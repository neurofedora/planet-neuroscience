Abstract: We report on an exact theory for ensembles of globally coupled, heterogeneous complex Riccati equations. A drastic dimensionality reduction to a few ordinary differential equations is achieved for Lorentzian heterogeneity. By applying this technique, we obtain low-dimensional firing-rate equations for populations of spiking neurons with a clustered substructure.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15538">There must be encapsulated nonconceptual content in vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I want to propose an argument to support Jerry Fodor's thesis (Fodor 1983) that input systems are modular and thus informationally encapsulated. The argument starts with the suggestion that there is a "grounding problem" in perception, i. e. that there is a problem in explaining how perception that can yield a visual experience is possible, how sensation can become meaningful perception of something for the subject. Given that visual experience is actually possible, this invites a transcendental argument that explains the conditions of its possibility. I propose that one of these conditions is the existence of a visual module in Fodor's sense that allows the step from sensation to object-identifying perception, thus enabling visual experience. It seems to follow that there is informationally encapsulated nonconceptual content in visual perception.

Abstract: High-resolution recordings of extracellular potentials are fundamental for the study of neuronal networks, the basis of neuronal coding and transmission. Here we present an innovative method for an in vivo electrical imaging of Local Field Potentials using novel implantable neural interfaces with a high-density array of 256 recording sites and a spatial resolution of 15 {\mu}m. Thanks to this technology, we analyze the propagation of whisker-evoked activity in a single barrel-column of the rat somatosensory cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16085">Allostatic Control of Persistent States in Spiking Neural Networks for perception and computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model for updating perceptual beliefs about the environment by extending the concept of Allostasis to the control of internal representations. Allostasis is a fundamental regulatory mechanism observed in animal physiology that orchestrates responses to maintain a dynamic equilibrium in bodily needs and internal states. In this paper, we focus on an application in numerical cognition, where a bump of activity in an attractor network is used as a spatial numerical representation. While existing neural networks can maintain persistent states, to date, there is no unified framework for dynamically controlling spatial changes in neuronal activity in response to environmental changes. To address this, we couple a well known allostatic microcircuit, the Hammel model, with a ring attractor, resulting in a Spiking Neural Network architecture that can modulate the location of the bump as a function of some reference input. This localized activity in turn is used as a perceptual belief in a simulated subitization task a quick enumeration process without counting. We provide a general procedure to fine-tune the model and demonstrate the successful control of the bump location. We also study the response time in the model with respect to changes in parameters and compare it with biological data. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of the network to understand the selectivity and specificity of different neurons to distinct categories present in the input. The results of this paper, particularly the mechanism for moving persistent states, are not limited to numerical cognition but can be applied to a wide range of tasks involving similar representations.

                arXiv:2503.15699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do two deep neural networks differ in how they arrive at a decision? Measuring the similarity of deep networks has been a long-standing open question. Most existing methods provide a single number to measure the similarity of two networks at a given layer, but give no insight into what makes them similar or dissimilar. We introduce an interpretable representational similarity method (RSVC) to compare two networks. We use RSVC to discover shared and unique visual concepts between two models. We show that some aspects of model differences can be attributed to unique concepts discovered by one model that are not well represented in the other. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluation across different vision model architectures and training protocols to demonstrate its effectiveness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18775">Resource-rational reinforcement learning and sensorimotor causal states, and resource-rational maximiners</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.18775v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new computational-level objective function for theoretical biology and theoretical neuroscience that combines: reinforcement learning, the study of learning with feedback via rewards; rate-distortion theory, a branch of information theory that deals with compressing signals to retain relevant information; and computational mechanics, the study of minimal sufficient statistics of prediction also known as causal states. We highlight why this proposal is likely only an approximation, but is likely to be an interesting one, and propose a new algorithm for evaluating it to obtain the newly-coined ``reward-rate manifold''. The performance of real and artificial agents in partially observable environments can be newly benchmarked using these reward-rate manifolds. Finally, we describe experiments that can probe whether or not biological organisms are resource-rational reinforcement learners, using as an example maximin strategies, as bacteria have been shown to be approximate maximiners -- doing their best in the worst-case environment, regardless of what is actually happening.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02424">Hierarchical feature extraction on functional brain networks for autism spectrum disorder identification with resting-state fMRI data</a></h4>

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder of the central nervous system, primarily manifesting in childhood. It is characterized by atypical and repetitive behaviors. Currently, diagnostic methods mainly rely on questionnaire surveys and behavioral observations, which are prone to misdiagnosis due to their subjective nature. With advancements in medical imaging, MR imaging-based diagnostics have emerged as a more objective alternative. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Neural Network model for ASD identification, termed ASD-HNet, which hierarchically extracts features from functional brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. This hierarchical approach enhances the extraction of brain representations, improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding in the identification of brain regions associated with ASD. Specifically, features are extracted at three levels: (1) the local region of interest (ROI) scale, (2) the community scale, and (3) the global representation scale. At the ROI scale, graph convolution is employed to transfer features between ROIs. At the community scale, functional gradients are introduced, and a K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to group ROIs with similar functional gradients into communities. Features from ROIs within the same community are then extracted to characterize the communities. At the global representation scale, we extract global features from the whole community-scale brain networks to represent the entire brain. We validate the effectiveness of our method using the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE-I) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ASD-HNet outperforms existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/LYQbyte/ASD-HNet.

                arXiv:2503.01761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The claustrum is a thin gray matter structure in each brain hemisphere, characterized by exceptionally high connectivity with nearly all brain regions. Despite extensive animal studies on its anatomy and function and growing evidence of claustral deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, its specific roles in normal and abnormal human brain function remain largely unknown. This is primarily due to its thin and complex morphology, which limits accurate anatomical delineation and neural activity isolation in conventional in vivo neuroimaging. To facilitate future neuroimaging studies, we developed a comprehensive and reliable manual segmentation protocol based on a cellular-resolution brain atlas and high-resolution (0.7^3 mm) MRI data. The protocols involve detailed guidelines to delineate the entire claustrum, including the inferior parts that have not been clearly described in earlier MRI studies. Additionally, we propose a geometric method to parcellate the claustrum into three subregions (the dorsal, ventral, and temporal claustrum) along the superior-to-inferior axis. The mean bilateral claustrum volume in 10 young adults was 3307.5 mm^3, approximately 0.21% of total intracranial volume. Our segmentation protocol demonstrated high inter- and intra-rater reliability (ICC > 0.89, DSC > 0.85), confirming its replicability. This comprehensive and reliable claustrum segmentation protocols will provide a cornerstone for future neuroimaging studies of systematic, large-scale investigations of the anatomy and the functions of the human claustrum in normal and pathological populations.

                arXiv:2503.15218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The world of beauty is deeply connected to the visual cortex, as perception often begins with vision in both humans and marmosets. Quantifying functional correspondences in the visual cortex across species can help us understand how information is processed in the primate visual cortex, while also providing deeper insights into human visual cortex functions through the study of marmosets. In this study, we measured pairwise and beyond pairwise correlation, redundancy, and synergy in movie-driven fMRI data across species. Our first key finding was that humans and marmosets exhibited significant overlaps in functional synergy. Second, we observed that the strongest functional correspondences between the human peri-entorhinal and entorhinal cortex (PeEc) and the occipitotemporal higher-level visual regions in the marmoset during movie watching reflected a functional synergistic relationship. These regions are known to correspond to face-selective areas in both species. Third, redundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core of shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic shift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased, reflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of information processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results reveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception, distinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual cortex.

Abstract: Animal sensorimotor behavior is frequently modeled using optimal controllers. However, it is unclear how the neural circuits within the animal's nervous system implement optimal controller-like behavior. In this work, we study the question of implementing a delayed linear quadratic regulator with linear dynamical "neurons" on a muscle model. We show that for any second-order controller, there are three minimal neural circuit configurations that implement the same controller. Furthermore, the firing rate characteristics of each circuit can vary drastically, even as the overall controller behavior is preserved. Along the way, we introduce concepts that bridge controller realizations to neural implementations that are compatible with known neuronal delay structures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20580">Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.

                arXiv:2503.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on Transformers have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance and high energy efficiency. However, the spiking attention modules of most existing Transformer-based SNNs are adapted from those of analog Transformers, failing to fully address the issue of over-allocating attention to irrelevant contexts. To fix this fundamental yet overlooked issue, we propose a Lateral Inhibition-inspired Spiking Transformer (SpiLiFormer). It emulates the brain's lateral inhibition mechanism, guiding the model to enhance attention to relevant tokens while suppressing attention to irrelevant ones. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10 (+0.45%), CIFAR-100 (+0.48%), CIFAR10-DVS (+2.70%), N-Caltech101 (+1.94%), and ImageNet-1K (+1.6%). Notably, on the ImageNet-1K dataset, SpiLiFormer (69.9M parameters, 4 time steps, 384 resolution) outperforms E-SpikeFormer (173.0M parameters, 8 time steps, 384 resolution), a SOTA spiking Transformer, by 0.46% using only 39% of the parameters and half the time steps. Our code and training checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

                arXiv:2503.15576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring with automatic recorders is essential for ecosystem conservation but generates vast unsupervised audio data, posing challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning techniques offer a promising solution. BirdNET, a widely used model for bird identification, has shown success in many study systems but is limited in some regions due to biases in its training data. A key challenge in bird species detection is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations. To overcome these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a region facing significant conservation threats. Our approach included a Bird Song Detector to isolate vocalizations and custom classifiers trained with BirdNET embeddings. We manually annotated 461 minutes of audio from three habitats across nine locations, yielding 3,749 annotations for 34 classes. Spectrograms facilitated the use of image processing techniques. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all classification models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of the Bird Song Detector and fine-tuned BirdNET compared to the baseline without the Bird Song Detector. Our approach demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with fine-tuned classification models for bird identification at local soundscapes. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools for specific ecological challenges, as demonstrated in Do\~nana. Automatically detecting bird species serves for tracking the health status of this threatened ecosystem, given the sensitivity of birds to environmental changes, and helps in the design of conservation measures for reducing biodiversity loss

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of optical astronomy, we must advance imaging technology to overcome conventional frame-based cameras' limited dynamic range and temporal resolution. Our Perspective paper examines how neuromorphic cameras can effectively address these challenges. Drawing inspiration from the human retina, neuromorphic cameras excel in speed and high dynamic range by utilizing asynchronous pixel operation and logarithmic photocurrent conversion, making them highly effective for celestial imaging. We use 1300 mm terrestrial telescope to demonstrate the neuromorphic camera's ability to simultaneously capture faint and bright celestial sources while preventing saturation effects. We illustrate its photometric capabilities through aperture photometry of a star field with faint stars. Detection of the faint gas cloud structure of the Trapezium cluster during a full moon night highlights the camera's high dynamic range, effectively mitigating static glare from lunar illumination. Our investigations also include detecting meteorite passing near the Moon and Earth, as well as imaging satellites and anthropogenic debris with exceptionally high temporal resolution using a 200mm telescope. Our observations show the immense potential of neuromorphic cameras in advancing astronomical optical imaging and pushing the boundaries of observational astronomy.

Abstract: This work introduces GazeSCRNN, a novel spiking convolutional recurrent neural network designed for event-based near-eye gaze tracking. Leveraging the high temporal resolution, energy efficiency, and compatibility of Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) cameras with event-based systems, GazeSCRNN uses a spiking neural network (SNN) to address the limitations of traditional gaze-tracking systems in capturing dynamic movements. The proposed model processes event streams from DVS cameras using Adaptive Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (ALIF) neurons and a hybrid architecture optimized for spatio-temporal data. Extensive evaluations on the EV-Eye dataset demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting gaze vectors. In addition, we conducted ablation studies to reveal the importance of the ALIF neurons, dynamic event framing, and training techniques, such as Forward-Propagation-Through-Time, in enhancing overall system performance. The most accurate model achieved a Mean Angle Error (MAE) of 6.034{\deg} and a Mean Pupil Error (MPE) of 2.094 mm. Consequently, this work is pioneering in demonstrating the feasibility of using SNNs for event-based gaze tracking, while shedding light on critical challenges and opportunities for further improvement.

                arXiv:2503.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robotics holds transformative potential for enabling adaptive and adaptable systems in dynamic environments. However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.

                arXiv:2404.18400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely large combinatorial hypothesis spaces. Current methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression techniques, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. They also employ limited representations such as expression trees, constraining the search space and expressiveness of equations. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its domain knowledge, which are then optimized against data to estimate parameters. We evaluate LLM-SR on four benchmark problems across diverse scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology), which we carefully designed to simulate the discovery process and prevent LLM recitation. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR discovers physically accurate equations that significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic regression baselines, particularly in out-of-domain test settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01033">Neural Networks Trained by Weight Permutation are Universal Approximators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.01033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal approximation property is fundamental to the success of neural networks, and has traditionally been achieved by training networks without any constraints on their parameters. However, recent experimental research proposed a novel permutation-based training method, which exhibited a desired classification performance without modifying the exact weight values. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of this permutation training method by proving its ability to guide a ReLU network to approximate one-dimensional continuous functions. Our numerical results further validate this method's efficiency in regression tasks with various initializations. The notable observations during weight permutation suggest that permutation training can provide an innovative tool for describing network learning behavior.

                arXiv:2501.07930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal convolutional layers are the workhorse of multiple areas in machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, normalizing flows, GANs, and Lipschitzconstrained models. Their ability to preserve norms and ensure stable gradient propagation makes them valuable for a large range of problems. Despite their promise, the deployment of orthogonal convolution in large-scale applications is a significant challenge due to computational overhead and limited support for modern features like strides, dilations, group convolutions, and transposed convolutions.In this paper, we introduce AOC (Adaptative Orthogonal Convolution), a scalable method for constructing orthogonal convolutions, effectively overcoming these limitations. This advancement unlocks the construction of architectures that were previously considered impractical. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method produces expressive models that become increasingly efficient as they scale. To foster further advancement, we provide an open-source library implementing this method, available at https://github.com/thib-s/orthogonium.

                Background Head and neck cancer (HNCs) is a major health issue worldwide, and India has contributed to approximately 2.4 lakh new cases in 2022. Definitive chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced disease but carries a risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) that add to morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and possible delay in treatment. The increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has also contributed to management burden. This study aimed to assess the microbiological profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiation. Methods Patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and who developed LRTIs were included in the study. Sputum and tracheostomy suction tip cultures were obtained and processed using standard microbiological techniques such as Gram staining, biochemical tests, and VITEK-2 automated systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and EUCAST recommendations. Clinical and treatment-related factors were documented and compared using SPSS version 23.0, with descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression models. Results Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen (35.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%). The pathogens were strongly resistant to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins but were susceptible to carbapenems and aminoglycosides in the majority of isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups and chemotherapy regimens (p<0.001). Conclusion LRTIs in patients with HNC treated with chemoradiation were mainly caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance patterns are crucial for directing empirical antibiotic therapy, minimizing treatment delays, and enhancing clinical outcomes.

                Background Soft-tissue sarcomas are an uncommon group of neoplasms that can be fatal, especially in metastatic settings. Thus, this study aimed to assess the demographic, pathological, clinical, and treatment patterns of soft tissue sarcoma at the Tikur Anbesa Specialized Hospital in Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with soft tissue sarcomas who visited the Tihur Anbesa Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia, between August 2017 and August 2021GC. A total of 190 samples were taken. Data from health management information system logbooks and medical records were collected, with only histopathology-confirmed cases included, while those with incomplete data were excluded. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 25, and ethical clearance was obtained from Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences. Results A total of 320 patients were registered between August 2017 and August 2021; 190 patients were available for this study, and 130 were lost. The median age was 32 years of age and male sex was commonly affected, accounting 61.6%, and female sex accounted 38.4%. The common sites were extremities, accounting for 48.9% of cases. The Commonest presenting symptoms were mass and pain, accounting for 93.2% and 77.9% of cases, respectively. The common histological subtypes were undifferentiated sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma, accounting 50%, 15.8%, and 6.3% cases, respectively. The grade of the lesions was described in 67.3% of patients. Of the lesions whose grade was described, 56.8% were high grade lesions. In all cases, 58.3% of the patients underwent surgery as the primary treatment modality. Only 50.5% of cases were started treatment with curative intent, and 49.5% of the patients started their treatment with palliative treatment. Conclusions The pattern of soft tissue sarcomas showed a heterogeneous distribution in terms of demography, clinical presentation, treatment, and pathological subtypes. The advanced stage of initial clinical presentation and substandard work-up and therapy make it unique from cases reported in other parts of the world.

                <p>Cutaneomuscular reflexes (CMRs) can be recorded in the hand muscle of human subjects after stimulation of a digital nerve. We hypothesized that repeated synchronous stimulation of nerves from two digits may lead to long-term plastic changes in CMR, by the mechanisms of spike-timing&ndash;dependent plasticity (STDP). To test this idea, we conducted experiments in 27 healthy human volunteers. After baseline measurement of CMR, one of four 30-min-long stimulation conditions were tested; the CMR was then remeasured. The four conditions were simultaneous index finger and thumb stimulation; asynchronous index finger and thumb stimulation; thumb 5&nbsp;ms before index finger stimulation; and thumb-only stimulation. Neither the early (E1) nor late excitatory (E2) components of the CMR showed consistent changes after any stimulation condition. The inhibitory (I1) component was slightly reduced in all cases. To understand why paired stimulation did not produce long-term changes, we conducted a further experiment. In this, we measured the CMR in response to simultaneous stimulation of index finger and thumb, compared with a prediction expected if the responses summed linearly. This revealed sublinear summation, possibly indicating partial response saturation after stimulation of only one digit. We argue such a pattern prevents paired stimuli from generating especially reliable and well-timed outputs relative to synaptic inputs in downstream neurons, which is required to produce plasticity by STDP.</p>

                <p>Beta event-related spectral perturbation, including bilateral movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD) and postmovement beta synchronization (PMBS), can be evoked by unilateral speed movement. A potential correlation might exist between power (de)synchronization and interhemispheric coherence during movement execution. However, during the PMBS phase, the existence of interhemispheric coupling and the effect of speed on it are largely undiscovered. To answer this question, we investigated eight healthy, right-handed volunteers using a combination of electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and electromyography. We explored interhemispheric (directed) coherence during isotonic right index finger abduction movements at two speeds: ballistic and self-paced. We discovered that (1) interhemispheric coherence was greater during the PMBS than during the MRBD period. Furthermore, ballistic movement induced a larger coherence during the PMBS period, but not during the MRBD period. (2) In the MRBD phase, directed coherence from the contralateral motor cortex (CM1) to the ipsilateral motor cortex (IM1) was larger, with a reverse tendency observed during the PMBS period. Additionally, in ballistic movement, directed coherence from IM1 to CM1 was stronger and positively correlated with coherence, with no effect of speed on directed coherence detected in the MRBD phase. To explore the causality of interhemispheric coherence during the PMBS period, we investigated the interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from IM1 to CM1 at different speeds. A stronger IHI from IM1 to CM1 at PMBS peak time was demonstrated, which was enhanced during ballistic movement. Additionally, IHI was negatively correlated with PMBS, and movement speed was positively associated with interhemispheric coupling during the PMBS period and IHI from IM1 to CM1.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012893">How immunity shapes the long-term dynamics of influenza H3N2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oliver Eales, Freya M. Shearer, James M. McCaw</p>

Since its emergence in 1968, influenza A H3N2 has caused yearly epidemics in temperate regions. While infection confers immunity against antigenically similar strains, new antigenically distinct strains that evade existing immunity regularly emerge (‘antigenic drift’). Immunity at the individual level is complex, depending on an individual's lifetime infection history. An individual's first infection with influenza typically elicits the greatest response with subsequent infections eliciting progressively reduced responses (‘antigenic seniority’). The combined effect of individual-level immune responses and antigenic drift on the epidemiological dynamics of influenza are not well understood. Here we develop an integrated modelling framework of influenza transmission, immunity, and antigenic drift to show how individual-level exposure, and the build-up of population level immunity, shape the long-term epidemiological dynamics of H3N2. Including antigenic seniority in the model, we observe that following an initial decline after the pandemic year, the average annual attack rate increases over the next 80 years, before reaching an equilibrium, with greater increases in older age-groups. Our analyses suggest that the average attack rate of H3N2 is still in a growth phase. Further increases, particularly in the elderly, may be expected in coming decades, driving an increase in healthcare demand due to H3N2 infections.

                <p>by Simón Poblete, Mikolaj Mlynarczyk, Marta Szachniuk</p>

RNA 3D structure prediction often encounters entanglements, computational artifacts that complicate structural models, resulting in their exclusion from further studies despite the potentially accurate prediction of regions outside the entanglement. This study presents a protocol aimed at resolving such issues in RNA models while preserving the overall 3D fold and structural integrity. By employing the SPQR coarse-grained model and short Molecular Dynamics simulations, the protocol imposes energy terms that enable selective modifications to disentangle structures without causing significant distortions. The method was validated on 195 entangled RNA models from CASP15 and RNA-Puzzles, successfully resolving over 70% of interlaces and approximately 40% of lassos, with minimal impact on the original geometry but notable improvement in ClashScore. The efficiency of untangling conformations that are unequivocally classified as artifacts is 81%. Certain cases, particularly those involving dense packing of atoms or complex secondary structures, posed challenges that limited the efficiency of the method. In this paper, we present quantitative results from the application of the protocol and discuss examples of both successfully disentangled and unresolved structures. We show a viable approach for refining models previously deemed unsuitable due to topological artifacts.

                <p>by Anna Posfai, Juannan Zhou, David M. McCandlish, Justin B. Kinney</p>

Quantitative models of sequence-function relationships are ubiquitous in computational biology, e.g., for modeling the DNA binding of transcription factors or the fitness landscapes of proteins. Interpreting these models, however, is complicated by the fact that the values of model parameters can often be changed without affecting model predictions. Before the values of model parameters can be meaningfully interpreted, one must remove these degrees of freedom (called “gauge freedoms” in physics) by imposing additional constraints (a process called “fixing the gauge”). However, strategies for fixing the gauge of sequence-function relationships have received little attention. Here we derive an analytically tractable family of gauges for a large class of sequence-function relationships. These gauges are derived in the context of models with all-order interactions, but an important subset of these gauges can be applied to diverse types of models, including additive models, pairwise-interaction models, and models with higher-order interactions. Many commonly used gauges are special cases of gauges within this family. We demonstrate the utility of this family of gauges by showing how different choices of gauge can be used both to explore complex activity landscapes and to reveal simplified models that are approximately correct within localized regions of sequence space. The results provide practical gauge-fixing strategies and demonstrate the utility of gauge-fixing for model exploration and interpretation.

                <p>by Sheng Huang, Chengji Piao, Zhiying Zhao, Christine B. Beuschel, Oriane Turrel, David Toppe, Stephan J. Sigrist</p>

Sleep is crucial for cognitive functions and life span across species. While sleep homeostasis and cognitive processes are linked through cellular and synaptic plasticity, the signaling pathways connecting them remain unclear. Here, we show that <i>Drosophila insomniac</i> (<i>inc</i>) short sleep mutants, which lack an adaptor protein for the autism-associated Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase, exhibited enhanced Pavlovian aversive olfactory learning and memory, unlike other sleep mutants with normal or reduced memory. Through a genetic modifier screen, we found that a mild reduction of Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling specifically rescued the sleep and longevity phenotypes of <i>inc</i> mutants. However, this reduction further increased their excessive memory and mushroom body overgrowth. Since <i>inc</i> mutants displayed higher PKA signaling, we propose that <i>inc</i> loss-of-function suppresses sleep via increased PKA activity, which also constrains the excessive memory of <i>inc</i> mutants. Our data identify a signaling cascade for balancing sleep and memory functions, and provide a plausible explanation for the sleep phenotypes of <i>inc</i> mutants, suggesting that memory hyperfunction can provoke sleep deficits.

                <p>by Rory L. Cooper, Michel C. Milinkovitch</p>

The morphological intricacies of avian feathers make them an ideal model for investigating embryonic patterning and morphogenesis. In particular, the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is an important mediator of feather outgrowth and branching. However, functional in vivo evidence regarding its role during feather development remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that an intravenous injection of sonidegib, a potent Shh pathway inhibitor, at embryonic day 9 (E9) temporarily produces striped domains (instead of spots) of <i>Shh</i> expression in the skin, arrests morphogenesis, and results in unbranched and non-invaginated feather buds—akin to proto-feathers—in embryos until E14. Although feather morphogenesis partially recovers, hatched treated chickens exhibit naked skin regions with perturbed follicles. Remarkably, these follicles are subsequently reactivated by seven weeks post-hatching. Our RNA-sequencing data and rescue experiment using Shh-agonism confirm that sonidegib specifically down-regulates Shh pathway activity. Overall, we provide functional evidence for the role of the Shh pathway in mediating feather morphogenesis and confirm its role in the evolutionary emergence and diversification of feathers.

                Background The Japanese central government’s human resource system is a “closed career-based system,” meaning that some ministries/agencies appoint government officials with PhDs in the field of Natural Science to positions responsible for policymaking and comprehensive coordination, similar to administrative officials who are executive candidates, rather than the positions requiring scientific and specialized knowledge. This study aims to clarify the characteristics of PhD-holding government officials, involved in the policymaking process, who possess expertise based on their doctoral degree in the field of Natural Sciences, yet are placed within the same personnel system as administrative officials. The study also aims to provide insights for future personnel systems. Methods A questionnaire survey was distributed among government officials responsible for science and technology policy. The questionnaire focused on tasks such as overall coordination, policymaking, and other general administrative duties. The analysis utilized descriptive statistics based on the perception data collected through the survey, and hypotheses derived from prior studies on administrative expertise were tested through statistical analysis using ordinary least squares (OLS). Result The results of the questionnaire survey revealed no significant differences between PhD-holding officials and others in terms of their perceptions of coordination tasks or the importance of evidence; however, regarding policymaking, PhD-holding officials showed a notable tendency to find greater fulfillment in formulating new policies. The OLS analysis, with the number of new policy proposals as the dependent variable, showed that the presence of a doctoral degree was found to have a significant impact. Conclusions This study suggests that PhD-holding officials utilize their specialized literacy when proposing new policies. The findings imply that leveraging doctoral-holding personnel with not only expertise in scientific knowledge but also specialized literacy and general skills in public institutions could lead to the creation of new innovations.

                Background This study addresses the challenge of stabilizing rice retail prices in Indonesia, a critical staple food across many Asian countries. The government prioritizes price stability to prevent sharp increases that could lead to social unrest due to rice shortages. Approaches to price control are categorized as direct or indirect. Direct controls involve immediate interventions, such as increasing rice stocks through imports to rapidly influence market prices. Indirect controls comprises longer-term measures, like enhancing domestic production capacity to achieve gradual price stability. This study proposes optimization model to determine the optimal volume of rice imports required to minimize bimonthly changes in rice retail prices. Methods A linear programming model is formulated to minimize bimonthly price changes, subject to constraints including local production capacity, import limits, rice flow balance, and demand fulfillment. The monthly retail price is modeled using a compound linear regression approach with ten explanatory variables: rice production, the rupiah-dollar exchange rate, GDP per capita, agricultural land area, harvested dry rice price per kilogram, ground dry rice price per kilogram, domestic rice procurement, rice imports, rice stocks, and monthly rice distribution. The explanatory variable is forecasted using methods best suited to its historical pattern. Results The model was tested using data from 2020 to 2023. The results indicate that bimonthly rice prices increases can be effectively controlled, with maximum inflation rates maintained between 0.42% and 0.53% and a standard deviation ranging from 0.39% to 0.53%. These values are significantly lower than the anticipated inflation rate of 2–3%. Conclusions The optimization model effectively determines the required volume of rice imports to minimize bimonthly retail price fluctuations. By regulating import volumes, excessive price increases can be prevented. Enhanced data-driven forecasting with granular historical data may further improve the accuracy of retail rice price predictions and strengthen price stabilization initiatives.

<p>In the telencephalon, apical specializations such as cilia, primary cilia, and microvilli with varying morphologies were observed. Goblet-like cells, arranged in a single row along the ventricular wall, contained secretory vesicles in their apical regions. Light microscopy demonstrated that these secretory vesicles had a carbohydrate-rich structure, as confirmed by positive alcian blue staining. Ultrastructural analysis revealed detailed cellular features within the ventricular wall. After metamorphosis, changes in the chromatin structure of the cell nucleus and alterations in the myelin sheath structure were observed.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability of certain tetrapods, such as amphibians, to regenerate complex structures, such as organs or limbs, is well-established, though this capacity varies significantly across species, with humans exhibiting limited regenerative potential. Ependymoglia cells in the ventricular region of the brain are known to exhibit proliferative properties during homeostasis and damage and to perform stem cell functions. This study investigated changes occurring in neurons and glia in the central nervous system following metamorphosis in axolotls. Morphological alterations in brain tissue, newly formed neurons, and cellular organizations in different brain regions were assessed using stereological and immunohistochemical methods, as well as light and electron microscopy. Interestingly, we observe no statistically significant difference in total neuron numbers in the telencephalon region between neotenic and metamorphic axolotls. However, the proliferation index and the numbers of cells expressing NeuN were significantly higher in metamorphic axolotls. Furthermore, structural changes in neuronal nuclei and myelin sheath organization were determined at the light and electron microscopic levels post-metamorphosis. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a change in chromatin organization from euchromatic to heterochromatic in neurons after metamorphosis, and morphological changes were also demonstrated in myelinated nerve fibers in the telencephalon. Additionally, mucopolysaccharide-containing secretory sacs were also identified on the apical surfaces of a subgroup of ependymoglia cells located in the lateral ventricle wall. Overall, this study sheds useful light on the intricate changes occurring in the central nervous system during metamorphosis in axolotls and provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying these processes.</p>

                Tian et al. show that DSCC1 is elevated during S/G2 phase and recruited at the DSBs to facilitate HR repair through ATR-mediated phosphorylation. DSCC1 binds to 53BP1 and prevents 53BP1-dependent recruitment of RIF1, thereby promoting DNA end resection. DSCC1 is a promising therapeutic target to improve the efficiency of PARPis.

                Dai et al. demonstrate that upregulated Slit1 from neurons is required for white matter integrity in neonatal hypoxic mice. They find that secreted Slit1 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation via activating Robo2-srGAP1-RhoA signaling axis in oligodendrocyte and hypoxia-induced hypomyelination can be rescued by RhoA inhibitor.

Tumors growing within the brain or elsewhere in the body connect with neuronal networks in circuit-specific manners, via neuron-to-cancer synaptic interactions and paracrine crosstalk. Moreover, neural factors govern critical components of the tumor environment, such as the immune system, and cancer can use neural mechanisms in a malignant cell-intrinsic manner. Here we provide a personal view on the burgeoning field of cancer neuroscience and highlight the need to approach cancer research from a neuroscience perspective — together with neuroscientists.

                <p>Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 20 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00916-3">doi:10.1038/s41583-025-00916-3</a></p>Identifying the psychological and neurobiological processes underpinning intra-individual variations in choice behaviour presents a formidable challenge. In this Review, Duffy et al. discuss how algorithmic models for teasing apart such sources of variability and advances in behavioural paradigm design and neurally grounded computational modelling are providing new avenues for systematic progress.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93171">Mesoscale functional organization and connectivity of color, disparity, and naturalistic texture in human second visual area</a></h4>

              
                Although parallel processing has been extensively studied in the low-level geniculostriate pathway and the high-level dorsal and ventral visual streams, less is known at the intermediate-level visual areas. In this study, we employed high-resolution fMRI at 7T to investigate the columnar and laminar organizations for color, disparity, and naturalistic texture in the human secondary visual cortex (V2), and their informational connectivity with lower- and higher-order visual areas. Although fMRI activations in V2 showed reproducible interdigitated color-selective thin and disparity-selective thick ‘stripe’ columns, we found no clear evidence of columnar organization for naturalistic textures. Cortical depth-dependent analyses revealed the strongest color-selectivity in the superficial layers of V2, along with both feedforward and feedback informational connectivity with V1 and V4. Disparity selectivity was similar across different cortical depths of V2, which showed significant feedforward and feedback connectivity with V1 and V3ab. Interestingly, the selectivity for naturalistic texture was strongest in the deep layers of V2, with significant feedback connectivity from V4. Thus, while local circuitry within cortical columns is crucial for processing color and disparity information, feedback signals from V4 are involved in generating the selectivity for naturalistic textures in area V2.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94169">Novel mechanism for tubular injury in nephropathic cystinosis</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the unique susceptibility of the human kidney to pH dysfunction and injury in cystinosis is paramount to developing new therapies to preserve renal function. Renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) and fibroblasts isolated from patients with cystinosis were transcriptionally profiled. Lysosomal fractionation, immunoblotting, confocal microscopy, intracellular pH, TEM, and mitochondrial stress test were performed for validation. CRISPR, <i>CTNS</i> <sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs were generated. Alterations in cell stress, pH, autophagic turnover, and mitochondrial energetics highlighted key changes in the V-ATPases in patient-derived and <i>CTNS</i><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs. ATP6V0A1 was significantly downregulated in cystinosis and highly co-regulated with loss of <i>CTNS</i>. Correction of ATP6V0A1 rescued cell stress and mitochondrial function. Treatment of <i>CTNS</i> <sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs with antioxidants ATX induced ATP6V0A1 expression and improved autophagosome turnover and mitochondrial integrity. Our exploratory transcriptional and in vitro cellular and functional studies confirm that loss of Cystinosin in RPTECs, results in a reduction in ATP6V0A1 expression, with changes in intracellular pH, mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial function, and autophagosome-lysosome clearance. The novel findings are ATP6V0A1’s role in cystinosis-associated renal pathology and among other antioxidants, ATX specifically upregulated ATP6V0A1, improved autophagosome turnover or reduced autophagy and mitochondrial integrity. This is a pilot study highlighting a novel mechanism of tubular injury in cystinosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101350">Tissue inflammation induced by constitutively active STING is mediated by enhanced TNF signaling</a></h4>

              
                Constitutive activation of STING by gain-of-function mutations triggers manifestation of the systemic autoinflammatory disease STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). In order to investigate the role of signaling by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in SAVI, we used genetic inactivation of TNF receptors 1 and 2 in murine SAVI, which is characterized by T cell lymphopenia, inflammatory lung disease and neurodegeneration. Genetic inactivation of TNFR1 and TNFR2, however, rescued the loss of thymocytes, reduced interstitial lung disease and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, genetic inactivation of TNFR1 and TNFR2 blunted transcription of cytokines, chemokines and adhesions proteins, which result from chronic STING activation in SAVI mice. In addition, increased transendothelial migration of neutrophils was ameliorated. Taken together, our results demonstrate a pivotal role of TNFR-signaling in the pathogenesis of SAVI in mice and suggest that available TNFR antagonists could ameliorate SAVI in patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100041">Genetic diversity affects ecosystem functions across trophic levels as much as species diversity, but in an opposite direction</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning stands as a cornerstone in ecological research. Extensive evidence now underscores the profound impact of species loss on the stability and dynamics of ecosystem functions. However, it remains unclear whether the loss of genetic diversity within key species yields similar consequences. Here, we delve into the intricate relationship between species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem functions across three trophic levels – primary producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers – in natural aquatic ecosystems. Our investigation involves estimating species diversity and genome-wide diversity – gauged within three pivotal species – within each trophic level, evaluating seven key ecosystem functions, and analyzing the magnitude of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions (BEFs). We found that, overall, the absolute effect size of genetic diversity on ecosystem functions mirrors that of species diversity in natural ecosystems. We nonetheless unveil a striking dichotomy: while genetic diversity was positively correlated with various ecosystem functions, species diversity displays a negative correlation with these functions. These intriguing antagonist effects of species and genetic diversity persist across the three trophic levels (underscoring its systemic nature), but were apparent only when BEFs were assessed within trophic levels rather than across them. This study reveals the complexity of predicting the consequences of genetic and species diversity loss under natural conditions, and emphasizes the need for further mechanistic models integrating these two facets of biodiversity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100796">Single-cell RNA sequencing of the holothurian regenerating intestine reveals the pluripotency of the coelomic epithelium</a></h4>

              
                In holothurians, the regenerative process following evisceration involves the development of a ‘rudiment’ or ‘anlage’ at the injured end of the mesentery. This regenerating anlage plays a pivotal role in the formation of a new intestine. Despite its significance, our understanding of the molecular characteristics inherent to the constituent cells of this structure has remained limited. To address this gap, we employed state-of-the-art scRNA-seq and hybridization chain reaction fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses to discern the distinct cellular populations associated with the regeneration anlage. Through this approach, we successfully identified 13 distinct cell clusters. Among these, two clusters exhibit characteristics consistent with putative mesenchymal cells, while another four show features akin to coelomocyte cell populations. The remaining seven cell clusters collectively form a large group encompassing the coelomic epithelium of the regenerating anlage and mesentery. Within this large group of clusters, we recognized previously documented cell populations such as muscle precursors, neuroepithelial cells, and actively proliferating cells. Strikingly, our analysis provides data for identifying at least four other cellular populations that we define as the precursor cells of the growing anlage. Consequently, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that the coelomic epithelium of the anlage is a pluripotent tissue that gives rise to diverse cell types of the regenerating intestinal organ. Moreover, our results provide the initial view into the transcriptomic analysis of cell populations responsible for the amazing regenerative capabilities of echinoderms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96850">The domesticated transposon protein L1TD1 associates with its ancestor L1 ORF1p to promote LINE-1 retrotransposition</a></h4>

              
                Repression of retrotransposition is crucial for the successful fitness of a mammalian organism. The domesticated transposon protein L1TD1, derived from LINE-1 (L1) ORF1p, is an RNA-binding protein that is expressed only in some cancers and early embryogenesis. In human embryonic stem cells, it is found to be essential for maintaining pluripotency. In cancer, L1TD1 expression is highly correlative with malignancy progression and as such considered a potential prognostic factor for tumors. However, its molecular role in cancer remains largely unknown. Our findings reveal that DNA hypomethylation induces the expression of L1TD1 in HAP1 human tumor cells. L1TD1 depletion significantly modulates both the proteome and transcriptome and thereby reduces cell viability. Notably, L1TD1 associates with L1 transcripts and interacts with L1 ORF1p protein, thereby facilitating L1 retrotransposition. Our data suggest that L1TD1 collaborates with its ancestral L1 ORF1p as an RNA chaperone, ensuring the efficient retrotransposition of L1 retrotransposons, rather than directly impacting the abundance of L1TD1 targets. In this way, L1TD1 might have an important role not only during early development but also in tumorigenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97658">Two long-axis dimensions of hippocampal-cortical integration support memory function across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a complex structure critically involved in numerous behavior-regulating systems. In young adults, multiple overlapping spatial modes along its longitudinal and transverse axes describe the organization of its functional integration with neocortex, extending the traditional framework emphasizing functional differences between sharply segregated hippocampal subregions. Yet, it remains unknown whether these modes (i.e. gradients) persist across the adult human lifespan, and relate to memory and molecular markers associated with brain function and cognition. In two independent samples, we demonstrate that the principal anteroposterior and second-order, mid-to-anterior/posterior hippocampal modes of neocortical functional connectivity, representing distinct dimensions of macroscale cortical organization, manifest across the adult lifespan. Specifically, individual differences in topography of the second-order gradient predicted episodic memory and mirrored dopamine D1 receptor distribution, capturing shared functional and molecular organization. Older age was associated with less distinct transitions along gradients (i.e. increased functional homogeneity). Importantly, a youth-like gradient profile predicted preserved episodic memory – emphasizing age-related gradient dedifferentiation as a marker of cognitive decline. Our results underscore a critical role of mapping multidimensional hippocampal organization in understanding the neural circuits that support memory across the adult lifespan.

">All-optical electrophysiology reveals behavior-dependent dynamics of excitation and inhibition in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neuronal integration is modulated by behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. We combined voltage imaging with optogenetic depolarization to reveal how changes in excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) inputs, modulate the spiking output, subthreshold dynamics, and gain of key genetically defined cell types in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. We imaged pyramidal cells (PCs), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons (INs) and found that locomotion reduced firing in PCs and VIP INs while increasing activity in SST and PV cells. Prolonged optical depolarization experiments and simulations revealed that intracellular theta oscillations are predominantly driven by inhibitory inputs in PCs and VIP cells. Firing rate-laser intensity (F-I) curves revealed distinct gain modulation across cell types, with a divisive gain reduction in PC bursting during locomotion, while simple spikes are unaffected. A two-compartment model suggested that this results from a balanced E/I input increase to somatic and dendritic compartments. These findings reveal how behavioral state-dependent coordination of excitation and inhibition governs hippocampal neuronal dynamics and output-specific gain modulation.

">Theta activity supports landmark-based correction of naturalistic human path integration</a></h4>

              
                How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation task? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration. Our findings reveal that a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated homing errors. However, this effect was transient and less optimal when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. At the neural level, RSC theta-band activity supported these recalibration processes. When fine adjustments of the spatial representation were sufficient, landmark presentation elicited stronger theta-band activity and greater phase resetting compared to when substantial spatial updating was necessary. Our results also revealed motor-related theta activity that scaled with acceleration during rotational corrections, highlighting the dual role of theta in the flexible integration of multimodal signals, involved in both landmark-based spatial updating and self-motion encoding.

">Hierarchical Processing of Natural Scenes in the Human Pulvinar</a></h4>

              
                The hierarchical organization of the ventral visual cortex has been the focus of theories and computational models characterizing high-level visual processing and object recognition, often overlooking potential contributions of subcortical structures. The pulvinar, through its extensive reciprocal connections with ventral visual cortex, is well-positioned to play a prominent role in high-level visual recognition processes. Here, we investigated whether the pulvinar plays such a role using a high-resolution 7T fMRI dataset of responses to tens of thousands of natural scenes. Encoding models testing the representation of different stimulus features revealed a pulvinar region selective for bodies and faces presented within the contralateral visual hemifield. Model-free analyses demonstrated that this region is predominantly co-active with body- and face-selective cortical areas during natural scene viewing. This functional specificity was embedded within a broader gradient of cortical correlations across the pulvinar mirroring the hierarchical organization of ventral visual cortex. These findings challenge cortico-centric models of object vision and implicate a role of the pulvinar in high-level vision. More broadly, these results demonstrate that principles of cortical organization, including functional clustering and hierarchical organization, also manifest in subcortex, and highlight the value of using naturalistic stimuli to probe visual function.

">Social stress, cortisol awakening response and sex: Impact on hippocampus and amygdala volume</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala, both major hubs for neural stress regulation amongst others, are influenced by social stressors, cortisol awakening response (CAR) and sex, i.e. psychological and physiological stress factors. Importantly, the interplay of these different factors in affecting the morphology of both brain regions remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the intricate influence of these factors on grey matter volumes (GMV) of the hippocampus and amygdala. Methods: We analyzed associations between structural brain data, self-reported chronic social stress (including subscales on social tension, social overload, lack of social recognition and social isolation) and CAR of 83 healthy participants (40 females) with multiple regression analyses. Results: In males, but not females, higher social tension predicted lower bilateral hippocampus GMV. In individuals not showing the typical CAR, higher social tension predicted reduced bilateral hippocampus GMV. Amygdala GMV was also related to social stress and CAR, with social overload associated with reduced amygdala GMV in individuals not showing the typical CAR, while the opposite pattern emerged in those with an atypical CAR. Conclusions: Chronic social stress is associated with hippocampus and amygdala volumes, interacting with CAR and sex. The brain morphology in males and in individuals with atypical CAR seems to be more vulnerable to chronic social stress. Our findings enhance our understanding of how brain architecture, social stress, CAR patterns and sex shape individual stress responses.

">Predator odor stress produces sex- and subpopulation-specific increases in alcohol drinking, anxiety-like behavior, and lateral hypothalamic crh expression</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic stress leads to maladaptive avoidance behaviors and alcohol misuse in some people. In rats, predator odor (traumatic) stress produces persistent avoidance of stress-paired contexts and escalated alcohol self-administration in some animals (Avoiders), but not others (Non-Avoiders). This mirrors the individual differences in stress responsivity and alcohol misuse seen in humans. Here, we used a quinine-adulterated alcohol drinking procedure to model compulsive-like alcohol drinking in humans. Male and female Wistar rats were given 12 weeks of intermittent access to 20% (v/v) alcohol, followed by three weeks of limited access. Rats were then indexed for avoidance using predator odor stress exposure, and limited access drinking resumed for three additional weeks after stress. During this period, the alcohol solution was adulterated twice weekly with increasing concentrations of quinine. More Avoidant males were more resistant to quinine adulteration and Avoider males increased in non-quinine alcohol drinking. Using ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as a measure of affective state, we found that Non-Avoider males emitted more lower frequency USVs (<32 kHz) preceding, during, and following predator odor stress. Finally, quantification of crh, crhr1, crhr2, crhbp gene expression in the lateral hypothalamus revealed a strong positive correlation between greater crh transcripts and avoidance in males and a positive correlation between crh transcripts and less anxiety-like behaviors in females. Together, these results suggest that the intersection of stress and compulsive-like alcohol drinking is sex-specific and dependent on individual differences in stress outcomes. This work reinforces the importance of considering sex differences in stress and alcohol use disorder research.

">Benchmarking overlapping community detection methods for applications in human connectomics</a></h4>

              
                Brain networks exhibit non-trivial modular organization, with groups of densely connected areas participating in specialized functions. Traditional community detection algorithms assign each node to one module, but this representation cannot capture integrative, multi-functional nodes that span multiple communities. Despite the increasing availability of overlapping community detection algorithms (OCDAs) to capture such integrative nodes, there is no objective procedure for selecting the most appropriate method and its parameters for a given problem. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing a data-driven method for selecting an OCDA and its parameters from performance on a tailored ensemble of generated benchmark networks, assessing 22 unique algorithms and parameter settings. Applied to the human structural connectome, we find that the `Order Statistics Local Optimization Method' (OSLOM) best identifies ground-truth overlapping structure in the benchmark ensemble and yields a seven-network decomposition of the human cortex. These modules are bridged by fifteen overlapping regions that generally sit at the apex of the putative cortical hierarchy---suggesting integrative, higher-order function---with network participation increasing along the cortical hierarchy, a finding not supported using a non-overlapping modular decomposition. This data-driven approach to selecting OCDAs is applicable across domains, opening new avenues to detecting and quantifying informative structures in complex real-world networks.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease (AD), yet the mechanistic link remains unclear. Here, we integrated human patient-derived transcriptomics with a 3D in vitro brain injury model to dissect cell-specific mitochondrial dysfunction as a driver of neurodegeneration. Comparative transcriptomic analysis at 6 and 48 hours post-injury revealed conserved mitochondrial impairments across excitatory neurons, interneurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Using a one-of-a-kind cell-specific mitochondria tracking system, we demonstrate prolonged neuronal mitochondrial fragmentation, bioenergetic failure, and metabolic instability, coinciding with the emergence of AD markers, including pTau, APP, and Abeta 42/40 dysregulation. Glial mitochondria exhibited delayed but distinct metabolic dysfunctions, with astrocytes failing to maintain metabolic support and microglia sustaining chronic inflammation. These findings establish neuronal mitochondrial failure as an early trigger of injury-induced neurodegeneration, reinforcing mitochondrial dysfunction as a therapeutic target for preventing TBI-driven AD pathology.

">Two Axes of White Matter Development</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of neuroimaging research, how white matter develops along the length of major tracts in humans remains unknown. Here, we identify fundamental patterns of white matter maturation by examining developmental variation along major, long-range cortico-cortical tracts in youth ages 5-23 years using diffusion MRI from three large-scale, cross-sectional datasets (total N = 2,710). Across datasets, we delineate two replicable axes of human white matter development. First, we find a deep-to-superficial axis, in which superficial tract regions near the cortical surface exhibit greater age-related change than deep tract regions. Second, we demonstrate that the development of superficial tract regions aligns with the cortical hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-association axis, with tract ends adjacent to sensorimotor cortices maturing earlier than those adjacent to association cortices. These results reveal developmental variation along tracts that conventional tract-average analyses have previously obscured, challenging the implicit assumption that white matter tracts mature uniformly along their length. Such developmental variation along tracts may have functional implications, including mitigating ephaptic coupling in densely packed deep tract regions and tuning neural synchrony through hierarchical development in superficial tract regions - ultimately refining neural transmission in youth.

">Oxytocin Receptor Expression and Activation in Parasympathetic Brainstem Cardiac Vagal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Autonomic imbalance, particularly reduced activity from brainstem parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs) is a major characteristic of many cardiorespiratory diseases. Therapeutic approaches to selectively increase CVN activity have been limited by lack of identified selective translational targets. Recent work has shown that there is an important excitatory synaptic pathway from oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to brainstem CVNs, and that OXT could provide a key selective excitation of CVNs. In clinical studies, intranasal OXT increases parasympathetic cardiac activity, autonomic balance, and reduces obstructive event durations and oxygen desaturations in obstructive sleep apnea patients. However, the mechanisms by which activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons, or intranasal OXT, increases brainstem parasympathetic cardiac activity is poorly understood. CVNs are located in two cholinergic brainstem nuclei: the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX). In this study we characterize the co-localization of OXT receptors in CVNs (OXTR), as well as non-CVN cholinergic neurons, located in the NA and DMNX nuclei. Selective chemogenetic excitation of OXTR+ CVNs was performed by expressing DREADDs with a combination of Cre and flp dependent viruses. We found that OXT receptors are highly expressed in CVNs in the DMNX and OXT increases DMNX CVN activity, but the receptors and responses are absent in CVNs in the NA. Selective chemogenetic activation of OXTR+ CVNs in the DMNX evoked a rapid and sustained bradycardia.

">Normative high-frequency oscillation phase-amplitude coupling and effective connectivity under sevoflurane</a></h4>

              
                Resective surgery for pediatric drug-resistant focal epilepsy often requires extraoperative intracranial electroencephalography recording to accurately localize the epileptogenic zone. This procedure entails multiple neurosurgeries, intracranial electrode implantation and explantation, and days of invasive inpatient evaluation. There is a need for methods to reduce diagnostic burden and introduce objective epilepsy biomarkers. Our preliminary studies aimed to address these issues by using sevoflurane anesthesia to rapidly and reversibly activate intraoperative phase-amplitude coupling between delta and high-frequency activities, as well as high-frequency activity-based effective connectivity. Phase-amplitude coupling can serve as a proxy for spike-and-wave discharges, and effective connectivity describes the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural information flow among regions. Notably, sevoflurane activated these interictal electrocorticography biomarkers most robustly in areas whose resection led to seizure freedom. However, they were also increased in normative brain regions that did not require removal for seizure control. Before using these electrocorticography biomarkers prospectively to guide resection, we should understand their endogenous distribution and propagation pathways, at different anesthetic stages. In the current study, we highlighted the normative distribution of delta and high-frequency activity phase-amplitude coupling and effective connectivity under sevoflurane. Normative data was derived from nineteen patients, whose ages ranged from four to eighteen years and included eleven males. All achieved seizure control following focal resection. Electrocorticography was recorded at an isoflurane baseline, during stepwise increases in sevoflurane concentration, and also during extraoperative slow-wave sleep without anesthesia. Normative electrode sites were then mapped onto a standard cortical surface for anatomical visualization. Dynamic tractography traced white matter pathways that connected sites with significantly augmented biomarkers. Finally, we analyzed all sites -regardless of normal or abnormal status - to determine whether sevoflurane-enhanced biomarker values could intraoperatively localize the epileptogenic sites. We found that normative electrocorticography biomarkers increased as a function of sevoflurane concentration, especially in bilateral frontal and parietal lobe regions (Bonferroni-corrected p-values <0.05). Callosal fibers directly connected homotopic Rolandic regions exhibiting elevated phase-amplitude coupling. The superior longitudinal fasciculus linked frontal and parietal association cortices showing augmented effective connectivity. Higher biomarker values, particularly at three to four volume percent sevoflurane, characterized epileptogenicity and seizure-onset zone status (Bonferroni-corrected p-values <0.05). Supplementary analysis showed that epileptogenic sites exhibited less augmentation in delta-based effective connectivity. This study helps clarify the normative distribution of, and plausible propagation pathways supporting, sevoflurane enhanced electrocorticographic biomarkers. Future work should confirm that sevoflurane-activated electrocorticography biomarkers can predict postoperative seizure outcomes in larger cohorts, to establish their clinical utility.

">Serial dependence during visuomotor integration is robust to the passage of time and interference from intervening tasks</a></h4>

              
                When intercepting a moving target, responses are systematically biased toward the time of impact from the previous trial. This phenomenon, known as serial dependence, relies on a memory mechanism that remains poorly understood. In interceptive tasks, multiple stimulus features - such as speed, time, or motor responses - can guide behavior on the current trial and may be stored to influence subsequent trials. Here, we examined how memory decays over short inter-trial intervals (Experiment 1, N = 23) and whether interleaved tasks influence serial dependence (Experiment 2, N = 28). Participants performed either a temporal reproduction task or a speed judgment task, designed to compete for temporal and speed-processing resources, respectively. Our findings reveal that serial dependence persists across all inter-trial durations and remains unaffected by intervening tasks. While serial dependence was neither reduced nor eliminated, variations in responses were partially influenced by prior temporal reproductions from the interfering task. These results suggest that serial dependence in visuomotor tasks is robust to both the passage of time and external interference, though task responses may be subtly modulated by preceding temporal reproductions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Alexithymia is a subclinical condition that affects individuals’ processing of emotions. Emerging evidence suggests that alexithymia results from a multidomain and multidimensional interoceptive failure. Although extensive research has examined the relationship between alexithymia and interoception, less is known about how alexithymia modulates the brain activity evoked by interoceptive sensations. In this study, we used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess intersubject correlations in response to interoceptive sensation words in individuals with high alexithymia and low alexithymia. Participants with high alexithymia (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 29) and low alexithymia (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 28) were instructed to view words during MRI scanning, each word corresponding to a specific emotional category related to interoceptive sensations. Intersubject correlation analysis identified several brain regions exhibiting increased synchronization in individuals with high alexithymia, including those involved in cognitive control. Follow-up analyses revealed that the left middle occipital gyrus and the right inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part) were more active during interoceptive sensation events in individuals with high alexithymia. Validation analyses revealed that the amygdala and insula are also crucial in representing interoceptive sensations. These findings shed light on the neural basis of interoceptive deficits in high alexithymia and have significant implications for the mechanisms regulating these differences.</span>

                <p>Early psychosis (EP) is a critical period for psychotic disorders during which the brain undergoes rapid and significant functional and structural changes (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Shinn et al., 2017</cross-ref>). The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a global effort to map the human brain's connectivity in health and disease. Here we focus on HCP-EP subjects (i.e., those within 5&nbsp;years of the initial psychotic episode) to determine macro- and microstructural alterations in EP (HCP-EP sample, <I>n</I> = 179: EP, <I>n</I> = 123, controls, <I>n</I> = 56) and their association with clinical outcomes (i.e., symptoms severity) in HCP-EP. We carried out analyses of deformation-based morphometry (DBM), scalar indices from the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Lastly, we conducted correlation analyses focused on the midbrain (DBM and DTI) to examine associations between its structure and clinical symptoms. Our results show that the midbrain displays robust alteration in its structure (DBM and DTI) in the voxel-based analysis. Complimentary alterations were also observed for the hippocampus and putamen. A seed-based analysis centered around the midbrain confirms the voxel-based analysis of DBM and DTI. TBSS displays structural differences within the midbrain and complementary alterations in the corticospinal tract and cingulum. Correlations between the midbrain structures and behavior showed that the quantified features correlate with cognition and clinical scores. Our findings contribute to understanding the midbrain-focused circuitry involvement in EP and provide a path for future investigations to inform specific brain-based biomarkers of EP.</p>

                <p>We aimed to better understand the dynamics of cortical neurons during nonREM sleep&mdash;a state in which neuronal populations are silenced for ~100&nbsp;ms of every second due to delta wave fluctuations. This alternation between periods of population spiking ("UP states") and silence ("DOWN states") generally synchronizes populations at the 1&nbsp;s timescale, although some prior work has shown that anticorrelations in nonREM can occur in pairs of neurons that are anticorrelated in wake. We used 24&nbsp;h recordings of frontal cortical neurons in rats to measure cross-correlation between pairs of neurons in wake, nonREM, and REM. Surprisingly, while most pairs of neurons were synchronized, we found a minority of pairs that showed significant nonREM-induced desynchronization, as indicated by negative cross-correlations in nonREM without equivalent anticorrelation in wake or REM. Interestingly, the degree of anticorrelation within NREM epochs was positively modulated by oscillations in the low-frequency (i.e., "delta" or 1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) range, meaning anticorrelation between some pairs increases when correlation increases between other pairs. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by firing during the nonsilent UP state phase of the delta cycle, indicating it is not due to neurons active in the DOWN state. Finally, high-variance spike timing between pairs of neurons and burst spiking during UP states are shown to specifically contribute to the anticorrelation. This state-specific desynchronization during the "synchronized" state represents a new phenomenon that can lead to new understanding of network dynamics during sleep.</p>

                The past decade has been marked by increased discussions on sustainability; some of the prominent accelerators being, mounting natural disasters, vocal climate activism, and the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interest has crossed over from deliberations in global summits to grassroots-level communication. Additionally, the literature points to the increasing usage of social media in communicating sustainability with an increase of interest in this area among Asian researchers. This paper aims to understand the direction of sustainability communication and the usage of social media in the communication of sustainability, in the last decade (2013-2023), from an Asian perspective – researchers and respondents from Asia. A comprehensive search of the literature by Asian researchers on sustainability communication on social media in the past decade was conducted using the Scopus database. The studies were clustered around common directions and terminologies, basis an in-depth content analysis. Based on the analysis, the study presents the current direction of research in sustainability communication on social media in the areas of brand-generated sustainability communication, cause-generated content and user-generated content. Few prominent themes that emerged were of green marketing, greenwashing, social media as a platform for active engagement and environment related discussions. The studies analyzed in the scoping review affirm that sustainability communication on social media in Asia has substantial potential to improve the environmental awareness of the public and promote actual pro-environmental behavior in the broad areas of green purchase and conservation behavior. The review provides a holistic view of the recent trends and possible future directions for sustainability communication on social media.

                Background Recently, health professional education uses visual art observation to promote various observation-related technical skills. This article maps the studies on such interventions, scrutinizes what they measured as observational skills, and discusses their effectiveness. Methods Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, a scoping review was conducted. Publications from 2001 on were identified by searching four databases and by hand searching. The author screened each publication using the pre-designed eligibility criteria: participants were novice healthcare learners enrolled in visual art observation training; the study aimed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on technical skills related to observation; the skills were objectively measured. The author extracted relevant information from the included papers without additional inquiry into the study authors. The extracted information was illustrated in both a tabular and descriptive format. Results 3,157 publications were identified, of which 18 articles were included. Few studies had valid and reliable experiments. The relatively valid evidence is that the participants listed more elements or signs for artistic or medical images. Conclusions Sound evidence is lacking for all the technical skills intended to be fostered. Observation skills for artistic images have not been demonstrated to transfer to technical skills. Nor do the studies show that they promoted accurate diagnoses and reduced misdiagnoses. Additionally, the evidence on verbalizing skills is not isolated from the impact of discussions and is unclear regarding its transfer to actual communication. For the others, there are not enough valid studies on technical skills. This is true for studies that directly examine promoting accurate diagnosis or reducing misdiagnosis. Moreover, there may be promising alternatives to visual art observations for cultivating such technical skills, but no comparative studies were conducted.

                Background The most prevalent, widely recognized, and challenging side effect experienced by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy is mucositis, which results in considerable morbidity and has the potential to impede the treatment regimen and augment therapeutic costs. Therefore, a comparison between the two experimental interventions in the present study was performed to represent the effectiveness of different treatments or preventative measures. Aim To evaluate the efficacy of oral cryotherapy compared to normal saline mouthwash in reducing alkylating drug-induced mucositis among cancer patients. Methods A Randomized controlled clinical trial-parallel group design was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in the oncology ward of Bhubaneswar, with a total number of 74 participants (of which 37 were administered cryotherapy and 37 were administered normal saline mouthwash) using the WHO mucositis assessment scale. Results Association of mucositis assessment grading with groups was performed on day 1st, 7th day, 14th day and 21st day followed by intervention. The review on 21st day revealed that 70.3% of the cryotherapy group had grade 0 mucositis, which is a big jump from 48.6% on day 14. In contrast, in the normal saline group, the corresponding increase was only 18.9% to 27.0% only. Conclusion There is clear evidence that on day 21, the improvement in mucositis grade was much higher in the cryotherapy group than in the normal saline group, as there was a significant association between mucositis grade and group (p<0.001) on day 21.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-683/v2?src=rss">A cross-sectional study of Malaysian low-income drug addict wives: Relationship between family impact, coping and mental wellbeing [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The involvement of the husbands in the issue of drug addiction has impacted the wives’ livelihoods. Due to drug addiction amongst husbands, the wives experience stress and strain. The Stress Strain Coping Support Model (SSCS) was established to better comprehend how coping influences stress and strain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the stress which refers to family impact experienced by the wives of drug addicts, in terms of economic difficulties and marital conflict, and mental wellbeing. Furthermore, this study examines the role of coping as a mediating factor between family impact and mental wellbeing. Methods This study involved 132 wives of low-income drug addicts in Malaysia, who were selected using a purposive sampling method. Economic Strain Scale (ESS) and Braiker-Kelly Marital Conflict Scale (BKMCS) were used to measure family impact. Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale Short Form (CAPS-SF) and Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) were used to measure coping and mental wellbeing of the respective respondents. Results Path analysis using SmartPLS software version 3.3.7 showed that there is a direct association between family impact and coping, and between coping and mental wellbeing. The results also showed that family impact was associated indirectly with mental wellbeing through coping. Conclusions The findings benefited drug addict wives and practitioners related to this field in terms of enhancing the use of coping mechanisms in managing family impact and improving mental wellbeing, specifically amongst low-income drug addict wives.

                Background As lung cancer treatment has progressed, there has been an increase in awareness of the short- and long-term adverse effects of targeted cancer therapies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly cardiovascular toxicities. Methods The current study assessed the potential drug interactions using interaction drug-interaction checkers (IBM Micromedex and Drugs.com). Molecular docking was employed to further investigate the involvement of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) proteins to elucidate their potential interactions and underlying mechanisms. Result A total of 74 pharmacokinetic and 105 pharmacodynamic interactions were detected between tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cardiovascular drugs, along with a report on the severity and level of documentation. A considerable fraction of molecular modelling outcomes concurred with information of drug-drug interaction checkers. The binding energies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with hERG and PXR were high, indicating significant interactions. The cardiovascular drug class encompasses calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic medicines, and statins, which exhibit synergistic interactions. The identification of these potential drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A4, P-gp, and hERG proteins can be utilized in therapy optimization in clinical settings. Conclusion This study will aid clinicians in designing safe dosage regimens for patients with lung cancer. In cases where patients have multiple comorbidities, it is essential to study the clinical aspects to design efficient chemotherapy and manage adverse effects and toxicities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-308/v1?src=rss">Osteopetrosis and fracture: planning and management [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Osteopetrosis (OP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density. Monitoring is the only alternative in these patients because of bone fragility, which is a source of frequent complications. This study aimed to describe the fracture profile, possible complications, and management in this group of patients. Material and methods We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study including 21 fractures in 8 OP patients managed in our department between 1996 and 2022, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Patient data included age, sex, history of surgery, fractures, intraoperative difficulties encountered, and complications. Results All of our patients were young adults with a mean age of 28.4 years and an M/F ratio of 3:1. A total of 21 fractures (8 patients with OP) were managed in our department. The femur was the most frequent fracture site. The management of these fractures is surgical. Plate osteosynthesis is the most common indication. Three fractures were treated by orthopaedics. There were high rates of intraoperative and post-operative complications. Discussion Fractures in patients with OP often involve the long bones. As this is a rare disease, there are few studies on the appropriate management of fractures in this population. Most studies are case series with a small number of cases. Osteosynthesis is the recommended treatment for these fractures despite the risk of failure. Therefore, effective preoperative planning is essential. Great care must be taken when synthesizing these fractures to avoid intraoperative complications. Conclusion Fractures in patients with osteopetrosis present a challenge to orthopaedic surgeons. Planned surgery enables the appropriate synthesis of fractures. Long-term follow-up is essential for these patients to detect complications at an early stage.

Drugs that impair microtubule dynamics alter microtubule-kinetochore attachment and invoke the mitotic checkpoint which arrests cells in mitosis. The arrest can last for hours, but it is leaky: cells adapt (i.e., slip out of it) and exit from mitosis. Here, we investigate the mechanism that allows cells to escape, and whether it is possible to prevent it. Based on a model of the mitotic checkpoint which includes the presence of a positive feedback loop, the escape from the arrest is described as a stochastic transition driven by fluctuations of molecular components from a checkpoint ON to a checkpoint OFF state. According to the model, drug removal further facilitates adaptation, a prediction we confirmed in budding yeast. The model suggests two ways to avoid adaptation: inhibition of APC/C and strengthening the mitotic checkpoint. We confirmed experimentally that both alterations decrease the chance of cells slipping out of mitosis, during a prolonged arrest and after washing out the drug. Our results may be relevant for increasing the efficiency of microtubule depolymerizing drugs.

                <p>A host of acquired abnormalities in visual function are known to occur in persons who suffer stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders. Cerebral visual impairment occurs in children with early neurological injury or disorders, especially neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. With the improved survival of pre-term infants through meticulous neonatal intensive care unit care, cerebral visual impairment in children has become much more common in developed countries. In recent months a number of National Institutes of Health institutes and the American Academy of Pediatrics have brought new attention to this major public health problem, which is highly relevant to child neurologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, as well as the general neurologists who will care for affected individuals as they enter adulthood.

                Sonoda et al. show that selective visual experience can alter the distribution of feature selectivity in the primary visual thalamus. This plasticity is independent of changes in cortical feedback and requires proper retinogeniculate refinement. While plasticity is present in both developing and mature thalamus, changes during development are longer lasting.

                Lucantonio et al. highlight a fundamental role for synaptic plasticity within the nucleus accumbens D1-medium spiny neurons (NAc D1-MSNs) in driving the anti-anhedonic effects of ketamine. They demonstrate that these effects are driven by restoration of synaptic efficacy at two monosynaptic inputs to the NAc—medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus—which control different components of hedonic behaviors.
