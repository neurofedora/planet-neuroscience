     alt="Divergent association between pain intensity and resting-state fMRI-based brain entropy in different age groups"/>
<p>We investigate the association between brain entropy (BEN) estimated from resting-state fMRI and pain intensity in a sample including young adults, middle-aged participants, and elders. Main results show that the interaction between age and pain intensity is related to BEN increase in pain-related brain regions. Further investigation showed that, in young adults, pain intensity is related to BEN decrease, whereas in middle-aged participants and elders, pain intensity is related to BEN increase.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pain is a multidimensional subjective experience sustained by multiple brain regions involved in different aspects of pain experience. We used brain entropy (BEN) estimated from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data to investigate the neural correlates of pain experience. BEN was estimated from rs-fMRI data provided by two datasets with different age range: the Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA) and the Human Connectome project-Aging (HCP-A) datasets. Retrospective assessment of experienced pain intensity was retrieved from both datasets. No main effect of pain intensity was observed. The interaction between pain and age, however, was related to increased BEN in several pain-related brain regions, reflecting greater variability of spontaneous brain activity. Dividing the sample into a young adult group (YG) and a middle age-aging group (MAG) resulted in two divergent patterns of pain–BEN association: In the YG, pain intensity was related to reduced BEN in brain regions involved in the sensory processing of pain; in the MAG, pain was associated with increased BEN in areas related to both sensory and cognitive aspects of pain experience.</p>

">A left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal network for naming</a></h4>

              
                The ability to connect the form and meaning of a concept, known as word retrieval, is fundamental to human communication. While various input modalities could lead to identical word retrieval, the exact neural dynamics supporting this convergence relevant to daily auditory discourse remain poorly understood. Here, we leveraged neurosurgical electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from 48 patients and dissociated two key language networks that highly overlap in time and space integral to word retrieval. Using unsupervised temporal clustering techniques, we found a semantic processing network located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri. This network was distinct from an articulatory planning network in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which was agnostic to input modalities. Functionally, we confirmed that the semantic processing network encodes word surprisal during sentence perception. Our findings characterize how humans integrate ongoing auditory semantic information over time, a critical linguistic function from passive comprehension to daily discourse.

">Developmental and adult striatal patterning of nociceptin ligand marks striosomal population with direct dopamine projections</a></h4>

              
                Circuit influences on the midbrain dopamine system are crucial to adaptive behavior and cognition. Recent developments in the study of neuropeptide systems have enabled high-resolution investigations of the intersection of neuromodulatory signals with basal ganglia circuitry, identifying the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) endogenous opioid peptide system as a prospective regulator of striatal dopamine signaling. Using a prepronociceptin-Cre reporter mouse line, we characterized highly selective striosomal patterning of Pnoc mRNA expression in mouse dorsal striatum, reflecting early developmental expression of Pnoc. In the ventral striatum, Pnoc expression was clustered across the nucleus accumbens core and medial shell, including in adult striatum. We found that PnoctdTomato reporter cells largely comprise a population of dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1) expressing medium spiny projection neurons localized in dorsal striosomes, known to be unique among striatal projections neurons for their direct innervation of midbrain dopamine neurons. These findings provide new understanding of the intersection of the N/OFQ system among basal ganglia circuits with particular implications for developmental regulation or wiring of striato-nigral circuits.

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting individuals worldwide and characterized by deficits in social interaction along with the presence of restricted interest and repetitive behaviors. Despite decades of behavioral research, little is known about the brain mechanisms that influence social behaviors among children with ASD. This, in part, is due to limitations of traditional imaging techniques specifically targeting pediatric populations. As a portable and scalable optical brain monitoring technology, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a measure of cerebral hemodynamics related to sensory, motor, or cognitive function. Here, we utilized fNIRS to investigate the prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity of young children with ASD and with typical development while they watched social and nonsocial video clips. The PFC activity of ASD children was significantly higher for social stimuli at medial PFC, which is implicated in social cognition/processing. Moreover, this activity was also consistently correlated with clinical measures, and higher activation of the same brain area only during social video viewing was associated with more ASD symptoms. This is the first study to implement a neuroergonomics approach to investigate cognitive load in response to realistic, complex, and dynamic audiovisual social stimuli for young children with and without autism. Our results further confirm that new generation of portable fNIRS neuroimaging can be used for ecologically valid measurements of the brain function of toddlers and preschool children with ASD.</p>

                <p>The perception of food relies on the integration of olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth. This multisensory process generates robust associations between odors and tastes, significantly influencing the perceptual judgment of flavors. However, the specific neural substrates underlying this integrative process remain unclear. Previous electrophysiological studies identified the gustatory cortex as a site of convergent olfactory and gustatory signals, but whether neurons represent multimodal odor&ndash;taste mixtures as distinct from their unimodal odor and taste components is unknown. To investigate this, we recorded single-unit activity in the gustatory cortex of behaving female rats during the intraoral delivery of individual odors, individual tastes, and odor&ndash;taste mixtures. Our results demonstrate that chemoselective neurons in the gustatory cortex are broadly responsive to intraoral chemosensory stimuli, exhibiting time-varying multiphasic changes in activity. In a subset of these chemoselective neurons, odor&ndash;taste mixtures elicit nonlinear cross-modal responses that distinguish them from their olfactory and gustatory components. These findings provide novel insights into multimodal chemosensory processing by the gustatory cortex, highlighting the distinct representation of unimodal and multimodal intraoral chemosensory signals. Overall, our findings suggest that olfactory and gustatory signals interact nonlinearly in the gustatory cortex to enhance the identity coding of both unimodal and multimodal chemosensory stimuli.</p>

                <p>A central question in consciousness theories is whether one is dealing with a dichotomous ("all-or-none") or a gradual phenomenon. In this 7T fMRI study, we investigated whether dichotomy or gradualness in fact depends on the brain region associated with perceptual awareness reports. Both male and female human subjects performed an emotion discrimination task (fear vs neutral bodies) presented under continuous flash suppression with trial-based perceptual awareness measures. Behaviorally, recognition sensitivity increased linearly with increased stimuli awareness and was at chance level during perceptual unawareness. Physiologically, threat stimuli triggered a slower heart rate than neutral ones during "almost clear" stimulus experience, indicating freezing behavior. Brain results showed that activity in the occipitotemporal, parietal, and frontal regions as well as in the amygdala increased with increased stimulus awareness while early visual areas showed the opposite pattern. The relationship between temporal area activity and perceptual awareness best fitted a gradual model while the activity in frontoparietal areas fitted a dichotomous model. Furthermore, our findings illustrate that specific experimental decisions, such as stimulus type or the approach used to evaluate awareness, play pivotal roles in consciousness studies and warrant careful consideration.</p>

                <p>The brain bidirectionally communicates with the gut to control food intake and energy balance, which becomes dysregulated in obesity. For example, endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling in the small-intestinal (SI) epithelium is upregulated in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and promotes overeating by a mechanism that includes inhibiting gut&ndash;brain satiation signaling. Upstream neural and molecular mechanism(s) involved in overproduction of orexigenic gut eCBs in DIO, however, are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that overactive parasympathetic signaling at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the SI increases biosynthesis of the eCB, 2-arachidonoyl-<I>sn</I>-glycerol (2-AG), which drives hyperphagia via local CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs in DIO. Male mice were maintained on a high-fat/high-sucrose Western-style diet for 60&nbsp;d, then administered several mAChR antagonists 30&nbsp;min prior to tissue harvest or a food intake test. Levels of 2-AG and the activity of its metabolic enzymes in the SI were quantitated. DIO mice, when compared to those fed a low-fat/no-sucrose diet, displayed increased expression of cFos protein in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, which suggests an increased activity of efferent cholinergic neurotransmission. These mice exhibited elevated levels of 2-AG biosynthesis in the SI, that was reduced to control levels by mAChR antagonists. Moreover, the peripherally restricted mAChR antagonist, methylhomatropine bromide, and the peripherally restricted CB<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonist, AM6545, reduced food intake in DIO mice for up to 24&nbsp;h but had no effect in mice conditionally deficient in SI CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs. These results suggest that hyperactivity at mAChRs in the periphery increases formation of 2-AG in the SI and activates local CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs, which drives hyperphagia in DIO.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/20/e1224232024?rss=1">Identifying Distinct Neural Features between the Initial and Corrective Phases of Precise Reaching Using AutoLFADS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many initial movements require subsequent corrective movements, but how the motor cortex transitions to make corrections and how similar the encoding is to initial movements is unclear. In our study, we explored how the brain's motor cortex signals both initial and corrective movements during a precision reaching task. We recorded a large population of neurons from two male rhesus macaques across multiple sessions to examine the neural firing rates during not only initial movements but also subsequent corrective movements. AutoLFADS, an autoencoder-based deep-learning model, was applied to provide a clearer picture of neurons&rsquo; activity on individual corrective movements across sessions. Decoding of reach velocity generalized poorly from initial to corrective submovements. Unlike initial movements, it was challenging to predict the velocity of corrective movements using traditional linear methods in a single, global neural space. We identified several locations in the neural space where corrective submovements originated after the initial reaches, signifying firing rates different than the baseline before initial movements. To improve corrective movement decoding, we demonstrate that a state-dependent decoder incorporating the population firing rates at the initiation of correction improved performance, highlighting the diverse neural features of corrective movements. In summary, we show neural differences between initial and corrective submovements and how the neural activity encodes specific combinations of velocity and position. These findings are inconsistent with assumptions that neural correlations with kinematic features are global and independent, emphasizing that traditional methods often fall short in describing these diverse neural processes for online corrective movements.</p>

                <p>Protein misfolding, aggregation, and spread through the brain are primary drivers of neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. Phagocytic glia are responsible for regulating the load of pathological proteins in the brain, but emerging evidence suggests that glia may also act as vectors for aggregate spread. Accumulation of protein aggregates could compromise the ability of glia to eliminate toxic materials from the brain by disrupting efficient degradation in the phagolysosomal system. A better understanding of phagocytic glial cell deficiencies in the disease state could help to identify novel therapeutic targets for multiple neurological disorders. Here, we report that mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates impair glial responsiveness to injury and capacity to degrade neuronal debris in male and female adult <I>Drosophila</I> expressing the gene that causes Huntington's disease (HD). mHTT aggregate formation in neurons impairs engulfment and clearance of injured axons and causes accumulation of phagolysosomes in glia. Neuronal mHTT expression induces upregulation of key innate immunity and phagocytic genes, some of which were found to regulate mHTT aggregate burden in the brain. A forward genetic screen revealed Rab10 as a novel component of Draper-dependent phagocytosis that regulates mHTT aggregate transmission from neurons to glia. These data suggest that glial phagocytic defects enable engulfed mHTT aggregates to evade lysosomal degradation and acquire prion-like characteristics. Together, our findings uncover new mechanisms that enhance our understanding of the beneficial and harmful effects of phagocytic glia in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <p>The reversal potential refers to the membrane potential at which the net current flow through a channel reverses direction. The reversal potential is determined by transmembrane ion gradients and, in turn, determines how the channel's activity will affect the membrane potential. Traditional investigation into the reversal potential of inhibitory ligand-gated ion channels (E<SUB>Inh</SUB>) has relied upon the activation of endogenous receptors, such as the GABA-A receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R). There are, however, challenges associated with activating endogenous receptors, including agonist delivery, isolating channel responses, and the effects of receptor saturation and desensitization. Here, we demonstrate the utility of using a light-gated anion channel, stGtACR2, to probe E<SUB>Inh</SUB> in the rodent brain. Using mice of both sexes, we demonstrate that the properties of this optically activated channel make it a suitable proxy for studying GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R receptor-mediated inhibition. We validate this agonist-independent optogenetic strategy in vitro and in vivo and further show how it can accurately capture differences in E<SUB>Inh</SUB> dynamics following manipulations of endogenous ion fluxes. This allows us to explore distinct resting E<SUB>Inh</SUB> differences across genetically defined neuronal subpopulations. Using this approach to challenge ion homeostasis mechanisms in neurons, we uncover cell-specific E<SUB>Inh</SUB> dynamics that are supported by the differential expression of endogenous ion handling mechanisms. Our findings therefore establish an effective optical strategy for revealing novel aspects of inhibitory reversal potentials and thereby expand the repertoire of optogenetics.</p>

                <p>Microglia undergo two-stage activation in neurodegenerative diseases, known as disease-associated microglia (DAM). TREM2 mediates the DAM2 stage transition, but what regulates the first DAM1 stage transition is unknown. We report that glucose dyshomeostasis inhibits DAM1 activation and PKM2 plays a role. As in tumors, PKM2 was aberrantly elevated in both male and female human AD brains, but unlike in tumors, it is expressed as active tetramers, as well as among TREM2<sup>+</sup> microglia surrounding plaques in 5XFAD male and female mice. snRNAseq analyses of microglia without <I>Pkm2</I> in 5XFAD mice revealed significant increases in DAM1 markers in a distinct metabolic cluster, which is enriched in genes for glucose metabolism, DAM1, and AD risk. 5XFAD mice incidentally exhibited a significant reduction in amyloid pathology without microglial <I>Pkm2</I>. Surprisingly, microglia in 5XFAD without <I>Pkm2</I> exhibited increases in glycolysis and spare respiratory capacity, which correlated with restoration of mitochondrial cristae alterations. In addition, in situ spatial metabolomics of plaque-bearing microglia revealed an increase in respiratory activity. These results together suggest that it is not only glycolytic but also respiratory inputs that are critical to the development of DAM signatures in 5XFAD mice.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus (SC) is a prominent and conserved visual center in all vertebrates. In mice, the most superficial lamina of the SC is enriched with neurons that are selective for the moving direction of visual stimuli. Here, we study how these direction selective neurons respond to complex motion patterns known as plaids, using two-photon calcium imaging in awake male and female mice. The plaid pattern consists of two superimposed sinusoidal gratings moving in different directions, giving an apparent pattern direction that lies between the directions of the two component gratings. Most direction selective neurons in the mouse SC respond robustly to the plaids and show a high selectivity for the moving direction of the plaid pattern but not of its components. Pattern motion selectivity is seen in both excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons and is especially prevalent in response to plaids with large cross angles between the two component gratings. However, retinal inputs to the SC are ambiguous in their selectivity to pattern versus component motion. Modeling suggests that pattern motion selectivity in the SC can arise from a nonlinear transformation of converging retinal inputs. In contrast, the prevalence of pattern motion selective neurons is not seen in the primary visual cortex (V1). These results demonstrate an interesting difference between the SC and V1 in motion processing and reveal the SC as an important site for encoding pattern motion.</p>

                <p>The human hand possesses both consolidated motor skills and remarkable flexibility in adapting to ongoing task demands. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the brain balances stability and flexibility remain unknown. In the absence of external input or behavior, spontaneous (intrinsic) brain connectivity is thought to represent a prior of stored memories. In this study, we investigated how manual dexterity modulates spontaneous functional connectivity in the motor cortex during hand movement. Using magnetoencephalography, in 47 human participants (both sexes), we examined connectivity modulations in the &alpha; and &beta; frequency bands at rest and during two motor tasks (i.e., finger tapping or toe squeezing). The flexibility and stability of such modulations allowed us to identify two groups of participants with different levels of performance (high and low performers) on the nine-hole peg test, a test of manual dexterity. In the &alpha; band, participants with higher manual dexterity showed distributed decreases of connectivity, specifically in the motor cortex, increased segregation, and reduced nodal centrality. Participants with lower manual dexterity showed an opposite pattern. Notably, these patterns from the brain to behavior are mirrored by results from behavior to the brain. Indeed, when participants were divided using the median split of the dexterity score, we found the same connectivity patterns. In summary, this experiment shows that a long-term motor skill&mdash;manual dexterity&mdash;influences the way the motor systems respond during movements.</p>

                <p>Our prior research has identified neural correlates of cognitive control in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), leading us to hypothesize that the ACC is necessary for increasing attention as rats flexibly learn new contingencies during a complex reward-guided decision-making task. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using optogenetics to transiently inhibit the ACC, while rats of either sex performed the same two-choice task. ACC inhibition had a profound impact on behavior that extended beyond deficits in attention during learning when expected outcomes were uncertain. We found that ACC inactivation slowed and reduced the number of trials rats initiated and impaired both their accuracy and their ability to complete sessions. Furthermore, drift&ndash;diffusion model analysis suggested that free-choice performance and evidence accumulation (i.e., reduced drift rates) were degraded during initial learning&mdash;leading to weaker associations that were more easily overridden in later trial blocks (i.e., stronger bias). Together, these results suggest that in addition to attention-related functions, the ACC contributes to the ability to initiate trials and generally stay on task.</p>

                <p>The default mode network (DMN) typically deactivates to external tasks, yet supports semantic cognition. It comprises medial temporal (MT), core, and frontotemporal (FT) subsystems, but its functional organization is unclear: the requirement for perceptual coupling versus decoupling, input modality (visual/verbal), type of information (social/spatial), and control demands all potentially affect its recruitment. We examined the effect of these factors on activation and deactivation of DMN subsystems during semantic cognition, across four task-based human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, and localized these responses in whole-brain state space defined by gradients of intrinsic connectivity. FT showed activation consistent with a central role across domains, tasks, and modalities, although it was most responsive to abstract, verbal tasks; this subsystem uniquely showed more "tuned" states characterized by increases in both activation and deactivation when semantic retrieval demands were higher. MT also activated to both perceptually coupled (scenes) and decoupled (autobiographical memory) tasks and showed stronger responses to picture associations, consistent with a role in scene construction. Core DMN consistently showed deactivation, especially to externally oriented tasks. These diverse contributions of DMN subsystems to semantic cognition were related to their location on intrinsic connectivity gradients: activation was closer to the sensory-motor cortex than deactivation, particularly for FT and MT, while activation for core DMN was distant from both visual cortex and cognitive control. These results reveal distinctive yet complementary DMN responses: MT and FT support different memory-based representations that are accessed externally and internally, while deactivation in core DMN is associated with demanding, external semantic tasks.</p>

                <p>The visual perception of individuals is thought to be mediated by a network of regions in the occipitotemporal cortex that supports specialized processing of faces, bodies, and actions. In comparison, we know relatively little about the neural mechanisms that support the perception of multiple individuals and the interactions between them. The present study sought to elucidate the visual processing of social interactions by identifying which regions of the social perception network represent interpersonal synchrony. In an fMRI study with 32 human participants (26 female, 6 male), we used multivoxel pattern analysis to investigate whether activity in face-selective, body-selective, and interaction-sensitive regions across the social perception network supports the decoding of synchronous versus asynchronous head-nodding and head-shaking. Several regions were found to support significant decoding of synchrony/asynchrony, including extrastriate body area (EBA), face-selective and interaction-sensitive mid/posterior right superior temporal sulcus, and occipital face area. We also saw robust cross-classification across actions in the EBA, suggestive of movement-invariant representations of synchrony/asynchrony. Exploratory whole-brain analyses also identified a region of the right fusiform cortex that responded more strongly to synchronous than to asynchronous motion. Critically, perceiving interpersonal synchrony/asynchrony requires the simultaneous extraction and integration of dynamic information from more than one person. Hence, the representation of synchrony/asynchrony cannot be attributed to augmented or additive processing of individual actors. Our findings therefore provide important new evidence that social interactions recruit dedicated visual processing within the social perception network that extends beyond that engaged by the faces and bodies of the constituent individuals.</p>

                <p>Human frontocentral event-related potentials (FC-ERPs) are ubiquitous neural correlates of cognition and control, but their generating multiscale mechanisms remain mostly unknown. We used the Human Neocortical Neurosolver's biophysical model of a canonical neocortical circuit under exogenous thalamic and cortical drive to simulate the cell and circuit mechanisms underpinning the P2, N2, and P3 features of the FC-ERP observed after Stop-Signals in the Stop&ndash;Signal task (SST; <I>N</I> = 234 humans, 137 female). We demonstrate that a sequence of simulated external thalamocortical and corticocortical drives can produce the FC-ERP, similar to what has been shown for primary sensory cortices. We used this model of the FC-ERP to examine likely circuit-mechanisms underlying FC-ERP features that distinguish between successful and failed action-stopping. We also tested their adherence to the predictions of the horse-race model of the SST, with specific hypotheses motivated by theoretical links between the P3 and Stop process. These simulations revealed that a difference in P3 onset between successful and failed Stops is most likely due to a later arrival of thalamocortical drive in failed Stops, rather than, for example, a difference in the effective strength of the input. In contrast, the same model predicted that early thalamocortical drives underpinning the P2 and N2 differed in both strength and timing across stopping accuracy conditions. Overall, this model generates novel testable predictions of the thalamocortical dynamics underlying FC-ERP generation during action-stopping. Moreover, it provides a detailed cellular and circuit-level interpretation that supports links between these macroscale signatures and predictions of the behavioral race model.</p>

                <p>Aging dogs serve as a valuable preclinical model for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to their natural age-related development of &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) plaques, human-like metabolism, and large brains that are ideal for studying structural brain aging trajectories from serial neuroimaging. Here we examined the effects of chronic treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus or the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-inhibiting compound Q134R on age-related canine brain atrophy from a longitudinal study in middle-aged beagles (36 females, 7 males) undergoing behavioral enrichment. Annual MRI was analyzed using modern, automated techniques for region-of-interest-based and voxel-based volumetric assessments. We found that the frontal lobe showed accelerated atrophy with age, while the caudate nucleus remained relatively stable. Remarkably, the hippocampus increased in volume in all dogs. None of these changes were influenced by tacrolimus or Q134R treatment. Our results suggest that behavioral enrichment can prevent atrophy and increase the volume of the hippocampus but does not prevent aging-associated prefrontal cortex atrophy.</p>

                <p>Historically, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in a variety of behaviors ranging from reversal learning and inhibitory control to more complex representations of reward value and task space. While modern interpretations of the OFC's function have focused on a role in outcome evaluation, these cognitive processes often require an organism to inhibit a maladaptive response or strategy. Single-unit recordings from the OFC in rats performing a stop-change task show that the OFC responds strongly to STOP trials. To investigate the role that the OFC plays in stop-change performance, we expressed halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in excitatory neurons in the OFC and tested rats on the stop-change task. Previous work suggests that the OFC differentiates between STOP trials based on trial sequence (i.e., gS trials: STOP trials preceded by a GO vs sS trials: STOP trials preceded by a STOP). We found that yellow light activation of the eNpHR3.0-expressing neurons significantly decreased accuracy only on STOP trials that followed GO trials (gS trials). Further, optogenetic inhibition of the OFC speeded reaction times on error trials. This suggests that the OFC plays a role in inhibitory control processes and that this role needs to be accounted for in modern interpretations of OFC function.</p>

                <p>Retinal prosthetics are one of the leading therapeutic strategies to restore lost vision in patients with retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Much work has described patterns of spiking in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in response to electrical stimulation, but less work has examined the underlying retinal circuitry that is activated by electrical stimulation to drive these responses. Surprisingly, little is known about the role of inhibition in generating electrical responses or how inhibition might be altered during degeneration. Using whole-cell voltage&ndash;clamp recordings during subretinal electrical stimulation in the <I>rd10</I> and wild-type (<I>wt</I>) retina, we found electrically evoked synaptic inputs differed between ON and OFF RGC populations, with ON cells receiving mostly excitation and OFF cells receiving mostly inhibition and very little excitation. We found that the inhibition of OFF bipolar cells limits excitation in OFF RGCs, and a majority of both pre- and postsynaptic inhibition in the OFF pathway arises from glycinergic amacrine cells, and the stimulation of the ON pathway contributes to inhibitory inputs to the RGC. We also show that this presynaptic inhibition in the OFF pathway is greater in the <I>rd10</I> retina, compared with that in the <I>wt</I> retina.</p>

                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often associated with social communication impairments and specific sound processing deficits, for example, problems in following speech in noisy environments. To investigate underlying neuronal processing defects located in the auditory cortex (AC), we performed two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in <I>FMR1</I> (<I>fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein</I> <I>1</I>) knock-out (KO) mice, a model for fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of hereditary ASD in humans. For primary AC (A1) and the anterior auditory field (AAF), topographic frequency representation was less ordered compared with control animals. We additionally analyzed ensemble AC activity in response to various sounds and found subfield-specific differences. In A1, ensemble correlations were lower in general, while in secondary AC (A2), correlations were higher in response to complex sounds, but not to pure tones. Furthermore, sound specificity of ensemble activity was decreased in AAF. Repeating these experiments 1&nbsp;week later revealed no major differences regarding representational drift. Nevertheless, we found subfield- and genotype-specific changes in ensemble correlation values between the two times points, hinting at alterations in network stability in <I>FMR1</I> KO mice. These detailed insights into AC network activity and topography in <I>FMR1</I> KO mice add to the understanding of auditory processing defects in FXS.</p>

                <p>The voltage-gated calcium channel subunit &alpha;2-2 controls calcium-dependent signaling in neurons, and loss of this subunit causes epilepsy in both mice and humans. To determine whether mice without &alpha;2-2 demonstrate hippocampal activation or histopathological changes associated with seizure activity, we measured expression of the activity-dependent gene c<I>-fos</I> and various histopathological correlates of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in hippocampal tissue from wild-type (WT) and &alpha;2-2 knock-out (<I>CACNA2D2</I> KO) mice using immunohistochemical staining and confocal microscopy. Both genotypes demonstrated similarly sparse c-<I>fos</I> and <I>FosB</I> expressions within the hippocampal dentate granule cell layer (GCL) at baseline, consistent with no difference in basal activity of granule cells between genotypes. Surprisingly, when mice were assayed 1&nbsp;h after handling-associated convulsions, KO mice had fewer c-<I>fos</I>-positive cells but dramatically increased <I>FosB</I> expression in the dentate gyrus compared with WT mice. After administration of a subthreshold pentylenetetrazol dose, however, KO mice dentate had significantly more c-<I>fos</I> expression compared with WT mice. Other histopathological markers of TLE in these mice, including markers of neurogenesis, glial activation, and mossy fiber sprouting, were similar between WT and KO mice, apart from a small but statistically significant increase in hilar mossy cell density, opposite to what is typically found in mice with TLE. This suggests that the differences in seizure-associated dentate gyrus function in the absence of &alpha;2-2 protein are likely due to altered functional properties of the network without associated structural changes in the hippocampus at the typical age of seizure onset.</p>

Computational cognitive models have been used extensively to formalize cognitive processes. Model parameters offer a simple way to quantify individual differences in how humans process information. Similarly, model comparison allows researchers to identify which theories, embedded in different models, provide the best accounts of the data. Cognitive modeling uses statistical tools to quantitatively relate models to data that often rely on computing/estimating the likelihood of the data under the model. However, this likelihood is computationally intractable for a substantial number of models. These relevant models may embody reasonable theories of cognition, but are often under-explored due to the limited range of tools available to relate them to data. We contribute to filling this gap in a simple way using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to map data directly onto model identity and parameters, bypassing the likelihood estimation. We test our instantiation of an ANN as a cognitive model fitting tool on classes of cognitive models with strong inter-trial dependencies (such as reinforcement learning models), which offer unique challenges to most methods. We show that we can adequately perform both parameter estimation and model identification using our ANN approach, including for models that cannot be fit using traditional likelihood-based methods. We further discuss our work in the context of the ongoing research leveraging simulation-based approaches to parameter estimation and model identification, and how these approaches broaden the class of cognitive models researchers can quantitatively investigate.

Contrast transport models are widely used to quantify blood flow and transport in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. These models analyze the time course of the contrast agent concentration, providing diagnostic and prognostic value for many biological systems. Thus, ensuring accuracy and repeatability of the model parameter estimation is a fundamental concern. In this work, we analyze the structural and practical identifiability of a class of nested compartment models pervasively used in analysis of MRI data. We combine artificial and real data to study the role of noise in model parameter estimation. We observe that although all the models are structurally identifiable, practical identifiability strongly depends on the data characteristics. We analyze the impact of increasing data noise on parameter identifiability and show how the latter can be recovered with increased data quality. To complete the analysis, we show that the results do not depend on specific tissue characteristics or the type of enhancement patterns of contrast agent signal.

                <p>by Nikhil Phaniraj, Rahel K. Brügger, Judith M. Burkart</p>

Synchronization is widespread in animals, and studies have often emphasized how this seemingly complex phenomenon can emerge from very simple rules. However, the amount of flexibility and control that animals might have over synchronization properties, such as the strength of coupling, remains underexplored. Here, we studied how pairs of marmoset monkeys coordinated vigilance while feeding. By modeling them as coupled oscillators, we noted that (1) individual marmosets do not show perfect periodicity in vigilance behaviors, (2) nevertheless, marmoset pairs started to take turns being vigilant over time, a case of anti-phase synchrony, (3) marmosets could couple flexibly; the coupling strength varied with every new joint feeding bout, and (4) marmosets could control the coupling strength; dyads showed increased coupling if they began in a more desynchronized state. Such flexibility and control over synchronization require more than simple interaction rules. Minimally, animals must estimate the current degree of asynchrony and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, the fact that each marmoset is inherently non-periodic adds to the cognitive demand. Overall, our study provides a mathematical framework to investigate the cognitive demands involved in coordinating behaviors in animals, regardless of whether individual behaviors are rhythmic or not.

                <p>by Sean M. Cascarina, Eric D. Ross</p>

Low-complexity domains (LCDs) in proteins are typically enriched in one or two predominant amino acids. As a result, LCDs often exhibit unusual structural/biophysical tendencies and can occupy functional niches. However, for each organism, protein sequences must be compatible with intracellular biomolecules and physicochemical environment, both of which vary from organism to organism. This raises the possibility that LCDs may occupy sequence spaces in select organisms that are otherwise prohibited in most organisms. Here, we report a comprehensive survey and functional analysis of LCDs in all known reference proteomes (>21k organisms), with added focus on rare and unusual types of LCDs. LCDs were classified according to both the primary amino acid and secondary amino acid in each LCD sequence, facilitating detailed comparisons of LCD class frequencies across organisms. Examination of LCD classes at different depths (i.e., domain of life, organism, protein, and per-residue levels) reveals unique facets of LCD frequencies and functions. To our surprise, all 400 LCD classes occur in nature, although some are exceptionally rare. A number of rare classes can be defined for each domain of life, with many LCD classes appearing to be eukaryote-specific. Certain LCD classes were consistently associated with identical functions across many organisms, particularly in eukaryotes. Our analysis methods enable simultaneous, direct comparison of all LCD classes between individual organisms, resulting in a proteome-scale view of differences in LCD frequencies and functions. Together, these results highlight the remarkable diversity and functional specificity of LCDs across all known life forms.

As one approach to address this question, we used a novel class of γ-secretase modulators that promote γ-site cleavages by the γ-secretase complex, resulting in lower levels of the Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ts65Dn mice, which serve as a model of DS, were treated via oral gavage with 10 mg/kg/weekday of BPN15606 (a potent and novel pyridazine-containing γ-secretase modulators). Treatment started at 3 months-of-age and lasted for 4 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Demonstrating successful target engagement, treatment with BPN15606 significantly decreased levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the cortex and hippocampus; it had no effect on full-length APP or its C-terminal fragments in either 2 N or Ts65Dn mice. Importantly, the levels of total amyloid-β were not impacted, pointing to BPN15606-mediated enhancement of processivity of γ-secretase. Additionally, BPN15606 rescued hyperactivation of Rab5, a protein responsible for regulating endosome function, and normalized neurotrophin signaling deficits. BPN15606 treatment also normalized the levels of synaptic proteins and tau phosphorylation, while reducing astrocytosis and microgliosis, and countering cognitive deficits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings point to the involvement of increased levels of Aβ42 and/or Aβ40 in contributing to several molecular and cognitive traits associated with DS-AD. They speak to increased dosage of the <i>APP</i> gene acting through heightened levels of Aβ42 and/or Aβ40 as supporting pathogenesis. These findings further the interest in the potential use of γ-secretase modulators for treating and possibly preventing AD in individuals with DS. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26959?af=R">DNA Methylation in the Anti‐Mullerian Hormone Gene and the Risk of Disease Activity in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a complex pathobiology, with genetic and environmental factors being crucial players. Understanding the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in disease activity is crucial for tailored treatment. We explored the impact of DNA methylation, a key mechanism in the genetics-environment interplay, on disease activity in MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Peripheral immune methylome profiling using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips was conducted on 249 untreated relapsing–remitting MS patients, sampled at the start of disease-modifying treatment (DMT). A differential methylation analysis compared patients with evidence of disease activity (EDA) to those with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) over 2 years from DMT start. Utilizing causal inference testing (CIT) and Mendelian randomization (MR), we sought to elucidate the relationships between DNA methylation, gene expression, genetic variation, and disease activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between EDA and NEDA. Examining the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 923 variants were found to account for the observed differences in the 4 DMRs. Importantly, 3 out of the 923 SNPs, affecting DNA methylation in a DMR linked to the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) gene, were associated with disease activity risk in an independent cohort of 1,408 MS patients. CIT and MR demonstrated that DNA methylation in AMH acts as a mediator for the genetic risk of disease activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study uncovered a novel molecular pathway implicating the interaction between DNA methylation and genetic variation in the risk of disease activity in MS, emphasizing the role of sex hormones, particularly the AMH, in MS pathobiology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26964?af=R">Cognitive Trajectories and Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers: From Successful Cognitive Aging to Clinical Impairment</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional definitions of successful cognitive aging have been widely utilized, but longitudinal measurements can identify people who do not decline. We performed this study to contrast maintenance with declining trajectories, including clinical conversion.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included baseline cognitively unimpaired Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with 3 or more cognitive testing sessions (n = 539, follow-up 6.1 ± 3.5 years) and calculated slopes of an episodic memory composite (MEM) to classify them into two groups: maintainers (slope ≥ 0) and decliners (slope &lt; 0). Within decliners, we examined a subgroup of individuals who became clinically impaired during follow-up. These groups were compared on baseline characteristics and cognitive performance, as well as both cross-sectional and longitudinal Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarker measures (beta-amyloid [Aβ], tau, and hippocampal volume).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-one percent (n = 221) of the cohort were MEM maintainers, and 33% (n = 105) of decliners converted to clinical impairment during follow-up. Compared to those with superior baseline scores, maintainers had lower education and were more likely to be male. Maintainers and decliners did not differ on baseline MEM scores, but maintainers did have higher non-MEM cognitive scores. Maintainers had lower baseline global Aβ, lower tau pathology, and larger hippocampal volumes than decliners, even after removing converters. There were no differences in rates of change of any AD biomarkers between any cognitive trajectory groups except for a higher rate of hippocampal atrophy in clinical converters compared to maintainers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using longitudinal data to define cognitive trajectory groups reduces education and sex bias and reveals the prognostic importance of early onset of accumulation of AD pathology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ubiquity of nanoparticles, sourced from both natural environments and human activities, presents critical challenges for public health. While offering significant potential for innovative biomedical applications—especially in enhancing drug transport across the blood–brain barrier—these particles also introduce possible hazards due to inadvertent exposure. This concise review explores the paradoxical nature of nanoparticles, emphasizing their promising applications in healthcare juxtaposed with their potential neurotoxic consequences. Through a detailed examination, we delineate the pathways through which nanoparticles can reach the brain and the subsequent health implications. There is growing evidence of a disturbing association between nanoparticle exposure and the onset of neurodegenerative conditions, highlighting the imperative for comprehensive research and strategic interventions. Gaining a deep understanding of these mechanisms and enacting protective policies are crucial steps toward reducing the health threats of nanoparticles, thereby maximizing their therapeutic advantages.</p>

                Interest in the neurobiological substrates of consciousness has risen dramatically over the last few decades. This is reflected both in the steady increase in the number of papers published and in the recent surge of adversarial collaborations, in which researchers with opposing assumptions join forces to develop experiments to settle controversies and advance the field. Given this progress, we are enthusiastic to present this Neuron special issue on consciousness, with numerous reviews and commentaries each addressing a different area of consciousness research.

                Conscious experiences in infants remain poorly understood. In this NeuroView, Passos-Ferreira discusses recent evidence for and against consciousness in newborn babies. She argues that the weight of evidence from neuroimaging and behavioral studies supports the thesis that newborn infants are conscious.

                Cellular and systems neuroscience points to a thalamic contribution to consciousness. Matrix-thalamocortical loops support wakefulness and perceptual threshold, and core-thalamocortical loops maintain content and enable perceptual constancy. The mesoscale architecture of these loops may explain general properties of conscious contents.

">Cortico-amygdala synaptic structural abnormalities produced by templated aggregation of α-synuclein</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by neuronal -synuclein (-syn) inclusions termed Lewy Pathology, which are abundant in the amygdala. The basolateral amygdala (BLA), in particular, receives projections from the thalamus and cortex. These projections play a role in cognition and emotional processing, behaviors which are impaired in -synucleinopathies. To understand if and how pathologic -syn impacts the BLA requires animal models of -syn aggregation. Injection of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum induces robust -synuclein aggregation in excitatory neurons in the BLA that corresponds with reduced contextual fear conditioning. At early time points after aggregate formation, cortico-amygdala excitatory transmission is abolished. The goal of this project was to determine if -syn inclusions in the BLA induce synaptic degeneration and/or morphological changes. In this study, we used C57BL/6J mice injected bilaterally with PFFs in the dorsal striatum to induce -syn aggregate formation in the BLA. A method was developed using immunofluorescence and three-dimensional reconstruction to analyze excitatory cortico-amygdala and thalamo-amygdala presynaptic terminals closely juxtaposed to postsynaptic densities. The abundance and morphology of synapses were analyzed at 6- or 12-weeks post-injection of PFFs. -Syn aggregate formation in the BLA did not cause a significant loss of synapses, but cortico-amygdala and thalamo-amygdala presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic densities with aggregates of -synuclein show increased volumes, similar to previous findings in human DLB cortex, and in non-human primate models of PD. Transmission electron microscopy showed that PFF-injected mice showed reduced intervesicular distances similar to a recent study showing phospho-serine-129 -synuclein increases synaptic vesicle clustering. Thus, pathologic -synuclein causes major alterations to synaptic architecture in the BLA, potentially contributing to behavioral impairment and amygdala dysfunction observed in synucleinopathies.

">Dissociable encoding of evolving beliefs and momentary belief updates in distinct neural decision signals</a></h4>

              
                Making accurate decisions in noisy or otherwise uncertain environments requires integrating evidence over time. Using simple tasks requiring rapid evaluation of a stationary sensory feature, two human neurophysiological signals have been found to evolve with similar integration dynamics, with one (centroparietal positivity; CPP) appearing to compute the running integral and continuously feed it to the other (motor beta lateralisation; MBL). However, it remains unknown whether and how these signals serve more distinct functional roles in more complex scenarios where information arrives discontinuously and requires more computational steps to form appropriate belief updates. We employed a volatile expanded judgement task that permits dissociation of the encoding of raw sensory information in each of a series of discrete stimuli ('objective evidence'), the appropriately transformed belief updates from that information ('effective evidence'), and the evolving belief itself (accumulated evidence). Whereas MBL traced the evolving belief across stimuli, the CPP was found only to locally encode the effective evidence associated with each individual stimulus. Furthermore, fluctuations in CPP amplitude after each single stimulus could account for variability in the encoding of accumulated evidence in MBL. These results suggest a flexible computational hierarchy in which effective evidence can be computed sample-by-sample at an intermediate processing level to drive downstream belief updates for protracted decisions about discrete stimuli.

">Precision fMRI reveals that the language network exhibits adult-like left-hemispheric lateralization by 4 years of age</a></h4>

              
                Left hemisphere damage in adulthood often leads to linguistic deficits, but many cases of early damage leave linguistic processing preserved, and a functional language system can develop in the right hemisphere. To explain this early apparent equipotentiality of the two hemispheres for language, some have proposed that the language system is bilateral during early development and only becomes left-lateralized with age. We examined language lateralization using functional magnetic resonance imaging with two large pediatric cohorts (total n=273 children ages 4-16; n=107 adults). Strong, adult-level left-hemispheric lateralization (in activation volume and response magnitude) was evident by age 4. Thus, although the right hemisphere can take over language function in some cases of early brain damage, and although some features of the language system do show protracted development (magnitude of language response and strength of inter-regional correlations in the language network), the left-hemisphere bias for language is robustly present by 4 years of age.

">eIF2α phosphorylation evokes dystonia-like movements with D2-receptor and cholinergic origin and abnormal neuronal connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Dystonia is the 3rd most common movement disorder. Dystonia is acquired through either injury or genetic mutations, with poorly understood molecular and cellular mechanisms. Eukaryotic initiation factor alpha (eIF2) controls cell state including neuronal plasticity via protein translation control and expression of ATF4. Dysregulated eIF2 phosphorylation (eIF2-P) occurs in dystonia patients and models including DYT1, but the consequences are unknown. We increased/decreased eIF2-P and tested motor control and neuronal properties in a Drosophila model. Bidirectionally altering eIF2-P produced dystonia-like abnormal posturing and dyskinetic movements in flies. These movements were also observed with expression of the DYT1 risk allele. We identified cholinergic and D2-receptor neuroanatomical origins of these dyskinetic movements caused by genetic manipulations to dystonia molecular candidates eIF2-P, ATF4, or DYT1, with evidence for decreased cholinergic release. In vivo, increased and decreased eIF2-P increase synaptic connectivity at the NMJ with increased terminal size and bouton synaptic release sites. Long-term treatment of elevated eIF2-P with ISRIB restored adult longevity, but not performance in a motor assay. Disrupted eIF2-P signaling may alter neuronal connectivity, change synaptic release, and drive motor circuit changes in dystonia.

">Efficient Federated Learning for distributed NeuroImaging Data</a></h4>

              
                Recent advancements in neuroimaging have led to greater data sharing among the scientific community. However, institutions frequently maintain control over their data, citing concerns related to research culture, privacy, and accountability. This creates a demand for innovative tools capable of analyzing amalgamated datasets without the need to transfer actual data between entities. To address this challenge, we propose a decentralized sparse federated learning (FL) strategy. This approach emphasizes local training of sparse models to facilitate efficient communication within such frameworks. By capitalizing on model sparsity and selectively sharing parameters between client sites during the training phase, our method significantly lowers communication overheads. This advantage becomes increasingly pronounced when dealing with larger models and accommodating the diverse resource capabilities of various sites. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through the application to the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset.

To decide how to move, the brain must determine which navigational actions are afforded by the current environment. Here, we demonstrate that human visual cortex represents navigational action affordances of complex natural scenes. Behavioral annotations of possible navigational actions (e.g., walking, cycling) show that humans group environments into distinct affordance clusters using at least three separate dimensions. Representational similarity analysis of multi-voxel fMRI responses in scene-selective visual cortex regions shows that perceived affordances are represented in a manner that is only partly explained by other scene properties (e.g. contained objects), and independent of the task performed in the scanner. Visual features extracted from deep neural networks (DNNs) pretrained on a range of other visual understanding tasks fail to fully account for behavioral and neural representations of affordances. While DNN predictions of human-perceived affordances improve when training directly on affordance labels, the best human-model alignment is observed when visual DNN features are paired with rich linguistic representation in a multi-modal large-language model. These results uncover a new type of representation in the human brain that reflect action affordances independent from other scene properties.

">Synchronization of the prefrontal cortex with the hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex is navigation strategy-dependent during spatial learning</a></h4>

              
                During goal-directed spatial learning, subjects progressively change their navigation strategies to increase their navigation efficiency, an operation supported by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, how the mPFC may integrate relevant information in a wider memory networks involving the hippocampus (HPC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is poorly understood. We recorded local-field potential and neuronal firing simultaneously from the mPFC, HPC and PPC in mice subjected to spatial memory acquisition in the Barnes maze. During navigation trials, animals demonstrated two consecutive behavioral stages: searching and exploration. Throughout training, mice gradually switched from less efficient (non-spatial) to more efficient (spatial) goal-oriented strategies exclusively during the searching stage. 4-Hz and theta (6-12 Hz) oscillations were detected during spatial navigation in the three recorded areas associated with episodes of immobility and locomotion, respectively. The entrainment of prefrontal gamma oscillations (60-100 Hz) by hippocampal and parietal 4-Hz and theta oscillations, as well as the incidence of prefrontal gamma, was higher when mice implemented spatial strategies during the searching stage. Interestingly, 4-Hz and theta from HPC and PPC also synchronized the spike-timing of prefrontal neurons, which was maximum during spatial strategies in the searching stage. Finally, neurons recorded in the mPFC increased their task stage firing selectivity when they used spatial strategy. Altogether, these results provide evidence for the neural mechanisms underlying the prefrontal large-scale coordination with distributed neural networks during spatial learning.

">Genetic screening and metabolomics identify glial adenosine metabolism as a therapeutic target in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and lacks disease-modifying therapies. We developed a Drosophila model for identifying novel glial-based therapeutic targets for PD. Human alpha-synuclein is expressed in neurons and individual genes are independently knocked down in glia. We performed a forward genetic screen, knocking down the entire Drosophila kinome in glia in alpha-synuclein expressing flies. Among the top hits were five genes (Ak1, Ak6, Adk1, Adk2, and awd) involved in adenosine metabolism. Knockdown of each gene improved locomotor dysfunction, rescued neurodegeneration, and increased brain adenosine levels. We determined that the mechanism of neuroprotection involves adenosine itself, as opposed to a downstream metabolite. We dove deeper into the mechanism for one gene, Ak1, finding rescue of dopaminergic neuron loss, alpha-synuclein aggregation, and bioenergetic dysfunction after glial Ak1 knockdown. We performed metabolomics in Drosophila and in human PD patients, allowing us to comprehensively characterize changes in purine metabolism and identify potential biomarkers of dysfunctional adenosine metabolism in people. These experiments support glial adenosine as a novel therapeutic target in PD.

">Meta-Reinforcement Learning reconciles surprise, value and control in the anterior cingulate cortex.</a></h4>

              
                The role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in cognition is a frequently studied yet highly debated topic in neuroscience. Most authors agree that the dACC is involved in either cognitive control (e.g. voluntary inhibition of automatic responses) or monitoring (e.g. comparing expectations with outcomes, detecting errors, tracking surprise). A consensus on which theoretical perspective best explains dACC contribution to behaviour is still lacking. In a recent neuroimaging study, the experimental predictions of two prominent models formalizing the cognitive control hypothesis (Expected Value of Control, EVC) and the monitoring hypothesis (Predicted Response Outcome, PRO) have been tested using a behavioural task involving both monitoring and cognitive control mechanisms. The results indicated that of the two tested models, only the PRO model effectively predicted the dACC activity, indicating surprise tracking for performance monitoring as the key sole underlying mechanism, even when cognitive control was required by the task at hand. These findings challenged the long-standing and established cognitive control hypothesis of dACC function and opened a theory crisis: the proposed surprise-monitoring hypothesis indeed cannot account for a wide array of previous experimental findings evidencing dACC activation in tasks requiring cognitive control without involving monitoring or surprise. Here we propose a novel hypothesis on dACC function that integrates both the monitoring and the cognitive control perspective in a unifying coherent framework, based on meta-Reinforcement Learning. Our model, the Reinforcement Meta Learner (RML), optimizes cognitive control - as in control models like EVC- by meta-learning based on tracking surprise - as in monitoring models like PRO. We tested RML experimental predictions with the same behavioural task used to compare the PRO and EVC models, and showed that RML predictions on dACC activity matched PRO predictions and outperformed EVC predictions. However, crucially, the RML simultaneously accounts for both cognitive control and monitoring functions, resolving the theoretical impasse about dACC function within an integrative framework. In sum, our results suggest that dACC function can be framed as a meta-learning optimiser of cognitive control, providing an integrative perspective on its roles in cognitive control, surprise tracking, and performance monitoring.

">Activation of the proteasome 20S Core particle prevents neuronal death induced by oxygen- and glucose deprivation in cultured neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal damage in brain ischemia is characterized by a disassembly of the proteasome and a decrease in its activity. However, to what extent these alterations are coupled to neuronal death is controversial since proteasome inhibitors were shown to provide protection in different models of stroke in rodents. This question was addressed in the present work using cultured cerebrocortical neurons subjected to transient oxygen- and glucose-deprivation (OGD). Under the latter conditions there was a time-dependent loss in the proteasome activity, determined by cleavage of the Suc-LLVY-AMC fluorogenic substrate, and the disassembly of the proteasome, as assessed by native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by western blot against Psma2 and Rpt6, which are components of the catalytic core and regulatory particle, respectively. Immunocytochemistry experiments against the two proteins also showed differential effects on their dendritic distribution. OGD also downregulated the protein levels of Rpt3 and Rpt10, two components of the regulatory particle, by a mechanism dependent on the activity of NMDA receptors and mediated by calpains. Activation of the proteasome activity, using an inhibitor USP14, a deubiquitinase enzyme, inhibited OGD-induced cell death, and decreased calpain activity as determined by analysis of spectrin cleavage. Similar results were obtained in the presence of two oleic amide derivatives (B12 and D3) which directly activate the 20S proteasome. Together, these results shown that calpain activation prevents neuronal death in cortical neurons subjected to OGD, suggesting that inhibition of the proteasome is a mediator of neuronal death in brain ischemia.

">Excitoprotective effects of conditional tau reduction in excitatory neurons and in adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Tau reduction is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. In numerous models, tau reduction via genetic knockout is beneficial, at least in part due to protection against hyperexcitability and seizures, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we describe the generation and initial study of a new conditional Tauflox model to address these mechanisms. Given the protective effects of tau reduction against hyperexcitability, we compared the effects of selective tau reduction in excitatory or inhibitory neurons. Tau reduction in excitatory neurons mimicked the protective effects of global tau reduction, while tau reduction in inhibitory neurons had the opposite effect and increased seizure susceptibility. Since most prior studies used knockout mice lacking tau throughout development, we crossed Tauflox mice with inducible Cre mice and found beneficial effects of tau reduction in adulthood. Our findings support the effectiveness of tau reduction in adulthood and indicate that excitatory neurons may be a key site for its excitoprotective effects.

">Surround Suppression of Broadband Images</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception is profoundly sensitive to context. Surround suppression is a well-known visual context effect in which the firing rate of a neuron is suppressed by stimulation of its extra-classical receptive field. The majority of contrast surround suppression studies exclusively use narrowband, sinusoidal grating stimuli; however, it is unclear whether the results produced by such artificial stimuli generalize to real-world, naturalistic visual experiences. To address this issue, we developed a contrast discrimination paradigm that includes both naturalistic broadband textures and narrowband grating textures. All textures were matched for first order image statistics and overall perceptual salience. We observed surround suppression across broadband textures (F(1,6)=19.01, p=.005); however, effect sizes were largest for narrowband, sinusoidal gratings (Cohen's d=1.83). Among the three broadband texture types, we observed strongest suppression for the texture with a clear dominant orientation (stratified: Cohen's d=1.29), while the textures with a more even distribution of orientation information produced weaker suppression (fibrous: Cohen's d=0.63; braided: Cohen's d=0.65). We also observed an effect of texture identity on the slope of psychometric functions (F(1.98,11.9)=7.29, p=0.01), primarily driven by smaller slopes for the texture with the most uniform distribution of orientations. Our results suggest that well-known contextual modulation effects only partially generalize to more ecologically valid stimuli.

">Reducing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) increases body weight and blood glucose levels while decreasing physical activity in female mice.</a></h4>

              
                Glucose-inhibited (GI) neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) depend on neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) for activation in low glucose. The Lopez laboratory has shown that the effects of estrogen on brown fat thermogenesis and white fat browning require inhibition of VMH AMPK. This effect of estrogen was mediated by downstream lateral hypothalamus (LH) orexin neurons (1,2). We previously showed that estrogen inhibits activation of GI neurons in low glucose by inhibiting AMPK (3). Thus, we hypothesized that VMH AMPK- and nNOS-dependent GI neurons project to and inhibit orexin neurons. Estrogen inhibition of AMPK in GI neurons would then disinhibit orexin neurons and stimulate brown fat thermogenesis and white fat browning, leading to decreased body weight. To test this hypothesis, we reduced VMH nNOS expression using nNOS shRNA in female mice and measured body weight, adiposity, body temperature, white and brown fat uncoupling protein (UCP1; an index of thermogenesis and browning), locomotor activity, and blood glucose levels. Surprisingly, we saw no effect of reduced VMH nNOS expression on body temperature or UCP1. Instead, body weight and adiposity increased by 30% over 2 weeks post injection of nNOS shRNA. This was associated with increased blood glucose levels and decreased locomotor activity. We also found that VMH nNOS-GI neurons project to the LH. However, stimulation of VMH-LH projections increased excitatory glutamate input onto orexin neurons. Thus, our data do not support our original hypothesis. Excitation of orexin neurons has previously been shown to increase physical activity, leading to decreased blood glucose and body weight (4). We now hypothesize that VMH nNOS-GI neurons play a role in this latter function of orexin neurons.

">Transition to chaos separates learning regimes and relates to measure of consciousness in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent neural networks exhibit chaotic dynamics when the variance in their connection strengths exceed a critical value. Recent work indicates connection variance also modulates learning strategies; networks learn "rich" representations when initialized with low coupling and "lazier" solutions with larger variance. Using Watts-Strogatz networks of varying sparsity, structure, and hidden weight variance, we find that the critical coupling strength dividing chaotic from ordered dynamics also differentiates rich and lazy learning strategies. Training moves both stable and chaotic networks closer to the edge of chaos, with networks learning richer representations before the transition to chaos. In contrast, biologically realistic connectivity structures foster stability over a wide range of variances. The transition to chaos is also reflected in a measure that clinically discriminates levels of consciousness, the perturbational complexity index (PCIst). Networks with high values of PCIst exhibit stable dynamics and rich learning, suggesting a consciousness prior may promote rich learning. The results suggest a clear relationship between critical dynamics, learning regimes and complexity-based measures of consciousness.

">POSTERIOR-SUPERIOR INSULA REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION REDUCES EXPERIMENTAL TONIC PAIN AND PAIN-RELATED CORTICAL INHIBITION IN HUMANS</a></h4>

              
                High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the posterosuperior insula (PSI) may produce analgesic effects. However, the neuroplastic changes behind PSI-rTMS analgesia remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to determine whether tonic capsaicin-induced pain and cortical inhibition (indexed using TMS-electroencephalography) are modulated by PSI-rTMS. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 females) attended two sessions randomized to active or sham rTMS. Experimental pain was induced by capsaicin administered to the forearm for 90 minutes, with pain ratings collected every 5 minutes. Left PSI-rTMS was delivered (10Hz, 100 pulses per train, 15 trains) ~50 minutes post-capsaicin administration. TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and thermal sensitivity were assessed at baseline, during capsaicin pain prior to rTMS and after rTMS. Bayesian evidence of reduced pain scores and increased heat pain thresholds were found following active rTMS, with no changes occurring after sham rTMS. Pain (prior to active rTMS) led to an increase in the frontal negative peak ~45 ms (N45) TEP relative to baseline. Following active rTMS, there was a decrease in the N45 peak back to baseline levels. In contrast, following sham rTMS, the N45 peak was increased relative to baseline. We also found that the reduction in pain NRS scores following active vs. sham rTMS was partially mediated by decreases in the N45 peak. These findings provide evidence of the analgesic effects of PSI-rTMS and suggest that the TEP N45 peak is a potential marker and mediator of both pain and analgesia.

">Unexpected events modulate context signaling in VIP and excitatory cells of the visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The visual cortex plays a significant role in constructing internal models that predict incoming sensory experiences. Unexpected stimuli that violate those predictions play an important role in how neural circuits learn these internal models. The cortical inhibitory network, particularly VIP cells, is hypothesized to act as a key player in representing unexpected stimuli due to its unique anatomical connectivity motifs; however, the exact information carried by VIP neurons during unexpected events remains unclear: to what extent does VIP activity reflect stimulus-specific prediction violations vs. broad context information such as shared network dynamics that may arise from the animal's internal representations or external cues signals? To address this question, we analyzed a dataset of cell-type specific, multi-area, two-photon calcium imaging during a behavioral task collected by the Allen Institute. Mice viewed repeated familiar images, as well as unexpected omissions of such images. Using dimensionality reduction, we extracted the contribution of context to the activity of individual neurons, defined as the shared neuronal activity across brain areas that is not driven by images or omissions. We demonstrate that during omissions the activity of VIP neurons in V1 and higher visual area LM is highly influenced by context, particularly in superficial layers. Excitatory neurons across all recorded layers and areas switched from weakly modulation by context during expected images to being largely modulated by context during unexpected omission. Our results suggest that during expected images context information is suppressed to allow for external stimuli to drive neuronal activity. Conversely, during unexpected omissions, VIP neurons function as non-specific error encoders, driving cortical networks to attend to context.

">Investigating tissue microstructure using steady-state diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion MRI is a leading method to non-invasively characterise brain tissue microstructure across multiple domains and scales. Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) is an established imaging sequence for post-mortem MRI, addressing the challenging imaging environment of fixed tissue with short T2 and low diffusivities. However, a current limitation of DW-SSFP is signal interpretation: it is not clear what diffusion 'regime' the sequence probes and therefore its potential to characterise tissue microstructure. Building on a model of Extended Phase Graphs (EPG), I establish two alternative representations of the DW-SSFP signal in terms of (1) conventional b-values (time-independent diffusion) and (2) encoding power-spectra (time-dependent diffusion). The proposed representations provide insights into how different parameter regimes and gradient waveforms impact the diffusion properties of DW-SSFP. Using these representations, I introduce an approach to incorporate existing diffusion models into DW-SSFP without the requirement of extensive derivations. Investigations incorporating free-diffusion and tissue-relevant microscopic restrictions (cylinder of varying radius) give excellent agreement to complementary analytical models and Monte Carlo simulations. Experimentally, the time-independent representation is used to derive Tensor and proof of principle NODDI estimates in a whole human post-mortem brain. A final SNR-efficiency investigation demonstrates the theoretical potential of DW-SSFP for ultra-high field microstructural imaging.

">Abscisic Acid rescues behavior in adult female mice in Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity model of dopamine depletion by regulating microglia and vesicular GABA transporter</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. While genetic studies have highlighted catecholamine dysfunction, emerging epidemiological evidence suggest neuroinflammation as a significant trigger. However, understanding the relative contributions of these alterations to ADHD symptomatology remains elusive. Method: This study employed 93 female Swiss mice of the ADHD dopamine deficit model. Dopaminergic lesions were induced via 6-hydroxidopamine (6-OHDA) injection on postnatal day 5. The impact of these lesions during development was examined by comparing young and adult mice (at postnatal day 21 and 90, respectively). We sought to mitigate adult symptoms through abscisic acid (ABA) administration during two-months. Postmortem analyses encompassed the evaluation of neuroinflammation (microglia morphology, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, cytokine expression) and excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio in specific brain regions. Results: Neonatal dopaminergic lesions elicited hyperactivity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity increased social interaction in both one-month and three-month females and induced impaired memory in three-month mice. ABA exposure significantly ameliorated hyperactivity, impulsivity, anxiety, hypersensitivity, and social interaction alterations, but not cognitive impairment. In the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of one-month mice dopamine-deficit elevated IL-1{beta} and TNF-alpha; expression and reduced Arg1 mRNA levels, along with E/I imbalance. ABA intervention restored microglia morphology, IL-1beta, Arg1 expression and enhanced vGAT levels. Conclusions: This study strongly suggest that dopamine deficit induced alteration of microglia and E/I ratio underling distinct ADHD symptoms. Reinstating healthy microglia by anti-inflammatory agents in specific areas emerges as a promising strategy for managing ADHD

">Functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Prolonged Motor Activation using Conventional and Spectral GLM Analyses</a></h4>

              
                Background: Functional MRS (fMRS) is a technique used to measure metabolic changes in response to increased neuronal activity, providing unique insights into neurotransmitter dynamics and neuroenergetics. In this study we investigate the response of lactate and glutamate levels in the motor cortex during a sustained motor task using conventional spectral fitting and explore the use of a novel analysis approach based on the application of linear modelling directly to the spectro-temporal fMRS data. Methods: fMRS data were acquired at a field strength of 3 Tesla from 23 healthy participants using a short echo-time (28ms) semi-LASER sequence. The functional task involved rhythmic hand clenching over a duration of 8 minutes and standard MRS preprocessing steps, including frequency and phase alignment, were employed. Both conventional spectral fitting and direct linear modelling were applied, and results from participant-averaged spectra and metabolite-averaged individual analyses were compared. Results: We observed a 20% increase in lactate in response to the motor task, consistent with findings at higher magnetic field strengths. However, statistical testing showed some variability between the two averaging schemes and fitting algorithms. While lactate changes were supported by the direct spectral modelling approach, smaller increases in glutamate (2%) were inconsistent. Exploratory spectral modelling identified a 4% decrease in aspartate, aligning with conventional fitting and observations from prolonged visual stimulation. Conclusion: We demonstrate that lactate dynamics in response to a prolonged motor task are observed using short-echo time semi-LASER at 3 Tesla, and that direct linear modelling of fMRS data is a useful complement to conventional analysis. Future work includes mitigating spectral confounds, such as scalp lipid contamination and lineshape drift, and further validation of our novel direct linear modelling approach through experimental and simulated datasets.

">An anesthetized rat assay for evaluating the effects of organophosphate-based compounds and countermeasures on intracranial EEG and respiratory rate.</a></h4>

              
                The development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) against organophosphate (OP) induced poisoning is of substantial importance. Use of conventional therapeutics is complicated by off-target effects and restricted penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, a concerted effort is underway to discover improved acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivators, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonists, and other countermeasures with broader spectrum activity and enhanced CNS efficacy. We recently developed a rat brain slice assay to assess the efficacy of AChE reactivators and mAChR antagonists against the acute effects of the organophosphorus AChE inhibitor 4-nitrophenyl isopropyl methylphosphonate (NIMP) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Here we introduce a complimentary anesthetized animal model to evaluate the same compounds in vivo with concurrent monitoring of EEG and respiratory rate. We find that intravenous delivery of 0.5 mg/kg NIMP reliably produces seizure like activity in the BLA, with concurrent respiratory depression and eventual respiratory failure. The central effects of AChE reactivators and mAChR antagonists delivered intravenously are consistent with their expected ability to cross the BBB. Combining our previously described in vitro assay with the methods described here provides a relatively comprehensive set of preclinical tools for evaluating the efficacy of novel MCMs. Notably, using these methods potentially obviates subjecting conscious animals to cholinergic crises, which aligns with the AAALAC's 3Rs principle of refinement.

">Benefits of spaced learning are predicted by re-encoding of past experience in ventromedial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                More than a century of research shows that spaced learning improves long-term memory. Yet, there remains debate concerning why. A major limitation to resolving theoretical debates is the lack of evidence for how neural representations change as a function of spacing. Here, leveraging a massive-scale 7T human fMRI dataset, we tracked neural representations and behavioral expressions of memory as participants viewed thousands of natural scene images that repeated at lags ranging from seconds to many months. We show that spaced learning increases the similarity of human ventromedial prefrontal cortex representations across stimulus encounters and, critically, these increases parallel and predict the behavioral benefits of spacing. Additionally, we show that these spacing benefits critically depend on remembering and, in turn, 're-encoding' past experience. Collectively, our findings provide fundamental insight into how spaced learning influences neural representations and why spacing is beneficial.

">Test Retest Reliability of Meta Analytic Networks During Naturalistic Viewing</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity analyses have given considerable insights into human brain function and organization. As research moves towards clinical application, test-retest reliability has become a main focus of the field. So far, the majority of studies have relied on resting-state paradigms to examine brain connectivity, based on its low demand and ease of implementation. However, the reliability of resting-state measures is mostly moderate, potentially due to its unconstrained nature. Recently, naturalistic viewing paradigms have gained popularity because they probe the human brain under more ecologically valid conditions, thereby possibly increasing reliability. Therefore, we here compared the reliability of graph metrics extracted from resting-state and naturalistic viewing in functional networks, across two sessions. We show that naturalistic viewing can increase reliability over resting-state, but that its effect varies between stimuli and networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of naturalistic viewing differs between two cohorts with Asian and European cultural backgrounds. Taken together, our study encourages the use of naturalistic viewing to increase reliability, but emphasizes the need to carefully select the appropriate stimulus and network for the respective research question.

                Research on interoception has revealed the role of heartbeats in shaping our perceptual awareness and embodying a first-person perspective. These heartbeat dynamics exhibit distinct responses to various types of affective touch. We advanced that those dynamics are directly associated to the brain activity that allow self-other distinction. In our study encompassing self and social affective touch, we employed a method to quantify the distinct couplings of temporal patterns in cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activities with brain connectivity. Our findings revealed that social touch led to an increase in the coupling between specific brain networks and parasympathetic/vagal activity, particularly in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Conversely, as social touch progressed, we observed a decrease in the coupling between brain networks and sympathetic dynamics across a broad frequency range. These results show how heartbeat dynamics are intertwined with brain organization and provide fresh evidence on the neurophysiological mechanisms of affective touch.

Our MEA-seqX platform, integrating high-density microelectrode arrays, spatial transcriptomics, optical imaging, and advanced computational strategies, enables the simultaneous recording and analysis of molecular and electrical network activities at the level of individual cells. Applied to a mouse hippocampal model of experience-dependent plasticity, MEA-seqX unveiled massively enhanced nested dynamics between transcription and function. Graph-theoretic analysis revealed an increase in densely connected bimodal hubs, marking the first observation of coordinated spatiotemporal dynamics in hippocampal circuitry at both molecular and functional levels. This platform also identified different cell types based on their distinct bimodal profiles. Machine-learning algorithms accurately predicted network-wide electrophysiological features from spatial gene expression, demonstrating a previously inaccessible convergence across modalities, time, and scales.

">Rapid modulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons and dopamine release by satellite astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are increasingly thought to have underestimated and important roles in modulating neuronal circuits. Astrocytes in striatum can regulate dopamine transmission by governing the extracellular tone of axonal neuromodulators, including GABA and adenosine. However, here we reveal that striatal astrocytes occupy a cell type-specific anatomical and functional relationship with cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), through which they rapidly excite ChIs and govern dopamine release via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on subsecond timescales. We identify that ChI somata are in unexpectedly close proximity to astrocyte somata, in mouse and human, forming a soma-to-soma satellite-like configuration not typically observed for other striatal neurons. Transient depolarization of astrocytes in mouse striatum reversibly regulated ChI excitability by decreasing extracellular calcium. These findings reveal a privileged satellite astrocyte-interneuron interaction for striatal ChIs operating on subsecond timescales via regulation of extracellular calcium dynamics to shape downstream striatal circuit activity and dopamine signaling.

">Concurrent predictive and prospective strategies in a simple visuomotor task</a></h4>

              
                Interception, a fundamental visuomotor skill for activities such as driving and sports, involves two main strategies: predictive, anticipating the target's trajectory, and prospective, actively tracking and adjusting movement. Experimentally controlled factors could potentially influence the relative usage of these strategies. We designed a visuomotor task to probe the relationship between target predictability and interception strategies. We manipulated stimulus predictability through controlled adjustments of external forces, altering the target's trajectory. We also manipulated the availability of perceptual information by introducing spatial occlusion at specific parts of the visual field. Our observations indicate that decreased target variability promoted predictive interception, whereas increased variability prompted a shift toward prospective strategies. Notably, hand-catching trajectories exhibited increased curvature in response to changes in target variability, whereas eye trajectories displayed a relatively consistent curvature across trials. Similarly, heightened target variability resulted in delayed onset of hand movements while showing no discernible alterations in the onset of eye movements. Thus, gaze position was a poor predictor of hand position, highlighting distinct adaptive patterns for hand and eye movements in response to task unpredictability. Finally, participants exhibited consistent interception strategies within and across sessions, highlighting their differences and preferences for predictive or prospective strategies. These results reveal a dynamic interplay between target predictability and interception, suggesting a flexible combination of both approaches. Examining how humans integrate sensory information, plan, and execute movements provides a unique opportunity to characterize predictive and prospective interception strategies in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

">Differential effects of aging and epilepsy in discriminating and reactivating memories</a></h4>

              
                Pattern separation and pattern completion are distinct neurocognitive processes involved in encoding and retrieval of memories. However, there is currently no robust behavioural task in humans to measure both processes within the same paradigm. We describe the Memory Pinhole task, a novel paradigm which offers a distinct measure of each process, applied to healthy young, healthy older and people with epilepsy. Both pattern separation and pattern completion are observed in healthy younger individuals. A pattern completion deficit is seen in people with epilepsy, while the healthy older cohort show a deficit in pattern separation. To understand the neural mechanisms, we simulated human performance using an auto-associative neural network. Modelling indicated that disruption in different neuronal populations could explain the distinct memory profiles observed in ageing and epilepsy. These results demonstrate that pattern separation and pattern completion are distinct processes that can be measured from a single behavioural task and are differentially affected by ageing and epilepsy.

">Sensorimotor faculties bias perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making is a deliberate process that seemingly evolves under our own volition. Yet, research on embodied cognition has demonstrated that higher-order cognitive processes may be influenced, in unexpected ways, by properties of motor and sensory and systems. Here we tested whether and how simple decisions are influenced by handedness and by asymmetries in the auditory system. Right- and left- handed participants perform an auditory decision task. In the task, subjects decided whether they heard more click sounds in the right ear or in the left ear, and pressed a key with either their right or left index finger, according to an instructed stimulus-key assignment (congruent or reversed). On some trials, there was no stimulus and subjects could choose either of the responses freely. When subjects chose freely, their choices were substantially governed by their handedness: Left-handed subjects were significantly biased to make the leftward choice, whereas right-handed subjects showed a substantial rightward bias. When the choice was governed by the sensory stimulus, subjects showed a rightward choice bias under the congruent key assignment, but this effect reversed to a leftward choice bias under the reversed key assignment. This result indicates a bias towards deciding that there were more clicks presented to the right ear. Together, our findings demonstrate that human choices can be considerably influenced by properties of motor and sensory systems.

	<p>Background: Applying deep brain stimulation (DBS) to several brain regions has been investigated in attempts to treat highly treatment-resistant depression, with variable results. Our initial pilot data suggested that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) could be a promising therapeutic target. Objective: The aim of this study was to gather blinded data exploring the efficacy of applying DBS to the BNST in patients with highly refractory depression. Method: Eight patients with chronic severe treatment-resistant depression underwent DBS to the BNST. A randomised, double-blind crossover study design with fixed stimulation parameters was followed and followed by a period of open-label stimulation. Results: During the double-blind crossover phase, no consistent antidepressant effects were seen with any of the four stimulation parameters applied, and no patients achieved response or remission criteria during the blinded crossover phase or during a subsequent period of three months of blinded stimulation. Stimulation-related side effects, especially agitation, were reported by a number of patients and were reversible with adjustment of the stimulation parameters. Conclusions: The results of this study do not support the application of DBS to the BNST in patients with highly resistant depression or ongoing research utilising stimulation at this brain site. The blocked randomised study design utilising fixed stimulation parameters was poorly tolerated by the participants and does not appear suitable for assessing the efficacy of DBS at this location.</p>

	<p>The sensorimotor gating is a nervous system function that modulates the acoustic startle response (ASR). Prepulse inhibition (PPI) phenomenon is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, defined as the reduction of ASR when a high intensity sound (pulse) is preceded in milliseconds by a weaker stimulus (prepulse). Brainstem nuclei are associated with the mediation of ASR and PPI, whereas cortical and subcortical regions are associated with their modulation. However, it is still unclear how the modulatory units can influence PPI. In the present work, we developed a computational model of a neural circuit involved in the mediation (brainstem units) and modulation (cortical and subcortical units) of ASR and PPI. The activities of all units were modeled by the leaky-integrator formalism for neural population. The model reproduces basic features of PPI observed in experiments, such as the effects of changes in interstimulus interval, prepulse intensity, and habituation of ASR. The simulation of GABAergic and dopaminergic drugs impaired PPI by their effects over subcortical units activity. The results show that subcortical units constitute a central hub for PPI modulation. The presented computational model offers a valuable tool to investigate the neurobiology associated with disorder-related impairments in PPI.</p>

	<p>Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are a cornerstone data analysis strategy in behavioral research because of their robustness in handling non-normally distributed variables. Recently, their integration with ordered beta regression (OBR), a novel statistical tool for managing percentage data, has opened new avenues for analyzing continuous response data. Here, we applied this combined approach to investigate nuanced differences between the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and their C57BL/6 non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging in a 5-day Morris Water Maze (MWM) test protocol. Our longitudinal study included 22 3xTg-AD mice and 15 NTg mice (both male and female) assessed at 12 and 16 months of age. By identifying and analyzing multiple swimming strategies during three different paradigms (cue, place task, and removal), we uncovered genotypic differences in all paradigms. Thus, the NTg group exhibited a higher percentage of direct search behaviors, while an association between circling episodes and 3xTg-AD animals was found. Furthermore, we also propose a novel metric&amp;amp;mdash;the &amp;amp;ldquo;Cognitive Flexibility Index&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;which proved sensitive in detecting sex-related differences. Overall, our integrated GLMMs-OBR approach provides a comprehensive insight into mouse behavior in the MWM test, shedding light on the effects of aging and AD pathology.</p>

	<p>We assessed the aesthetic experience of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) to understand their ability to experience feelings of the sublime and to be moved when viewing paintings. We exposed patients with bvFTD and control participants to concrete and abstract paintings and asked them how moved they were by these paintings and whether the latter were beautiful or ugly. Patients with bvFTD declared being less moved than control participants by both abstract and concrete paintings. No significant differences were observed between abstract and concrete paintings in both patients with bvFTD and control participants. Patients with bvFTD provided fewer &amp;amp;ldquo;beautiful&amp;amp;rdquo; and more &amp;amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;amp;rdquo; responses than controls for both abstract and concrete paintings. No significant differences in terms of &amp;amp;ldquo;beautiful&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;amp;rdquo; responses were observed between abstract and concrete paintings in both patients with bvFTD and control participants. These findings suggest disturbances in the basic affective experience of patients with bvFTD when they are exposed to paintings, as well as a bias in their ability to judge the aesthetic quality of paintings.</p>

	<p>In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to differentiate between four distinct subject-driven cognitive states: resting state, narrative memory, music, and subtraction tasks. EEG data were collected from seven healthy male participants while performing these cognitive tasks, and the raw EEG signals were transformed into time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency maps using continuous wavelet transform. Based on these time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency maps, we developed a convolutional neural network model (TF-CNN-CFA) with a channel and frequency attention mechanism to automatically distinguish between these cognitive states. The experimental results demonstrated that the model achieved an average classification accuracy of 76.14% in identifying these four cognitive states, significantly outperforming traditional EEG signal processing methods and other classical image classification algorithms. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of varying lengths of EEG signals on classification performance and found that TF-CNN-CFA demonstrates consistent performance across different window lengths, indicating its strong generalization capability. This study validates the ability of EEG to differentiate higher cognitive states, which could potentially offer a novel BCI paradigm.</p>

	<p>This study explores the multifaceted influence of litter size, maternal care, exercise, and aging on rats&amp;amp;rsquo; neurobehavioral plasticity and dentate gyrus microglia dynamics. Body weight evolution revealed a progressive increase until maturity, followed by a decline during aging, with larger litters exhibiting lower weights initially. Notably, exercised rats from smaller litters displayed higher body weights during the mature and aged stages. The dentate gyrus volumes showed no significant differences among groups, except for aged sedentary rats from smaller litters, which exhibited a reduction. Maternal care varied significantly based on litter size, with large litter dams showing lower frequencies of caregiving behaviors. Behavioral assays highlighted the detrimental impact of a sedentary lifestyle and reduced maternal care/large litters on spatial memory, mitigated by exercise in aged rats from smaller litters. The microglial dynamics in the layers of dentate gyrus revealed age-related changes modulated by litter size and exercise. Exercise interventions mitigated microgliosis associated with aging, particularly in aged rats. These findings underscore the complex interplay between early-life experiences, exercise, microglial dynamics, and neurobehavioral outcomes during aging.</p>

                <p>by Feng Jiao, Jing Li, Ting Liu, Yifeng Zhu, Wenhao Che, Leonidas Bleris, Chen Jia</p>

In experiments, the distributions of mRNA or protein numbers in single cells are often fitted to the random telegraph model which includes synthesis and decay of mRNA or protein, and switching of the gene between active and inactive states. While commonly used, this model does not describe how fluctuations are influenced by crucial biological mechanisms such as feedback regulation, non-exponential gene inactivation durations, and multiple gene activation pathways. Here we investigate the dynamical properties of four relatively complex gene expression models by fitting their steady-state mRNA or protein number distributions to the simple telegraph model. We show that despite the underlying complex biological mechanisms, the telegraph model with three effective parameters can accurately capture the steady-state gene product distributions, as well as the conditional distributions in the active gene state, of the complex models. Some effective parameters are reliable and can reflect realistic dynamic behaviors of the complex models, while others may deviate significantly from their real values in the complex models. The effective parameters can also be applied to characterize the capability for a complex model to exhibit multimodality. Using additional information such as single-cell data at multiple time points, we provide an effective method of distinguishing the complex models from the telegraph model. Furthermore, using measurements under varying experimental conditions, we show that fitting the mRNA or protein number distributions to the telegraph model may even reveal the underlying gene regulation mechanisms of the complex models. The effectiveness of these methods is confirmed by analysis of single-cell data for <i>E. coli</i> and mammalian cells. All these results are robust with respect to cooperative transcriptional regulation and extrinsic noise. In particular, we find that faster relaxation speed to the steady state results in more precise parameter inference under large extrinsic noise.

                <p>by Albert Albesa-González, Claudia Clopath</p>

Filopodia are thin synaptic protrusions that have been long known to play an important role in early development. It has recently been found that they are more abundant in the adult cortex than previously thought, and more plastic than spines (button-shaped mature synapses). Inspired by these findings, we introduce a new model of synaptic plasticity that jointly describes learning of filopodia and spines. The model assumes that filopodia exhibit strongly competitive learning dynamics -similarly to additive spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). At the same time it proposes that, if filopodia undergo sufficient potentiation, they consolidate into spines. Spines follow weakly competitive learning, classically associated with multiplicative, soft-bounded models of STDP. This makes spines more stable and sensitive to the fine structure of input correlations. We show that our learning rule has a selectivity comparable to additive STDP and represents input correlations as well as multiplicative models of STDP. We also show how it can protect previously formed memories and act as a synaptic consolidation mechanism. Overall, our results can be seen as a phenomenological description of how filopodia and spines could cooperate to overcome the difficulties that strong and weak competition each have.

                <p>by Tanmoy Sarkar, Matej Krajnc</p>

Cell rearrangements are fundamental mechanisms driving large-scale deformations of living tissues. In three-dimensional (3D) space-filling cell aggregates, cells rearrange through local topological transitions of the network of cell-cell interfaces, which is most conveniently described by the vertex model. Since these transitions are not yet mathematically properly formulated, the 3D vertex model is generally difficult to implement. The few existing implementations rely on highly customized and complex software-engineering solutions, which cannot be transparently delineated and are thus mostly non-reproducible. To solve this outstanding problem, we propose a reformulation of the vertex model. Our approach, called Graph Vertex Model (GVM), is based on storing the topology of the cell network into a knowledge graph with a particular data structure that allows performing cell-rearrangement events by simple graph transformations. Importantly, when these same transformations are applied to a two-dimensional (2D) polygonal cell aggregate, they reduce to a well-known T1 transition, thereby generalizing cell-rearrangements in 2D and 3D space-filling packings. This result suggests that the GVM’s graph data structure may be the most natural representation of cell aggregates and tissues. We also develop a Python package that implements GVM, relying on a graph-database-management framework Neo4j. We use this package to characterize an order-disorder transition in 3D cell aggregates, driven by active noise and we find aggregates undergoing efficient ordering close to the transition point. In all, our work showcases knowledge graphs as particularly suitable data models for structured storage, analysis, and manipulation of tissue data.

                <p>by Daniel L. Barton, Yow-Ren Chang, William Ducker, Jure Dobnikar</p>

In this work, we quantitatively compare computer simulations and existing cell tracking data of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> surface motility in order to analyse the underlying motility mechanism. We present a three dimensional twitching motility model, that simulates the extension, retraction and surface association of individual Type IV Pili (TFP), and is informed by recent experimental observations of TFP. Sensitivity analysis is implemented to minimise the number of model parameters, and quantitative estimates for the remaining parameters are inferred from tracking data by approximate Bayesian computation. We argue that the motility mechanism is highly sensitive to experimental conditions. We predict a TFP retraction speed for the tracking data we study that is in a good agreement with experimental results obtained under very similar conditions. Furthermore, we examine whether estimates for biologically important parameters, whose direct experimental determination is challenging, can be inferred directly from tracking data. One example is the width of the distribution of TFP on the bacteria body. We predict that the TFP are broadly distributed over the bacteria pole in both walking and crawling motility types. Moreover, we identified specific configurations of TFP that lead to transitions between walking and crawling states.

                <p>by Chun-Chih Tseng, Thomas E. Woolley, Ting-Xin Jiang, Ping Wu, Philip K. Maini, Randall B. Widelitz, Chuong Cheng-Ming</p>

Periodic patterning requires coordinated cell–cell interactions at the tissue level. Turing showed, using mathematical modeling, how spatial patterns could arise from the reactions of a diffusive activator-inhibitor pair in an initially homogenous 2D field. Most activators and inhibitors studied in biological systems are proteins, and the roles of cell–cell interaction, ions, bioelectricity, etc. are only now being identified. Gap junctions (GJs) mediate direct exchanges of ions or small molecules between cells, enabling rapid long-distance communications in a cell collective. They are therefore good candidates for propagating nonprotein-based patterning signals that may act according to the Turing principles. Here, we explore the possible roles of GJs in Turing-type patterning using feather pattern formation as a model. We found 7 of the 12 investigated GJ isoforms are highly dynamically expressed in the developing chicken skin. In ovo functional perturbations of the GJ isoform, <i>connexin 30</i>, by siRNA and the dominant-negative mutant applied before placode development led to disrupted primary feather bud formation. Interestingly, inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in the ex vivo skin explant culture allowed the sequential emergence of new feather buds at specific spatial locations relative to the existing primary buds. The results suggest that GJIC may facilitate the propagation of long-distance inhibitory signals. Thus, inhibition of GJs may stimulate Turing-type periodic feather pattern formation during chick skin development, and the removal of GJ activity would enable the emergence of new feather buds if the local environment were competent and the threshold to form buds was reached. We further propose Turing-based computational simulations that can predict the sequential appearance of these ectopic buds. Our models demonstrate how a Turing activator-inhibitor system can continue to generate patterns in the competent morphogenetic field when the level of intercellular communication at the tissue scale is modulated.

                <p>by Marie Morin, Mathias Jönsson, Conan K. Wang, David J. Craik, Sandie M. Degnan, Bernard M. Degnan</p>

Animals are influenced by the season, yet we know little about the changes that occur in most species throughout the year. This is particularly true in tropical marine animals that experience relatively small annual temperature and daylight changes. Like many coral reef inhabitants, the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), well known as a notorious consumer of corals and destroyer of coral reefs, reproduces exclusively in the summer. By comparing gene expression in 7 somatic tissues procured from wild COTS sampled on the Great Barrier Reef, we identified more than 2,000 protein-coding genes that change significantly between summer and winter. COTS genes that appear to mediate conspecific communication, including both signalling factors released into the surrounding sea water and cell surface receptors, are up-regulated in external secretory and sensory tissues in the summer, often in a sex-specific manner. Sexually dimorphic gene expression appears to be underpinned by sex- and season-specific transcription factors (TFs) and gene regulatory programs. There are over 100 TFs that are seasonally expressed, 87% of which are significantly up-regulated in the summer. Six nuclear receptors are up-regulated in all tissues in the summer, suggesting that systemic seasonal changes are hormonally controlled, as in vertebrates. Unexpectedly, there is a suite of stress-related chaperone proteins and TFs, including HIFa, ATF3, C/EBP, CREB, and NF-κB, that are uniquely and widely co-expressed in gravid females. The up-regulation of these stress proteins in the summer suggests the demands of oogenesis in this highly fecund starfish affects protein stability and turnover in somatic cells. Together, these circannual changes in gene expression provide novel insights into seasonal changes in this coral reef pest and have the potential to identify vulnerabilities for targeted biocontrol.

                <p>by Davide Crombie, Martin A. Spacek, Christian Leibold, Laura Busse</p>

The processing of sensory information, even at early stages, is influenced by the internal state of the animal. Internal states, such as arousal, are often characterized by relating neural activity to a single “level” of arousal, defined by a behavioral indicator such as pupil size. In this study, we expand the understanding of arousal-related modulations in sensory systems by uncovering multiple timescales of pupil dynamics and their relationship to neural activity. Specifically, we observed a robust coupling between spiking activity in the mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus and pupil dynamics across timescales spanning a few seconds to several minutes. Throughout all these timescales, 2 distinct spiking modes—individual tonic spikes and tightly clustered bursts of spikes—preferred opposite phases of pupil dynamics. This multi-scale coupling reveals modulations distinct from those captured by pupil size per se, locomotion, and eye movements. Furthermore, coupling persisted even during viewing of a naturalistic movie, where it contributed to differences in the encoding of visual information. We conclude that dLGN spiking activity is under the simultaneous influence of multiple arousal-related processes associated with pupil dynamics occurring over a broad range of timescales.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The discovery of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is frequently attributed to Dr. Gustav Oppenheim—a man who has been largely passed over in history. Oppenheim’s clinical and neuropathologic research covered a variety of disorders, but his name is best known for his work on senile dementia and CAA. Although Oppenheim was in fact not the first to discover CAA, his neuropathologic observations and inferences on neurodegenerative disease proved to be remarkably faithful to our modern understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. As a neurologist, he served in the First World War and was later subjected to religious persecutions in the leadup to the Holocaust but was not fortunate enough to emigrate before his death. The life, social impact, and previously overlooked contributions to science and medicine by Oppenheim are detailed.

     alt="The differential effects of palmitic acid and oleic acid on the metabolic response of hypothalamic astrocytes from male and female mice"/>
<p>Astrocytes in the hypothalamus differentially metabolize palmitic acid and oleic acid, two fatty acids commonly found in our diets, with this possibly being involved in our differential overall metabolic response to these nutrients.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Diets rich in saturated fats are more detrimental to health than those containing mono- or unsaturated fats. Fatty acids are an important source of energy, but they also relay information regarding nutritional status to hypothalamic metabolic circuits and when in excess can be detrimental to these circuits. Astrocytes are the main site of central fatty acid β-oxidation, and hypothalamic astrocytes participate in energy homeostasis, in part by modulating hormonal and nutritional signals reaching metabolic neurons, as well as in the inflammatory response to high-fat diets. Thus, we hypothesized that how hypothalamic astrocytes process-specific fatty acids participates in determining the differential metabolic response and that this is sex dependent as males and females respond differently to high-fat diets. Male and female primary hypothalamic astrocyte cultures were treated with oleic acid (OA) or palmitic acid (PA) for 24 h, and an untargeted metabolomics study was performed. A clear predictive model for PA exposure was obtained, while the metabolome after OA exposure was not different from controls. The observed modifications in metabolites, as well as the expression levels of key metabolic enzymes, indicate a reduction in the activity of the Krebs and glutamate/glutamine cycles in response to PA. In addition, there were specific differences between the response of astrocytes from male and female mice, as well as between hypothalamic and cerebral cortical astrocytes. Thus, the response of hypothalamic astrocytes to specific fatty acids could result in differential impacts on surrounding metabolic neurons and resulting in varied systemic metabolic outcomes.</p>

                The descending-pain modulating circuit controls the experience of pain by modulating transmission of sensory signals through the dorsal horn. This circuit’s key output node, the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), integrates ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ inputs that regulate functionally defined RVM cell types, ‘OFF-cells’ and ‘ON-cells’, which respectively suppress or facilitate pain-related sensory processing. While recent advances have sought molecular definition of RVM cell types, conflicting behavioral findings highlight challenges involved in aligning functional and molecularly defined types. This review summarizes current understanding, derived primarily from rodent studies but with corroborating evidence from human imaging, of the role of RVM populations in pain modulation and persistent pain states and explores recent advances outlining inputs to, and outputs from, RVM pain-modulating neurons.

	<p>Lucid dreaming involves becoming aware that one&amp;amp;rsquo;s current experience is a dream, which has similarities with the notion of mindfulness&amp;amp;mdash;becoming aware of moment-to-moment changes in experience. Additionally, meta-awareness, the ability to explicitly notice the current content of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own mental state, has also been proposed to play an important role both in lucid dreaming and mindfulness meditation practices. However, research has shown conflicting strengths of associations between mindfulness, meditation, and lucid dreaming frequency, and the link between lucid dreaming and meta-awareness has not yet been empirically studied. This study evaluated the associations between lucid dreaming frequency and different meditation practice styles, mindfulness traits, and individual differences in meta-awareness through an online survey (n = 635). The results suggest that daily frequent meditators experience more lucid dreams than non-frequent meditators. However, weekly frequent meditators did not have a higher lucid dreaming frequency. A positive association was observed between open monitoring styles of meditation and lucid dreaming. The findings also indicate that meta-awareness is higher for meditators and weekly lucid dreamers. Furthermore, frequent lucid dreaming was commonly associated with a non-reactive stance and experiencing transcendence. Overall, the findings suggest a positive relationship between specific meditation practices and lucid dreaming as well as the importance of meta-awareness as a cognitive process linking meditation, mindfulness, and lucid dreaming.</p>

                <p>Singing-based treatments of aphasia can improve language outcomes, but the neural benefits of group-based singing in aphasia are unknown. Here, we set out to determine the structural neuroplasticity changes underpinning group-based singing-induced treatment effects in chronic aphasia. Twenty-eight patients with at least mild nonfluent poststroke aphasia were randomized into two groups that received a 4-month multicomponent singing intervention (singing group) or standard care (control group). High-resolution T1 images and multishell diffusion-weighted MRI data were collected in two time points (baseline/5&nbsp;months). Structural gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) neuroplasticity changes were assessed using language network region of interest-based voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and quantitative anisotropy-based connectometry, and their associations to improved language outcomes (Western Aphasia Battery Naming and Repetition) were evaluated. Connectometry analyses showed that the singing group enhanced structural WM connectivity in the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and corpus callosum as well as in the frontal aslant tract (FAT), superior longitudinal fasciculus, and corticostriatal tract bilaterally compared with the control group. Moreover, in VBM, the singing group showed GM volume increase in the left inferior frontal cortex (Brodmann area 44) compared with the control group. The neuroplasticity effects in the left BA44, AF, and FAT correlated with improved naming abilities after the intervention. These findings suggest that in the poststroke aphasia group, singing can bring about structural neuroplasticity changes in left frontal language areas and in bilateral language pathways, which underpin treatment-induced improvement in speech production.</p>

                <p>Infrared neural stimulation (INS) is a promising area of interest for the clinical application of a neuromodulation method. This is in part because of its low invasiveness, whereby INS modulates the activity of the neural tissue mainly through temperature changes. Additionally, INS may provide localized brain stimulation with less tissue damage. The inferior colliculus (IC) is a crucial auditory relay nucleus and a potential target for clinical application of INS to treat auditory diseases and develop artificial hearing devices. Here, using continuous INS with low to high-power density, we demonstrate the laminar modulation of neural activity in the mouse IC in the presence and absence of sound. We investigated stimulation parameters of INS to effectively modulate the neural activity in a facilitatory or inhibitory manner. A mathematical model of INS-driven brain tissue was first simulated, temperature distributions were numerically estimated, and stimulus parameters were selected from the simulation results. Subsequently, INS was administered to the IC of anesthetized mice, and the modulation effect on the neural activity was measured using an electrophysiological approach. We found that the modulatory effect of INS on the spontaneous neural activity was bidirectional between facilitatory and inhibitory effects. The modulatory effect on sound-evoked responses produced only an inhibitory effect to all examined stimulus intensities. Thus, this study provides important physiological evidence on the response properties of IC neurons to INS. Overall, INS can be used for the development of new therapies for neurological disorders and functional support devices for auditory central processing.</p>

                Background This study conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to identify the gaps in the existing literature related to Online marketing and brand awareness strategies for HEI. It has evaluated the current state of the literature on the given topic showing the pivotal role of online marketing and brand awareness in higher education for enrollment. Methods The study used a web-based application, Biblioshiny, which comes in the bibliometrix package. The study used the Scopus database to create the data set, given its conventional construction and quality of the sources. The analysis done is descriptive. By using the bibliometrix software, the study showed the authors name, articles, sources, citations, relevant journals and co-citation from the year 2017 to 2022. The time period selected by the study was five years which means that articles published from 2017 to 2022 have been taken for the study. Results We found that HEI online marketing and brand awareness have not been explored much as it has not reached the stage of maturity. Most of the publication was done during the time of Covid-19. Also, the role of brand awareness in student enrollment decisions for HEI requires more investigation. Top most publications their sources and top authors are identified. Conclusions Bibliometric analysis has provided valuable insights into the seminal work, emerging trends, and the gap in the study. This area of study has been explored but not as much as challenges, and the effectiveness of online marketing tools like seo, sem,ppc and more has not been measured. Further, this paper allows researchers to study by examining the pattern of publications by seeing the different authorships, co-authors, collaborations, relevant sources, and citations. The insights of this paper will help education policymakers devise more creative strategies to increase enrollment, ensuring sustained relevance and competitive advantage in higher education institutions .

                <p>by Marko Šterk, Yaowen Zhang, Viljem Pohorec, Eva Paradiž Leitgeb, Jurij Dolenšek, Richard K. P. Benninger, Andraž Stožer, Vira Kravets, Marko Gosak</p>

Within the islets of Langerhans, beta cells orchestrate synchronized insulin secretion, a pivotal aspect of metabolic homeostasis. Despite the inherent heterogeneity and multimodal activity of individual cells, intercellular coupling acts as a homogenizing force, enabling coordinated responses through the propagation of intercellular waves. Disruptions in this coordination are implicated in irregular insulin secretion, a hallmark of diabetes. Recently, innovative approaches, such as integrating multicellular calcium imaging with network analysis, have emerged for a quantitative assessment of the cellular activity in islets. However, different groups use distinct experimental preparations, microscopic techniques, apply different methods to process the measured signals and use various methods to derive functional connectivity patterns. This makes comparisons between findings and their integration into a bigger picture difficult and has led to disputes in functional connectivity interpretations. To address these issues, we present here a systematic analysis of how different approaches influence the network representation of islet activity. Our findings show that the choice of methods used to construct networks is not crucial, although care is needed when combining data from different islets. Conversely, the conclusions drawn from network analysis can be heavily affected by the pre-processing of the time series, the type of the oscillatory component in the signals, and by the experimental preparation. Our tutorial-like investigation aims to resolve interpretational issues, reconcile conflicting views, advance functional implications, and encourage researchers to adopt connectivity analysis. As we conclude, we outline challenges for future research, emphasizing the broader applicability of our conclusions to other tissues exhibiting complex multicellular dynamics.

                <p>by Yasuhiro Mochizuki, Norihiro Harasawa, Mayank Aggarwal, Chong Chen, Haruaki Fukuda</p>

Changes in risk preference have been reported when making a series of independent risky choices or non-foraging economic decisions. Behavioral economics has put forward various explanations for specific effects on risk preference in non-foraging tasks, but a consensus regarding the general principle underlying these effects has not been reached. In contrast, recent studies have investigated human economic risky choices using tasks adapted from foraging theory, which require consideration of past choices and future opportunities to make optimal decisions. In these foraging tasks, human economic risky choices are explained by the ethological principle of fitness maximization, which naturally leads to dynamic risk preference. Here, we conducted two online experiments to investigate whether the principle of fitness maximization can explain risk preference dynamics in a non-foraging task. Participants were asked to make a series of independent risky economic decisions while the environmental richness changed. We found that participants’ risk preferences were influenced by the current and past environments, making them more risk-averse during and after the rich environment compared to the poor environment. These changes in risk preference align with fitness maximization. Our findings suggest that the ethological principle of fitness maximization might serve as a generalizable principle for explaining dynamic preferences, including risk preference, in human economic decision-making.

                <p>by Blox Bloxham, Hyunseok Lee, Jeff Gore</p>

How natural communities maintain their remarkable biodiversity and which species survive in complex communities are central questions in ecology. Resource competition models successfully explain many phenomena but typically predict only as many species as resources can coexist. Here, we demonstrate that sequential resource utilization, or diauxie, with periodic growth cycles can support many more species than resources. We explore how communities modify their own environments by sequentially depleting resources to form sequences of temporal niches, or intermediately depleted environments. Biodiversity is enhanced when community-driven or environmental fluctuations modulate the resource depletion order and produce different temporal niches on each growth cycle. Community-driven fluctuations under constant environmental conditions are rare, but exploring them illuminates the temporal niche structure that emerges from sequential resource utilization. With environmental fluctuations, we find most communities have more stably coexisting species than resources with survivors accurately predicted by the same temporal niche structure and each following a distinct optimal strategy. Our results thus present a new niche-based approach to understanding highly diverse fluctuating communities.

                <p>by Fleur Zeldenrust, Niccolò Calcini, Xuan Yan, Ate Bijlsma, Tansu Celikel</p>

Sensory neurons reconstruct the world from action potentials (spikes) impinging on them. To effectively transfer information about the stimulus to the next processing level, a neuron needs to be able to adapt its working range to the properties of the stimulus. Here, we focus on the intrinsic neural properties that influence information transfer in cortical neurons and how tightly their properties need to be tuned to the stimulus statistics for them to be effective. We start by measuring the intrinsic information encoding properties of putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons in L2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex. Excitatory neurons show high thresholds and strong adaptation, making them fire sparsely and resulting in a strong compression of information, whereas inhibitory neurons that favour fast spiking transfer more information. Next, we turn to computational modelling and ask how two properties influence information transfer: 1) spike-frequency adaptation and 2) the shape of the IV-curve. We find that a subthreshold (but not threshold) adaptation, the ‘h-current’, and a properly tuned leak conductance can increase the information transfer of a neuron, whereas threshold adaptation can increase its working range. Finally, we verify the effect of the IV-curve slope in our experimental recordings and show that excitatory neurons form a more heterogeneous population than inhibitory neurons. These relationships between intrinsic neural features and neural coding that had not been quantified before will aid computational, theoretical and systems neuroscientists in understanding how neuronal populations can alter their coding properties, such as through the impact of neuromodulators. Why the variability of intrinsic properties of excitatory neurons is larger than that of inhibitory ones is an exciting question, for which future research is needed.

                <p>by Moo K. Chung, Shih-Gu Huang, Ian C. Carroll, Vince D. Calhoun, H. Hill Goldsmith</p>

We introduce an innovative, data-driven topological data analysis (TDA) technique for estimating the state spaces of dynamically changing functional human brain networks at rest. Our method utilizes the Wasserstein distance to measure topological differences, enabling the clustering of brain networks into distinct topological states. This technique outperforms the commonly used k-means clustering in identifying brain network state spaces by effectively incorporating the temporal dynamics of the data without the need for explicit model specification. We further investigate the genetic underpinnings of these topological features using a twin study design, examining the heritability of such state changes. Our findings suggest that the topology of brain networks, particularly in their dynamic state changes, may hold significant hidden genetic information.

                <p>by Ariana Chriss, G. Valentin Börner, Shawn D. Ryan</p>

During meiosis, pairing of homologous chromosomes (homologs) ensures the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates crossover recombination and homolog segregation during the ensuing reductional cell division. Mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive, but rapid chromosome movements during prophase I appear to play a role in the process. Apart from homolog attraction, provided by early intermediates of homologous recombination, dissociation of non-homologous associations also appears to contribute to homolog pairing, as suggested by the detection of stable non-homologous chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants. Here, we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble. The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements, as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions. Chromosome number and size as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces are identified as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction. Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. Incorporating natural chromosome lengths, the model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>For stroke patients with unknown time of onset, mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can guide thrombolytic intervention. However, access to MRI for hyperacute stroke is limited. Here, we sought to evaluate whether a portable, low-field (LF)-MRI scanner can identify DWI-FLAIR mismatch in acute ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eligible patients with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke underwent LF-MRI acquisition on a 0.064-T scanner within 24 h of last known well. Qualitative and quantitative metrics were evaluated. Two trained assessors determined the visibility of stroke lesions on LF-FLAIR. An image coregistration pipeline was developed, and the LF-FLAIR signal intensity ratio (SIR) was derived.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 71 patients aged 71 ± 14 years and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 6 (interquartile range 3–14). The interobserver agreement for identifying visible FLAIR hyperintensities was high (<i>κ</i> = 0.85, 95% CI 0.70–0.99). Visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch had a 60% sensitivity and 82% specificity for stroke patients &lt;4.5 h, with a negative predictive value of 93%. LF-FLAIR SIR had a mean value of 1.18 ± 0.18 &lt;4.5 h, 1.24 ± 0.39 4.5–6 h, and 1.40 ± 0.23 &gt;6 h of stroke onset. The optimal cut-point for LF-FLAIR SIR was 1.15, with 85% sensitivity and 70% specificity. A cut-point of 6.6 h was established for a FLAIR SIR &lt;1.15, with an 89% sensitivity and 62% specificity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A 0.064-T portable LF-MRI can identify DWI-FLAIR mismatch among patients with acute ischemic stroke. Future research is needed to prospectively validate thresholds and evaluate a role of LF-MRI in guiding thrombolysis among stroke patients with uncertain time of onset.

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide range of clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic presentation to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Although COVID-19 disease progression was studied elsewhere, it is largely unknown in Bangladesh. Methods We conducted this cross-sectional study in November 2020 to January 2021 on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Pearson chi-square tests were used to assess the disease progressions across selected variables. A logistic regression model was used to assess the associated factors of COVID-19 infection for explanatory variables. All statistics were performed using the Stata software version 14.0 (Stata corporation, college station, Texas, USA). Results A total of 384 of respondents were involved in the survey. Of participants, most males (73%), unmarried (69%), aged 18 to 35 years during survey, and lived in urban community (73%). Overall, 41% of patients were in asymptotic condition, 44% were in mild condition, while 17% were moderate to severe conditions. Male patients and patients over 50 years had severe symptoms, accounting for 52% and 50%, respectively. Nearly half of business persons and office employees had severe symptoms. Almost all married patients (98%) had severe symptoms. The severity of symptoms was also higher for patients living in urban areas (79%), smoking (95%), and not physically active (52%). Patients with diabetes, asthma/COPD, and cancer were significantly associated with severe stage of COVID-19 (p≤0.05). Patient’s age, gender, smoking status, diabetics, working conditions significantly affect Covid-19 disease progression. Conclusion The study found that 7.03% of patients had severe, 9.11% had moderate and 40.36% had asymptomatic conditions. The heterogenic association between the disease progressions with age, sex, residence, marital status, smoking habits, diabetes, physical exercise, working conditions, sedentary lifestyles. Findings highlight the idea of using vulnerability ratings for each risk factor related to disease progression.

                Background Pseudomonads are gram negative bacteria and readily form biofilms in the environment, allowing long-term colonization and persistence in sinks, water systems. They pose a risk of life-threatening opportunistic infections in immune-compromised individuals. MDR strains, make treatment increasingly difficult. Environmentally persistent MDR strains are typically problematic within healthcare facilities, however, data on MDR pseudomonad reservoirs in settings with community-acquired infections to inform preventive interventions, in resource-constrained settings is scarce. Here, we determined reservoirs and antibiotic susceptibility of Pseudomonas species in water sources in Kisumu County, Kenya with reported high levels of community acquired pseudomonad infections. Methods We adopted a cross-sectional design, randomly collecting 297 samples from tap heads, sinks, tanks, vendor and household storage containers in six selected sub-locations and one hospital (KCRH). Standard microbiological procedures were used for identification and AST of the isolates. Results We isolated Pseudomonads from 14.1% of the samples collected, predominantly from the community 10.4%. Seven different pseudomonads were identified, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominating 6.7% overall, in the community samples 5.7%, and among isolates from water tanks 21.4%. Pseudomonad isolates were 62% non-susceptible to piperacillin, 57% to tigecycline, 24% meropenem, 21% cefepime, 19% levofloxacin and 14% colistin. Carbapenem resistance was mainly detected in P. aeruginosa 80% (8/10) from Milimani sub-location 75% (6/8). 45% of the isolates recovered were MDR, mainly community-associated carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) 42%, strains susceptible to colistin. The MDR pseudomonads exhibited high multiple antibiotic resistance indices, ranging from 0.43 to 1. Conclusion This study reveals a higher prevalence of MDR pseudomonads, including CRPA strains in community water sources. These potential conduits of drug resistance present a critical public health threat, especially among immunocompromised. Regular cleaning of water storage facilities, water treatment and implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs, are required to prevent a rise in AMR and eliminate the environmental reservoirs that put the vulnerable populations at risk.

	<p>Background: Patients with supratentorial cavernous malformations (SCMs) commonly present with seizures. First-line treatments for cavernoma-related epilepsy (CRE) include conservative management (antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)) and surgery. We compared seizure outcomes of CRE patients after early (&amp;amp;le;6 months) vs. delayed (&amp;amp;gt;6 months) surgery. Methods: We compared outcomes of CRE patients with SCMs surgically treated at our large-volume cerebrovascular center (1 January 2010&amp;amp;ndash;31 July 2020). Patients with 1 sporadic SCM and &amp;amp;ge;1-year follow-up were included. Primary outcomes were International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) class 1 seizure freedom and AED independence. Results: Of 63 CRE patients (26 women, 37 men; mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD age, 36.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.6 years), 48 (76%) vs. 15 (24%) underwent early (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 2.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 months) vs. delayed (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 6.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.1 years) surgery. Most (32 (67%)) with early surgery presented after 1 seizure; all with delayed surgery had &amp;amp;ge;2 seizures. Seven (47%) with delayed surgery had drug-resistant epilepsy. At follow-up (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 5.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.3 years), CRE patients with early surgery were more likely to have ILAE class 1 seizure freedom and AED independence than those with delayed surgery (92% (44/48) vs. 53% (8/15), p = 0.002; and 65% (31/48) vs. 33% (5/15), p = 0.03, respectively). Conclusions: Early CRE surgery demonstrated better seizure outcomes than delayed surgery. Multicenter prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.</p>

	<p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enables the assessment of changes in brain tissue microstructure during maturation and ageing. In general, patterns of cerebral maturation and decline render non-monotonic lifespan trajectories of DTI metrics with age, and, importantly, the rate of microstructural changes is heterochronous for various white matter fibres. Recent studies have demonstrated that diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics are more sensitive to microstructural changes during ageing compared to those of DTI. In a previous work, we demonstrated that the Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d of mean diffusional kurtosis (dMK) represents a useful biomarker for quantifying maturation heterochronicity. However, some inferences on the maturation grades of different fibre types, such as association, projection, and commissural, were of a preliminary nature due to the insufficient number of fibres considered. Hence, the purpose of this follow-up work was to further explore the heterochronicity of microstructural maturation between pre-adolescence and middle adulthood based on DTI and DKI metrics. Using the effect size of the between-group parametric changes and Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d, we observed that all commissural fibres achieved the highest level of maturity, followed by the majority of projection fibres, while the majority of association fibres were the least matured. We also demonstrated that dMK strongly correlates with the maxima or minima of the lifespan curves of DTI metrics. Furthermore, our results provide substantial evidence for the existence of spatial gradients in the timing of white matter maturation. In conclusion, our data suggest that DKI provides useful biomarkers for the investigation of maturation spatial heterogeneity and heterochronicity.</p>

	<p>The duration of slow-wave sleep (SWS) is related to the reported sleep quality and to the important variables of mental and physical health. The internal cues to end an episode of SWS are poorly understood. One such internal cue is the initiation of a body movement, which is detectable as electromyographic (EMG) activity in sleep-electroencephalography (EEG). In the present study, we characterized the termination of SWS episodes by movement to explore its potential as a biomarker. To this end, we characterized the relation between the occurrence of SWS termination by movement and individual characteristics (age, sex), SWS duration and spectral content, chronotype, depression, medication, overnight memory performance, and, as a potential neurological application, epilepsy. We analyzed 94 full-night EEG-EMG recordings (75/94 had confirmed epilepsy) in the video-EEG monitoring unit of the EpiCARE Centre Salzburg, Austria. Segments of SWS were counted and rated for their termination by movement or not through the visual inspection of continuous EEG and EMG recordings. Multiple linear regression was used to predict the number of SWS episodes that ended with movement by depression, chronotype, type of epilepsy (focal, generalized, no epilepsy, unclear), medication, gender, total duration of SWS, occurrence of seizures during the night, occurrence of tonic-clonic seizures during the night, and SWS frequency spectra. Furthermore, we assessed whether SWS movement termination was related to overnight memory retention. According to multiple linear regression, patients with overall longer SWS experienced more SWS episodes that ended with movement (t = 5.64; p = 0.001). No other variable was related to the proportion of SWS that ended with movement, including no epilepsy-related variable. A small sample (n = 4) of patients taking Sertraline experienced no SWS that ended with movement, which was significant compared to all other patients (t = 8.00; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and to n = 35 patients who did not take any medication (t = 4.22; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). While this result was based on a small subsample and must be interpreted with caution, it warrants replication in a larger sample with and without seizures to further elucidate the role of the movement termination of SWS and its potential to serve as a biomarker for sleep continuity and for medication effects on sleep.</p>

	<p>Once thought of as an immune-privileged site, we now know that the nervous system communicates in a bidirectional manner with the immune system via the neuroimmune axis. Neuropeptides constitute a component of this axis, playing critical roles in the brain and periphery. The function of salivary neuropeptides in the acute stress response is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate salivary neuropeptide levels during acute stress. Salivary samples were collected from fire recruits engaged in a stress training exercise previously shown to induce acute stress, at three separate timepoints during the exercise and levels of oxytocin, neurotensin, Substance P, &amp;amp;alpha;-MSH, and &amp;amp;beta;-Endorphin were measured using the Human Neuropeptide 5-Plex Custom Assay Eve Technologies. All neuropeptides increased throughout the acute stress simulation and during the recovery phase. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified one factor contributing to baseline values across five neuropeptides and Pairwise Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis showed positive correlations &amp;amp;gt;0.9 for almost all neuropeptide combinations at the pre-stress timepoint. Further analysis identified negative and positive correlations between past-life trauma and self-assessed hardiness, respectively. Calculated neuropeptide scores showed an overall positive correlation to self-assessed hardiness. Altogether, our results suggest that salivary neuropeptides increase synchronously during acute stress and higher levels correlate with an increase in self-assessed hardiness. Further study is required to determine if interventions designed to enhance neuropeptide activity can increase stress resilience, especially in high-stress occupations such as firefighting.</p>

	<p>Executive functions (EFs) are related abilities, associated with the frontal lobes functions, that allow individuals to modify behavioral patterns when they become unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to assess EFs in children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and in children with &amp;amp;ldquo;specific language impairment&amp;amp;rdquo; (SLI), compared with a control group of children with normal development, to identify specific skill deficits. Three groups of preschool children aged between 2 and 6 years were assessed: 19 children with normal hearing, cognitive, and language development, 10 children with SNHL, and 20 children with SLI. The FE-PS 2-6 Battery was used for the assessment of preschool EFs, supplemented with the Modified Bell Test for the analysis of selective attention. Statistically significant differences were found between the two experimental groups and the control one, regarding the investigated skills. Children with SNHL showed a clear deficit in flexibility, whereas children with SLI had greater problems in self-regulation and management of waiting for gratification. Selective attention was found to be deficient in all three groups, with no statistically significant differences. This study shows that the skills investigated were found to be deficient in both SNHL and SLI patients. It is essential to start targeted exercises based on specific deficient skills as part of the rehabilitation program. It is of great importance to understand the consequences of EF deficit in preschool children to achieve an accurate diagnosis and carry out customized rehabilitation programs.</p>

	<p>Background: In recent years, new technologies have been applied in cerebral palsy. Among these, immersive virtual reality is one with promising motor and cognitive effects along with the reduced costs of its application. The level of immersion of the subject in the illusional world gives the feeling of being a real part of the virtual environment. This study aims to investigate the safety and the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in children affected by cerebral palsy. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, RehabData, and Web of Science were screened up to February 2023 to identify eligible clinical studies. Results: Out of 788, we included 15 studies involving CP patients. There was high heterogeneity in the outcomes considered, and the results showed non-inferiority to conventional therapy and initial additional benefits in comparison with conventional rehabilitation. Conclusions: Immersive virtual reality emerges as a pivotal technological tool in rehabilitation, seamlessly integrating with conventional therapy within CP rehabilitation programs. Indeed, it not only enhances motivation but significantly increases children&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional capacity and abilities.</p>

<p>Our results suggest that the lateral spiriform nucleus of the pretectum in birds modulates brainstem-projecting tectobulbar neurons in a manner comparable to the influence of globus pallidus internus on motor thalamus in mammals and receives its striatal input from a newly recognized third striatal region called the intrapeduncular nucleus.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We used diverse methods to characterize the role of avian lateral spiriform nucleus (SpL) in basal ganglia motor function. Connectivity analysis showed that SpL receives input from globus pallidus (GP), and the intrapeduncular nucleus (INP) located ventromedial to GP, whose neurons express numerous striatal markers. SpL-projecting GP neurons were large and aspiny, while SpL-projecting INP neurons were medium sized and spiny. Connectivity analysis further showed that SpL receives inputs from subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and that the SNr also receives inputs from GP, INP, and STN. Neurochemical analysis showed that SpL neurons express ENK, GAD, and a variety of pallidal neuron markers, and receive GABAergic terminals, some of which also contain DARPP32, consistent with GP pallidal and INP striatal inputs. Connectivity and neurochemical analysis showed that the SpL input to tectum prominently ends on GABAA receptor-enriched tectobulbar neurons. Behavioral studies showed that lesions of SpL impair visuomotor behaviors involving tracking and pecking moving targets. Our results suggest that SpL modulates brainstem-projecting tectobulbar neurons in a manner comparable to the demonstrated influence of GP internus on motor thalamus and of SNr on tectobulbar neurons in mammals. Given published data in amphibians and reptiles, it seems likely the SpL circuit represents a major direct pathway-type circuit by which the basal ganglia exerts its motor influence in nonmammalian tetrapods. The present studies also show that avian striatum is divided into three spatially segregated territories with differing connectivity, a medial striato-nigral territory, a dorsolateral striato-GP territory, and the ventrolateral INP motor territory.</p>

	<p>Background: Clinical case illustrations of patients with an impairment of personality functioning (IPF) have repeatedly reported that progress during psychotherapy is reflected by alterations in dream content. However, quantitative studies based on samples of psychotherapy patients are scarce. As a core component of both personality functioning and contemporary psychodynamic dream theory, the construct of affect regulation is of specific significance in this context. Aims: To test if improvement in personality functioning in the course of psychotherapy is associated with an increasing ability to regulate affects in dreams. Method: In a longitudinal design, affect regulation was compared in N = 94 unsolicited dream reports from the first vs. last third of long term psychotherapy of ten patients with initial IPF. Dream reports were transcribed from recordings of the sessions. Expert ratings of the level of personality functioning were obtained using the Scales of Psychological Capacities. The capacity for affect regulation was assessed using the Zurich Dream Process Coding System. Group differences were assessed using linear mixed models, controlling for dream length as well as the nested structure of this data set. Results: Patients demonstrated an increased capacity for affect regulation in dreams that was primarily evident in three core features: the complexity of dream elements (cf., e.g., parameter attributes, p = 0.024); the extent of affective involvement in the dream ego (cf., e.g., parameter subject feeling, p = 0.014); and the flexibility to regulate the dynamics of safety/involvement processes (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001). This pattern was especially prominent in a subgroup (n = 7) of patients with more pronounced improvements in personality functioning. Conclusion: These findings support the hypotheses that decreasing IPF during psychotherapy is associated with increases in the capacity for affect regulation in dreams. Thus, researchers and therapists can utilize dream reports to illuminate the important aspects of treatment progress in clinical practice.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The discovery of novel diagnostic methods and therapies for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) faces significant challenges. Previous research has shed light on the neuroprotective properties of Apelin-13 in neurodegenerative disorders. However, elucidating the mechanism underlying its efficacy in combating AD-related nerve injury is imperative. In this study, we aimed to investigate Apelin-13&amp;amp;rsquo;s mechanism of action in an in vivo model of AD induced by streptozocin (STZ). (2) Methods: We utilized an STZ-induced nerve injury model of AD in mice to investigate the effects of Apelin-13 administration. Apelin-13 was administered intranasally, and cognitive impairment was assessed using standardized behavioral tests, primarily, behavioral assessment, histological analysis, and biochemical assays, in order to evaluate synaptic plasticity and oxidative stress signaling pathways. (3) Results: Our findings indicate that intranasal administration of Apelin-13 ameliorated cognitive impairment in the STZ-induced AD model. Furthermore, we observed that this effect was potentially mediated by the enhancement of synaptic plasticity and the attenuation of oxidative stress signaling pathways. (4) Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that intranasal administration of Apelin-13 holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. By improving synaptic plasticity and mitigating oxidative stress, Apelin-13 may offer a novel approach to neuroprotection in AD and related conditions.</p>

	<p>Exploring the spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for interpreting dementia and related cognitive decline. Spatiotemporal patterns of EEG can be described through microstate analysis, which provides a discrete approximation of the continuous electric field patterns generated by the brain cortex. Here, we propose a novel microstate spatiotemporal dynamic indicator, termed the microstate sequence non-randomness index (MSNRI). The essence of the method lies in initially generating a sequence of microstate transition patterns through state space compression of EEG data using microstate analysis. Following this, we assess the non-randomness of these microstate patterns using information-based similarity analysis. The results suggest that this MSNRI metric is a potential marker for distinguishing between health control (HC) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (HC vs. FTD: 6.958 vs. 5.756, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), as well as between HC and populations with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) (HC vs. AD: 6.958 vs. 5.462, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Healthy individuals exhibit more complex macroscopic structures and non-random spatiotemporal patterns of microstates, whereas dementia disorders lead to more random spatiotemporal patterns. Additionally, we extend the proposed method by integrating the Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) method to explore spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of microstates at specific frequency scales. Moreover, we assessed the effectiveness of this innovative method in predicting cognitive scores. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of CEEMD-enhanced microstate dynamic indicators significantly improved the prediction accuracy of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (R2 = 0.940). The CEEMD-enhanced MSNRI method not only aids in the exploration of large-scale neural changes in populations with dementia but also offers a robust tool for characterizing the dynamics of EEG microstate transitions and their impact on cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic increased symptoms of stress and anxiety and induced changes in sleep quality, dream activity, and parasomnia episodes. It has been shown that stressful factors and/or bad sleep habits can affect parasomnia behaviors. However, investigations on how COVID-19 has affected sleep, dreams, and episode frequency in parasomnias are rare. The current study focuses on the impact of the pandemic on a specific parasomnia characterized by speech production (sleep talking, ST). Methods: We selected 27 participants with frequent ST episodes (STs) during the pandemic and compared them with 27 participants with frequent STs from a previous study conducted during a pre-pandemic period. All participants performed home monitoring through sleep logs and recorded their nocturnal STs for one week. Results: We observed a higher frequency of STs in the pandemic group. Moreover, STs were related to the emotional intensity of dreams, independent of the pandemic condition. The pandemic was associated with lower bizarreness of dreams in the pandemic group. There were no differences in sleep variables between the two groups. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest a stressful effect of COVID-19 on the frequency of STs. Both the pandemic and the frequency of STs affect qualitative characteristics of dreams in this population.</p>

                <p>Both the retina and brain exhibit neurovascular coupling, increased blood flow during increased neural activity. In the retina increased blood flow can be evoked by flickering light, but the magnitude of the metabolic change that underlies this is not known. Local changes in oxygen consumption (QO<SUB>2</SUB>) are difficult to measure in vivo when both supply and demand are changing. Here we isolated the C57BL/6J mouse retina and supplied it with oxygen from both sides of the tissue. Microelectrode recordings of PO<SUB>2</SUB> were made in darkness and during 20&nbsp;s of high scotopic flickering light at 1&nbsp;Hz. Flicker led to a PO<SUB>2</SUB> increase in the outer retina and a decrease in the inner retina, indicating that outer retinal QO<SUB>2</SUB> (QOR) decreased and inner retinal QO<SUB>2</SUB> (QIR) increased. A four-layer oxygen diffusion model was fitted to PO<SUB>2</SUB> values obtained in darkness and at the end of flicker to determine the values of QOR and QIR. QOR in flicker was 76 &plusmn; 14% (mean and SD, <I>n</I> = 10) of QOR in darkness. The increase in QIR was smaller, 6.4 &plusmn; 5.0%. These metabolic changes are likely smaller than the maximum changes, because with no regeneration of pigment in the isolated retina, we limited the illumination. Further modeling indicated that at high illumination, QIR could increase by up to 45%, which is comparable to the magnitude of flow changes. This suggests that the blood flow increase is at least roughly matched to the increased metabolic demands of activity in the retina.</p>

                Background The aim of this study was to observe and analyze vascular function in ‘prolonged sitting’, followed by a yoga asana routine and pranayama intervention. Participants in this study include those who work from desks in offices. The study required the participants to attend on three separate days at random, and they had to finish a computerized test on each day. On the first day, participants were required to complete a computer test while sitting still for four hours (with the exception of washroom breaks). The next day, they underwent a computerized test along with a pranayama intervention. Finally, on the last day, they underwent a computerized test along with a yoga asana intervention. At the start of the study and after two and four hours, we measured the diameter and velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Methods The study was a within-subjects prospective single-center trial conducted in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India, between September 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to do one of the following ‘activities’ over successive weeks: Week 1 – Prolonged sitting; Week 2 – Pranayama intervention; and Week 3 – Yoga asana intervention during prolonged sitting. The baseline and follow-up variables of pulse velocity, endothelial thickness, and shear rate were assessed for normality through a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Results Our sample included 11 participants with moderate physical activity, five with high physical activity and one with low physical activity. Yoga asana intervention comprised participants sitting continuously for four hours, with a yoga asana intervention being provided every hour, lasting for 10 minutes. Conclusions Yoga asana improves vascular functions in prolonged sitting conditions. This routine can promote the concept of interrupted sitting and ways to reduce it with efficient yoga asana practice without changing the work culture and provide better physical relief.

                Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), a serious clinical challenge caused by incomplete abortion in female, calls for efficient and minimally invasive therapies to treat symptoms and protect reproductive health. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has been discovered as a viable therapeutic strategy to treat DUB following an incomplete abortion. The existing information and clinical experience of UAE for this particular indication were thoroughly reviewed. A female’s quality of life may be negatively affected by incomplete abortion, which is defined as residual fetal tissue inside the uterine cavity. This frequently results in heavy and continuous uterine bleeding. Medical procedures and traditional management techniques such as dilatation and curettage (D&C) do not always produce the desired effects or might have inherent dangers. UAE, a less invasive technique first developed for treating uterine fibroids, has shown promise as a substitute solution for DUB caused by an incomplete abortion.

The heterogeneity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) poses a barrier to effective treatment. Stratifying highly heterogeneous HCC into molecular subtypes with similar features is crucial for personalized anti-tumor therapies. Although driver genes play pivotal roles in cancer progression, their potential in HCC subtyping has been largely overlooked. This study aims to utilize driver genes to construct HCC subtype models and unravel their molecular mechanisms. Utilizing a novel computational framework, we expanded the initially identified 96 driver genes to 1192 based on mutational aspects and an additional 233 considering driver dysregulation. These genes were subsequently employed as stratification markers for further analyses. A novel multi-omics subtype classification algorithm was developed, leveraging mutation and expression data of the identified stratification genes. This algorithm successfully categorized HCC into two distinct subtypes, CLASS A and CLASS B, demonstrating significant differences in survival outcomes. Integrating multi-omics and single-cell data unveiled substantial distinctions between these subtypes regarding transcriptomics, mutations, copy number variations, and epigenomics. Moreover, our prognostic model exhibited excellent predictive performance in training and external validation cohorts. Finally, a 10-gene classification model for these subtypes identified <i>TTK</i> as a promising therapeutic target with robust classification capabilities. This comprehensive study provides a novel perspective on HCC stratification, offering crucial insights for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis and the development of promising treatment strategies.

                Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a prominent cause of illness and mortality worldwide, with a significant amount of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries performed each year. It is a complicated technique that results in several clinical and functional issues. While CABG is an effective treatment, it comes with clinical and functional challenges, including reduced lung volume, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure, and thoracic mobility after surgery. Incisional pain has been associated with a decline in postoperative lung function; however, this resolves a month following surgery. There is no documented association between respiratory muscle strength and lung function after heart surgery. The POWERbreathe Medic Plus is intended for patients who have extremely weak breathing muscles as a result of illness, hospitalization, or existing respiratory health disorders such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. To address these challenges, a study will investigate the efficacy of the POWERbreathe Medic Plus device in improving maximal inspiratory pressure, functional capacity, and quality of life in CABG patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-471/v1?src=rss">Towards a quality indicator for research data publications and research software publications – a vision from the Helmholtz Association [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Research data and software are widely accepted as an outcome of scientific work. However, in comparison to text-based publications, there is not yet an established process to assess and evaluate quality of research data and research software publications. This paper presents an attempt to fill this gap. Initiated by the Working Group Open Science of the Helmholtz Association, the Task Group Helmholtz Quality Indicators for Data and Software Publications currently develops a quality indicator for research data and research software publications to be used within the Association. This report summarizes the vision of the group of what all contributes to such an indicator. The proposed approach relies on generic well-established concepts for quality criteria, such as the FAIR Principles and the COBIT Maturity Model. It does – on purpose – not limit itself to technical implementation possibilities to avoid using an existing metric for a new purpose. The intention of this paper is to share the current state for further discussion with all stakeholders, particularly with other groups also working on similar metrics but also with entities that use the metrics.

                de Brito Van Velze et al. show that behavioral state modulation of SST-INs is not uniform across sensory cortices and is influenced by the presence of sensory drive. Experimental and numerical simulations suggest that differences in SST-INs across behavioral states can be explained by varying ratios of VIP-driven inhibition and thalamus-driven cortical excitation.

                Song et al. demonstrate that astrocyte-derived CHI3L1 engages with the CRTH2/RAGE receptor to impede neurogenesis and cognition by attenuating β-catenin signaling in the demyelinated hippocampus. CHI3L1 suppresses NSC proliferation via the CRTH2 receptor and hinders the neuronal development via the RAGE receptor rather than CRTH2.

	<p>Background: Parents report associations between children&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep disturbances and behaviors. Children with neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., Williams Syndrome and autism) are consistently reported to experience increased sleeping problems. Sleep in children with vision impairment and children with a dual diagnosis of vision impairment and autism remains understudied. Methods: Our exploratory study compared sleep profiles in 52 children (aged 4&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) and their parents (n = 37), across four groups: children with vision impairment (VI; n = 9), autism (n = 10), comorbid vision impairment + autism (n = 6), and typically developing children (n = 27). Childhood sleep was measured using the parental report Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire and sleep diaries. Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive functioning was measured using digit span, semantic, and phonemic verbal fluency measures. Parental sleep was measured via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Results: Clinically disordered sleep was reported in all child groups (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), particularly children with VI + autism. Age, not sleep quality/quantity, predicted cognitive task performance in TD and autistic groups, but not in VI and VI + autism groups. The child&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagnosis affected parental sleep, particularly in children with a dual diagnosis of VI + autism. Conclusions: All participants experienced problematic sleep to varying degrees. Those most affected were children and parents in the VI + autism group, suggesting that autism may be the main driver of sleep problems in our sample.</p>

	<p>Recently, we and others have shown that manipulating the activity of cholinergic interneurons (CIN) present in the NAc can modulate binge alcohol consumption. The present study is designed to examine the relationship between binge alcohol consumption and the activity of the CIN in real time by using an in vivo microendoscopic technique. We hypothesized that mice exposed to Drinking in the Dark (DID)&amp;amp;mdash;a recognized mouse model for binge drinking&amp;amp;mdash;would exhibit increased activity in the accumbal shell region (NAcSh). To test this hypothesis, male mice expressing Cre-recombinase in the cholinergic neurons were exposed to binge alcohol consumption (alcohol group), employing the DID method, and utilized in vivo calcium imaging to observe CIN activity in real time during alcohol consumption. The control (sucrose) group was exposed to 10% (w/v) sucrose. As compared to sucrose, mice in the alcohol group displayed a significant increase in the frequency and amplitude of discharge activity, which was measured using calcium transients in the CIN present in the NAcSh. In summary, our findings suggest that the activity of CIN in the NAcSh plays a crucial role in alcohol self-administration. These results emphasize the potential significance of targeting CIN activity as a therapeutic approach for addressing AUD.</p>

	<p>Background: Despite the availability of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treating obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD), alternative approaches need to be explored due to the high likelihood of treatment resistance. Neuronavigated 20 Hz theta burst stimulation (TBS-20 Hz), targeting the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) augmented with the right orbitofrontal cortex (ROFC), was tested for treating OCD comorbid with depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on fourteen patients treated for moderate-to-severe OCD in a private outpatient clinic. Twelve patients had comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), and thirteen patients had either generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder (PD). Patients completed the Y-BOCS-SR, BDI-II, and BAI rating scales weekly, which were used to measure the changes in OCD, depression, and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Results: Neuronavigated TBS-20 Hz was sequentially applied to the right DLPFC (RDLPFC), left DLPFC (LDLPFC), and ROFC. A total of 64% (9/14) of patients achieved remission from OCD (Y-BOCS-SR &amp;amp;le; 14) in an average of 6.1 weeks of treatment (SD = 4.0). A total of 58% (7/12) of patients remitted from MDD (BDI &amp;amp;lt; 13) in an average of 4.1 weeks (SD = 2.8), and 62% (8/13) of patients remitted from GAD/PD (BAI &amp;amp;lt; 8) in an average of 4.3 weeks (SD = 2.5). Conclusions: The neuronavigated TBS-20 Hz sequential stimulation of RDLPFC and LDLPFC, followed by ROFC, significantly reduced OCD, MDD, and GAD/PD symptoms. Randomized sham controls are warranted to validate these results.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between Cathepsin B and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD), with a particular focus on determining the role of N-acetylaspartate as a potential mediator. Methods: We used summary-level data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, exploring the association between Cathepsin B (3301 cases) and PD (4681 cases). A sequential two-step MR approach was applied (8148 cases) to study the role of N-acetylaspartate. Results: The MR analysis yielded that genetically predicted elevated Cathepsin B levels correlated with a reduced risk of developing PD (p = 0.0133, OR: 0.9171, 95% CI: 0.8563&amp;amp;ndash;0.9821). On the other hand, the analysis provided insufficient evidence to determine that PD affected Cathepsin B levels (p = 0.8567, OR: 1.0035, 95% CI: 0.9666&amp;amp;ndash;1.0418). The estimated effect of N-acetylaspartate in this process was 7.52% (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;3.65% to 18.69%). Conclusions: This study suggested that elevated Cathepsin B levels decreased the risk of developing PD, with the mediation effect of N-acetylaspartate. Further research is needed to better understand this relationship.</p>

	<p>Hyperserotonemia is one of the most studied endophenotypes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there are still no unequivocal results about its causes or biological and behavioral outcomes. This systematic review summarizes the studies investigating the relationship between blood serotonin (5-HT) levels and ASD, comparing diagnostic tools, analytical methods, and clinical outcomes. A literature search on peripheral 5-HT levels and ASD was conducted. In total, 1104 publications were screened, of which 113 entered the present systematic review. Of these, 59 articles reported hyperserotonemia in subjects with ASD, and 26 presented correlations between 5-HT levels and ASD-core clinical outcomes. The 5-HT levels are increased in about half, and correlations between hyperserotonemia and clinical outcomes are detected in a quarter of the studies. The present research highlights a large amount of heterogeneity in this field, ranging from the characterization of ASD and control groups to diagnostic and clinical assessments, from blood sampling procedures to analytical methods, allowing us to delineate critical topics for future studies.</p>

                <p>The primary motor cortex (M1) integrates sensory and cognitive inputs to generate voluntary movement. Its functional impairments have been implicated in the pathophysiology of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, dopaminergic degeneration and basal ganglia dysfunction entrain M1 neurons into the abnormally synchronized bursting pattern of activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. However, how degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons affects the anatomy, microcircuit connectivity, and function of the M1 network remains poorly understood. The present study examined whether and how the loss of dopamine (DA) affects the morphology, cellular excitability, and synaptic physiology of Layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing (PV<sup>+</sup>) cells in the M1 of mice of both sexes. Here, we reported that loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons does not alter the number, morphology, and physiology of Layer 5 PV<sup>+</sup> cells in M1. Moreover, we demonstrated that the number of perisomatic PV<sup>+</sup> puncta of M1 pyramidal neurons as well as their functional innervation of cortical pyramidal neurons were not altered following the loss of DA. Together, the present study documents an intact GABAergic inhibitory network formed by PV<sup>+</sup> cells following the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.</p>

                <p>More and more patients worldwide are diagnosed with dementia, which emphasizes the urgent need for early detection markers. In this study, we built on the auditory hypersensitivity theory of a previous study&mdash;which postulated that responses to auditory input in the subcortex as well as cortex are enhanced in cognitive decline&mdash;and examined auditory encoding of natural continuous speech at both neural levels for its indicative potential for cognitive decline. We recruited study participants aged 60 years and older, who were divided into two groups based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, one group with low scores (<I>n</I> = 19, participants with signs of cognitive decline) and a control group (<I>n</I> = 25). Participants completed an audiometric assessment and then we recorded their electroencephalography while they listened to an audiobook and click sounds. We derived temporal response functions and evoked potentials from the data and examined response amplitudes for their potential to predict cognitive decline, controlling for hearing ability and age. Contrary to our expectations, no evidence of auditory hypersensitivity was observed in participants with signs of cognitive decline; response amplitudes were comparable in both cognitive groups. Moreover, the combination of response amplitudes showed no predictive value for cognitive decline. These results challenge the proposed hypothesis and emphasize the need for further research to identify reliable auditory markers for the early detection of cognitive decline.</p>

                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                The routine genomic surveillance of pathogens in diverse geographical settings and equitable data sharing are critical to inform effective infection control and therapeutic development. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of routine genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to detect emerging variants of concern. However, the majority of high-income countries sequenced >0.5% of their COVID-19 cases, unlike low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, many countries around the world had managed to establish capacity for pathogen genomic surveillance. Notably, Beta and Omicron; 2 of the 5 current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were first discovered in Africa through an aggressive sequencing campaign led by African scientists. To sustain such infrastructure and expertise beyond this pandemic, other endemic pathogens should leverage this investment. Therefore, countries are establishing multi-pathogen genomic surveillance strategies. Here we provide a catalog of the current landscape of sequenced and publicly shared pathogens in different countries in Africa. Drawing upon our collective knowledge and expertise, we review the ever-evolving challenges and propose innovative recommendations.

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                <p>by Hazal Koptagel, Seong-Hwan Jun, Joanna Hård, Jens Lagergren</p>

Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method’s robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells.

                <p>by Raphael Sonabend, Hugo Gruson, Leo Wolansky, Agnes Kiragga, Daniel S. Katz</p>

This paper extends the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines to provide criteria for assessing if software conforms to best practices in open source. By adding “USE” (User-Centered, Sustainable, Equitable), software development can adhere to open source best practice by incorporating user-input early on, ensuring front-end designs are accessible to all possible stakeholders, and planning long-term sustainability alongside software design. The FAIR-USE4OS guidelines will allow funders and researchers to more effectively evaluate and plan open-source software projects. There is good evidence of funders increasingly mandating that all funded research software is open source; however, even under the FAIR guidelines, this could simply mean software released on public repositories with a Zenodo DOI. By creating FAIR-USE software, best practice can be demonstrated from the very beginning of the design process and the software has the greatest chance of success by being impactful.

                Background In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organization recommended the use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) to curb transmission, leading to increased production and use. This has posed a danger of production and use of poor-quality ABHRs. Methods This study assessed and compared the quality of ABHRs in the Kenyan market that were produced before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Quality testing was carried out against European EN 1500:2013 and Kenyan EAS 789:2013 Standards and 20 samples analyzed for alcohol content by GC-FID. Results The study found that 27.8% of the peri-COVID-19 pandemic sanitizers had less than 90% bactericidal reduction activity as compared to 12.5% manufactured pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Only 25% peri-COVID-19 pandemic ABHRs met the EAS 789:2013 acceptable limit of over 60% alcohol content. Product adulteration with methanol was found in 20 % of the samples with only 5% complying with FDA approval limit of <0.063% v/v methanol. Study found no correlation between the total alcohol content and the efficacy of ABHRs. Conclusions The study found that more substandard products were produced during the pandemic. This raises a concern about possible emergence of alcohol resistant strains of microorganisms. The study therefore recommends an adequate quality monitoring system to curb against substandard products.

                Background Parthenium is an invasive annual weed that affects crop production, rangelands, grasslands, animals, the environment, and human health. Since its introduction into Ethiopia, different management options such as uprooting, slashing, burning, plowing, and applying synthetic herbicides have been practiced. However, these options are not sustainable in weed management. However, Zygogramma bicolorata is known to be used in different countries. Although many countries use it under field conditions, its population-based efficacy has not been well studied in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Z. bicolorata populations on parthenium plants under greenhouse conditions. Methods This experiment was conducted at the Ambo Agricultural Research Center. Different numbers of Z. bicolorata per plant were used as treatments and were laid out in a completely randomized design with three replications. The numbers of damaged leaves, eggs, and larvae were recorded daily until the leaves were completely defoliated. The collected data and the correlation between beetle population and leaf defoliation were analyzed using SAS. Results The result revealed that all beetle populations caused damage to weed plants. A higher population of beetles completely defoliated the leaves within 12 days. However, lower numbers required 21 days to completely defoliate the weed. In contrast, a higher number of eggs (328.67) and larvae (272.33) were obtained from plants that received 20 pairs of beetles. The beetle population and exposure time were positively correlated, and the effectiveness of the bioagent was greater following the emergence of larvae. Conclusions Z. bicolorata can manage parthenium weeds, even with a lower population. However, more than 15 pairs of beetles could be suggested to manage weeds in a shorter time, and further study is needed under field conditions by considering the different agroecologies of the country.

                Background This study aims to develop a vulnerability map for Surabaya using GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to assess the city’s vulnerability to COVID-19. Methods Six key factors influencing vulnerability were identified and their relative importance determined through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) pairwise comparison matrix. GIS was utilized to classify Surabaya’s vulnerability into five levels: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Results The resulting vulnerability map provides essential insights for decision-makers, healthcare professionals, and disaster management teams. It enables strategic resource allocation, targeted interventions, and formulation of comprehensive response strategies tailored to specific needs of vulnerable districts. Conclusions Through these measures, Surabaya can enhance its resilience and preparedness, ensuring the well-being of its residents in the face of potential emergency outbreaks.
