	<p>The technology for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has significantly changed over the years, with important improvements in the signal generators, the coils, the positioning systems, and the software for modeling, optimization, and therapy planning. In this systematic literature review (SLR), the evolution of each component of TMS technology is presented and analyzed to assess the limitations to overcome. This SLR was carried out following the PRISMA 2020 statement. Published articles of TMS were searched for in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, IEEE). Conference papers and other reviews were excluded. Records were filtered using terms about TMS technology with a semi-automatic software; articles that did not present new technology developments were excluded manually. After this screening, 101 records were included, with 19 articles proposing new stimulator designs (18.8%), 46 presenting or adapting coils (45.5%), 18 proposing systems for coil placement (17.8%), and 43 implementing algorithms for coil optimization (42.6%). The articles were blindly classified by the authors to reduce the risk of bias. However, our results could have been influenced by our research interests, which would affect conclusions for applications in psychiatric and neurological diseases. Our analysis indicates that more emphasis should be placed on optimizing the current technology with a special focus on the experimental validation of models. With this review, we expect to establish the base for future TMS technological developments.</p>

	<p>Background and Aims. Most research on Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) focuses on describing symptoms and movement characteristics. Studies rarely focus on the early detection of PD and the search for suitable markers of a prodromal stage. Early detection is important, so treatments that may potentially change the course of the disease can be attempted early on. While gait disturbances are less pronounced in the early stages of the disease, the prevalence, and severity increase with disease progression. Therefore, postural instability and gait difficulties could be identified as sensitive biomarkers. The aim was to evaluate the discriminatory power of the Trail-Walking Test (TWT; Schott, 2015) as a potential diagnostic instrument to improve the predictive power of the clinical evaluation concerning the severity of the disease and record the different aspects of walking. Methods. A total of 20 older healthy (M = 72.4 years, SD = 5.53) adults and 43 older adults with PD and the motor phenotypes postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD; M = 69.7 years, SD = 8.68) and tremor dominant (TD; M = 68.2 years, SD = 8.94) participated in the study. The participants performed a motor-cognitive dual task (DT) of increasing cognitive difficulty in which they had to walk a given path (condition 1), walk to numbers in ascending order (condition 2), and walk to numbers and letters alternately and in ascending order (condition 3). Results. With an increase in the cognitive load, the time to complete the tasks (seconds) became longer in all groups, F(1.23, 73.5) = 121, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;#627;2p = 0.670. PIGD showed the longest times in all conditions of the TWT, F(2, 60) = 8.15, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;#627;2p = 0.214. Mutual interferences in the cognitive and motor domain can be observed. However, clear group-specific patterns cannot be identified. A differentiation between the motor phenotypes of PD is especially feasible with the purely motor condition (TWT-M; AUC = 0.685, p = 0.44). Conclusions. PD patients with PIGD must be identified by valid, well-evaluated clinical tests that allow for a precise assessment of the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s individual fall risk, the severity of the disease, and the prognosis of progression. The TWT covers various aspects of mobility, examines the relationship between cognitive functions and walking, and enables differentiation of the motor phenotypes of PD.</p>

	<p>Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the only etiological technique for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Whilst there is a consensus MVD is likely effective regardless of age, the elderly population is thought to be more prone to have a higher rate of surgical complication, morbidity, and mortality. The main objective of our single-center, retrospective study was to analyze the surgical and clinical outcomes of MVD in TN elderly patients. From a surgical series of patients with TN who had undergone MVD from April 2018 to April 2022, 76 patients who matched the inclusion criteria were divided into two groups: twenty-five (32.9%) patients were older than 65 years and included in the elderly group, while the remaining fifty-one (61.1%) patients were below 65 years included in the non-elderly one. There were no differences between the groups in terms of acute pain relief (APR), Barrow Neurological Index (BNI) at follow-up, complications, and recurrence rate. In multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression analysis) the presence of an offending artery with nerve root distortion/indentation emerged as the only independent prognostic factor for pain-free survival (p = 0.0001). Our data endorse MVD as a safe and effective surgical procedure also for elderly patients with TN.</p>

	<p>The current study investigated the bottom-up experiential emotion regulation in comparison to the cognitiveve top down-approach of cognitive defusion. Rooted in an experiential- and client-centered psychotherapeutic approach, experiential emotion regulation involves an active, non-intervening, accepting, open and welcoming approach towards the bodily felt affective experience in a welcoming, compassionate way, expressed in &amp;amp;lsquo;experiential awareness&amp;amp;rsquo; in a first phase, and its verbalization or &amp;amp;lsquo;experiential expression&amp;amp;rsquo; in a second phase. Defusion refers to the ability to observe one&amp;amp;rsquo;s thoughts and feelings in a detached manner. Nineteen healthy participants completed an emotion regulation task during fMRI scanning by processing highly arousing negative events by images. Both experiential emotion regulation and cognitive defusion resulted in higher negative emotion compared to a &amp;amp;lsquo;watch&amp;amp;rsquo; control condition. On the neurophysiological level, experiential emotion regulation recruited brain areas that regulate attention towards affective- and somatosensorial experience such as the anterior cingulate cortex, the paracingulate gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the prefrontal pole, areas underlying multisensory information integration (e.g., angular gyrus), and linking body states to emotion recognition and awareness (e.g., postcentral gyrus). Experiential emotion regulation, relative to the control condition, also resulted in a higher interaction between the anterior insular cortex and left amygdala while participants experienced less negative emotion. Cognitive defusion decreased activation in the subcortical areas such as the brainstem, the thalamus, the amygdala, and the hippocampus. In contrast to cognitive defusion, experiential emotion regulation relative to demonstrated greater activation in the left angular gyrus, indicating more multisensory information integration. These findings provide insight into different and specific neural networks underlying psychotherapy-based experiential emotion regulation and cognitive defusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Lateralization of Autonomic Output in Response to Limb-Specific Threat</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In times of stress or danger, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) signals the fight or flight response. A canonical function of ANS activity is to globally mobilize metabolic resources, preparing the organism to respond to threat. Yet a body of research has demonstrated that, rather than displaying a homogenous pattern across the body, autonomic responses to arousing events, as measured through changes in electrodermal activity (EDA), can differ between right and left body locations. Surprisingly, an attempt to identify a function of ANS asymmetry consistent with its metabolic role has not been investigated. In the current study, we investigated whether asymmetric autonomic responses could be induced through limb-specific aversive stimulation. Participants were given mild electric stimulation to either the left or right arm while EDA was monitored bilaterally. In a group-level analyses, an ipsilateral EDA response bias was observed, with increased EDA response in the hand adjacent to the stimulation. This effect was observable in ~50% of individual participants. These results demonstrate that autonomic output is more complex than canonical interpretations suggest. We suggest that, in stressful situations, autonomic outputs can prepare either the whole-body fight or flight response, or a simply a limb-localized flick, which can effectively neutralize the threat while minimizing global resource consumption. These findings are consistent with recent theories proposing evolutionary leveraging of neural structures organized to mediate sensory responses for processing of cognitive emotional cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hierarchical Individual Naturalistic Functional Brain Networks with Group Consistency Uncovered by a Two-Stage NAS-Volumetric Sparse DBN Framework</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The functional magnetic resonance imaging under naturalistic paradigm (NfMRI) showed great advantages in identifying complex and interactive functional brain networks (FBNs) because of its dynamics and multimodal information. In recent years, various deep learning models, such as deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE), deep belief network (DBN), and volumetric sparse DBN (vsDBN), can obtain hierarchical FBNs and temporal features from fMRI data. Among them, the vsDBN model revealed a good capability in identifying hierarchical FBNs by modeling fMRI volume images. However, because of the high dimensionality of fMRI volumes and the diverse training parameters of deep learning methods, especially the network architecture that is the most critical parameter for uncovering the hierarchical organization of human brain function, researchers still face challenges in designing an appropriate deep learning framework with automatic network architecture optimization to model volumetric NfMRI. In addition, most of the existing deep learning models ignore the group-wise consistency and intersubject variation properties embedded in NfMRI volumes. To solve these problems, we proposed a two-stage neural architecture search (NAS) and vsDBN model (two-stage NAS-vsDBN model) to identify the hierarchical human brain spatiotemporal features possessing both group consistency and individual uniqueness under naturalistic condition. Moreover, our model defined reliable network structure for modeling volumetric NfMRI data via NAS framework, and the group-level and individual-level FBNs and associated temporal features exhibited great consistency. In general, our method well identified the hierarchical temporal and spatial features of the brain function and revealed the crucial properties of neural processes under natural viewing condition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Barriers to participation in research as perceived by undergraduate medical students: A cross-sectional study from Qassim. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Medical students` engagement in research activities continues to be below the expectation. In this study we aimed to investigate students` views about research, and to identify the barriers preventing them from participation in research projects. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Qassim University. A total of 230 students were included. The perceptions of students were assessed using a 16-item questionnaire. The mean scores were compared between students using Mann-Whitney test .Factors associated with students` perception of research barriers were analyzed using four separate logistic regression models. Results: The overall response rate was 89.4%. The results indicate that the students generally possess a moderately positive attitude towards research with a mean score of 14.8Â±2.7 (range: 5-25). A substantial number of participants reported their willingness to take part in any research-related task (77.0%). However, the participants highly agreed that lack of time (70.4%), lack of supervision and guidance (72.6%), lack of research training and support (73.9%), and lack of research exposure and opportunities (75.2%) were major barriers to their participation in research .We found that students having lower CGPA ranks are almost three times more likely to indicate lack of time as a challenge (AOR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.09,7.94; p.value=0.033). Overall, female students were more likely to report concerns about research training and availability of research opportunities, while male students were more likely to indicate lack of time and lack of supervision as research barriers. Conclusions: The barriers addressed in the current study âboth discretely and cumulativelyâare highly demotivating for students, and negatively affect their participation in research. Efforts should be invested to shift the focus from providing superficial research exposure to incorporating more in-depth and effective research training for undergraduate students

                The last 50 years have witnessed extraordinary discoveries in the field of circadian rhythms. However, there are still several mysteries that remain. One of these chronobiological mysteries is the circadian rhythm that is revealed by administration of stimulant drugs to rodents. Herein we describe the discovery of this circadian rhythm and its underlying oscillator, which is frequently called the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator, or MASCO. This oscillator is distinct from canonical circadian oscillators because it controls robust activity rhythms independently of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and canonical circadian genes are not essential for its timekeeping. We discuss these fundamental properties of MASCO and synthesize studies of strain, sex, and circadian gene mutations on MASCO. The anatomical loci of MASCO are not known, so it has not been possible thus far to discover its novel molecular timekeeping mechanism or its functional significance. However, studies in mutant mice suggest that genetic approaches can be used to identify the neural network involved in the rhythm generation of MASCO. We also discuss parallels between human and rodent studies that support our working hypothesis that a function of MASCO may be to regulate sleep-wake cycles.

                Background: Dictyostelium discoideum is a ~10 Âµm diameter unicellular eukaryote that lives on soil surfaces. When starved, D. discoideum cells aggregate into streams of cells in a process called chemotaxis. In this report, we studied D. discoideum cells during chemotaxis using 3D - mass spectrometry imaging (3D-MSI). Methods: The 3D-MSI consisted of the sequential generation of 2D molecular maps using burst alignment coupled to delayed extraction time-of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) combined with a soft sputtering beam to access the different layers. Results: Molecular maps with sub-cellular high spatial resolution (~300 nm) indicated the presence of ions at m/z = 221 and 236 at the front and sides, but reduced levels at the back, of cells moving toward of aggregation streams. The 3D-MSI also detected an ion at m/z = 240 at the edges and back, but reduced levels at the front, of aggregating cells. Other ions showed an even distribution across the cells. Conclusions: Together, these results demonstrate the utility of sub-micron MSI to study eukaryotic chemotaxis.

                Antecedentes La malaria urbana es un problema de salud pÃºblica en Colombia y aÃºn existe desconocimiento sobre sus caracterÃ­sticas epidemiolÃ³gicas, las cuales son clave para la implementaciÃ³n de medidas de control. La presencia de casos de malaria urbana y el diagnÃ³stico de la enfermedad son algunos de los desafÃ­os que enfrentan los programas de eliminaciÃ³n de la malaria. El objetivo de esta investigaciÃ³n fue estimar la prevalencia de malaria, explorar factores asociados y detectar genes pfhrp 2/3 , en la zona urbana de Tumaco entre julio y diciembre de 2019. MÃ©todos Se realizÃ³ un estudio de prevalencia utilizando un muestreo probabilÃ­stico aleatorio estratificado. Se administraron encuestas estructuradas y se tomaron muestras de sangre y se examinaron mediante microscopÃ­a Ã³ptica, pruebas de diagnÃ³stico rÃ¡pido (RDT) y reacciÃ³n en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR). Se utilizÃ³ un modelo de regresiÃ³n logÃ­stica para explorar los factores asociados. Resultados Se encuestÃ³ a 1.504 personas que vivÃ­an en 526 hogares. La prevalencia global fue del 2,97% (IC 95%: 2,1 - 4,3%). Fue mayor en varones, en el grupo de edad de 10 a 19 aÃ±os y en casos asintomÃ¡ticos. La prevalencia de la amplificaciÃ³n de pfhrp2 fue del 2,16 % (IC del 95 %: 1,6 - 2,9 %). Los hogares con tres o mÃ¡s personas tenÃ­an un mayor riesgo de infecciÃ³n por paludismo (odds ratio ajustado [ORa] 4,05; intervalo de confianza [IC] del 95%: 1,57-10,43). Todos los casos se debieron a P. falciparum. Conclusiones La prevalencia de malaria urbana fue baja. Las estrategias para eliminar la malaria en Ã¡reas urbanas deben ajustarse considerando el acceso al diagnÃ³stico temprano, la infecciÃ³n asintomÃ¡tica y las PDR utilizadas para detectar la presencia del gen pfhrp2 .

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stability criteria for the consumption and exchange of essential resources</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Theo Gibbs, Yifan Zhang, Zachary R. Miller, James P. OâDwyer</p>

Models of consumer effects on a shared resource environment have helped clarify how the interplay of consumer traits and resource supply impact stable coexistence. Recent models generalize this picture to include the exchange of resources alongside resource competition. These models exemplify the fact that although consumers shape the resource environment, the outcome of consumer interactions is context-dependent: such models can have either stable or unstable equilibria, depending on the resource supply. However, these recent models focus on a simplified version of microbial metabolism where the depletion of resources always leads to consumer growth. Here, we model an arbitrarily large system of consumers governed by Liebigâs law, where species require and deplete multiple resources, but each consumerâs growth rate is only limited by a single one of these resources. Resources that are taken up but not incorporated into new biomass are leaked back into the environment, possibly transformed by intracellular reactions, thereby tying the mismatch between depletion and growth to cross-feeding. For this set of dynamics, we show that feasible equilibria can be either stable or unstable, again depending on the resource environment. We identify special consumption and production networks which protect the community from instability when resources are scarce. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the qualitative stability patterns derived analytically apply to a broader class of network structures and resource inflow profiles, including cases where multiple species coexist on only one externally supplied resource. Our stability criteria bear some resemblance to classic stability results for pairwise interactions, but also demonstrate how environmental context can shape coexistence patterns when resource limitation and exchange are modeled directly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Investigating differential abundance methods in microbiome data: A benchmark study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marco Cappellato, Giacomo Baruzzo, Barbara Di Camillo</p>

The development of increasingly efficient and cost-effective high throughput DNA sequencing techniques has enhanced the possibility of studying complex microbial systems. Recently, researchers have shown great interest in studying the microorganisms that characterise different ecological niches. Differential abundance analysis aims to find the differences in the abundance of each taxa between two classes of subjects or samples, assigning a significance value to each comparison. Several bioinformatic methods have been specifically developed, taking into account the challenges of microbiome data, such as sparsity, the different sequencing depth constraint between samples and compositionality. Differential abundance analysis has led to important conclusions in different fields, from health to the environment. However, the lack of a known biological truth makes it difficult to validate the results obtained. In this work we exploit metaSPARSim, a microbial sequencing count data simulator, to simulate data with differential abundance features between experimental groups. We perform a complete comparison of recently developed and established methods on a common benchmark with great effort to the reliability of both the simulated scenarios and the evaluation metrics. The performance overview includes the investigation of numerous scenarios, studying the effect on methodsâ results on the main covariates such as sample size, percentage of differentially abundant features, sequencing depth, feature variability, normalisation approach and ecological niches. Mainly, we find that methods show a good control of the type I error and, generally, also of the false discovery rate at high sample size, while recall seem to depend on the dataset and sample size.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constructing functional models from biophysically-detailed neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Duggins, Chris Eliasmith</p>

Improving biological plausibility and functional capacity are two important goals for brain models that connect low-level neural details to high-level behavioral phenomena. We develop a method called âoracle-supervised Neural Engineering Frameworkâ (osNEF) to train biologically-detailed spiking neural networks that realize a variety of cognitively-relevant dynamical systems. Specifically, we train networks to perform computations that are commonly found in cognitive systems (communication, multiplication, harmonic oscillation, and gated working memory) using four distinct neuron models (leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, Izhikevich neurons, 4-dimensional nonlinear point neurons, and 4-compartment, 6-ion-channel layer-V pyramidal cell reconstructions) connected with various synaptic models (current-based synapses, conductance-based synapses, and voltage-gated synapses). We show that osNEF networks exhibit the target dynamics by accounting for nonlinearities present within the neuron models: performance is comparable across all four systems and all four neuron models, with variance proportional to task and neuron model complexity. We also apply osNEF to build a model of working memory that performs a delayed response task using a combination of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons connected with NMDA and GABA synapses. The baseline performance and forgetting rate of the model are consistent with animal data from delayed match-to-sample tasks (DMTST): we observe a baseline performance of 95% and exponential forgetting with time constant <i>Ï</i> = 8.5s, while a recent meta-analysis of DMTST performance across species observed baseline performances of 58 â 99% and exponential forgetting with time constants of <i>Ï</i> = 2.4 â 71s. These results demonstrate that osNEF can train functional brain models using biologically-detailed components and open new avenues for investigating the relationship between biophysical mechanisms and functional capabilities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Architect: A tool for aiding the reconstruction of high-quality metabolic models through improved enzyme annotation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nirvana Nursimulu, Alan M. Moses, John Parkinson</p>

Constraint-based modeling is a powerful framework for studying cellular metabolism, with applications ranging from predicting growth rates and optimizing production of high value metabolites to identifying enzymes in pathogens that may be targeted for therapeutic interventions. Results from modeling experiments can be affected at least in part by the quality of the metabolic models used. Reconstructing a metabolic network manually can produce a high-quality metabolic model but is a time-consuming task. At the same time, current methods for automating the process typically transfer metabolic function based on sequence similarity, a process known to produce many false positives. We created Architect, a pipeline for automatic metabolic model reconstruction from protein sequences. First, it performs enzyme annotation through an ensemble approach, whereby a likelihood score is computed for an EC prediction based on predictions from existing tools; for this step, our method shows both increased precision and recall compared to individual tools. Next, Architect uses these annotations to construct a high-quality metabolic network which is then gap-filled based on likelihood scores from the ensemble approach. The resulting metabolic model is output in SBML format, suitable for constraints-based analyses. Through comparisons of enzyme annotations and curated metabolic models, we demonstrate improved performance of Architect over other state-of-the-art tools, notably with higher precision and recall on the eukaryote <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> and when compared to UniProt annotations in two bacterial species. Code for Architect is available at https://github.com/ParkinsonLab/Architect. For ease-of-use, Architect can be readily set up and utilized using its Docker image, maintained on Docker Hub.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparing and linking machine learning and semi-mechanistic models for the predictability of endemic measles dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Max S. Y. Lau, Alex Becker, Wyatt Madden, Lance A. Waller, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Bryan T. Grenfell</p>

Measles is one the best-documented and most-mechanistically-studied non-linear infectious disease dynamical systems. However, systematic investigation into the comparative performance of traditional mechanistic models and machine learning approaches in forecasting the transmission dynamics of this pathogen are still rare. Here, we compare one of the most widely used semi-mechanistic models for measles (TSIR) with a commonly used machine learning approach (LASSO), comparing performance and limits in predicting short to long term outbreak trajectories and seasonality for both regular and less regular measles outbreaks in England and Wales (E&W) and the United States. First, our results indicate that the proposed LASSO model can efficiently use data from multiple major cities and achieve similar short-to-medium term forecasting performance to semi-mechanistic models for E&W epidemics. Second, interestingly, the LASSO model also captures annual to biennial bifurcation of measles epidemics in E&W caused by susceptible response to the late 1940s baby boom. LASSO may also outperform TSIR for predicting less-regular dynamics such as those observed in major cities in US between 1932â45. Although both approaches capture short-term forecasts, accuracy suffers for both methods as we attempt longer-term predictions in highly irregular, post-vaccination outbreaks in E&W. Finally, we illustrate that the LASSO model can both qualitatively and quantitatively reconstruct mechanistic assumptions, notably susceptible dynamics, in the TSIR model. Our results characterize the limits of predictability of infectious disease dynamics for strongly immunizing pathogens with both mechanistic and machine learning models, and identify connections between these two approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Connectivity concepts in neuronal network modeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Johanna Senk, Birgit Kriener, Mikael Djurfeldt, Nicole Voges, Han-Jia Jiang, Lisa SchÃ¼ttler, Gabriele Gramelsberger, Markus Diesmann, Hans E. Plesser, Sacha J. van Albada</p>

Sustainable research on computational models of neuronal networks requires published models to be understandable, reproducible, and extendable. Missing details or ambiguities about mathematical concepts and assumptions, algorithmic implementations, or parameterizations hinder progress. Such flaws are unfortunately frequent and one reason is a lack of readily applicable standards and tools for model description. Our work aims to advance complete and concise descriptions of network connectivity but also to guide the implementation of connection routines in simulation software and neuromorphic hardware systems. We first review models made available by the computational neuroscience community in the repositories ModelDB and Open Source Brain, and investigate the corresponding connectivity structures and their descriptions in both manuscript and code. The review comprises the connectivity of networks with diverse levels of neuroanatomical detail and exposes how connectivity is abstracted in existing description languages and simulator interfaces. We find that a substantial proportion of the published descriptions of connectivity is ambiguous. Based on this review, we derive a set of connectivity concepts for deterministically and probabilistically connected networks and also address networks embedded in metric space. Beside these mathematical and textual guidelines, we propose a unified graphical notation for network diagrams to facilitate an intuitive understanding of network properties. Examples of representative network models demonstrate the practical use of the ideas. We hope that the proposed standardizations will contribute to unambiguous descriptions and reproducible implementations of neuronal network connectivity in computational neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Impact of gender on the formation and outcome of formal mentoring relationships in the life sciences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leah P. Schwartz, Jean F. LiÃ©nard, Stephen V. David</p>

Despite increasing representation in graduate training programs, a disproportionate number of women leave academic research without obtaining an independent position that enables them to train the next generation of academic researchers. To understand factors underlying this trend, we analyzed formal PhD and postdoctoral mentoring relationships in the life sciences during the years 2000 to 2020. Student and mentor gender are both associated with differences in rates of studentâs continuation to positions that allow formal academic mentorship. Although trainees of women mentors are less likely to take on positions as academic mentors than trainees of men mentors, this effect is reduced substantially after controlling for several measurements of mentor status. Thus, the effect of mentor gender can be explained at least partially by gender disparities in social and financial resources available to mentors. Because trainees and mentors tend to be of the same gender, this association between mentor gender and academic continuation disproportionately impacts women trainees. On average, gender homophily in graduate training is unrelated to mentor status. A notable exception to this trend is the special case of scientists having been granted an outstanding distinction, evidenced by membership in the National Academy of Sciences, being a grantee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, or having been awarded the Nobel Prize. This group of mentors trains men graduate students at higher rates than their most successful colleagues. These results suggest that, in addition to other factors that limit career choices for women trainees, gender inequities in mentorsâ access to resources and prestige contribute to womenâs attrition from independent research positions.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Injury programs shape glioblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer in adults and is almost universally fatal due to its stark therapeutic resistance. During the past decade, although survival has not substantially improved, major advances have been made in our understanding of the underlying biology. It has become clear that these devastating tumors recapitulate features of neurodevelopmental hierarchies which are influenced by the microenvironment. Emerging evidence also highlights a prominent role for injury responses in steering cellular phenotypes and contributing to tumor heterogeneity.

                Infant animals spend the majority of each day asleep, but researchers are only beginning to delineate the contributions of sleep to sensory neurodevelopment. In this perspective, Blumberg etÂ al. provide a conceptual framework to guide future progress.

                The medial entorhinal cortex supports not only the encoding of the position one occupies in space, but also that of object location in a given environment. Caputi etÂ al. highlight the role of commissural input to the medial entorhinal cortex in the episodic memory retrieval of object location.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Low and high frequency intracranial neural signals match in the human associative cortex</a></h4>

              
                In vivo intracranial recordings of neural activity offer a unique opportunity to understand human brain function. Intracranial electrophysiological (iEEG) activity related to sensory, cognitive or motor events manifests mostly in two types of signals: event-related local field potentials in lower frequency bands (&lt;30 Hz, LF) and broadband activity in the higher end of the frequency spectrum (&gt;30 Hz, High frequency, HF). While most current studies rely exclusively on HF, thought to be more focal and closely related to spiking activity, the relationship between HF and LF signals is unclear, especially in human associative cortex. Here, we provide a large-scale in-depth investigation of the spatial and functional relationship between these 2 signals based on intracranial recordings from 121 individual brains (8000 recording sites). We measure category-selective responses to complex ecologically salient visual stimuli â human faces â across a wide cortical territory in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC), with a frequency-tagging method providing high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the same objective quantification of signal and noise for the two frequency ranges. While LF face-selective activity has higher SNR across the VOTC, leading to a larger number of significant electrode contacts especially in the anterior temporal lobe, LF and HF display highly similar spatial, functional, and timing properties. Specifically, and contrary to a widespread assumption, our results point to nearly identical spatial distribution and local spatial extent of LF and HF activity at equal SNR. These observations go a long way towards clarifying the relationship between the two main iEEG signals and reestablish the informative value of LF iEEG to understand human brain function.

                The mechanistic details of the tethered agonist mode of activation for the adhesion GPCR ADGRF5/GPR116 has not been completely deciphered. We set out to investigate the physiologic importance of autocatalytic cleavage upstream of the agonistic peptide sequence, an event necessary for NTF displacement and subsequent receptor activation. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized tethered agonist-mediated activation of GPR116 <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. A knock-in mouse expressing a non-cleavable GPR116 mutant phenocopies the pulmonary phenotype of GPR116 knock-out mice, demonstrating that tethered agonist-mediated receptor activation is indispensable for function <i>in vivo</i>. Using site-directed mutagenesis and species swapping approaches we identified key conserved amino acids for GPR116 activation in the tethered agonist sequence and in extracellular loops 2/3 (ECL2/3). We further highlight residues in transmembrane7 (TM7) that mediate stronger signaling in mouse versus human GPR116 and recapitulate these findings in a model supporting tethered agonist:ECL2 interactions for GPR116 activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct regions of H. pylori's bactofilin CcmA regulate protein-protein interactions to control helical cell shape</a></h4>

              
                The helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells promotes robust stomach colonization, however, how the helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells is determined is unresolved. Previous work identified helical-cell-shape-promoting protein complexes containing a peptidoglycan-hydrolase (Csd1), a peptidoglycan precursor synthesis enzyme (MurF), a non-enzymatic homologue of Csd1 (Csd2), non-enzymatic transmembrane proteins (Csd5 and Csd7), and a bactofilin (CcmA). Bactofilins are highly conserved, spontaneously polymerizing cytoskeletal bacterial proteins. We sought to understand CcmA's function in generating the helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells. Using CcmA deletion analysis, <i>in vitro</i> polymerization, and <i>in vivo</i> co-immunoprecipitation experiments we identified that the bactofilin domain and N-terminal region of CcmA are required for helical cell shape and the bactofilin domain of CcmA is sufficient for polymerization and interactions with Csd5 and Csd7. We also found that CcmA's N-terminal region inhibits interaction with Csd7. Deleting the N-terminal region of CcmA increases CcmA-Csd7 interactions and destabilizes the peptidoglycan-hydrolase Csd1. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that Csd5 recruits CcmA to the cell envelope and promotes CcmA enrichment at the major helical axis. Thus, CcmA helps organize cell-shape-determining proteins and peptidoglycan synthesis machinery to coordinate cell wall modification and synthesis, promoting the curvature required to build a helical cell.

                Lung cancer classification and treatment has been revolutionized by improving our understanding of driver mutations and the introduction of tumor microenvironment (TME)-associated immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite the significant improvement of lung cancer patient survival in response to either oncogene-targeted therapy or anticancer immunotherapy, many patients show initial or acquired resistance to these new therapies. Recent advances in genome sequencing reveal that specific driver mutations favor the development of an immunosuppressive TME phenotype, which may result in unfavorable outcomes in lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapies. Clinical studies with follow-up after immunotherapy, assessing oncogenic driver mutations and the TME immune profile, not only reveal the underlying potential molecular mechanisms in the resistant lung cancer patients but also hold the key to better treatment choices and the future of personalized medicine. In this review, we discuss the crosstalk between cancer cell genomic features and the TME to reveal the impact of genetic alterations on the TME phenotype. We also provide insights into the regulatory role of cellular TME components in defining the genetic landscape of cancer cells during tumor development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evidence accumulation, not âself-controlâ, explains dorsolateral prefrontal activation during normative choice</a></h4>

              
                What role do regions like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) play in normative behavior (e.g., generosity, healthy eating)? Some models suggest that dlPFC activation during normative choice reflects controlled inhibition or modulation of default hedonistic preferences. Here, we develop an alternative account, showing that evidence accumulation models predict trial-by-trial variation in dlPFC response across three fMRI paradigms and two self-control contexts (altruistic sacrifice and healthy eating). Using these models to simulate a variety of self-control dilemmas generated a novel prediction: although dlPFC activity might <i>typically</i> increase for norm-consistent choices, deliberate self-regulation focused on normative goals should <i>decrease</i> or even <i>reverse</i> this pattern (i.e., greater dlPFC response for hedonistic, self-interested choices). We confirmed these predictions in both altruistic and dietary choice contexts. Our results suggest that dlPFC response during normative choice may depend more on value-based evidence accumulation than inhibition of our baser instincts.

                Pleiotropy and genetic correlation are widespread features in GWAS, but they are often difficult to interpret at the molecular level. Here, we perform GWAS of 16 metabolites clustered at the intersection of amino acid catabolism, glycolysis, and ketone body metabolism in a subset of UK Biobank. We utilize the well-documented biochemistry jointly impacting these metabolites to analyze pleiotropic effects in the context of their pathways. Among the 213 lead GWAS hits, we find a strong enrichment for genes encoding pathway-relevant enzymes and transporters. We demonstrate that the effect directions of variants acting on biology between metabolite pairs often contrast with those of upstream or downstream variants as well as the polygenic background. Thus, we find that these outlier variants often reflect biology local to the traits. Finally, we explore the implications for interpreting disease GWAS, underscoring the potential of unifying biochemistry with dense metabolomics data to understand the molecular basis of pleiotropy in complex traits and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Injury-induced pulmonary tuft cells are heterogenous, arise independent of key Type 2 cytokines, and are dispensable for dysplastic repair</a></h4>

              
                While the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling. The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5<sup>+ </sup>dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4ra signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. In addition, tuft cell expansion occurred independently of type I or type III interferon signalling. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5<sup>+</sup> dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5<sup>+</sup> cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for murine lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fip1 is a multivalent interaction scaffold for processing factors in human mRNA 3' end biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                3' end formation of most eukaryotic mRNAs is dependent on the assembly of a ~1.5 megadalton multiprotein complex, that catalyzes the coupled reaction of pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. In mammals, the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) constitutes the core of the 3' end processing machinery onto which the remaining factors, including cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) and poly(A) polymerase (PAP), assemble. These interactions are mediated by Fip1, a CPSF subunit characterized by high degree of intrinsic disorder. Here, we report two crystal structures revealing the interactions of human Fip1 (hFip1) with CPSF30 and CstF77. We demonstrate that CPSF contains two copies of hFip1, each binding to the zinc finger (ZF) domains 4 and 5 of CPSF30. Using polyadenylation assays we show that the two hFip1 copies are functionally redundant in recruiting one copy of PAP, thereby increasing the processivity of RNA polyadenylation. We further show that the interaction between hFip1 and CstF77 is mediated via a short motif in the N-terminal 'acidic' region of hFip1. In turn, CstF77 competitively inhibits CPSF-dependent PAP recruitment and 3' polyadenylation. Taken together, these results provide a structural basis for the multivalent scaffolding and regulatory functions of hFip1 in 3' end processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Postpartum estrogen withdrawal induces deficits in affective behaviors and increases ÎFosB in D1 and D2 neurons in the nucleus accumbens core in mice</a></h4>

              
                In placental mammals, estradiol levels are chronically elevated during pregnancy, but quickly drop to prepartum levels following birth. This may produce an estrogen withdrawal state that has been linked to changes in affective states in humans and rodents during the postpartum period. The neural mechanisms underlying these affective changes, however, are understudied. We used a hormone-simulated pseudopregnancy (HSP), a model of postpartum estrogen withdrawal, in adult female C57BL/6 mice to test the impact of postpartum estrogen withdrawal on several behavioral measures of anxiety and motivation. We found that estrogen withdrawal following HSP increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, but not in the open field or marble burying tests. Although hormone treatment during HSP consistently increased sucrose consumption, sucrose preference was generally not impacted by hormone treatment or subsequent estrogen withdrawal. In the social motivation test, estrogen withdrawal decreased the amount of time spent in proximity to a social stimulus animal. These behavioral changes were accompanied by changes in the expression of {Delta}FosB, a transcription factor correlated with stable long-term plasticity, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Specifically, estrogen-withdrawn females had higher {Delta}FosB expression in the nucleus accumbens core. Using transgenic reporter mice, we found that this increase in {Delta}FosB occurred in both D1- and D2-expressing cells in the NAc core. Together, these results suggest that postpartum estrogen withdrawal impacts anxiety and motivation and increases {Delta}FosB in the NAc core.

                Spectrins are highly conserved molecules that form a distinct membrane associated periodic scaffold within axons thought to provide mechanical resilience. In C. elegans, UNC-70/{beta}-Spectrin also functions outside the nervous system, within the epidermis, to maintain the integrity of sensory neurons. The precise molecular organization and cellular mechanisms that mediate this protection are unknown. Here, using 3D-structured illumination microscopy, we show that within the epidermis spectrins form a crescent-shaped scaffold with a periodicity of ~ 200 nm that embraces adjacent axons. This epidermal spectrin scaffold is induced by developing axons and reformed during axonal regeneration, and creates a molecular imprint of the adjacent nervous system. Disruption of this epidermal scaffold causes widespread axonal damage in sensory and motor neurons. These findings reveal the existence of a distinct and periodic spectrin framework within the epidermis that is molded by the developing nervous system and is necessary to protect it from mechanical damage.

                Visceral pain is among the most prevalent and bothersome forms of chronic pain, but their transmission in the spinal cord is still poorly understood. Here we used a focal colorectal distention (fCRD) method to drive visceromotor responses (VMRs) plus affective pain-indicative aversive learning. We first found that spinal CCK neurons were necessary for noxious fCRD to drive both VMRs and aversion. We next showed that spinal VGLUT3 neurons mediate affective visceral allodynia, whose ablation caused loss of aversion evoked by low-intensity fCRD in mice with gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation or spinal circuit disinhibition. Importantly, these neurons are dispensable for driving VMRs. Anatomically, VGLUT3 neurons send projection to the parabrachial nuclei, whose photoactivation sufficiently generated aversion in mice with GI inflammation. Our studies suggest the presence of different spinal substrates that transmit nociceptive versus affective dimensions of visceral sensory information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Statistical Learning of Distractor Suppression Down-regulates Pre-Stimulus Neural Excitability in Early Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual attention is highly influenced by past experiences. Recent behavioral research has shown that expectations about the spatial location of distractors within a search array are implicitly learned, with expected distractors becoming less interfering. Little is known about the neural mechanism supporting this form of statistical learning. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure human brain activity to test whether proactive mechanisms are involved in the statistical learning of distractor locations. Specifically, we used a new technique called rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT) to assess neural excitability in early visual cortex during statistical learning of distractor suppression, while concurrently investigating the modulation of posterior alpha-band activity (8-12 Hz). Male and female human participants performed a visual search task in which a target was occasionally presented alongside a color-singleton distractor. Unbeknown to the participants, the distracting stimuli were presented with different probabilities across the two hemifields. RIFT analysis showed that early visual cortex exhibited reduced neural excitability in the pre-stimulus interval at retinotopic locations associated with higher distractor probabilities. In contrast, we did not find any evidence of expectation-driven distractor suppression in alpha-band activity. These findings indicate that proactive mechanisms of attention are involved in predictive distractor suppression and that these mechanisms are associated with altered neural excitability in early visual cortex. Moreover, our findings indicate that RIFT and alpha-band activity might subtend different and possibly independent attentional mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of TrkB in Parvalbumin interneurons is required for the promotion of reversal learning in spatial and fear memory by antidepressants</a></h4>

              
                Critical period-like plasticity (iPlasticity) can be reinstated in the adult brain by several interventions, including drugs and optogenetic modifications. We have demonstrated that a combination of iPlasticity with optimal training improves behaviors related to neuropsychiatric disorders. In this context, the activation of TrkB, a receptor for BDNF, in Parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons has a pivotal role in cortical network changes. However, it is unknown if the activation of TrkB in PV+ interneurons is important for other plasticity-related behaviors, especially for learning and memory. Here, using mice with heterozygous conditional TrkB deletion in PV+ interneurons (PV-TrkB hCKO) in Intellicage and fear erasure paradigms, we show that chronic treatment with fluoxetine, a widely prescribed antidepressant drug that is known to promote the activation of TrkB, enhances behavioral flexibility in spatial and fear memory, largely depending on the expression of the TrkB receptor in PV+ interneurons. In addition, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced by chronic treatment with fluoxetine in wild-type mice, but not in PV-TrkB hCKO mice. Transcriptomic analysis of PV+ interneurons after fluoxetine treatment indicated intrinsic changes in synaptic formation and downregulation of enzymes involved in perineuronal net (PNN) formation. Consistently, immunohistochemistry has shown that the fluoxetine treatment alters PV expression and reduces PNNs in PV+ interneurons, and here we show that TrkB expression in PV+ interneurons is required for these effects. Together, our results provide molecular and network mechanisms for the induction of critical period-like plasticity in adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the performance of multi-compartment relaxometry for myelin water imaging - Intra-subject and inter-protocol reproducibility</a></h4>

              
                We evaluate the test-retest repeatability and study the tissue properties of multicompartment relaxometry-based myelin water imaging (MCR-MWI) derived from different gradient echo (GRE) acquisition settings. Additionally, the variable flip angle acquisition scheme is optimised based on numerical simulations to reduce the acquisition time of MCR-MWI in a clinically practical range without using advanced image acquisition methods. For the test-retest analysis, in vivo imaging was performed to collect data from three healthy volunteers in two identical sessions. Three GRE sequence settings with different echo times and repetition times imitating various scanner setups were evaluated. The in vivo data was also used to validate the optimal variable flip angle combination derived from simulations. Bundle-specific profiles of MCR-MWI derived microstructural parameters were investigated, as well as the cross-correlations of those parameters. Good cross-session repeatability is observed for MCR-MWI. While good correlations can also be found in myelin water fraction (MWF) across protocols, systematic differences, particularly for protocols with different repetition times, are observed. Numerical simulations indicate that MCR-MWI can be performed with a minimum of three flip angles covering a wide range of T1 weighting without adding significant measurement bias and the result is supported by the in vivo experiment allowing whole brain 1.5mm isotropic MWF maps to be acquired in 9 minutes. Bundles-specific MWF analysis reveals that certain white matter bundles are similar in all three participants. We also found that microstructure relaxation parameters have low correlations with MWF. MCR-MWI is a reproducible measure of myelin. However, attention should be paid to considering the protocol related MWF differences for comparison studies, especially when different repetition times are used as this can introduce biases up to 0.5% of MWF in our tested protocols. The optimised flip angle acquisition scheme can reduce the total scan time to 40% of the original implementation without significant quality degradation.

                Regulation of microtubule cytoskeleton is fundamental for the development and maintenance of neuronal architecture. Recent studies have shown that regulated RNA processing is also critical for the establishment and maintenance of neural circuits. In a genetic screen using mechanosensory neurons of C. elegans, we identified a mutation in muscleblind-1 as a suppressor of loss of kinesin-13 family microtubule destabilizing factor klp-7. Muscleblind-1(MBL-1) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the splicing, localization, and stability of RNA. We found that mbl-1 is required cell-autonomously for axon growth and synapse formation in the posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) neuron. Loss of mbl-1 affects stability and plus-end-out organization of microtubules in the anterior process of PLM. These defects are also accompanied by abnormal axonal transport of the synaptic protein RAB-3 and loss of gentle touch sensation in mbl-1 mutant. Our data showed that mbl-1 is genetically epistatic to mec-7 ({beta}-tubulin) and mec-12 (-tubulin) for axon growth. The immunoprecipitation of MBL-1 pulls down the mec-7, mec-12, and sad-1 mRNAs. Additionally, the mbl-1 mutants show a reduction in the level and stability of mec-7 and mec-12 transcripts. Independently, mbl-1 is epistatic to sad-1 for synapse formation. Our work elucidated a previously unknown link between RNA binding protein and cytoskeletal machinery for the development and maintenance of the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theoretical limits on the speed of learning inverse models explain the rate of adaptation in arm reaching tasks</a></h4>

              
                An essential aspect of human motor learning is the formation of inverse models, which map desired actions to motor commands. Inverse models can be learned by adjusting parameters in neural circuits to minimize errors in the performance of motor tasks through gradient descent. However, the theory of gradient descent establishes an upper limit on the learning speed, above which learning becomes unstable. Specifically, the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the error surface around a minimum determine the maximum speed of learning in a given task.  Here, we use this theoretical framework to analyze the speed of learning in different inverse model learning architectures in a set of isometric arm-reaching tasks. We show theoretically that, for these isometric tasks, the error surface and, thus the speed of learning, are determined by the shapes of 1) the force manipulability ellipsoid of the arm and 2) the distribution of targets in the task. In particular, rounder manipulability ellipsoids generate a rounder error surface, allowing for faster learning of the inverse model. Rounder target distributions have a similar effect. We tested these predictions experimentally in a virtual quasi-isometric reaching task with a visuomotor transformation. The experimental results were consistent with our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, our analysis accounts for the speed of learning in previous experiments with incompatible and compatible virtual surgery tasks, and in visuomotor rotation tasks with different numbers of targets. By identifying aspects of a task that influence the speed of learning, our results provide theoretical principles for the design of motor tasks that allow for faster learning.

                Functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) can be used to investigate neurometabolic responses to external stimuli in-vivo, but findings to date are inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on 49 human fMRS studies that measured levels of the primary neurotransmitters Glutamate (Glu), Glx (Glutamate + Glutamine), and GABA. Data were extracted, grouped by metabolite, stimulus domain, and brain region, and then analysed by determining standardised effect sizes. The quality of individual studies (such as the choice of acquisition parameters and reporting quality) was rated with a standardised check list. When results were analysed by metabolite type across all studies, small to moderate effect sizes of 0.29-0.47 (p < 0.05) were observed for changes in Glu and Glx regardless of stimulus domain and brain region, but no significant effects were observed for GABA. Further analysis suggests that Glu, Glx and GABA responses differ by stimulus domain or task and vary depending on the time course of stimulation and data acquisition technique. In summary, we establish effect sizes and directionality of GABA, Glu and Glx response in all currently available fMRS studies. This work provides normative ground to improve consensus and reproducibility of fMRS research and highlights the importance of standardised reporting and minimal best practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Natural statistics of head roll: implications for Bayesian inference in spatial orientation</a></h4>

              
                We previously proposed a Bayesian model of multisensory integration in spatial orientation (1). Using a Gaussian prior, centered on an upright head orientation, this model could explain various perceptual observations in roll-tilted participants, such as the subjective visual vertical, the subjective body tilt (1), the rod-and-frame effect (2), as well as their clinical (3) and age-related deficits (4). Because it is generally assumed that the prior reflects an accumulated history of previous head orientations, and recent work on natural head motion suggests non-Gaussian statistics, we examined how the model would perform with a non-Gaussian prior. In the present study, we first experimentally generalized the previous observations in showing that also the natural statistics of head orientation are characterized by long tails, best quantified as a t-location-scale distribution. Next, we compared the performance of the Bayesian model and various model variants using such a t-distributed prior to the original model with the Gaussian prior on their accounts of previously published data of the subjective visual vertical and subjective body tilt tasks. All of these variants performed substantially worse than the original model, suggesting a special value of the Gaussian prior. We provide computational and neurophysiological reasons for the implementation of such a prior, in terms of its associated precision-accuracy trade-off in vertical perception across the tilt range.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapidly Inferring Personalized Neurostimulation Parameters with Meta-Learning: A Case Study of Individualized Fiber Recruitment in Vagus Nerve Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Neurostimulation is emerging as treatment for several diseases of the brain and peripheral organs. Due to variability arising from placement of stimulation devices, underlying neuroanatomy and physiological responses to stimulation, it is essential that neurostimulation protocols are personalized to maximize efficacy and safety. Building such personalized protocols would benefit from accumulated information in increasingly large datasets of other individuals' responses. Approach. To address that need, we propose a meta-learning family of algorithms to conduct few-shot optimization of key fitting parameters of physiological responses in new individuals. While our method is agnostic to neurostimulation modality, here we demonstrate its effectiveness on the problem of physiological modeling of fiber recruitment during vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Using data from acute VNS experiments, the mapping between amplitudes of stimulus-evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs) and physiological responses, such as heart rate and breathing interval modulation, is inferred. Main results. Using additional synthetic data sets to complement experimental results, we demonstrate that our meta-learning framework is capable of directly modeling the physiology-eCAP relationship for individual subjects with much fewer individually queried data points than standard methods. Significance. Our meta-learning framework is general and can be adapted to any input-response neurostimulation mapping problem. Moreover, this method leverages information from growing data sets of past patients, as a treatment is deployed. It can also be combined with several model types, including regression, Gaussian processes with Bayesian optimization, and beyond.

                Neurofilaments are one of the main cytoskeletal components in neurons and they can be found in the form of oligomers at pre- and postsynapses. How their presence is regulated at the postsynapse remains widely unclear. Here we systematically quantified by immunolabeling the occurrence of the neurofilament isoform triplet neurofilament light (NFL), medium (NFM), and heavy (NFH) at the postsynapse with STED nanoscopy together with markers of synaptic strength and activity. Our data shows that within dendritic spines neurofilament isoforms rarely colocalize with each other and that they are present to different extents, with NFL being the most abundant isoform. The amount of the three isoforms correlates with markers of postsynaptic strength and presynaptic activity to varying degrees: while NFL shows moderate correlation to both synaptic traits suggesting its involvement in synaptic response, NFM and NFH were only correlated on a low level. By quantifying the presence of neurofilaments at the postsynapse within the context of the synaptic status, this work sheds new light on the regulation of synaptic neurofilaments and their possible contribution to psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Upper limb joint coordination acts to preserve hand kinematics after a traumatic brachial plexus injury</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traumatic brachial plexus injury (TBPI) causes a sensorimotor deficit in upper limb (UL) movements. Objective: Our aim was to investigate the arm-forearm coordination of both the injured and uninjured UL of TBPI subjects. Methods: TBPI participants (n=13) and controls (n=10) matched in age, gender, and anthropometric characteristics were recruited. Kinematics from the shoulder, elbow, wrist and index finger markers were collected while upstanding participants transported a cup to mouth and returned the UL to a starting position. The UL coordination was measured through the relative phase (RP) between arm and forearm phase angles and analyzed as a function of the hand kinematics. Results: For all participants, the hand transport had a shorter time to peak velocity (p<0.01) compared to the return. Also, for the control and the uninjured TBPI UL, the RP showed a coordination pattern that favored forearm movements in the peak velocity of the transport phase (p<0.001). TBPI participants' injured UL showed a longer movement duration in comparison to controls (p<0.05), but no differences in peak velocity, time to peak velocity and trajectory length, indicating preserved hand kinematics. The RP of the injured UL revealed altered coordination in favor of arm movements compared to controls and to the uninjured UL (p<0.001). Finally, TBPI participants' uninjured UL showed altered control of arm and forearm phase angles during the deceleration of hand movements compared to controls (p<0.05). Conclusion: These results suggest that UL coordination is reorganized after a TBPI so as to preserve hand kinematics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural framework for spontaneous development of orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism or microcircuitry behind orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1), and the means by which it develops without supervision or visual input, both remain unresolved questions. Work on the developmental question has assumed the prevalent spatial convergence model of orientation selectivity as the target mechanism. Encouraged by growing evidence challenging both the completeness of this model and its developmental viability, we investigated an alternative scheme. Accordingly, we demonstrate computationally how a scheme in which orientation selectivity originates from the orientation biases already in the retina and lateral geniculate nucelus (LGN) can answer both the mechanistic and developmental questions. In this scheme, the divergence of outputs from the retina allows retinal spontaneous activity to create correlations within the LGN. These correlations in turn allow a Hebbian plasticity mechanism to strengthen those LGN inputs to V1 which carry similar orientation biases and thus provide an orientation tuned excitatory input.

                Subanesthetic ketamine rapidly and robustly reduces depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression. While it is commonly classified as an N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, our picture of ketamine's mechanistic underpinnings is incomplete. Recent clinical evidence has indicated, controversially, that a component of the efficacy of ketamine in depression may be opioid dependent. Using pharmacological functional ultrasound imaging in rats, we found that blocking opioid receptors suppressed neurophysiologic changes evoked by ketamine, but not by a more selective NMDAR antagonist, in regions implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and in reward processing. Importantly, this opioid-dependent response was strongly sex dependent, as it was not evident in female subjects and was fully reversed by surgical removal of the male gonads. We observed similar opioid-mediated sex-dependent effects in ketamine-evoked structural plasticity and behavioral sensitization. Together, these results underscore the potential for ketamine to induce its affective responses via opioid signaling, and indicate that this opioid dependence may be strongly influenced by subject sex. These factors should be more directly assessed in future clinical trials.

                Severe pain is often experienced by patients with head and neck cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite its frequency and severity, current treatments fail to adequately control cancer-associated pain, because of our lack of mechanistic understanding. Cancer-derived small extracellular vesicles (Cancer-sEVs) are well-positioned to function as mediators of communication between cancer cells and neurons. Inhibition of Cancer-sEV release attenuated pain in tumor-bearing mice. Injection of purified Cancer-sEVs is sufficient to induce pain hypersensitivity in naive mice. Cancer-sEVs triggered calcium influx in nociceptors and inhibition or ablation of nociceptors protect against cancer pain. Interrogation of published sequencing data of human sensory neurons exposed to human Cancer-sEVs suggested a stimulation of protein translation in neurons. Induction of translation by Cancer-sEVs was validated in our mouse model and its inhibition alleviated cancer pain in mice. These findings define a role of Cancer-sEVs in cancer pain and identify several druggable targets.

                Hippocampal place cells exhibit spatially modulated firing, or place fields, which can remap to encode changes in the environment or other variables. Unique among hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) has two excitatory populations of place cells, granule cells and mossy cells, which are among the least and most active spatially modulated cells in the hippocampus, respectively. Previous studies of remapping in the DG have drawn different conclusions about whether granule cells exhibit global remapping and contribute to the encoding of context specificity. By recording granule cells and mossy cells as mice foraged in different environments, we found that by most measures, both granule cells and mossy cells remapped robustly but through different mechanisms that are consistent with firing properties of each cell type. Our results resolve the ambiguity surrounding remapping in the DG and suggest that most spatially modulated granule cells contribute to orthogonal representations of distinct spatial contexts.

                Reactive astrocytes are both neurotoxic and pro-regenerative. Their reparative roles after injury have been demonstrated, but how they play a contributing role to regeneration remains question. Here, we investigate the use of astrocytic extracellular vesicles from primary astrocytes cultured in reactive conditions in promoting repair after ischemic stroke. Our studies show that extracellular vesicles derived from reactive astrocytes that co-express a significant number of inflammatory genes (155 upregulated including log2 of 9.61 for Lcn2) and axonal outgrowth genes (59 upregulated including log2 of 3.49 Ntn1) are necessary for improved regenerative outcomes, including axonal infiltration, vascularization, and improved behavioral recovery. Proteomic analysis of the extracellular vesicles show that astrocytes enrich pro-reparative proteins in extracellular vesicles with only 30 proteins relating to inflammatory or complement pathways loaded out of a total of 1073 proteins. Further, we show that the use of a biomaterial scaffold is necessary for the improved regeneration observed from reactive astrocyte extracellular vesicles. These studies show that reactive astrocytes use extracellular vesicles enriched with pro-repair proteins to promote recovery after injury.

                The object-responsive cortex of the visual system has a highly systematic topography, with a macro-scale organization related to animacy and the real-world size of objects, and embedded meso-scale regions with strong selectivity for a handful of object categories. Here, we use self-organizing principles to learn a topographic representation of the data manifold of a deep neural network representational space. We find that a smooth mapping of this representational space showed many brain-like motifs, with (i) large-scale organization of animate vs. inanimate and big vs. small response preferences, supported by (ii) feature tuning related to textural and coarse form information, with (iii) naturally emerging face- and scene-selective regions embedded in this larger-scale organization. While some theories of the object-selective cortex posit that these differently tuned regions of the brain reflect a collection of distinctly specified functional modules, the present work provides computational support for an alternate hypothesis that the tuning and topography of the object-selective cortex reflects a smooth mapping of a unified representational space.

                A growing body of evidence indicates that gut microbiota influence brain function and behavior. However, the molecular basis of how gut bacteria modulate host nervous system function is largely unknown. Here we show that vitamin B12-producing bacteria that colonize the intestine can modulate excitatory synaptic transmission and behavior in the host Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that vitamin B12 reduces cholinergic signaling in the nervous system through rewiring of the methionine (Met)/S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle in the intestine. We identify a conserved metabolic crosstalk between the Met/SAM cycle and the choline oxidation pathway. We show that metabolic rewiring of these pathways by vitamin B12 reduces cholinergic transmission by limiting the availability of free choline required by neurons to synthesize acetylcholine. Our study reveals a gut-brain communication pathway by which enteric bacteria modulate host behavior and may affect mental health.

                Our interoceptive states and their perception are thought to be heavily shaped by interactions between expectations and interoceptive information. Surprisingly, previous research mostly investigated the impact of expectations on interoceptive states themselves (i.e. cardiac activity), rather than the perception of these states (i.e. heartbeat perception). This study investigated whether expectations of pain induce an illusory perception of heartbeat frequency, so that heartbeat perception reflects expectations about how the heartbeat will change, rather than only the actual change. Participants were instructed to report continuously their heartbeat, either tapping along to it (i.e., Experiment 1, heartbeat tapping task) or silently counting (i.e., Experiment 2, heartbeat counting task), while ECG was recorded. Crucially, while completing this task, subjects were presented with two types of cues, which provided valid predictive information about the intensity of an upcoming cutaneous stimulation, that is a painful or non-painful stimulus. Results showed that, whenever participants were exposed to cues that signalled the upcoming high-painful stimulation, they reported a higher number of heartbeats compared to when they were anticipating a low-painful shock. Importantly, the perceived increase was not mirrored by the real cardiac frequency, which showed no difference when participants were anticipating a high- vs. low- pain stimulus. Moreover, such perceptual modulations were dramatically reduced when participants executed the same tapping task but with an exteroceptive visual stimulus (i.e., Experiment 3, exteroceptive tapping task). Together, the findings reveal, for the first time, a perceptual illusion of heartbeats associated to pain expectation. This study offers some important insights for understanding how inferential processes can actively generate interoceptive perception, emphasizing its pivotal role within the predictive aspects of the processing of bodily signals and of physiological regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Presence of Myelinated Nerves and Schwann Cells in White Adipose Tissue: Proximity to Synaptic Vesicle Containing Nerve Terminals and Potential Role in BTBR ob/ob Demyelinating Diabetic Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral neuropathy is a pathophysiological state of nerve degeneration and loss of tissue innervation. The most prominent cause of small fiber neuropathy is diabetes which can be demyelinating in nature, but this has not yet been explored in adipose tissue. Both demyelinating neuropathies and axonopathies implicate Schwann cells (SCs), the peripheral glial required for nerve myelination and regeneration after injury. Here, we perform a comprehensive assessment of SCs and myelination patterns of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) nerves, including changes that occur with obesity and other imbalanced energy states in mice and humans. We found that mouse scWAT is densely innervated by both myelinated and unmyelinated sensory and sympathetic nerves. Accordingly, scWAT is home to both myelinating and non-myelinating SCs; the greater proportion of which are myelinating. Furthermore, SCs were found closely associated with synaptic vesicle-containing nerve terminals in scWAT. Obese BTBR ob/ob mice exhibit diabetic peripheral neuropathy in scWAT, and display concordant demyelination specific to small fibers, which was also associated with a decrease in the pan-SC marker Sox10 and compensatory increase in Krox20 gene expression. Together this suggests that adipose SCs may be involved in regulating the plasticity or the neuropathy of adipose tissue nerves.

                There are unique challenges in the preprocessing of spinal cord fMRI data, particularly voluntary or involuntary movement artifacts during image acquisition. Despite advances in data processing techniques for movement detection and correction, there are challenges in extrapolating motion correction algorithm developments in the brain cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord. We trained a Deep Learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) via an unsupervised learning algorithm, called DeepRetroMoCo, to detect and correct motions in axial T2*-weighted spinal cord data. Spinal cord fMRI data from 27 participants were used for training of the network (135 runs for training and 81 runs for testing). We used average temporal signal-to-noise-ratio (tSNR) and Delta Variation Signal (DVARS) of raw and motion-corrected images to compare the outcome of DeepRetroMoco with sct_fmri_moco implemented in the spinal cord toolbox. The average tSNR in the cervical cord was significantly higher when DeepRetroMoco was used for motion correction compared to sct_fmri_moco method. Average DVARS was lower in images corrected by DeepRetroMoco than those corrected by sct_fmri_moco. The average processing time for DeepRetroMoco was also significantly shorter than sct_fmri_moco. Our results suggest that DeepRetroMoCo improves motion correction procedures in fMRI data acquired from the cervical spinal cord.

                Patterns of activity across many neurons are fundamental units of neural computation. Two-photon holographic photostimulation allows both delivering input to, and imaging responses from, patterns or populations of neurons. However, to make this method an easily-deployable tool, simple methods are needed to robustly and stably express opsins and indicators in the same cells. Here we describe a bicistronic adeno-associated virus (AAV) that in transfected cells expresses both the fast and bright calcium indicator GCaMP8s, and a soma-targeted (st) and two-photon-activatable opsin, ChrimsonR. With this method, in the visual cortex of mice, stChrimsonR stimulation with two-photon holography drives robust spiking in targeted cells, and neural responses to visual sensory stimuli and spontaneous activity are strong and easy to measure. stChrimsonR is a good choice of opsin when a balance is needed between stimulation-laser activatability and avoidance of imaging laser activation. This approach is a simple and robust way to prepare neurons in vivo for two-photon holography and imaging.

                Walking through an environment generates retinal motion, which humans rely on to perform a variety of visual tasks. Retinal motion patterns are determined by an interconnected set of factors, including gaze location, gaze stabilization, the structure of the environment, and the walker's goals. The characteristics of these motion signals have important consequences for neural organization and behavior. However, to date, there are no empirical in situ measurements of how combined eye and body movements interact with real 3D environments to shape the statistics of retinal motion signals. Here, we collect measurements of the eyes, the body, and the 3D environment during locomotion. We describe properties of the resulting retinal motion patterns. We explain how these patterns are shaped by gaze location in the world, as well as by behavior, and how they may provide a template for the way motion sensitivity and receptive field properties vary across the visual field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-Frequency Stimulation Does Not Improve Comfort of Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord neuromodulation has gained much attention for demonstrating improved motor recovery in people with spinal cord injury, motivating the development of clinically applicable technologies. Among them, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is attractive because of its non-invasive profile. Many tSCS studies employ a high-frequency (10 kHz) carrier, which has been reported to reduce stimulation discomfort. However, these claims have come under scrutiny in recent years. The purpose of this study was to determine whether high-frequency tSCS is more comfortable at therapeutic amplitudes, which evoke posterior root-muscle (PRM) reflexes. In 16 neurologically intact participants, tSCS was delivered using a 1-ms long monophasic pulse with and without a high-frequency carrier. Stimulation amplitude and pulse duration were varied and PRM reflexes were recorded from the soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles. Participants rated their discomfort during stimulation from 0-10 at PRM reflex threshold. At PRM reflex threshold, high-frequency stimulation (0.87 {+/-} 0.2) was equally comfortable as conventional stimulation (1.03 {+/-} 0.18) but required approximately double the charge to evoke the PRM reflex (conventional: 32.4 {+/-} 9.2 C; high-frequency: 62.5 {+/-} 11.1 C). Strength-duration curves for high-frequency stimulation had a rheobase that was 4.8X greater and a chronaxie that was 5.7X narrower than the conventional monophasic pulse, indicating that high-frequency stimulation was less efficient in recruiting neural activity in spinal roots. High-frequency tSCS is equally as comfortable as conventional stimulation at amplitudes required to stimulate spinal dorsal roots.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early suppression of excitability in subcortical band heterotopia modifies epileptogenesis in rats</a></h4>

              
                Malformations of cortical development represent a major cause of epilepsy in childhood. However, the pathological substrate and dynamic changes leading to the development and progression of epilepsy remain unclear. Here, we characterized an etiology-relevant rat model of subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), a diffuse type of cortical malformation associated with drug-resistant seizures in humans. We used longitudinal electrographic recordings to monitor the age-dependent evolution of epileptiform discharges during the course of epileptogenesis in this model. We found both quantitative and qualitative age-related changes in seizures properties and patterns, accompanying a gradual progression towards a fully developed seizure pattern seen in adulthood. We also dissected the relative contribution of the band heterotopia and the overlying cortex to the development and age-dependent progression of epilepsy using timed and spatially targeted manipulation of neuronal excitability. We found that an early suppression of neuronal excitability in SBH slows down epileptogenesis in juvenile rats, whereas epileptogenesis is paradoxically exacerbated when excitability is suppressed in the overlying cortex. However, in rats with active epilepsy, similar manipulations of excitability have no effect on chronic spontaneous seizures. Together, our data support the notion that complex developmental alterations occurring in both the SBH and the overlying cortex concur to creating pathogenic circuits prone to generate seizures. Our study also suggests that early and targeted interventions could potentially influence the course of these altered developmental trajectories, and favorably modify epileptogenesis in malformations of cortical development.

                Background: The central amygdala (CeA) is a bilateral hub of pain and emotional processing with well-established functional lateralization. We reported that optogenetic manipulation of neural activity in the left and right CeA has opposing effects on bladder pain. Methods: To determine the influence of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) on this diametrically opposed lateralization, we administered CGRP and evaluated the activity of CeA neurons in acute brain slices as well as the behavioral signs of bladder pain in the mouse. Results: We found that CGRP increased firing in both the right and left CeA neurons. Furthermore, we found that CGRP administration in the right CeA increased behavioral signs of bladder pain and decreased bladder pain-like behavior when administered in the left CeA. Conclusions: These studies reveal a parabrachial-to-amygdala circuit driven by opposing actions of CGRP that determines hemispheric lateralization of visceral pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noradrenergic cross-modular reciprocal inhibition within the Locus Coeruleus.</a></h4>

              
                The Locus Coeruleus (LC) is the primary noradrenergic nucleus in the brain with widespread projections driving changes in cognitive state and animal behaviour. The LC is composed of multiple 'modules' with specific efferent target domains enabling discretional neuromodulation. LC neuronal activity releases noradrenaline within the nucleus as a local feedback mechanism, but it is not known how this influences modular output. We address this question using whole-cell recordings and calcium imaging in rat pontine slices in combination with LC neuronal ensemble modelling to assess the influence of local noradrenaline release on cross-modular interactions. Electrophysiological recordings of LC neurons from rats transduced with the optogenetic actuator ChR2 showed auto-inhibition and lateral inhibition (of surrounding non transduced neurons). This inhibition was strongly frequency dependent and was mediated by noradrenaline acting on alpha2-adrenceptors (alpha;2R). To allow calcium-imaging of LC neuronal ensembles a Canine-Adenoviral vector strategy was developed using the PRS promoter to drive selective expression GCaMP6s. Calcium imaging allowed resolution of both increases and decreases in LC activity (to TTX / clonidine or high potassium). Selective chemogenetic activation of subsets of LC neurons (expressing the ionotropic actuator PSAM) revealed both a direct excitation (after application of PSEM308, 3-PSEM308) and an alpha2R-mediated inhibition of neighbouring LC cells (non-transduced). Differential retrograde targeting of PSAM or GCaMP6s to specific LC modules showed the presence of strong, reciprocal cross-modular inhibition (shown for the LC-olfactory bulb vs LC bulbospinal modules) and a subsequent rebound activity inversion. This represents a preferential, targeted, cross-modular, lateral inhibition within the LC rather than a non-specific surround inhibition. Computational modelling showed the emergence of lateral inhibition and biphasic responses to modular activation when alpha2R signalling and noradrenergic reuptake saturation were included. This interaction may facilitate recruitment of neuronal ensembles by coherent inputs and represents a bottom-up differential contrast-enhancement mechanism within the LC to produce a modality specific focus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Low forces push the maturation of neural precursors into neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical stimulation modulates neural development and neuronal activity. In a previous study, we proposed magnetic nano-pulling as a tool to generate active forces. By loading neural cells with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), a precise force vector is remotely generated through static magnetic fields. In the present study, human neural stem cells (NSCs) were subjected to a standard differentiation protocol, in the presence or absence of nano-pulling. Under mechanical stimulation, we found an increase in the length of the neural processes which showed an enrichment in microtubules, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. A stimulation lasting up to 52 days induced a strong remodelling at the level of synapse density and a re-organization of the neuronal network, halving the time required for the maturation of neural precursors into neurons. We then injected the MNP-loaded NSCs into mouse spinal cord slices, demonstrating that nano-pulling stimulates the elongation of the NPC processes and modulates their orientation even in an ex vivo model system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing that active mechanical stimuli can guide the outgrowth of NSCs transplanted into the spinal cord tissue. Our findings suggest that MNPs play an important role in neuronal maturation which could be applied in regenerative medicine.

	<p>Intracranial hemangiopericytomas are rare tumors, accounting for 1% of all central nervous system malignancies. This tumor is considered at high risk of local and also distant metastases. Surgical excision is the gold standard for treatment, but it is seldom curative by itself. Adjuvant radiotherapy is often recommended. We report an overview and update of the available literature on one such rare but aggressive mesenchymal tumor, using the case of a 46-year-old woman affected by hemangiopericytoma of the cavernous sinus surgically removed and treated with adjuvant radiotherapy at our institution. After seven years, the patient underwent a local recurrence and was treated with exeresis and Gamma Knife radiotherapy. Sixteen years after the initial diagnosis, she is still well with stable disease.</p>

	<p>Objective: Schizophrenia is a complex functionally debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder, with associated social cognitive impairment. Corpus Callosum (CC) white matter tracts deficits are reported for people with schizophrenia; however, few studies focus on interhemispheric processing relative to social cognition tasks. This study aimed to determine if a relationship between the CC and social cognition exists. Method: In this cross-section study, a sample of n = 178 typical controls and n = 58 people with schizophrenia completed measures of mentalising (Reading the Mind in the Eyes), emotion recognition outcome and reaction time (Emotion Recognition Test), and clinical symptoms (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale), alongside diffusion-based tract imaging. The CC and its subregions, i.e., the genu, body, and splenium were the regions of interest (ROI). Results: Reduced white matter tract integrity was observed in the CC for patients when compared to controls. Patients performed slower, and less accurately on emotion recognition tasks, which significantly and negatively correlated to the structural integrity of the CC genu. Tract integrity further significantly and negatively related to clinical symptomatology. Conclusions: People with schizophrenia have altered white matter integrity in the genu of the CC, compared to controls, which relates to cognitive deficits associated with recognising emotional stimuli accurately and quickly, and severity of clinical symptoms.</p>

	<p>The heterogeneous and multi-factorial nature of dementia requires the consideration of all health aspects when predicting the risk of its development and planning strategies for its prevention. This systematic review of reviews provides a comprehensive synthesis of those factors associated with cognition in the context of dementia, identifying the role of social aspects and evidencing knowledge gaps in this area of research. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses from 2009&amp;amp;ndash;2021 were searched for within Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos. Reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and assessed the records, following the PRISMA-2020 guidelines. From 314 included studies, 624 cognitive-related factors were identified, most of them risk factors (61.2%), mainly belonging to the group of &amp;amp;lsquo;somatic comorbidities&amp;amp;rsquo; (cardiovascular disease and diabetes) and &amp;amp;lsquo;genetic predispositions&amp;amp;rsquo;. The protective factors (20%) were mainly related to lifestyle, pointing to the Mediterranean diet, regular physical activity, and cognitively stimulating activities. Social factors constituted 9.6% of all identified factors. Research on biological and medical factors dominates the reviewed literature. Greater social support and frequent contact may confer some protection against cognitive decline and dementia by delaying its onset or reducing the overall risk; however, overall, our findings are inconsistent. Further research is needed in the fields of lifestyle, psychology, social health, and the protective factors against cognitive decline and dementia.</p>

	<p>Gait disturbance is a prototypical feature of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and the quantification of gait using wearable sensors is promising. This study aimed to identify gait impairment in the early and progressive stages of PD according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;amp;ndash;Y) scale. A total of 138 PD patients and 56 healthy controls (HCs) were included in our research. We collected gait parameters using the JiBuEn gait-analysis system. For spatiotemporal gait parameters and kinematic gait parameters, we observed significant differences in stride length (SL), gait velocity, the variability of SL, heel strike angle, and the range of motion (ROM) of the ankle, knee, and hip joints between HCs and PD patients in H&amp;amp;ndash;Y &amp;amp;#8544;-&amp;amp;#8545;. The changes worsened with the progression of PD. The differences in the asymmetry index of the SL and ROM of the hip were found between HCs and patients in H&amp;amp;ndash;Y &amp;amp;#8547;. Additionally, these gait parameters were significantly associated with Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire-39. This study demonstrated that gait impairment occurs in the early stage of PD and deteriorates with the progression of the disease. The gait parameters mentioned above may help to detect PD earlier and assess the progression of PD.</p>

	<p>The present study aimed to explore the effect of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on visual working memory for people suffering from methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Five sessions of iTBS were carried over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the vertex as a sham control, with each session in one day. Orientation free-recall tasks were conducted before the iTBS stimulation, after the first and fifth sessions of stimulation. Results showed that when compared with the sham group, a single session of iTBS over the left DLPFC improved participants&amp;amp;rsquo; working memory performance. Specifically, iTBS over the left DLPFC increased the working memory capacity and such effects enlarged with multiple sessions. The present finding suggested that iTBS over DLPFC could be a promising intervention method to enhance the cognitive function of addicts with MUD.</p>

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a sudden injury that causes damage to the brain. Rehabilitation therapies include specific training, such as attention process training (APT) programs using either standard or innovative approaches. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a non-immersive virtual reality-based attention training to stimulate attention processes and mood in TBI patients. Thirty subjects with TBI were enrolled at the Neurorehabilitation Unit of the IRCCS Neurolesi Center and divided into either the Conventional Attention Process Training Group (C_APT: n = 15) or the Virtual-Based Attention Processes Training Group (VB_APT: n = 15), treated with the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS-Evo). All of the patients were evaluated with a specific psychometric battery before (T0) and after the end (T1) of each program. We found statistically significant differences between the two groups, in particular concerning global cognitive status (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.02), attention processes (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.03), depression symptoms (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04) and visual attention (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Experimental intragroup analysis showed great statistical significances in all psychometric tests, i.e., the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0006), Attention Matrices (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0007), the Hamilton Rating Scale-Depression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.004), the Trail Making Test-A (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0007), the Trail Making Test-B (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0007), and the Trail Making test-BA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.007). Our results suggest that non-immersive virtual reality may be a useful and effective approach for the attention processes recovery and mood of TBI patients, leading to better cognitive and behavioral outcomes.</p>

	<p>We investigated the relationship between physical activity (PA) and emotional regulation strategies among college students to establish the mediating role of cortical thickness. A total of 60 university students (18&amp;amp;ndash;20 years old) were enrolled in this study. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-L) was used to estimate PA levels. Based on the International Physical Activity Working Group standards, PA levels were divided into low, medium, and high PA groups; emotional regulation strategies were determined by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), including the Cognitive Reappraisal Scale (CR) and the Expressive Suppression Scale (ES). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure cortical thickness. Differences in use of the ES strategy among high, medium, and low PA groups were not marked. However, compared to the low PA group, the CR strategy was frequently used in the high PA group, with a thicker right hemisphere rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rrACC). PA levels were positively correlated with thickness of the rrACC cortex (r = 0.398, p = 0.002 &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and CR strategy (r = 0.398, p = 0.002 &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and negatively correlated with the ES strategy (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.348, p = 0.007 &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The rrACC cortical thickness played a partial mediating role in the relationship between PA and CR strategy, accounting for 33.1% of total effect values. These findings indicate that although the negative correlation between PA and ES was not significant, the positive correlation between PA with CR was significant, and rrACC thickness played a partial mediating role in the relationship between PA and CR, providing new evidence toward comprehensively revealing the relationship between PA, rrACC cortical thickness, and emotion regulation strategies.</p>

                Background: Risk perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are considered important as they impact community health behaviors. The aim of this study was to determine the perceived risk of infection and death due to COVID-19 and to assess the factors associated with such risk perceptions among community members in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa, Asia, and South America. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 LMICs in Africa, Asia, and South America from February to May 2021. A questionnaire was utilized to assess the perceived risk of infection and death from COVID-19 and its plausible determinants. A logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with such risk perceptions. Results: A total of 1,646 responses were included in the analysis of the perceived risk of becoming infected and dying from COVID-19. Our data suggested that 36.4% of participants had a high perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, while only 22.4% had a perceived risk of dying from COVID-19. Being a woman, working in healthcare-related sectors, contracting pulmonary disease, knowing people in the immediate social environment who are or have been infected with COVID-19, as well as seeing or reading about individuals infected with COVID-19 on social media or TV were all associated with a higher perceived risk of becoming infected with COVID-19. In addition, being a woman, elderly, having heart disease and pulmonary disease, knowing people in the immediate social environment who are or have been infected with COVID-19, and seeing or reading about individuals infected with COVID-19 on social media or TV had a higher perceived risk of dying from COVID-19. Conclusions: The perceived risk of infection and death due to COVID-19 are relatively low among respondents; this suggests the need to conduct health campaigns to disseminate knowledge and information on the ongoing pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Soluble FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1: Role in placenta accreta spectrum disorder [version 4; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Placenta accreta is a pregnancy condition where the placenta's blood vessels attach too deeply to the uterine wall. Incidence of placenta accreta Â is increasingly seen today as the rate of cesarean section increases, however, the exact pathophysiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 Â (sflt-1) as a protein produced by the placenta was found to be decreased in placenta accreta, Therefore we aim Â to see if Â sfltsFlt-1 has a role in the development of placenta accreta. Methods:Â This study involved 40 samples from patients that had been diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum disorder (case group), and 40 samples from patients with normal pregnancies (control group) Â at Rumah Skit Umum Pusat H.Adam Malik (RSUP) Haji Adam Malik Medan, in Indonesia. Â Diagnosis of placenta accreta syndrome was based on Placenta Accreta Spectrum Â Score (PAS), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Â (FIGO) classification of placenta accreta spectrum disorder.Analyses Â were performed by independent t-test, man Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis test, with a P-value <0.05 Â considered as statistically significant (95%CI). Results:Â Based on this study, we found that the sFlt-1 level in the case group was lower than the control group. Data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a difference in sFlt-1 levels in this study group (p = 0.02), which was further evaluated Â with post hoc analysis using Mann. -Whitney U test. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the control and PAS 0, PAS1, and PAS 2 (p = 0.043; p = 0.002; p = 0.03). Conclusion:Â sFlt-1 levels decreased in placental invasive pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, however, this still needs to be investigated further in a multi-center study, considering that sFlt-1 levels are also influenced by ethnicity and other conditions that cannot be excluded in this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of Leptin and Leptin receptor Gene polymorphisms with Insulin resistance in pregnant women: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Leptin is an adipokine hormone that regulates insulin sensitivity and lipid profile, which may contribute to complications like gestational diabetes.The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance.. Methods: 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) and lipid profile by automated chemistry analyzer. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results: Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62Â±29.23 and 59.88Â±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, âAAâ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion: No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Depression among pet owners and non-pet owners: a comparative cross-sectional study in Dhaka, Bangladesh [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Depression is a major contributor to overall global disease burden, often beginning in the teenage years and continuing into later life. Previous studies have reported high global rates of depression during these formative years, including in Bangladesh. At the same time, the positive impact that pet ownership can have on depression is steeply Â being recognized. However, studies examining these effects in Bangladesh are scarce. This study examined the association between household pet ownership and depression among people older than 13 years in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using online and offline approaches. We employed a snowball sampling technique to identify pet owners aged greater than 13 years residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Both web-based survey questionnaires using social media and hard copies were used to collect data from urban-dwelling pet owners. Logistic regression model was used to identify the independent role of pet ownership in depression, adjusting for confounders, including age, sex, marital status, known chronic disabilities, and other variables. Results: A total of 140 pet owners and an equal number of non-pet owners participated in the study. Pet owners were found to be 41% less depressed than non-pet owners (AOR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.31â1.14). In addition, males (AOR: 3.38; 95% CI: 1.50â7.62) who were either unmarried (AOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.05â4.16), smoked tobacco (AOR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.50â18.53), or had a physical disability (AOR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.50â18.53) were significantly more likely to be depressed. Conclusion: Regression analysis revealed that in Dhaka, pet owners were associated with lower levels of depression compared to non-pet owners.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Extensive digital gangrene as a primary manifestation of late-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Digital gangrene is a rare but serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It occurs usually in middle-aged patients with longer disease duration. Case: Herein we report the case of a 56-year-old man (with no history suggestive of Raynaudâs phenomenon, diabetes mellitus, smoking, trauma, infection, or chemical exposure), who presented with SLE and digital gangrene was among the first signs. He presented with a one-month history of joint pain, hair loss, photosensitivity, mouth ulcers, malar rash, dyspnea, and digital pain. Physical examination revealed painful and diffuse erythematous skin lesions in the extremities and back, as well as cyanosis in the fingers. We noted lymphocytopenia (600 cells/mm3), and an elevated C-reactive protein (15.1 mg/l) on laboratory tests. Immunological tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with Title 1:400. Pulmonary computed tomography revealed pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary function tests revealed the restrictive pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of SLE with lung involvement was retained. The immunological assessment in search of elements in favor of a vascular origin of the patient's skin lesions was negative. Treatment was initiated with 200 mg/day hydroxychloroquine. For dermal and pulmonary involvement, intravenous (IV) pulse therapy was used with methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/d for three consecutive days monthly) and cyclophosphamide (1 g/month). Calcium blocking agents were also prescribed. However, the lesions did not improve. The patient was given two infusions of rituximab (1 g) at a 14-day interval with a marked improvement of the majority of vasculitis lesions, and a partial improvement of dyspnea. Conclusions: Digital gangrene is a rare complication of late-onset SLE, especially as a primary manifestation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Feature-Based Attention Multiplicatively Scales the fMRI-BOLD Contrast-Response Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>fMRI plays a key role in the study of attention. However, there remains a puzzling discrepancy between attention effects measured with fMRI and with electrophysiological methods. While electrophysiological studies find that attention increases sensory gain, amplifying stimulus-evoked neural responses by multiplicatively scaling the contrast-response function (CRF), fMRI appears to be insensitive to these multiplicative effects. Instead, fMRI studies typically find that attention produces an additive baseline shift in the BOLD signal. These findings suggest that attentional effects measured with fMRI reflect top-down inputs to visual cortex, rather than the modulation of sensory gain. If true, this drastically limits what fMRI can tell us about how attention improves sensory coding. Here, we examined whether fMRI is sensitive to multiplicative effects of attention using a feature-based attention paradigm designed to preclude any possible additive effects. We measured BOLD activity evoked by a probe stimulus in one visual hemifield while participants (6 male, 6 female) attended to the probe orientation (attended condition), or to an orthogonal orientation (unattended condition), in the other hemifield. To measure CRFs in visual areas V1-V3, we parametrically varied the contrast of the probe stimulus. In all three areas, feature-based attention increased contrast gain, improving sensitivity by shifting CRFs toward lower contrasts. In V2 and V3, we also found an increase in response gain, an increase in the responsivity of the CRF, that was greatest at inner eccentricities. These results provide clear evidence that the fMRI-BOLD signal is sensitive to multiplicative effects of attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> fMRI plays a central role in the study of attention because it allows researchers to precisely and noninvasively characterize the effects of attention throughout the brain. Electrophysiological studies have shown that attention increases sensory gain, amplifying stimulus-evoked neural responses. However, a growing body of work suggests that the BOLD signal that is measured with fMRI is not sensitive to these multiplicative effects of attention, calling into question what we can learn from fMRI about how attention improves sensory codes. Here, using a feature-based attention paradigm, we provide evidence that the BOLD signal can pick up multiplicative effects of attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Efferent Reflexes in the Efficient Encoding of Speech by the Auditory Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <p>To avoid information loss, the auditory system must adapt the broad dynamic range of natural sounds to the restricted dynamic range of auditory nerve fibers. How it solves this dynamic range problem is not fully understood. Recent electrophysiological studies showed that dynamic-range adaptation occurs at the auditory nerve level, but the amount of adaptation found was insufficient to prevent information loss. We used the physiological MATLAB Auditory Periphery model to study the contribution of efferent reflexes to dynamic range adaptation. Simulating the healthy human auditory periphery provided adaptation predictions that suggest that the acoustic reflex shifts rate-level functions toward a given context level and the medial olivocochlear reflex sharpens the response of nerve fibers around that context level. A simulator of hearing was created to decode model-predicted firing of the auditory nerve back into an acoustic signal, for use in psychophysical tasks. Speech reception thresholds in noise obtained with a normal-hearing implementation of the simulator were just 1 dB above those measured with unprocessed stimuli. This result validates the simulator for speech stimuli. Disabling efferent reflexes elevated thresholds by 4 dB, reaching thresholds found in mild-to-moderately hearing-impaired individuals. Overall, our studies suggest that efferent reflexes may contribute to overcoming the dynamic range problem. Because specific sensorineural pathologies can be inserted in the model, the simulator can be used to obtain the psychophysical signatures of each pathology, thereby laying a path to differential diagnosis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The saturation of auditory nerve fibers at moderate sound levels seen in rate-level functions challenges our understanding of how sounds of wide dynamic range are encoded. Our physiologically inspired simulations suggest that efferent reflexes may play a major role in dynamic range adaptation, with the acoustic reflex moving auditory nerve rate-level function toward a given context level and the medial olivocochlear reflex increasing fiber sensitivity around that context level. A psychophysical task using advanced simulations showed how the existence of the efferent system could prevent unrecoverable information loss and severe impairment of speech-in-noise intelligibility. These findings illustrate how important the precise modeling of peripheral compression is to both simulations and the understanding of normal and impaired hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Loss of Muscarinic M5 Receptor Function Manifests Disparate Impairments in Exploratory Behavior in Male and Female Mice despite Common Dopamine Regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>There are five cloned muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1&ndash;M5). Of these, the muscarinic type 5 receptor (M5) is the only one localized to dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. Unlike M1&ndash;M4, the M5 receptor has relatively restricted expression in the brain, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we performed an in-depth characterization of M5-dependent potentiation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens and accompanying exploratory behaviors in male and female mice. We show that M5 receptors potentiate dopamine transmission by acting directly on the terminals within the nucleus accumbens. Using the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine, we revealed a unique concentration&ndash;response curve and a sensitivity to repeated forced swim stress or restraint stress exposure. We found that constitutive deletion of M5 receptors reduced exploration of the center of an open field while at the same time impairing normal habituation only in male mice. In addition, M5 deletion reduced exploration of salient stimuli, especially under conditions of high novelty, yet had no effect on hedonia assayed using the sucrose preference test or on stress-coping strategy assayed using the forced swim test. We conclude that M5 receptors are critical for both engaging with the environment and updating behavioral output in response to environment cues, specifically in male mice. A cardinal feature of mood and anxiety disorders is withdrawal from the environment. These data indicate that boosting M5 receptor activity may be a useful therapeutic target for ameliorating these symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The basic physiological and behavioral functions of the muscarinic M5 receptor remain understudied. Furthermore, its presence on dopamine neurons, relatively restricted expression in the brain, and recent crystallization make it an attractive target for therapeutic development. Yet, most preclinical studies of M5 receptor function have primarily focused on substance use disorders in male rodents. Here, we characterized the role of M5 receptors in potentiating dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens, finding impaired functioning after stress exposure. Furthermore, we show that M5 receptors can modulate exploratory behavior in a sex-specific manner, without affecting hedonic behavior. These findings further illustrate the therapeutic potential of the M5 receptor, warranting further research in the context of treating mood disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Learning from Ingroup Experiences Changes Intergroup Impressions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans form impressions toward individuals of their own social groups (ingroup members) and of different social groups (outgroup members). Outgroup-focused theories predict that intergroup impressions are mainly shaped by experiences with outgroup individuals, while ingroup-focused theories predict that ingroup experiences play a dominant role. Here we test predictions from these two psychological theories by estimating how intergroup impressions are dynamically shaped when people learn from both ingroup and outgroup experiences. While undergoing fMRI, male participants had identical experiences with different ingroup or outgroup members and rated their social closeness and impressions toward the ingroup and the outgroup. Behavioral results showed an initial ingroup bias in impression ratings which was significantly reduced over the course of learning, with larger effects in individuals with stronger ingroup identification. Computational learning models revealed that these changes in intergroup impressions were predicted by the weight given to ingroup prediction errors. Neurally, the individual weight for ingroup prediction errors was related to the coupling between the left inferior parietal lobule and the left anterior insula, which, in turn, predicted learning-related changes in intergroup impressions. Our findings provide computational and neural evidence for ingroup-focused theories, highlighting the importance of ingroup experiences in shaping social impressions in intergroup settings.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Living in multicultural societies, humans interact with individuals of their own social groups (ingroup members) and of different social groups (outgroup members). However, little is known about how people learn from the mixture of ingroup and outgroup interactions, the most natural experiences in current societies. Here, participants had identical, intermixed experiences with different ingroup and outgroup individuals and rated their closeness and impressions toward the ingroup and the outgroup. Combining computational models and fMRI, we find that the weight given to ingroup experiences (ingroup prediction errors) is the main source of intergroup impression change, captured by changes in connectivity between the parietal lobe and insula. These findings highlight the importance of ingroup experiences in shaping intergroup impressions in complex social environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Complementary Roles of Primate Dorsal Premotor and Pre-Supplementary Motor Areas to the Control of Motor Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are able to temporally organize multiple movements in a purposeful manner in everyday life. Both the dorsal premotor (PMd) area and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are known to be involved in the performance of motor sequences. However, it is unclear how each area differentially contributes to controlling multiple motor sequences. To address this issue, we recorded single-unit activity in both areas while monkeys (one male, one female) performed sixteen motor sequences. Each sequence comprised either a series of two identical movements (repetition) or two different movements (nonrepetition). The sequence was initially instructed with visual signals but had to be remembered thereafter. Here, we showed that the activity of single neurons in both areas transitioned from reactive- to predictive encoding while motor sequences were memorized. In the memory-guided trials, in particular, the activity of PMd cells preferentially represented the second movement (2M) in the sequence leading to a reward generally regardless of the first movement (1M). Such activity frequently began even before the 1M in a prospective manner, and was enhanced in nonrepetition sequences. Behaviorally, a lack of the activity enhancement often resulted in premature execution of the 2M. In contrast, cells in pre-SMA instantiated particular sequences of actions by coordinating switching or nonswitching movements in sequence. Our findings suggest that PMd and pre-SMA play complementary roles within behavioral contexts: PMd preferentially controls the movement that leads to a reward rather than the sequence per se, whereas pre-SMA coordinates all elements in a sequence by integrating temporal orders of multiple movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although both dorsal premotor (PMd) area and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are involved in the control of motor sequences, it is not clear how these two areas contribute to coordination of sequential movements differently. To address this issue, we directly compared neuronal activity in the two areas recorded while monkeys memorized and performed multiple motor sequences. Our findings suggest that PMd preferentially controls the final action that ultimately leads to a reward in a prospective manner, whereas the pre-SMA coordinates switching among multiple actions within the context of the sequence. Our findings are of significance to understand the distinct roles for motor-related areas in the planning and executing motor sequences and the pathophysiology of apraxia and/or Parkinson's diseases that disables skilled motor actions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multiple Sources of Fast Traveling Waves during Human Seizures: Resolving a Controversy</a></h4>

              
                <p>During human seizures, organized waves of voltage activity rapidly sweep across the cortex. Two contradictory theories describe the source of these fast traveling waves: either a slowly advancing narrow region of multiunit activity (an ictal wavefront) or a fixed cortical location. Limited observations and different analyses prevent resolution of these incompatible theories. Here we address this disagreement by combining the methods and microelectrode array recordings (<I>N</I> = 11 patients, 2 females, <I>N</I> = 31 seizures) from previous human studies to analyze the traveling wave source. We find, inconsistent with both existing theories, a transient relationship between the ictal wavefront and traveling waves, and multiple stable directions of traveling waves in many seizures. Using a computational model that combines elements of both existing theories, we show that interactions between an ictal wavefront and fixed source reproduce the traveling wave dynamics observed <I>in vivo</I>. We conclude that combining both existing theories can generate the diversity of ictal traveling waves.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The source of voltage discharges that propagate across cortex during human seizures remains unknown. Two candidate theories exist, each proposing a different discharge source. Support for each theory consists of observations from a small number of human subject recordings, analyzed with separately developed methods. How the different, limited data and different analysis methods impact the evidence for each theory is unclear. To resolve these differences, we combine the unique, human microelectrode array recordings collected separately for each theory and analyze these combined data with a unified approach. We show that neither existing theory adequately describes the data. We then propose a new theory that unifies existing proposals and successfully reproduces the voltage discharge dynamics observed <I>in vivo</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retinoschisin Deficiency Induces Persistent Aberrant Waves of Activity Affecting Neuroglial Signaling in the Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>Genetic disorders that present during development make treatment strategies particularly challenging because there is a need to disentangle primary pathophysiology from downstream dysfunction caused at key developmental stages. To provide a deeper insight into this question, we studied a mouse model of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, an early-onset inherited condition caused by mutations in the <I>Rs1</I> gene encoding retinoschisin (RS1) and characterized by cystic retinal lesions and early visual deficits. Using an unbiased approach in expressing the fast intracellular calcium indicator GCaMP6f in neuronal, glial, and vascular cells of the retina of RS1-deficient male mice, we found that initial cyst formation is paralleled by the appearance of aberrant spontaneous neuroglial signals as early as postnatal day 15, when eyes normally open. These presented as glutamate-driven wavelets of neuronal activity and sporadic radial bursts of activity by Mu&#x0308;ller glia, spanning all retinal layers and disrupting light-induced signaling. This study confers a role to RS1 beyond its function as an adhesion molecule, identifies an early onset for dysfunction in the course of disease, establishing a potential window for disease diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developmental disorders make it difficult to distinguish pathophysiology due to ongoing disease from pathophysiology due to disrupted development. Here, we investigated a mouse model for X-linked retinoschisis, a well defined monogenic degenerative disease caused by mutations in the <I>Rs1</I> gene, which codes for the protein retinoschisin. We evaluated the spontaneous activity of explanted retinas lacking retinoschisin at key stages of development using the unbiased approach of ubiquitously expressing GCaMP6f in all retinal neurons, vasculature, and glia. In mice lacking RS1, we found that an array of novel phenotypes, which present around eye opening, are linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission and affect visual processing. These data identify a novel pathophysiology linked to RS1, and define a window where treatments might be best targeted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Transplantation of Astrocytic Mitochondria Modulates Neuronal Antioxidant Defense and Neuroplasticity and Promotes Functional Recovery after Intracerebral Hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astrocytes release functional mitochondria (Mt) that play regulatory and prosurvival functions on entering adjacent cells. We recently demonstrated that these released Mts could enter microglia to promote their reparative/prophagocytic phenotype that assists in hematoma cleanup and neurological recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the relevance of astrocytic Mt transfer into neurons in protecting brain after ICH is unclear. Here, we found that ICH causes a robust increase in superoxide generation and elevated oxidative damage that coincides with loss of the mitochondrial enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). The damaging effect of ICH was reversed by intravenous transplantation of astrocytic Mt, which on entering the brain (and neurons), restored Mn-SOD levels and reduced neurological deficits in male mice subjected to ICH. Using an <I>in vitro</I> ICH-like injury model in cultured neurons, we established that astrocytic Mt on entering neurons prevented reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress and neuronal death by restoring neuronal Mn-SOD levels while at the same time promoted neurite extension and upregulation of synaptogenesis-related gene expression. Furthermore, we found that Mt genome-encoded small peptide humanin, which is normally abundant in Mt, could simulate Mt-transfer effect on neuronal Mn-SOD expression, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity under ICH-like injury. This study demonstrates that adoptive astrocytic Mt transfer enhances neuronal Mn-SOD-mediated antioxidative defense and neuroplasticity in the brain, which potentiate functional recovery following ICH.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mitochondrial dysfunction and antioxidant defense play essential roles in brain damage after ICH. Astrocytes release functional Mt that enters adjacent cells to help brain homeostatic function. Here, we show that systemic transplantation of astrocytic Mt restores ICH-impaired neuronal antioxidative defense, enhances neurite outgrowth, and improves stroke recovery after ICH. Our study suggests that systemic transplantation of astrocytic Mt could be considered as a novel and potentially promising strategy for ICH treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Alterations in Astrocytic Regulation of Excitation and Inhibition by Stress Exposure and in Severe Psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dysregulation of excitatory and inhibitory signaling is commonly observed in major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder, and is often targeted by psychological and pharmacological treatment methods. The balance of excitation and inhibition is highly sensitive to severe psychological stress, one of the strongest risk factors for psychiatric disorders. The role of astrocytes in regulating excitatory and inhibitory signaling is now widely recognized; however, the specific involvement of astrocytes in the context of psychiatric disorders with a history of significant stress exposure remains unclear. In this review, we summarize how astrocytes regulate the balance of excitation and inhibition in the context of stress exposure and severe psychopathology, with a focus on the PFC, a brain area highly implicated in psychopathology. We first focus on preclinical models to demonstrate that the duration of stress (particularly acute vs chronic stress) is key to shaping astrocyte function and downstream behavior. We then provide a hypothesis for how astrocytes are involved in stress-associated cortical signaling imbalance, discuss how this directly contributes to phenotypes of psychopathologies, and provide suggestions for future research. We highlight that astrocytes are a key target to understand and treat the dysregulation of cortical signaling associated with stress-related psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">c-Kit Receptor Maintains Sensory Axon Innervation of the Skin through Src Family Kinases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral somatosensory neurons innervate the skin and sense the environment. Whereas many studies focus on initial axon outgrowth and pathfinding, how signaling pathways contribute to maintenance of the established axon arbors and terminals within the skin is largely unknown. This question is particularly relevant to the many types of neuropathies that affect mature neuronal arbors. We show that a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), c-Kit, contributes to maintenance, but not initial development, of cutaneous axons in the larval zebrafish before sex determination. Downregulation of Kit signaling rapidly induced retraction of established axon terminals in the skin and a reduction in axonal density. Conversely, misexpression of c-Kit ligand in the skin in larval zebrafish induced increases in local sensory axon density, suggesting an important role for Kit signaling in cutaneous axon maintenance. We found Src family kinases (SFKs) act directly downstream to mediate Kit's role in regulating cutaneous axon density. Our data demonstrate a requirement for skin-to-axon signaling to maintain axonal networks and elucidate novel roles for Kit and SFK signaling in this context. This Kit-SFK signaling axis offers a potential pathway to therapeutically target in sensory neuropathies and to further explore in other neurobiological processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The skin is full of small nerve endings that sense different environmental stimuli. How these nerve endings grow and reach a specific area of the skin during development has been the focus of many studies. In contrast, the cellular and molecular mechanisms required to maintain the function and health of these structures is relatively unknown. We discovered that a specific receptor in sensory neurons, c-Kit, is required to maintain the density of nerve endings in the skin. Furthermore, we found that a molecular target of c-Kit, Src family kinases (SFKs), is necessary for this role. Thus, c-Kit/SFK signaling regulates density and maintenance of sensory nerve endings in the skin and may have important roles in neural disease and regeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Glia Clocks in the Regulation of Sleep in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>In <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, the pacemaker located in the brain plays the main role in maintaining circadian rhythms; however, peripheral oscillators including glial cells, are also crucial components of the circadian network. In the present study, we investigated an impact of oscillators located in astrocyte-like glia, the chiasm giant glia of the optic lobe, epithelial and subperineurial glia on sleep of <I>Drosophila</I> males. We described that oscillators located in astrocyte-like glia and chiasm giant glia are necessary to maintain daily changes in clock neurons arborizations, while those located in epithelial glia regulate amplitude of these changes. Finally, we showed that communication between glia and neurons through tripartite synapses formed by epithelial glia and, in effect, neurotransmission regulation plays important role in wake-promoting during the day.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian clock or pacemaker regulates many aspects of animals' physiology and behavior. The pacemaker is located in the brain and is composed of neurons. However, there are also additional oscillators, called peripheral clocks, which synchronize the main clock. Despite the critical role of glia in the clock machinery, little is known which type of glia houses peripheral oscillators and how they affect neuronal clocks. This study using <I>Drosophila</I> shows that oscillators in specific glia types maintain awakeness during the day by regulating the daily plasticity of clock neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rewiring Cortico-Muscular Control in the Healthy and Poststroke Human Brain with Proprioceptive {beta}-Band Neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                <p>In severely affected stroke survivors, cortico-muscular control is disturbed and volitional upper limb movements often absent. Mental rehearsal of the impaired movement in conjunction with sensory feedback provision are suggested as promising rehabilitation exercises. Knowledge about the underlying neural processes, however, remains vague. In male and female chronic stroke patients with hand paralysis, a brain-computer interface controlled a robotic orthosis and turned sensorimotor &beta;-band desynchronization during motor imagery (MI) of finger extension into contingent hand opening. Healthy control subjects performed the same task and received the same proprioceptive feedback with a robotic orthosis or visual feedback only. Only when proprioceptive feedback was provided, cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) increased with a predominant information flow from the sensorimotor cortex to the finger extensors. This effect (1) was specific to the &beta; frequency band, (2) transferred to a motor task (MT), (3) was proportional to subsequent corticospinal excitability (CSE) and correlated with behavioral changes in the (4) healthy and (5) poststroke condition; notably, MI-related enhancement of &beta;-band CMC in the ipsilesional premotor cortex correlated with motor improvements after the intervention. In the healthy and injured human nervous system, synchronized activation of motor-related cortical and spinal neural pools facilitates, in accordance with the communication-through-coherence hypothesis, cortico-spinal communication and may, thereby, be therapeutically relevant for functional restoration after stroke, when voluntary movements are no longer possible.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study provides insights into the neural processes that transfer effects of brain-computer interface neurofeedback to subsequent motor behavior. Specifically, volitional control of cortical oscillations and proprioceptive feedback enhances both cortical activity and behaviorally relevant connectivity to the periphery in a topographically circumscribed and frequency-specific way. This enhanced cortico-muscular control can be induced in the healthy and poststroke brain. Thereby, activating the motor cortex with mental rehearsal of the impaired movement and closing the loop by robot-assisted feedback synchronizes ipsilesional premotor cortex and spinal neural pools in the &beta; frequency band. This facilitates, in accordance with the communication-through-coherence hypothesis, cortico-spinal communication and may, thereby, be therapeutically relevant for functional restoration after stroke, when voluntary movements are no longer possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Extraglomerular Excitation of Rat Olfactory Bulb Mitral Cells by Depolarizing GABAergic Synaptic Input</a></h4>

              
                <p>Principal cells in the olfactory bulb (OB), mitral and tufted cells, receive direct sensory input and generate output signals that are transmitted to downstream cortical targets. Excitatory input from glutamatergic receptor neurons are the primary known sources of rapid excitation to OB principal cells. Principal cells also receive inhibitory input from local GABAergic interneurons in both the glomerular and plexiform layers. Previous work suggests that the functional effect of these inhibitory inputs, including numerous dendrodendritic synapses with GABAergic granule cells, is to reduce firing probability. In this study, we use <I>in vitro</I> patch-clamp recordings to demonstrate that rat (of both sexes) OB mitral cells also can be excited by GABAergic synapses formed outside the glomerular layer. Depolarizing GABAergic responses to focal extracellular stimulation were revealed when fast ionotropic glutamate receptors were blocked, and occurred with short, monosynaptic latencies. These novel synaptic responses were abolished by gabazine, bicuculline, and picrotoxin, three structurally dissimilar GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonists. The likely location of depolarizing GABAergic input to mitral cells was the proximal axon based on the actions of focally applied gabazine and GABA near this region. Excitatory GABAergic synaptic responses, commonly studied in cortical brain regions, have not been reported previously in OB principal cells. Excitatory GABAergic responses promote action potential firing and provide a mechanism for mitral cells to be excited independently of olfactory sensory input.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Odor stimuli generate distinctive activity patterns in olfactory bulb neurons through a combination of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions. Most of the excitatory drive to each principal cell is assumed to arise from a highly restricted subset of sensory neurons. This study describes a novel second source of synaptic excitation to principal cells to arise from GABAergic inputs to the proximal axon, a common site of action potential initiation. This new pathway provides a synaptic mechanism to excite OB principal cells that is independent of the canonical excitatory sensory input contained in the glomerular layer.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex and Basolateral Amygdala Regulate Sensitivity to Delayed Punishment during Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In real-world decision-making scenarios, negative consequences do not always occur immediately after a choice. This delay between action and outcome drives the underestimation, or "delay discounting," of punishment. While the neural substrates underlying sensitivity to immediate punishment have been well-studied, there has been minimal investigation of delayed consequences. Here, we assessed the role of lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), two regions implicated in cost/benefit decision-making, in sensitivity to delayed versus immediate punishment. The delayed punishment decision-making task (DPDT) was used to measure delay discounting of punishment in rodents. During DPDT, rats choose between a small, single-pellet reward and a large, three-pellet reward accompanied by a mild foot shock. As the task progresses, the shock is preceded by a delay that systematically increases or decreases throughout the session. We observed that rats avoid choices associated with immediate punishment, then shift preference toward these options when punishment is delayed. LOFC inactivation did not influence choice of rewards with immediate punishment, but decreased choice of delayed punishment. We also observed that BLA inactivation reduced choice of delayed punishment for ascending but not descending delays. Inactivation of either brain region produced comparable effects on decision-making in males and females, but there were sex differences observed in omissions and latency to make a choice. In summary, both LOFC and BLA contribute to the delay discounting of punishment and may serve as promising therapeutic targets to improve sensitivity to delayed punishment during decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Recurring Cholinergic Inputs Induce Local Hippocampal Plasticity through Feedforward Disinhibition</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The CA1 pyramidal neurons are embedded in an intricate local circuitry that contains a variety of interneurons. The roles these interneurons play in the regulation of the excitatory synaptic plasticity remains largely understudied. Recent experiments showed that recurring cholinergic activation of &alpha;7 nACh receptors expressed in oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (OLM&alpha;2) interneurons can directly induce LTP in Schaffer collateral (SC)&ndash;CA1 synapses. Here, we pair <I>in vitro</I> studies with biophysically based modeling to uncover the underlying mechanisms. According to our model, &alpha;7 nAChR activation increases OLM GABAergic activity. This results in the inhibition of the fast-spiking interneurons that provide feedforward inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. This disinhibition, paired with tightly timed SC stimulation, can induce potentiation at the excitatory synapses of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our work details the role of cholinergic modulation in disinhibition-induced hippocampal plasticity. It relates the timing of cholinergic pairing found experimentally in previous studies with the timing between disinhibition and hippocampal stimulation necessary to induce potentiation and suggests the dynamics of the involved interneurons plays a crucial role in determining this timing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A methylbenzimidazole derivative regulates mammalian circadian rhythms by targeting Cryptochrome proteins [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Impairment of the circadian clock has been associated with numerous diseases, including sleep disorders and metabolic disease. Although small-molecules that modulate clock function may form the basis of drug discovery of clock-related diseases, only a few compounds that selectively target core clock proteins have been identified. Three scaffolds were previously discovered as small-molecule activators of the clock protein Cryptochrome (CRY), and they have been providing powerful tools to understand and control the circadian clock system. Identifying new scaffolds will expand the possibilities of drug discovery. Methods: A methylbenzimidazole derivative TH401 identified from cell-based circadian screens was characterized. Effects of TH401 on circadian rhythms were evaluated in cellular assays. Functional assays and X-ray crystallography were used to elucidate the effects of the compound on CRY1 and CRY2 isoforms. Results: TH401 lengthened the period of circadian rhythms and stabilized both CRY1 and CRY2. The compound repressed Per2 reporter activity, which was reduced by Cry1 or Cry2 knockout and abolished by Cry1/Cry2 double knockout, indicating the dependence on CRY isoforms. Thermal shift assays showed slightly higher interaction of TH401 with CRY2 over CRY1. The crystal structure of CRY1 in complex with TH401 revealed a conformational change of the gatekeeper W399, which is involved in isoform-selectivity determination. Conclusions: The present study identified a new small-molecule TH401 that targets both CRY isoforms. This compound has expanded the chemical diversity of CRY activators, and will ultimately aid in the development of therapeutics against circadian clock-related disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modified solid in oil nanodispersion containing vemurafenib-lipid complex-in vitro/in vivo study [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vemurafenib (VEM) was a licensed drug for the treatment of skin melanoma and is available only in the market as oral tablets prescribed in huge doses (1920 mg/day). One reason for the high dose is vemurafenib's low oral bioavailability. Methods: VEM-lipid complex (DLC) was predicted based on Conquest and Mercury programs and prepared using the solvent evaporation method using the lipid (phosphatidylethanolamine). DLC was subjected to characterization (FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, DSC, TGA, P-XRD, and FESEM) to confirm complexation. Â DLC was used to prepare solid in oil nanodispersion (DLC-SON) and subjected to in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo evaluation in comparison to our recently prepared conventional SON (VEM-SON) and DLC-control. Results: Conquest and Mercury predict the availability of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between VEM and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). All characterization tests of DLC ensure the complexation of the drug with PE. Ex vivo studies showed that the drug in DLC-SON has significantly (P<0.05) higher skin permeation than DLC-control but lower drug permeation than conventional SON but it has a higher % skin deposition (P<0.05) than others. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the prepared DLC-SON is significantly high (P<0.05) in comparison to the conventional SON and pure VEM. In vivo permeation using confocal laser scanning microscopy (on the rat) results indicated that both conventional SON and DLC-SON can cross the SC and infiltrate the dermis and epidermis but DLC-SON has a higher luminance/gray value after 24 h in the dermis in comparison to the conventional SON. Conclusion: The novel lipid complex for VEM prepared using PE as a lipid and enclosed in SON showed higher anticancer activity and topical permeation as well as sustained delivery and good retention time in the dermis that localize the drug in a sufficient concentration to eliminate early diagnosed skin melanoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Alterations in cerebral glucose metabolism measured by FDG PET in subjects performing a meditation practice based on clitoral stimulation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The relationship between sexuality, or the libido, and spirituality or religion has long been debated in psychiatry. Recent studies have explored the neurophysiology of both sexual experiences and spiritual practices such as meditation or prayer. In the present study, we report changes in cerebral glucose metabolism in a unique meditation practice augmented by clitoral stimulation called, Orgasmic Meditation, in which a spiritual state is described to be attained by both male and female participants engaged in the practice as a pair. Methods: Male (N=20) and female (N=20) subjects had an intravenous catheter connected to a bag of normal saline inserted prior to the practice. During the practice, men stimulated their partnerâs clitoris for exactly 15 minutes (he received no sexual stimulation). Midway through the practice, researchers injected 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose so the scan would reflect cerebral metabolism during the practice. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed approximately 30 minutes later. Results: In the female participants, the meditation state showed significant decreases in the left inferior frontal, inferior parietal, insula, middle temporal, and orbitofrontal regions as well as in the right angular gyrus, anterior cingulate and parahippocampus compared to a neutral state (p<0.01). Male subjects had significant decreases in the left middle frontal, paracentral, precentral, and postcentral regions as well as the right middle frontal and paracentral regions during meditation (p<0.01). Men also had significantly increased metabolism in the cerebellum and right postcentral and superior temporal regions (p<0.01). Conclusions: These findings represent a distinct pattern of brain activity, for both men and women, that is a hybrid between that of other meditation practices and sexual stimulation. Such findings have potential psychotherapeutic implications and may deepen our understanding of the relationship between spiritual and sexual experience.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of neutral honey as a tissue fixative in histopathology [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In routine histopathology, 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) is the choice fixative. However, formalin is a human carcinogen, so there is a necessity for a safer alternative. To the best of our knowledge, neutral honey, not natural or artificial honey, has not been tested to fix histological samples. This study determined the effectiveness of neutral buffered honey and other types of fixatives to fix histological tissues. Methods: The study was conducted between July 2019 and August 2020 at Sultan Qaboos University, Oman. Sections from three rat livers, kidneys, and stomach tissues were fixed with 10% NBF, neutral buffered Sumer honey, neutral buffered date honey, formalin, Sumer honey, date honey, alcoholic formalin, alcoholic Sumer honey, and alcoholic date honey for 24 hours. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), special stains, and vimentin methods. Three expert biomedical scientists then evaluated the fixed and stained samples for the quality of all sections. The fixation ability of the different honey solutions was then compared to 10% NBF and the utility was determined using nuclear and cytoplasmic criteria, specificity, and intensity. Results: H&E showed adequate staining in all groups compared to 10% NBF. The specificity and intensity of all groups for the Periodic acidâSchiff method were identical to 10% NBF except for Sumer honey and alcoholic date honey. Vimentin showed comparable findings with 10% NBF as there were no significant differences. Conclusions: The findings of this study encourage the use of honey, including neutral, as a possible safe substitute fixative for formalin, however, further experiments on larger specimens should be conducted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cortical auditory potentials and cognitive potentials in individuals with and without vestibular dysfunction [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Among individuals with vestibular dysfunction, the loss of vestibular sensory information is found to alter cognitive abilities that coordinate spatial and non-spatial information. P300 is an event-related potential commonly used to assess cognitive processing. The aim of the present study was to compare the latency and amplitude of cortical auditory evoked potential and P300 between individuals with vestibular dysfunction and individuals with no vestibular dysfunction. Methods:Â Forty adults with a mean age of 40.5 Â± 13.07 participated in the study. Group I included 20 adults diagnosed with vestibular dysfunction and group II included 20 age-matched adults with no vestibular dysfunction. The P300 was recorded from the electrode site Cz and Pz.Â It was elicited using pure-tones in odd-ball paradigm. The latency and amplitude of peaks P1, N1, P2, and N2 of the cortical auditory evoked potential and the P300 were measured. Results:Â Significant amplitude difference was observed in cortical potentials at Cz and Pz. The P300 was present only in 70% of individuals with vestibular dysfunction compared to 100% among individuals with no vestibular dysfunction. The mean amplitude of the P300 was slightly larger in group 1 compared to group 2 and the mean latency of the P300 was similar in both groups. However, the difference in amplitude of the P300 between groups was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Knowing the cognitive function of individuals with vestibular dysfunction enables planning vestibular rehabilitation therapy, which enhances the quality of life in these individuals by improving their vestibular and cognitive functions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study of the protective effects of cyanocobalamin on methotrexate induced nephrotoxicity in rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic drug, used mainly in many cancerous stages, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases, but its use has been limited by its nephrotoxicity. Cyanocobalamin is a water-soluble vitamin possessing nephro-protective properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cyanocobalamin on the nephrotoxicity of methotrexate. Methods: In the study 42 albino adult female rats were used, divided into six groups each containing seven rats (n=7). 1st group: Control group (Negative control), 7 rats were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5ml/kg/day NS. Second group: 7 rats were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of methotrexate (20 mg/kg) for 4 days. Third Group: 7 rats were given intraperitoneally cyanocobalamin at a dose (1.5 mg/kg/day) for two weeks, fourth, fifth, sixth group: 7 rats from each group were injected intraperitoneally with different concentrations of cyanocobalamin (0.5, 1, 1.5 mg/kg /day), respectively, for two weeks and MTX (20 mg/kg), which was injected only on day 11. On day 15, rats from all groups were euthanized, and blood samples were taken for biochemical tests, including evaluating serum urea and creatinine. The kidneys were extracted for histological investigation and evaluation of antioxidant (GSH) and oxidative stress (MDA) by using kidney tissue homogenates. Results: This study revealed that kidney damage, produced by the MTX (group II), is manifested by significantly elevated (P<0.05) urea and creatinine. On the contrary, the cyanocobalamin groups (IV, V, VI) significantly (P<0.05) reduced urea and creatinine. Renal antioxidant defense systems, such as reduced glutathione depleted by MTX therapy, were restored to normal levels by cyanocobalamin. Furthermore, cyanocobalamin reduced oxidative stress (MDA) and histologically reduced renal tissue injury induced by MTX. Conclusions: In conclusion, the study revealed that cyanocobalamin has a nephroprotective action upon MTX-induced renal damage in rats; cyanocobalamin may offer a protective effect, such as antioxidant action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico comparison between the mutated and wild-type androgen receptors and their influence on the selection of optimum androgenic receptor blockers for the treatment of prostate cancer [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prostate cancer is a disease that occurs in men aged more than 50 years. In Iraq, 8.89 men per 100,000 population suffer from prostate cancer, with the incidence being 14,016 cases and mortality being 6,367 cases. Despite advances in treatment against prostate cancer, it can become resistant to drugs. Therefore, the aim of current study was to search and identify binding sites for the repositioning of drugs by computational methods (docking).Â  Methods: Based on the protein structure of the wild androgen receptor, the analysis parameters (22x22x22 on the X, Y, and Z axes) were established. Results: The interactions of the natural ligands with androgen receptor were 10.0 (testosterone) and 10.8 (dihydrotestosterone) while mutated androgen receptor (T877A) had a low affinity with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (-5.3 and -6.7, respectively). In the interactions of both receptors with the reported inhibitors (antagonists), a decrease with Bicalutamide (-8.3 and -4.3, respectively) and an increase in affinity with Flutamide and Nilutamide (-7.7 and 8.6, wild AR; -8.7 and -9.3 AR T877A) were observed. As for Enzalutamide and Apalutamide (second-generation antagonists), the change was minimal between wild androgen receptor and T877A (-7.6 and -7.7; -7.3 and -7.3, respectively). The change in the affinity of the ligands with androgen receptor and androgen receptor T877A shows how a mutation alters the bonds between these molecules. Conclusion: The identification of key sites and potent inhibitors against abnormal androgen receptor functions will enrich prostate cancer treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The potential utility of an augmented data collection approach in understanding the journey to care of pregnant women for maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) proposed by the World Health Organization recognises the importance for health systems to understand the reasons underpinning the death of a pregnant woman or her newborn as an essential first step in preventing future similar deaths. Data for the surveillance component of the MPDSR process are typically collected from health facility sources and post-mortem interviews with affected families, though it may be traumatising to them. This brief report aimed to assess the potential utility of an augmented data collection method for mapping journeys of maternal and perinatal deaths, which does not require sourcing additional information from grieving family members. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal and perinatal deaths that occurred across all 24 public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria, between 1st November 2018 and 30th October 2019 was conducted. Data on their demographic, obstetric history and complication at presentation, travel to the hospital, and mode of birth were extracted from their hospital records. The extracted travel data was exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time to the hospital for the period of the day of travel were also extracted. Results: Of the 182 maternal deaths, most presented during the week (80.8%), travelled 5-10 km (30.6%) and 10-29 minutes (46.9%), and travelled to the nearest hospital to their places of residence (70.9%). Of the 442 pregnant women who had perinatal deaths, most presented during the week (78.5%), travelled <5 km (26.9%) and 10-29 minutes (38.0%). For both, the least reported travel data was the mode of travel used to care (>90.0%) and the period of the day they travelled (approximately 30.0%). Conclusion: An augmented data collection approach that includes accurate and complete travel data and closer-to-reality estimates of travel time and distance can be beneficial for MPDSR purposes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Corneal endothelial morphology of healthy myopic Malaysian children of Chinese ethnicity aged 8-9 years and its association with axial length [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This is a cross-sectional study to further understand the effects of axial length elongation on the corneal endothelial cellâs morphology in myopic children. Abnormal changes in the morphology of corneal endothelium are indicators of corneal stress or instability which could be linked to myopia. Methods: 111 school children comprising of 37 emmetropes, 37 mild myopes and 37 moderate myopes aged 8-9 years old were recruited. Visual acuity was measured using the LogMar chart, cycloplegic refraction was determined using an open-field autorefractor (Grand Seiko WAM-5100, Hiroshima, Japan) and refined using subjective refraction. Morphology of corneal endothelial cells [endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation, hexagonality and central corneal thickness] was evaluated using a non-contact specular microscope (Topcon SP-2000P). Axial length was measured with A-scan ultrasound biometry (PacScan Plus, Sonomed Escalon, NY). The correlation between morphology of corneal endothelial cells and axial length were assessed using Pearson Correlation and Linear regression analysis. Results: There was no significant difference in corneal endothelial cells and axial length between gender (p>0.05). Significant reduction in endothelial cells density and hexagonality and increased coefficient of variation was found in eyes of higher myopic power which had longer axial when compared to emmetropes (p<0.001). Except for central corneal thickness, all corneal endothelial cells parameters correlated significantly with axial length (p<0.05). For every 1mm increase in axial length, endothelial cells density decreased by 73.27cells/mm2, hexagonality decreased by 2.32% and coefficient of variation increased by 1.75%. Conclusions: There were significant changes in morphology of cornea endothelial cells in young moderate myopic children of Chinese ethnicity at 8-9 years of age. This result provides normative data for Malaysian children of Chinese ethnicity that can be used for comparison and reference for clinical procedures, thereby facilitating decision-making with respect to interventions for myopia control, especially in prescribing contact lens for children.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal spatial view cells for memory and navigation, and their underlying connectivity in humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus spatial view neurons in primates respond to the spatial location being looked at. The representation is allocentric, in that the responses are to locations âout thereâ in the world, and are relatively invariant with respect to retinal position, eye position, head direction, and the place where the individual is located. The underlying connectivity in humans is from ventromedial visual cortical regions to the parahippocampal scene area, leading to the theory that spatial view cells are formed by combinations of overlapping feature inputs self-organized based on their closeness in space. Thus, although spatial view cells represent âwhereâ for episodic memory and navigation, they are formed by ventral visual stream feature inputs in the parahippocampal gyrus in what is the parahippocampal scene area. A second âwhereâ driver of spatial view cells are parietal inputs, which it is proposed provide the idiothetic update for spatial view cells, used for memory recall and navigation when the spatial view details are obscured. Inferior temporal object âwhatâ inputs and orbitofrontal cortex reward inputs connect to the human hippocampal system, and in macaques can be associated in the hippocampus with spatial view cell âwhereâ representations to implement episodic memory. Hippocampal spatial view cells also provide a basis for navigation to a series of viewed landmarks, with the orbitofrontal cortex reward inputs to the hippocampus providing the goals for navigation, which can then be implemented by hippocampal connectivity in humans to parietal cortex regions involved in visuomotor actions in space. The presence of foveate vision and the highly developed temporal lobe for object and scene processing in primates including humans provide a basis for hippocampal spatial view cells to be key to understanding episodic memory in the primate and human hippocampus, and the roles of this system in primate including human navigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HLA class I and discoveries of the HLA-K (pseudogene) related to disease severity and progression in patients with spondyloarthritis in Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, a tertiary health care center in Surabaya, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting pe</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by enthesitis, sacroiliitis, and axial joint involvement. Although the association of HLA with SpA has been widely reported, there have been no studies of HLA type in the Indonesian population within the last 20 years. This study aims to identify the HLA type in SpA patients at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Indonesia. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional analytical design with samples that met the criteria for SpA according to the 2009 ASAS. The clinical scores used in this study were mSASSS, BASFI, ASDAS, and Schober. Genetic identification using PCR was performed followed by sanger sequencing to determine the HLA type in the patient. DNA sequences were aligned with BLAST, and a phylogenetic tree was created using MEGA 11. Descriptive and comparative analyzes were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Results: This study founded four types of HLA in SpA patients at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, that is HLA-B with six alleles; -B*2704 (12.86%), -B*2705 (1.43%), -B*2706 (1.43%), -B*1802 (4.28%), -B*57v (1.43%), -B*35 (2.86%), HLA - C (21.43%), and HLA - K (52.83%). Clinical scoring of HLA-C and HLA-K indicated severe and progressive disease activity. The HLA-K had the highest mSASSS (26, 95% CI: 22â28), while HLA-C had the highest BASFI score (60, 95% CI: 55â68), the lowest Schober score (12, 95% CI: 10â14), and the shortest duration of illness (22, 95% CI: 12â36). There is no significant difference in the ASDAS score among types. Conclusions: The most common HLA types found in SpA patients at Dr. Soetomo were HLA-C and HLA-K, with the most progressive disease activity indicated by poor mSASSS, BASFI, ASDAS, and Schober scores with a short duration of illness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Us versus them mentality in football fans: Significant social defeat engages the mentalization network and disengages cognitive control areas [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social affiliation is one of the building blocks that shapes cultures and communities. This motivation contributes to the development of social bonding among individuals within a group, enjoying rights, assuming obligations, and strengthening its identity. Evidence has shown that social affiliation has inspired different social phenomena, such as wars, political movements, social struggles, among others, based on two human motivations: the ingroup love and the outgroup hate. One contemporary group to study as a proxy of social affiliation, and ingroup and outgroup motivations is the sports competition. However, this affiliation model has been poorly considered in social neuroscience research. This research aimed to shed light on the neurobiological networks that are related to social affiliation in football fans of two of the most popular Chilean football teams. Methods: To this end, 43 male fans of two football rival teams watched videos of winning and losing goals of their favorite team while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: The results showed that while the activation of the reward system was observed in fans when their team scores goals against the rival, both the activation of the mentalization network and the inhibition of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were associated with the emotional correlates of defeat in football fans. Conclusions: Taking these findings together could contribute to a deeper understanding of social affiliation, and more importantly, of extreme affiliation phenomena, and fanaticism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying enhancer properties associated with genetic risk for complex traits using regulome-wide association studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex M. Casella, Carlo Colantuoni, Seth A. Ament</p>

Genetic risk for complex traits is strongly enriched in non-coding genomic regions involved in gene regulation, especially enhancers. However, we lack adequate tools to connect the characteristics of these disruptions to genetic risk. Here, we propose RWAS (Regulome Wide Association Study), a new application of the MAGMA software package to identify the characteristics of enhancers that contribute to genetic risk for disease. RWAS involves three steps: (i) assign genotyped SNPs to cell type- or tissue-specific regulatory features (e.g., enhancers); (ii) test associations of each regulatory feature with a trait of interest for which genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics are available; (iii) perform enhancer-set enrichment analyses to identify quantitative or categorical features of regulatory elements that are associated with the trait. These steps are implemented as a novel application of MAGMA, a tool originally developed for gene-based GWAS analyses. Applying RWAS to interrogate genetic risk for schizophrenia, we discovered a class of risk-associated AT-rich enhancers that are active in the developing brain and harbor binding sites for multiple transcription factors with neurodevelopmental functions. RWAS utilizes open-source software, and we provide a comprehensive collection of annotations for tissue-specific enhancer locations and features, including their evolutionary conservation, AT content, and co-localization with binding sites for hundreds of TFs. RWAS will enable researchers to characterize properties of regulatory elements associated with any trait of interest for which GWAS summary statistics are available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A multi-label learning model for predicting drug-induced pathology in multi-organ based on toxicogenomics data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ran Su, Haitang Yang, Leyi Wei, Siqi Chen, Quan Zou</p>

Drug-induced toxicity damages the health and is one of the key factors causing drug withdrawal from the market. It is of great significance to identify drug-induced target-organ toxicity, especially the detailed pathological findings, which are crucial for toxicity assessment, in the early stage of drug development process. A large variety of studies have devoted to identify drug toxicity. However, most of them are limited to single organ or only binary toxicity. Here we proposed a novel multi-label learning model named Att-RethinkNet, for predicting drug-induced pathological findings targeted on liver and kidney based on toxicogenomics data. The Att-RethinkNet is equipped with a memory structure and can effectively use the label association information. Besides, attention mechanism is embedded to focus on the important features and obtain better feature presentation. Our Att-RethinkNet is applicable in multiple organs and takes account the compound type, dose, and administration time, so it is more comprehensive and generalized. And more importantly, it predicts multiple pathological findings at the same time, instead of predicting each pathology separately as the previous model did. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compared the proposed method with a series of state-of-the-arts methods. Our model shows competitive performance and can predict potential hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in a more accurate and reliable way. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/RanSuLab/Drug-Toxicity-Prediction-MultiLabel.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Copper binding leads to increased dynamics in the regulatory N-terminal domain of full-length human copper transporter ATP7B</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fredrik OrÃ¤dd, Jonas Hyld Steffen, Pontus Gourdon, Magnus Andersson</p>

ATP7B is a human copper-transporting P<sub>1B</sub>-type ATPase that is involved in copper homeostasis and resistance to platinum drugs in cancer cells. ATP7B consists of a copper-transporting core and a regulatory N-terminal tail that contains six metal-binding domains (MBD1-6) connected by linker regions. The MBDs can bind copper, which changes the dynamics of the regulatory domain and activates the protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To identify possible copper-specific structural dynamics involved in transport regulation, we constructed a model of ATP7B spanning the N-terminal tail and core catalytic domains and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with (holo) and without (apo) copper ions bound to the MBDs. In the holo protein, MBD2, MBD3 and MBD5 showed enhanced mobilities, which resulted in a more extended N-terminal regulatory region. The observed separation of MBD2 and MBD3 from the core protein supports a mechanism where copper binding activates the ATP7B protein by reducing interactions among MBD1-3 and between MBD1-3 and the core protein. We also observed an increased interaction between MBD5 and the core protein that brought the copper-binding site of MBD5 closer to the high-affinity internal copper-binding site in the core protein. The simulation results assign specific, mechanistic roles to the metal-binding domains involved in ATP7B regulation that are testable in experimental settings.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The evolutionary conserved proteins CEP90, FOPNL, and OFD1 recruit centriolar distal appendage proteins to initiate their assembly</a></h4>

In metazoa, cilia assembly is a cellular process that starts with centriole to basal body maturation, migration to the cell surface, and docking to the plasma membrane. Basal body docking involves the interaction of both the distal end of the basal body and the transition fibers/distal appendages, with the plasma membrane. Mutations in numerous genes involved in basal body docking and transition zone assembly are associated with the most severe ciliopathies, highlighting the importance of these events in cilium biogenesis. In this context, the ciliate <i>Paramecium</i> has been widely used as a model system to study basal body and cilia assembly. However, despite the evolutionary conservation of cilia assembly events across phyla, whether the same molecular players are functionally conserved, is not fully known. Here, we demonstrated that CEP90, FOPNL, and OFD1 are evolutionary conserved proteins crucial for ciliogenesis. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we unveiled that these proteins localize at the distal end of both centrioles/basal bodies in <i>Paramecium</i> and mammalian cells. Moreover, we found that these proteins are recruited early during centriole duplication on the external surface of the procentriole. Functional analysis performed both in <i>Paramecium</i> and mammalian cells demonstrate the requirement of these proteins for distal appendage assembly and basal body docking. Finally, we show that mammalian centrioles require another component, Moonraker (MNR), to recruit OFD1, FOPNL, and CEP90, which will then recruit the distal appendage proteins CEP83, CEP89, and CEP164. Altogether, we propose that this OFD1, FOPNL, and CEP90 functional module is required to determine in mammalian cells the future position of distal appendage proteins.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is solid evidence for the prominent involvement of the central autonomic and default mode systems in shaping personality. However, whether functional connectivity of these systems can represent neural correlates and predictors of individual variation in personality traits is largely unknown. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 215 healthy young adults were used to construct the sympathetic (SN), parasympathetic (PN), and default mode (DMN) networks, with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity measured. Personality factors were assessed using the five-factor model. We examined the associations between personality factors and functional network connectivity, followed by performance of personality prediction based on functional connectivity using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a recently developed machine learning approach. All personality factors (neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) other than openness were significantly correlated with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity of the SN, PN, and DMN. Moreover, the CPM models successfully predicted conscientiousness and agreeableness at the individual level using functional network connectivity. Our findings may expand existing knowledge regarding the neural substrates underlying personality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in nursing homes â the experience of care workers in Poland [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nursing homes in Poland are the most common formal care institutions for dependent people. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nursing homes had particularly high infection rates. In this context, it is important to ask about the experiences of the care workers working in these institutions. Methods: This research was conducted using the computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) technique in five provinces in Poland. The field research was carried out in April 2021. The research sample included, among others, nurses, care workers, therapists, social workers and the management staff of institutions whose representatives worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were asked to assess the care provided to residents. Results: It turned out that the vast majority of respondents positively assessed the fulfillment of the basic living needs of residents and the availability of care. The assessment of the organization of residentsâ leisure time, the fulfillment of their religious and cultural needs, and the issue of maintaining contacts with the social environment was less satisfactory. The article also describes the results of care institution employeesâ self-assessment of their mental health. For the majority, the most stressful factor was the need to work in a health-threatening environment and the sense of responsibility for the residents. Regarding the availability of the forms of support offered to workers experiencing deteriorating mental health due to working in the pandemic situation, more than a third said that their institution did not offer any form of assistance. Conclusions: The article lists a number of recommendations. In the light of the data obtained, it is necessary to increase the intensity of services provided to residents of nursing homes in terms of organizing their free time, meeting their religious and cultural needs and maintaining contact with the social environment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Workflow Times and Outcomes in Patients Triaged for a Suspected Severe Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Current recommendations for regional stroke destination suggest that patients with severe acute stroke in non-urban areas should be triaged based on the estimated transport time to a referral thrombectomy-capable center.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post hoc analysis to evaluate the association of pre-hospital workflow times with neurological outcomes in patients included in the RACECAT trial. Workflow times evaluated were known or could be estimated before transport allocation. Primary outcome was the shift analysis on the modified Rankin score at 90âdays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 1,369 patients included, the median time from onset to emergency medical service (EMS) evaluation, the estimated transport time to a thrombectomy-capable center and local stroke center, and the estimated transfer time between centers were 65Â minutes (interquartile ratio [IQR]Â =Â 43â138), 61Â minutes (IQRÂ =Â 36â80), 17Â minutes (IQRÂ =Â 9â27), and 62Â minutes (IQRÂ =Â 36â73), respectively. Longer time intervals from stroke onset to EMS evaluation were associated with higher odds of disability at 90âdays in the local stroke center group (adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) for each 30-minute incrementÂ =Â 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]Â =Â 1.01â1.06), with no association in the thrombectomy-capable center group (acOR for each 30-minute incrementÂ =Â 1.01, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.98â1.01, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub>Â =Â 0.021). No significant interaction was found for other pre-hospital workflow times. In patients evaluated by EMS later than 120Â minutes after stroke onset, direct transport to a thrombectomy-capable center was associated with better disability outcomes (acORÂ =Â 1.49, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.03â2.17).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We found a significant heterogeneity in the association between initial transport destination and neurological outcomes according to the elapse of time between the stroke onset and the EMS evaluation (<a target="_blank"

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) exon 45â55 deletion (del45â55) has been postulated as a model that could treat up to 60% of DMD patients, but the associated clinical variability and complications require clarification. We aimed to understand the phenotypes and potential modifying factors of this dystrophinopathy subset.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study applied clinical and functional evaluation. Next generation sequencing was employed to identify intronic breakpoints and their impact on the <i>Dp140</i> promotor, intronic long noncoding RNA, and regulatory splicing sequences. DMD modifiers (<i>SPP1, LTBP4, ACTN3</i>) and concomitant mutations were also assessed. Haplotypes were built using <i>DMD</i> single nucleotide polymorphisms. Dystrophin expression was evaluated via immunostaining, Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and droplet digital PCR in 9 muscle biopsies.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The series comprised 57 subjects (23 index) expressing Becker phenotype (28%), isolated cardiopathy (19%), and asymptomatic features (53%). Cognitive impairment occurred in 90% of children. Patients were classified according to 10 distinct index-case breakpoints; 4 of them were recurrent due to founder events. A specific breakpoint (D5) was associated with severity, but no significant effect was appreciated due to the changes in intronic sequences. All biopsies showed dystrophin expression of &gt;67% and traces of alternative del45â57 transcript that were not deemed pathogenically relevant. Only the <i>LTBP4</i> haplotype appeared associated the presence of cardiopathy among the explored extragenic factors.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We confirmed that del45â55 segregates a high proportion of benign phenotypes, severe cases, and isolated cardiac and cognitive presentations. Although some influence of the intronic breakpoint position and the <i>LTBP4</i> modifier may exist, the pathomechanisms responsible for the phenotypic variability remain largely unresolved.

                The respiratory tract is a compartmentalised and heterogenous environment. The nasopharynx and sinuses of the upper airways have distinct properties from the lungs and these differences may shape bacterial adaptation and evolution. Upper airway niches act as early colonisation sites for respiratory bacterial pathogens, including those, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that can go on to establish chronic infection of the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite the importance of upper airway environments in facilitating early adaptation to host environments, currently available in vitro models for study of respiratory infection in CF focus exclusively on the lungs. Furthermore, animal models, widely used to bridge the gap between in vitro systems and the clinical scenario, do not allow the upper and lower airways to be studied in isolation. We have developed a suite of culture media reproducing key features of the upper and lower airways, for the study of bacterial adaptation and evolution in different respiratory environments. For both upper and lower airway-mimicking media, we have developed formulations that reflect airway conditions in health and those that reflect the altered environment of the CF respiratory tract. Here, we describe the development and validation of these media and their use for study of genetic and phenotypic adaptations in P. aeruginosa during growth under upper or lower airway conditions in health and in CF.

     alt="Diversity in spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and speed tuning across mouse visual cortical areas and layers"/>
<p>Using extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging genetically targeted to different layer 5 cell classes, we characterize the spatial frequency (SF), temporal frequency (TF), and speed tuning of deep (layer 5/6) cortical neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual cortical areas anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM). We find that deep-layer neurons, like superficial layer neurons, are functionally specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies in different visual areas. However, we also found a larger range of preferred SFs and TFs than previously reported in superficial cortical layers. We also find that direction tuning is much more prominent for layer 5 extratelencephalically than layer 5 intratelencephalically projecting neurons in multiple visual areas.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mouse visual system consists of several visual cortical areas thought to be specialized for different visual features and/or tasks. Previous studies have revealed differences between primary visual cortex (V1) and other higher visual areas, namely, anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM), and their tuning preferences for spatial and temporal frequency. However, these differences have primarily been characterized using methods that are biased toward superficial layers of cortex, such as two-photon calcium imaging. Fewer studies have investigated cell types in deeper layers of these areas and their tuning preferences. Because superficial versus deep-layer neurons and different types of deep-layer neurons are known to have different feedforward and feedback inputs and outputs, comparing the tuning preferences of these groups is important for understanding cortical visual information processing. In this study, we used extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging targeted toward two different layer 5 cell classes to characterize their tuning properties in V1, AL, and PM. We find that deep-layer neurons, similar to superficial layer neurons, are also specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies, with the strongest differences between AL and V1, and AL and PM, but not V1 and PM. However, we note that the deep-layer neuron populations preferred a larger range of SFs and TFs compared to previous studies. We also find that extratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons are more direction selective than intratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons.</p>
