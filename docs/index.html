	<p>The menstrual cycle affects women&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional states, with estrogen and progesterone having predominant roles. However, it remains unclear whether the phases of the menstrual cycle also affect women&amp;amp;rsquo;s motivational behaviors. In this study, the main aim was to investigate how the menstrual cycle influences approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance behavior under conditions of conscious versus unconscious processing of emotions. Briefly, after recruitment by advertisement and screening with a menstrual cycle survey questionnaire, 27 naturally cycling, healthy women participated in an improved &amp;amp;ldquo;manikin task&amp;amp;rdquo; and were presented both positive and negative emotional stimuli during early follicular, late follicular, and mid-luteal phases. Estrogen and progesterone levels were measured. Women in the late follicular phase exhibited the shortest response times for approaching positive stimuli, while women in the mid-luteal phase exhibited the shortest response times for avoiding negative stimuli. Estrogen and progesterone levels significantly correlated with the speed of the approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance responses observed for the women, indicating the important role that sex hormones have in mediating emotionally motivated behavior. Overall, these findings suggest that the menstrual cycle has strong and specific influences on women&amp;amp;rsquo;s approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance behaviors that are in part mediated by estrogen and progesterone. By identifying characteristics of these behaviors in the late follicular and mid-luteal phases, greater insight can be provided to women regarding the physiological influences of the menstrual cycle on their personal growth and security.</p>

	<p>The principal reason for measuring mental workload is to quantify the cognitive cost of performing tasks to predict human performance. Unfortunately, a method for assessing mental workload that has general applicability does not exist yet. This is due to the abundance of intuitions and several operational definitions from various fields that disagree about the sources or workload, its attributes, the mechanisms to aggregate these into a general model and their impact on human performance. This research built upon these issues and presents a novel method for mental workload modelling from EEG data employing deep learning. This method is self-supervised, employing a continuous brain rate, an index of cognitive activation, and does not require human declarative knowledge. The aim is to induce models automatically from data, supporting replicability, generalisability and applicability across fields and contexts. This specific method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable with spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data, aimed at fitting a novel brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional layers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since within-subject models had, on average, a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error of around 11%. The addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of high-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their accuracy. These findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of automatically learnt high-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced through convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time, intuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses. Additionally, across-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of participants, thus trained with data containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to the within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of the induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence of subject-independent cognitive activation patterns. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing scholars with a novel computational method for mental workload modelling that aims to be generally applicable and does not rely on ad hoc human crafted models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in authorship demographics for manuscripts published in endocrine journals - A 70-year analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over the previous few decades, trends in author demographics have significantly changed. Such trends have already been studied for many sub-specialties but endocrinology is among the few branches that are yet to see an analysis of such trends. This paper aims to fill this gap.  Methods: Journal of Endocrinology and General & Comparative Endocrinology are two landmark journals that publish articles from around the world. Each decade during the 70-year period from 1961 to 2021 has been examined in this study. Funding source, first author – senior author gender, their demographics and proportion of papers with at least one female author were the parameters considered while studying each publication. It was predicted that the number of female authors per paper would increase with time, as would the range of degrees held by the authors, demographical variations in authorship, and the funding source. The aim was also to determine the distribution of female first authors and senior authors in endocrinology journals over a 70-year period, as well as to check the gender combinations using the Punnett square. Results: Female first authors rose from 7% to 29.6% (p<0.0006) between 1961 and 2021, whereas female senior authors rose from 15.6% to 22.2%. Despite women's small contributions to first and senior authors, female participation rose from 17.48% (25/143) to 70% (170/250) between 1961 and 2021. Male-Female and Female-Male combinations rose with Chi-Square = 124.6, (p<0.0001). Europe and the Americas had the most female academic medical contributors (p<0.0001) Regardless of author status, female participation rose from 17.48% in 1961 to 68% in 2021.  Conclusion: In papers published in endocrinology journals, there was a rising trend in female contributions to academic medicine. Even with the large growth of female endocrinologists, there is still a disparity in why the increase in female authors is comparably fewer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Metabolites of Pinang Yaki (Areca vestiaria) Fruit Extract: A Metabolite Profiling Study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pinang yaki has bioactive compounds that have potential as a new herbal supplement, but their metabolites profil is lack of data. A better understanding of the bioactive compounds of pinang yaki using untargeted metabolomic profiling studies will provide clearer insight into the health benefits of pinang yaki in further.   Methods: Fresh samples of pinang yaki (Areca vestiaria) are obtained from forests in North Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Samples were used for untargeted metabolomics analysis by UHPLC-MS.   Results: Based on an untargeted metabolomic profiling study of pinang yaki, 2504 compounds in ESI- and 2645 compounds in ESI+ were successfully obtained. After the analysis, 356 compounds in ESI- and 543 compounds in ESI+ were identified successfully. Major compounds Alpha-Chlorohydrin (PubChem ID: 7290) and Tagatose (PubChem ID: 439312) were found in ESI+ and ESI-.   Discussion: The 10 metabolites from pinang yaki extract (ESI+) also have been indicated in preventing viral infection and have exhibited good neuroprotective immunity. Benzothiazole (PubChem ID: 7222), L-isoleucine (PubChem ID: 6306), D-glucono-delta-lactone (PubChem ID: 736), Diethylpyrocarbonate (PubChem ID: 3051), Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) amine (PubChem ID: 7791), Cinnamic acid (PubChem ID: 444539), and Trigonelline (PubChem ID: 5570) also had potential effects as an antiviral and anti-inflammatory. Conclusion: Untargeted metabolomic profiling showed many bioactive compounds contained in pinang yaki (Areca vestiaria) extract. The top 10 compounds capable to ionize well have been identified and explored for their potential benefits as antiviral supplement products by literature study. This is a preliminary study which still needs further research such as in vitro, preclinical, and clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Returning to work at school during the COVID -19 pandemic, is it stressful for schoolteachers? Assessment of immediate psychological effects: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The adoption of remote classes for students has been in vogue since the onset of the pandemic. Schools reopened in a phased manner after the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India. Reverting to the regular face-to-face teaching for students became a challenge to the teachers and students, especially at times when there was an impending third wave on the way. The study aimed to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers who attended reopened schools in the scenario of face-to-face classes. In addition, we studied the association of psychological symptoms with teachers' age groups, gender, school boards, and school institution type. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October to December 2021 after schools had reopened. Data was collected using Google Form questionnaires in 124 schoolteachers. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire assessed the psychological symptoms. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers, 108(87.1%) were female, 112 (90.3%) were from private institutions, and 70(56.5%) were from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school boards. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers was 30.6%, 45.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. Nearly 80% of the female teachers expressed depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Amongst all the age groups, symptoms were higher in 40-49 group. We found anxiety to be statistically significant when compared with gender (p-0.042). We found no statistically significant differences concerning age groups, school boards, or school institutions with any psychological symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychological symptoms was high among schoolteachers after schools reopened for regular face-to-face teaching. Gender was associated with anxiety in teachers. We agree that identifying teachers' symptoms and providing adequate psychological counseling/support would improve their mental health status and thereby the quality of teaching to students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mulberroside A could serve as a pan inhibitor for the tyrosine kinase domains of the HER family [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Numerous medicines were authorized for their targeting of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of human epidermal receptors (HER). However, it has been demonstrated that these TKDs exhibit persistent resistance, necessitating the development of additional inhibitors with different modes of action. A single pharmacophore can be manipulated to create a pan-inhibitor where the binding site of these receptors has been highly conserved. The development of anti-cancer agents and the introduction of synergistic action to increase the efficacy of current medications have both recently benefited from the use of medicinal plants and herbal extracts as a reliable source. The binding affinity to the TKDs was predicted by molecular docking, followed by molecular dynamic simulation to examine the changes in the motion of the enzymes, with a focus on the components responsible for catalytic activity (C α-helix), activation (activation loop), and autophosphorylation (C-terminal loop). According to the ∆G value provided by Autodock Vina (-40.54, -40.12, -37.20, -37.62 kJ/mol for HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4, respectively) and MM/PBSA, which indicates a strong affinity for the TKDs, the outcomes are undeniably positive. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and the principal component analysis (PCA) detected significant dynamic changes in the TKDs, particularly in the C α-helix and the activation loop for all TKDs, suggesting that mulberroside A may alter the function of these enzymes. This study will expand our understanding of the dynamics of the TKDs and shed light on the anticancer potential of the polyphenolic compounds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Green campus universities: case studies on problems and prospects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sustainability is a crucial social issue. In recent years, many scholars have suggested that the issue should be tackled at universities because they act as leaders in education, research and innovation. Universities are in a good position to foster progressive action towards global issues within current and future generations. As universities seek to create sustainable campuses, the green campus approach can create opportunities for a cultural paradigm shift, where universities become global leaders in sustainability. There have been various studies related to sustainability issues that include how universities can seek to create sustainable campuses. However, there are some gaps in the research on the “green campus approach” as a way to create sustainable campuses. This paper intends to examine the problems and prospects of creating a green campus university.   Methods: Data collection was conducted using the qualitative method. Structured interviews and observations were conducted via visits to the selected case-study universities as well as panels and discussions with experts in respective ministry and government agencies. All collected data were transcribed before being analysed using the NVivo software and thematic coding.  Results: Most universities in Malaysia have plans toward sustainability and the green campus approach. The awareness of going green and creating sustainability on university campuses has gradually increased. A strategic framework is needed as a guideline for creating green campuses in the higher education setting of Malaysia.  Conclusions: This study offers new insights into creating green campus universities in Malaysia as a means to create sustainability in higher education settings. The study involved three of the oldest universities in Malaysia. Future research may expand into other universities in Malaysia or internationally.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Isolation and identification of fluoride sensitive and fluoride resistant Streptococcus mutans strains from dental carries of diabetic patients using conventional methods in Sudan. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental caries also known as cavities are the most predominant disease today. Streptococcus mutans can form a biofilm on the tooth surface, produce high levels of lactic acid following fermentation of dietary sugars, and are resistant to the adverse effects of low pH, properties which are essential for oral micro biota. The aim of this study was to isolate S. mutans and characterize their antimicrobial properties against sodium fluoride. Fresh dental caries samples were collected from diabetic patients. The isolates were identified based on their acidogenic, biochemical test, and antimicrobial properties. Methods The socio-demographic data collected through a structure designated questionnaire and the biological data collected through sterile cotton swabs. For analysis of data, Statistical Package for Social Sciences software, version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used. Results Only 32 of the 80 samples (40%) gave a positive growth for S. mutans on MSBA (mitis salivarius bacitracin agar). The sensitivity of the isolates against sodium fluoride was tested by preparing NaF of four different concentrations (80, 125, 250, and 500) mg\L. Fifty percent of isolates were found to be resistant to NaF at a concentration of 80 mg/L, while 28% were resistant to 125 mg/L NaF, 16%   to 250 mg/L and 3% to 500mg/L NaF. The majority of the participants were aged between 51–60 years (33%), were female (54%), had type II diabetes mellitus (64%), and the duration of their diabetes was less than five years (35%). Conclusions By using the information in this study, we were able to discover strains of S. mutans that are resistant to fluoride. This study can be used as an essential key to study the genetic mutation that occurred.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of forest honey (Apis dorsata) as therapy for ovarian failure causing malnutrition [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malnutrition is the imbalance between intake and nutritional needs, resulting in a decrease in body weight, composition, and physical function. Malnutrition causes infertility due to intestinal and liver degeneration,which may progress to testicular and ovarian degeneration. Methods: An infertile female rat model with a degenerative ovary was induced with malnutrition through a 5-day food fasting but still had drinking water. The administration of (T1) 30% (v/v) and (T2) 50% (v/v) forest honey (Apis dorsata) were performed for ten consecutive days, whereas the (T+) group was fasted and not administered forest honey and the (T−) group has not fasted and not administered forest honey. Superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, IL-13 and TNF-α cytokine expressions, and ovarian tissue regeneration were analyzed. Results: Superoxide dismutase was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (65.24±7.53), T2 (74.16±12.3), and T− (65.09±6.56) compared with T+ (41.76±8.51). Malondialdehyde was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (9.71±1.53), T2 (9.23±0.96), and T− (9.83±1.46) compared with T+ (15.28±1.61). Anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-13) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (5.30±2.31), T2 (9.80±2.53), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (2.70±1.57). Pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (4.40±3.02), T2 (2.50±1.65), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (9.50±1.78). Ovarian tissue regeneration was significantly different (p<0.05) in T− (8.6±0.69) and T2 (5.10±0.99) compared with T1 (0.7±0.95) and T+ (0.3±0.67). Conclusion: The 10-day administration of 50% (v/v) forest honey can be an effective therapy for ovarian failure that caused malnutrition in the female rat model.

                Background: The volatilome of fermented food products are essential metabolites that significantly contribute to such foods’ overall composition and sensorial quality. The dataset presented herein represents the volatilome of raw and fermented maize flour samples. Methods: Maize grains were milled and naturally fermented at 35°C into sourdough at different periods (24, 48 and 72 h) and, at each point, the profile of the volatiles was investigated. Samples at the different fermentation periods were analyzed using solid phase microextraction coupled with a gas chromatography-high resolution time of flight-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-HRTOF-MS). Results: Data obtained were classified into different compound groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic compounds, esters, organic acids, terpenes, ketones, among others and their characteristics such as the retention time, observed mass, molecular formular, mean peak areas and mass spectra also presented. Conclusion: These datasets of fermented maize volatilome can be used as biomarkers for maize fermentation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Global and gene-specific translational regulation in Escherichia coli across different conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Di Zhang, Sophia Hsin-Jung Li, Christopher G. King, Ned S. Wingreen, Zemer Gitai, Zhiyuan Li</p>

How well mRNA transcript levels represent protein abundances has been a controversial issue. Particularly across different environments, correlations between mRNA and protein exhibit remarkable variability from gene to gene. Translational regulation is likely to be one of the key factors contributing to mismatches between mRNA level and protein abundance in bacteria. Here, we quantified genome-wide transcriptome and relative translation efficiency (RTE) under 12 different conditions in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. By quantifying the mRNA-RTE correlation both across genes and across conditions, we uncovered a diversity of gene-specific translational regulations, cooperating with transcriptional regulations, in response to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphate (P) limitations. Intriguingly, we found that many genes regulating translation are themselves subject to translational regulation, suggesting possible feedbacks. Furthermore, a random forest model suggests that codon usage partially predicts a gene’s cross-condition variability in translation efficiency; such cross-condition variability tends to be an inherent quality of a gene, independent of the specific nutrient limitations. These findings broaden the understanding of translational regulation under different environments and provide novel strategies for the control of translation in synthetic biology. In addition, our data offers a resource for future multi-omics studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep mendelian randomization: Investigating the causal knowledge of genomic deep learning models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephen Malina, Daniel Cizin, David A. Knowles</p>

Multi-task deep learning (DL) models can accurately predict diverse genomic marks from sequence, but whether these models learn the causal relationships between genomic marks is unknown. Here, we describe Deep Mendelian Randomization (DeepMR), a method for estimating causal relationships between genomic marks learned by genomic DL models. By combining Mendelian randomization with <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis, DeepMR obtains local (locus specific) and global estimates of (an assumed) linear causal relationship between marks. In a simulation designed to test recovery of pairwise causal relations between transcription factors (TFs), DeepMR gives accurate and unbiased estimates of the ‘true’ global causal effect, but its coverage decays in the presence of sequence-dependent confounding. We then apply DeepMR to examine the global relationships learned by a state-of-the-art DL model, BPNet, between TFs involved in reprogramming. DeepMR’s causal effect estimates validate previously hypothesized relationships between TFs and suggest new relationships for future investigation.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To explore gene expression profile of primary CNS vasculitis (PCNSV).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain specimens of 4 patients with granulomatous vasculitis (GV), 5 with lymphocytic vasculitis (LV), 4 with amyloid β-related angiitis (ABRA) and 4 normal controls were studies. RNA-sequencing was performed using Illumina® Hiseq-4,000 platform and the Illumina® TruSeq® Total-RNA library. Student's t-test and false discovery rate tests were performed for each of the differentially expressed transcripts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® was used for the pathway expression analysis. CIBERSORT was used to esteem the abundances of different immune cell subsets in the tissues based on gene expression data.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Transcripts differentially expressed between PCNSV and normal brain indicated that endosomal, mitochondrial and ribosome dysfunction, alterations in protein synthesis and non-coding RNAs might be involved in PCNSV. Pathway analysis revealed the activation of dendritic cell maturation and antigen processing as well as neuroinflammation in PCNSV <i>versus</i> normal brain, while oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited. CIBERSORT estimation of immune cell subsets suggested that activated NK cells, M1 macrophages, memory B cells and follicular helper T cells were likely more prevalent in PCNSV samples. Naïve CD4 T cells and monocytes were mainly estimated to be present in GV and ABRA. Plasma cell and γδ T cell signatures were mainly found in LV and normal brain. GV showed higher levels of genes associated with macrophage activities and T cells. ABRA showed higher levels of long non-coding RNAs and miR-616. LV showed higher levels of genes encoding immunoglobulins.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RNA sequencing confirmed PCNSV heterogeneity.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a potentially harmful, often overlooked sleep disorder affecting up to 70% of Parkinson's disease patients. Current diagnosis relies on nocturnal video-polysomnography, which is an expensive and cumbersome examination requiring specific clinical expertise. Here, we explored the use of wrist actigraphy to enable automatic RBD diagnoses in home settings.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 26 Parkinson's disease patients underwent 2-week home wrist actigraphy, followed by two in-laboratory evaluations. Patients were classified as RBD versus non-RBD based on dream enactment history and video-polysomnography. We comprehensively characterized patients' movement patterns during sleep using actigraphic signals. We then trained machine learning classification algorithms to discriminate patients with or without RBD using the most relevant features. Classification performance was quantified with respect to clinical diagnosis, separately for in-laboratory and at-home recordings. Performance was further validated in a control group of non-Parkinson's disease patients with other sleep conditions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>To characterize RBD, actigraphic features extracted from both (1) individual movement episodes and (2) global nocturnal activity were critical. RBD patients were more active overall, and showed movements that were shorter, of higher magnitude, and more scattered in time. Using these features, our classification algorithms reached an accuracy of 92.9 ± 8.16% during in-clinic tests. When validated on home recordings in Parkinson's disease patients, accuracy reached 100% over a 2-week window, and was 94.4% in non-Parkinson's disease control patients. Features showed robustness across tests and conditions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results open new perspectives for faster, cheaper, and more regular screening of sleep disorders, both for routine clinical practice and clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>In this study, we propose that the resilience of structural hub disruption compensated by functional connectivity in the DMN underlies the stable disability compensating by the aging of RRMS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease which leads to impairment in several functional systems including cognition. Alteration of brain networks is linked to disability and its progression. However, results are mostly cross-sectional and yet contradictory as putative adaptive and maladaptive mechanisms were found. Here, we aimed to explore longitudinal reorganization of brain networks over 2-years by combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and a comprehensive neuropsychological-battery. In 37 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 39 healthy-controls, cognition remained stable over-time. We reconstructed network models based on the three modalities and analyzed connectivity in relation to the hierarchical topology and functional subnetworks. Network models were compared across modalities and in their association with cognition using linear-mixed-effect-regression models. Loss of hub connectivity and global reduction was observed on a structural level over-years (<i>p</i> &lt; .010), which was similar for functional MEG-networks but not for fMRI-networks. Structural hub connectivity increased in controls (<i>p</i> = .044), suggesting a physiological mechanism of healthy aging. Despite a general loss in structural connectivity in RRMS, hub connectivity was preserved (<i>p</i> = .002) over-time in default-mode-network (DMN). MEG-networks were similar to DTI and weakly correlated with fMRI in MS (<i>p</i> &lt; .050). Lower structural (<i>β</i> between .23–.33) and both lower (<i>β</i> between .40–.59) and higher functional connectivity (<i>β</i> = −.54) in DMN was associated with poorer performance in attention and memory in RRMS (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). MEG-networks involved no association with cognition. Here, cognitive stability despite ongoing neurodegeneration might indicate a resilience mechanism of DMN hubs mimicking a physiological reorganization observed in healthy aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Fewer COVID‐19 neurological complications with dexamethasone and remdesivir</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the impact of treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both on neurological complications in acute COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used observational data from the International Severe Acute and emerging Respiratory Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK). Hospital inpatients aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between 31 January 2020 and 29 June 2021 were included. Treatment allocation was non-blinded and performed by reporting clinicians. A propensity scoring methodology was used to minimize confounding. Treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone or both was assessed against standard of care. The primary outcome was a neurological complication occurring at the point of death, discharge, or resolution of the COVID-19 clinical episode.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Out of 89,297 hospital inpatients, 64,088 had severe COVID-19 and 25,209 had non-hypoxic COVID-19. Neurological complications developed in 4.8% and 4.5% respectively. In both groups, neurological complications associated with increased mortality, ICU admission, worse self-care on discharge and time to recovery. In severe COVID-19, treatment with dexamethasone (n=21,129), remdesivir (n=1,428) and both combined (n=10,846) associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications: OR=0.76 (95% CI=0.69-0.83), OR 0.69 (95% CI=0.51-0.90) and OR=0.54, (95% CI=0.47-0.61) respectively. In non-hypoxic COVID-19, dexamethasone (n=2,580) associated with less neurological complications (OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.97), while the dexamethasone/remdesivir combination (n=460) showed a similar trend (OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.31-1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications in an additive manner, such that the greatest benefit was observed in patients who received both drugs together.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enriched dietary saturated fatty acids induce trained immunity via ceramide production that enhances severity of endotoxemia and clearance of infection</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity is an innate immune memory response that is induced by primary microbial or sterile stimuli that sensitizes monocytes and macrophages to a secondary pathogenic challenge, reprogramming the host response to infection and inflammatory disease. Nutritional components, such as dietary fatty acids, can act as inflammatory stimuli, but it is unknown if they can act as the primary stimuli in the context of innate immune memory. Here we find mice fed a diet enriched exclusively in saturated fatty acids (SFAs; ketogenic diet; KD) confer a hyper-inflammatory response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased mortality, independent of diet-induced microbiome and glycemic modulation. We find KD mediates the composition of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, and macrophages derived from the bone marrow of mice fed KD do not have altered baseline inflammation, but enhanced responses to a secondary inflammatory challenge. Lipidomics identified enhanced free palmitic acid (PA) and PA-associated lipids in KD-fed mice serum. We found pre-treatment with physiologically relevant concentrations of PA alone reprograms macrophages to induce a hyper-inflammatory response to secondary challenge with LPS. This response was found to be dependent on the synthesis of ceramide, and reversible when treated with a ceramide synthase inhibitor. <i>In vivo</i>, we found systemic PA confers enhanced inflammation and mortality during an acute inflammatory response to systemic LPS, and this phenotype was not reversible for up to 7 days post-PA-exposure. While PA-treatment is harmful for endotoxemia outcome, we find PA exposure enhanced clearance of <i>Candida albicans</i> in <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further, we show that oleic acid (OA), a mono-unsaturated FA that depletes intracellular ceramide, reverses the PA-induced hyper-inflammatory response shown in macrophages treated with LPS, and reduces severity and mortality of LPS endotoxin stimulation, highlighting the plasticity of SFA-dependent enhanced endotoxemia severity <i>in vivo. </i>These are the first data to implicate enriched dietary SFAs, and specifically PA, in the induction of long-lived innate immune memory that is detrimental during an acute inflammatory response, but beneficial for clearance of pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural underpinning of a respiration-associated resting-state fMRI network</a></h4>

              
                Respiration can induce motion and CO<sub>2 </sub>fluctuation during resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) scans, which will lead to non-neural artifacts in the rsfMRI signal. In the meantime, as a crucial physiologic process, respiration that can directly drive neural activity change in the brain, and may thereby modulate the rsfMRI signal. Nonetheless, this potential neural component in the respiration-fMRI relationship is largely unexplored. To elucidate this issue, here we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiology, rsfMRI and respiration signals in rats. Our data show that respiration is indeed associated with neural activity changes, evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and the gamma-band power of the electrophysiologic signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex. Intriguingly, slow respiration variations are also linked to a characteristic rsfMRI network, which is mediated by gamma-band neural activity. In addition, this respiration-related brain network disappears when brain-wide neural activity is silenced at an iso-electrical state, while the respiration is maintained, further confirming the necessary role of neural activity in this network. Taken together, this study identifies a respiration-related brain network underpinned by neural activity, which represents a novel component in the respiration-rsfMRI relationship that is distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts. It opens a new avenue for investigating the interactions between respiration, neural activity and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel monocyte differentiation pattern in pristane-induced lupus with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                Pristane causes chronic peritoneal inflammation resulting in lupus, which in C57BL/6 mice is complicated by lung microvascular injury and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Mineral oil (MO) also causes inflammation, but not lupus or DAH. Since monocyte depletion prevents DAH, we examined the role of monocytes in the disease. Impaired bone marrow (BM) monocyte egress in <i>Ccr2−</i>/− mice abolished DAH, confirming the importance of monocyte recruitment to the lung. Circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice exhibited increased annexin-V staining in comparison with MO-treated controls without evidence of apoptosis, suggesting that pristane alters the distribution of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane before or shortly after monocyte egress from the BM. Plasma membrane asymmetry also was impaired in Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> ‘patrolling’ monocytes, which are derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> precursors. Patrolling Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes normally promote endothelial repair, but their phenotype was altered in pristane-treated mice. In contrast to MO-treated controls, Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice were CD138<sup>+</sup>, expressed more TremL4, a protein that amplifies TLR7 signaling, and exuberantly produced TNFα in response to TLR7 stimulation. TremL4 expression on these novel CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes was regulated by Nr4a1. Thus, monocyte CD138, high TremL4 expression, and annexin-V staining may define an activated/inflammatory subtype of patrolling monocytes associated with DAH susceptibility. By altering monocyte development, pristane exposure may generate activated Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes, contributing to lung microvascular endothelial injury and DAH susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In situ X-ray assisted electron microscopy staining for large biological samples</a></h4>

              
                Electron microscopy of biological tissue has recently seen an unprecedented increase in imaging throughput moving the ultrastructural analysis of large tissue blocks such as whole brains into the realm of the feasible. However, homogeneous, high quality electron microscopy staining of large biological samples is still a major challenge. To date, assessing the staining quality in electron microscopy requires running a sample through the entire staining protocol end-to-end, which can take weeks or even months for large samples, rendering protocol optimization for such samples to be inefficient. Here we present an <i>in situ</i> time-lapsed X-ray assisted staining procedure that opens the 'black box' of electron microscopy staining and allows observation of individual staining steps in real time. Using this novel method we measured the accumulation of heavy metals in large tissue samples immersed in different staining solutions. We show that the measured accumulation of osmium in fixed tissue obeys empirically a quadratic dependence between the incubation time and sample size. We found that potassium ferrocyanide, a classic reducing agent for osmium tetroxide, clears the tissue after osmium staining and that the tissue expands in osmium tetroxide solution, but shrinks in potassium ferrocyanide reduced osmium solution. X-ray assisted staining gave access to the <i>in situ</i> staining kinetics and allowed us to develop a diffusion-reaction-advection model that accurately simulates the measured accumulation of osmium in tissue. These are first steps towards <i>in silico</i> staining experiments and simulation-guided optimization of staining protocols for large samples. Hence, X-ray assisted staining will be a useful tool for the development of reliable staining procedures for large samples such as entire brains of mice, monkeys or humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular mechanism of Afadin substrate recruitment to the receptor phosphatase PTPRK via its pseudophosphatase domain</a></h4>

              
                Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type kappa (PTPRK) is a transmembrane receptor that links extracellular homophilic interactions to intracellular catalytic activity. Previously we showed that PTPRK promotes cell-cell adhesion by selectively dephosphorylating several cell junction regulators including the protein Afadin (Fearnley et al., 2019). Here we demonstrate that Afadin is recruited for dephosphorylation by directly binding to the PTPRK D2 pseudophosphatase domain. We mapped this interaction to a putative coiled coil (CC) domain in Afadin that is separated by more than 100 amino acids from the substrate pTyr residue. We identify the residues that define PTP specificity, explaining how Afadin is selectively dephosphorylated by PTPRK yet not by the closely related receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRM. Our work demonstrates that PTP substrate specificity can be determined by protein-protein interactions distal to the active site. This explains how PTPRK and other PTPs achieve substrate specificity despite a lack of specific sequence context at the substrate pTyr. Furthermore, by demonstrating that these interactions are phosphorylation-independent and mediated via binding to a non-catalytic domain, we highlight how receptor PTPs could function as intracellular scaffolds in addition to catalyzing protein dephosphorylation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure and flexibility of the yeast NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex</a></h4>

              
                The NuA4 protein complex acetylates histones H4 and H2A to activate both transcription and DNA repair. We report the 3.1 Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the central hub of NuA4, which flexibly tethers the HAT and TINTIN modules. The hub contains the large Tra1 subunit and a core that includes Swc4, Arp4, Act1, Eaf1 and the C-terminal region of Epl1. Eaf1 stands out as the primary scaffolding factor that interacts with the Tra1, Swc4 and Epl1 subunits and contributes the conserved HSA helix to the Arp module. Using nucleosome binding assays, we find that the HAT module, which is anchored to the core through Epl1, recognizes H3K4me3 nucleosomes with hyperacetylated H3 tails, while the TINTIN module, anchored to the core via Eaf1, recognizes nucleosomes that have hyperacetylated H2A and H4 tails. Together with the known interaction of Tra1 with site-specific transcription factors, our data suggests a model in which Tra1 recruits NuA4 to specific genomic sites then allowing the flexible HAT and TINTIN modules to select nearby nucleosomes for acetylation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Caveolae couple mechanical stress to integrin recycling and activation</a></h4>

              
                Cells are subjected to multiple mechanical inputs throughout their lives. Their ability to detect these environmental cues is called mechanosensing, a process in which integrins play an important role. During cellular mechanosensing, plasma membrane (PM) tension is adjusted to mechanical stress through the buffering action of caveolae; however, little is known about the role of caveolae in early integrin mechanosensing regulation. Here, we show that Cav1KO fibroblasts increase adhesion to FN-coated beads when pulled with magnetic tweezers, as compared to wild type fibroblasts. This phenotype is Rho-independent and mainly derived from increased active b1-integrin content on the surface of Cav1KO fibroblasts. FRAP analysis and endocytosis/recycling assays revealed that active b1-integrin is mostly endocytosed through the CLIC/GEEC pathway and is more rapidly recycled to the PM in Cav1KO fibroblasts, in a Rab4 and PM tension-dependent manner. Moreover, the threshold for PM tension-driven b1-integrin activation is lower in Cav1KO MEFs than in wild type MEFs, through a mechanism dependent on talin activity. Our findings suggest that caveolae couple mechanical stress to integrin cycling and activation, thereby regulating the early steps of the cellular mechanosensing response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Didemnin B and ternatin-4 differentially inhibit conformational changes in eEF1A required for aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation into mammalian ribosomes</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and accurate mRNA translation requires efficient codon-dependent delivery of the correct aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the ribosomal A site. In mammals, this fidelity-determining reaction is facilitated by the GTPase elongation factor-1 alpha (eEF1A), which escorts aa-tRNA as an eEF1A(GTP)-aa-tRNA ternary complex into the ribosome. The structurally unrelated cyclic peptides didemnin B and ternatin-4 bind to the eEF1A(GTP)-aa-tRNA ternary complex and inhibit translation but have different effects on protein synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we employ single-molecule fluorescence imaging and cryogenic electron microscopy to determine how these natural products inhibit translational elongation on mammalian ribosomes. By binding to a common site on eEF1A, didemnin B and ternatin-4 trap eEF1A in an intermediate state of aa-tRNA selection, preventing eEF1A release and aa-tRNA accommodation on the ribosome. We also show that didemnin B and ternatin-4 exhibit distinct effects on the dynamics of aa-tRNA selection that inform on observed disparities in their inhibition efficacies and physiological impacts. These integrated findings underscore the value of dynamics measurements in assessing the mechanism of small-molecule inhibition and highlight potential of single-molecule methods to reveal how distinct natural products differentially impact the human translation mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of SARS-CoV-2 M protein in lipid nanodiscs</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins incorporated into virions, spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M). M plays an essential role in viral assembly by organizing other structural proteins through physical interactions and directing them to sites of viral budding. As the most abundant protein in the viral envelope and a target of patient antibodies, M is a compelling target for vaccines and therapeutics. Still, the structure of M and molecular basis for its role in virion formation are unknown. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 M in lipid nanodiscs to 3.5 Å resolution. M forms a 50 kDa homodimer that is structurally related to the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a viroporin, suggesting a shared ancestral origin. Structural comparisons reveal how intersubunit gaps create a small, enclosed pocket in M and large open cavity in ORF3a, consistent with a structural role and ion channel activity, respectively. M displays a strikingly electropositive cytosolic surface that may be important for interactions with N, S, and viral RNA. Molecular dynamics simulations show a high degree of structural rigidity in a simple lipid bilayer and support a role for M homodimers in scaffolding viral assembly. Together, these results provide insight into roles for M in coronavirus assembly and structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">scRNA-sequencing reveals subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations in DRG neurons of PirtEGFPf mice in neuropathic pain condition</a></h4>

              
                Functionally distinct subtypes/clusters of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons may play different roles in nerve regeneration and pain. However, details about their transcriptomic changes under neuropathic pain conditions remain unclear. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve represents a well-established model of neuropathic pain, and we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize subtype-specific perturbations of transcriptomes in lumbar DRG neurons on day 7 post-CCI. By using <i>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></i> mice that selectively express an enhanced <i>green fluorescent protein</i> in DRG neurons, we established a highly efficient purification process to enrich neurons for scRNA-seq. We observed the emergence of four prominent CCI-induced clusters and a loss of marker genes in injured neurons. Importantly, a portion of injured neurons from several clusters were spared from injury-induced identity loss, suggesting subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in injured neurons. Moreover, uninjured neurons, which are necessary for mediating the evoked pain, also demonstrated cell-type-specific transcriptomic perturbations in these clusters, but not in others. Notably, male and female mice showed differential transcriptomic changes in multiple neuronal clusters after CCI, suggesting transcriptomic sexual dimorphism in DRG neurons after nerve injury. Using <i>Fgf3</i> as a proof-of-principle, RNAscope study provided further evidence of increased <i>Fgf3</i> in injured neurons after CCI, supporting scRNA-seq analysis, and calcium imaging study unraveled a functional role of <i>Fgf3</i> in neuronal excitability. These findings may contribute to the identification of new target genes and the development of DRG neuron cell-type-specific therapies for optimizing neuropathic pain treatment and nerve regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternative splicing of apoptosis genes promotes human T cell survival</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing occurs in the vast majority of human genes, giving rise to distinct mRNA and protein isoforms. We, and others, have previously identified hundreds of genes that change their isoform expression upon T cell activation via alternative splicing; however, how these changes link activation input with functional output remains largely unknown. Here we investigate how costimulation of T cells through the CD28 receptor impacts alternative splicing in T cells activated through the T cell receptor (CD3) and find that while CD28 signaling alone has minimal impact on splicing, it enhances the extent of change for up to 20% of TCR-induced alternative splicing events. Interestingly, a set of CD28-enhanced splicing events occur within genes encoding key components of the apoptotic signaling pathway; namely caspase-9, Bax and Bim. Using both CRISPR-edited cells and antisense oligos to force expression of specific isoforms, we show for all three of these genes that the isoform induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation promotes resistance to apoptosis, and that changes in all three genes together function combinatorially to further promote cell viability. Finally, we show that the JNK signaling pathway, induced downstream of CD3/CD28 costimulation, is required for each of these splicing events, further highlighting their co-regulation. Together these findings demonstrate that alternative splicing is a key mechanism by which costimulation of CD28 promotes viability of activated T cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular basis of FAAH-OUT-associated human pain insensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain affects millions of people worldwide. Studying pain insensitive individuals helps to identify novel analgesic strategies. Here we report how the recently discovered FAAH-OUT lncRNA-encoding gene, which was found from studying a pain insensitive patient with reduced anxiety and fast wound healing, regulates the adjacent key endocannabinoid system gene FAAH, which encodes the anandamide-degrading fatty acid amide hydrolase enzyme. We demonstrate that the disruption in FAAH-OUT lncRNA transcription leads to DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation within the FAAH promoter. In addition, FAAH-OUT contains a conserved regulatory element, FAAH-AMP, that acts as an enhancer for FAAH expression. Furthermore, using transcriptomic analyses we have uncovered a network of genes that are dysregulated from disruption of the FAAH-FAAH-OUT axis, thus providing a coherent mechanistic basis to understand the human phenotype observed and a platform for development of future gene and small molecule therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inference of Presynaptic Connectivity from Temporally Blurry Spike Trains by Supervised Learning</a></h4>

              
                Reconstruction of neural network connectivity is a central focus of neuroscience. The ability to use neuronal connection information to predict activity at single unit resolution and decipher its effect on whole systems can provide critical information about behavior and cognitive processing. Neuronal sensing modalities come in varying forms, but there is yet to exist a modality that can deliver readouts that sufficiently address the spatiotemporal constraints of biological nervous systems. This necessitates supplementary approaches that rely on mathematical models to mitigate physical limitations and decode network features. Here, we introduce a simple proof-of-concept model that addresses temporal constraints by reconstructing presynaptic connections from temporally blurry data. We use a variation of the perceptron algorithm to process firing rate information at multiple time constraints for a heterogenous feed-forward network of excitatory, inhibitory, and unconnected presynaptic units. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm under these conditions and determine the optimal learning rate, firing rate, and the ability to reconstruct single unit spikes for a given degree of temporal blur. We then test our method on a physiologically relevant configuration by sampling network subpopulations of leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal models displaying bursting firing patterns and find comparable learning rates for optimized reconstruction of network connectivity. Our method provides a recipe for reverse engineering neural networks based on limited data quality that can be extended to more complicated readouts and connectivity distributions relevant to multiple brain circuits.

                Background: Childhood maltreatment exposure (CME) can lead to adverse long term consequences for the exposed individual. Emerging evidence suggests that the long term effect of CME may be transmitted across generations, starting already during prenatal development. Methods: In this study, we measured brain grey and white matter volumes from MR images in 62 healthy neonates at 2 to 5 weeks of gestation corrected age and obtained Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) questionnaire data from both parents. Results: We found that paternal CME associated positively with neonate supratentorial grey matter volumes while the association for the maternal TADS scores was not statistically significant. Maternal prepregnancy BMI associated with supratentorial white matter volumes, but not with parental CME. Conclusions: We are the first to report that paternal CME is linked with variation in newborn grey matter volume. Our results imply an intergenerational transmission of paternal CME to offspring. Elucidating the later relevance of these associations and mechanisms involved remains an enticing avenue for future studies.

                Fluorescence imaging is widely used for the mesoscopic mapping of neuronal connectivity. However, neurite reconstruction is challenging, especially when neurons are densely labelled. Here we report a strategy for the fully automated reconstruction of densely labelled neuronal circuits. Firstly, we established stochastic super-multicolour labelling with up to seven different fluorescent proteins using the Tetbow method. With this method, each neuron was labelled with a unique combination of fluorescent proteins, which were then imaged and separated by linear unmixing. We also established an automated neurite reconstruction pipeline based on the quantitative analysis of multiple dyes (QDyeFinder). To classify colour combinations, we used a newly developed unsupervised clustering algorithm, dCrawler, in which data points in multi-dimensional space were clustered based on a given threshold distance. Our new strategy allows for the reconstruction of neurites for up to hundreds of neurons at a millimetre scale without manual tracing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding</a></h4>

              
                Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Synapses at the pillar IHC-side activate at lower voltages than those of the modiolar side, which show larger active zones and Ca2+-channel clusters. At the postsynapse, SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds and operating ranges. While it is tempting to speculate about a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity, direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we bridged this gap by ex-vivo paired recordings of IHCs and postsynaptic boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in-vivo SGN-characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate (SR) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage-thresholds, shorter response latencies and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs can account for functional response diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SGN.

                This study investigates the interrelationship between primary dendrite selection of Purkinje cells and migration of their pre-synaptic partner granule cells during cerebellar development. During development of the cerebellar cortex, each Purkinje cell grows more than three dendritic trees, from which a primary tree is selected to develop further, whereas the others completely retract. Experimental studies suggest that this selection process is coordinated by physical and synaptic interactions with granule cells. However, technical limitations hinder a continuous experimental observation of multiple populations. To reveal the mechanism underlying this selection process, we constructed a computational model of dendritic developments and granule cell migrations, using a new computational framework, NeuroDevSim. Comparisons of the resulting morphologies from the model demonstrate the roles of the selection stage in regulating the growth of the selected primary trees. The study presents the first computational model that simultaneously simulates growing Purkinje cells and the dynamics of granule cell migrations, revealing the role of physical and synaptic interactions upon dendritic selection. The model provides new insights about the distinct planar morphology of Purkinje cell dendrites and about roles of the dendritic selection process during the cerebellar development. The model also supports the hypothesis that synaptic interactions by granule cells are likely to be involved in the selection procedure.

	<p>Female-specific risk factors for stroke have gradually received attention. The relationship between ischemic stroke and adenomyosis, a benign uterine disorder commonly present in parous women, is underrecognized. We aimed to provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical characteristics, diagnostic considerations, and potential therapeutic strategies of adenomyosis-associated ischemic stroke. We shared our experience with the diagnosis and management of a patient, and summarized current findings and knowledge gaps of this disease based on previous literature. The relevant studies were searched in English and Chinese databases up to April 2022 using the keywords &amp;amp;ldquo;ischemic stroke&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;cerebral infarction&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;adenomyosis&amp;amp;rdquo;. Then, we provided a narrative review of the retrieved articles. Finally, the data of 32 cases were analyzed. We found that increased levels of carbohydrate antigen 125 and D-dimer and decreased level of hemoglobin are biomarkers of adenomyosis-associated ischemic stroke. In addition, hypercoagulability might be a key mechanism leading to thromboembolism in the cerebrovascular system. Additional studies are needed to find optimal prevention strategies for the disease. A better understanding of this &amp;amp;ldquo;rare&amp;amp;rdquo; pathogenesis of ischemic stroke may inform a more precise diagnosis and effective prevention strategy in middle-aged women with embolic stroke of undetermined source.</p>

	<p>This study pursued two goals: (1) to establish range of motion (ROM) demand tiers (i.e., low, moderate, high) specific to the jaw (J), lower lip (LL), posterior tongue (PT), and anterior tongue (AT) for multisyllabic words based on the articulatory performance of neurotypical talkers and (2) to identify demand- and disease-specific articulatory performance characteristics in talkers with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). J, LL, PT, and AT movements of 12 talkers with ALS, 12 talkers with PD, and 12 controls were recorded using electromagnetic articulography. Vertical ROM, average speed, and movement duration were measured. Results showed that in talkers with PD, J and LL ROM were already significantly reduced at the lowest tier whereas PT and AT ROM were only significantly reduced at moderate and high tiers. In talkers with ALS, J ROM was significantly reduced at the moderate tier whereas LL, PT, and AT ROM were only significantly reduced at the highest tier. In both clinical groups, significantly reduced J and LL speeds could already be observed at the lowest tier whereas significantly reduced AT speeds could only be observed at the highest tier. PT speeds were already significantly reduced at the lowest tier in the ALS group but not until the moderate tier in the PD group. Finally, movement duration, but not ROM or speed performance, differentiated between ALS and PD even at the lowest tier. Results suggest that articulatory deficits vary with stimuli-specific motor demands across articulators and clinical groups.</p>

	<p>Purpose: The effect of scinderin (SCIN) on cancer progression has been studied, but its role in glioma remains unknown. This study describes the value of SCIN for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of glioma. Methods: The expression of SCIN was analyzed using the GEPIA, Oncomine, cBioPortal, and CGGA databases. GO/KEGG enrichment analysis of similar genes to SCIN were performed using the R software package, and the protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction (PPI) network was analyzed by the STRING and GeneMANIA databases. The correlations of mRNA expression between SCIN and MMP2/9 were analyzed by TCGA glioma. Simultaneously, the TISIDB and TIMER databases were used to analyze the correlation between SCIN and immune infiltration. Finally, SCIN and MMP2/9 protein expression among different grades of glioma was performed and the results were obtained via immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays. We used the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model to assess the impact of SCIN and MMP2/9 on glioma patients&amp;amp;rsquo; survival. The correlations between SCIN and MMP2/9 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays. Results: SCIN was upregulated in glioma patients with a poor prognosis. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed the functional relationship between SCIN and the immune cell activation and regulation. In addition, the expression of SCIN was related to MMP2/9 in glioma. The correlation analysis showed that SCIN expression was associated with tumor purity and immune infiltration. SCIN and MMP2/9 are negative prognostic factors resulting in worsening glioma patients&amp;amp;rsquo; survival. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrated that SCIN expression was associated with MMP2/9, immune infiltration, and a poor prognosis in glioma. SCIN may serve as a potential prognostic marker and an immune therapy target for glioma.</p>

	<p>Several studies have revealed defects in autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). SQSTM1/p62 plays a key role in the autophagic machinery and may serve as a marker for autophagic flux in vivo. We investigated the role of p62 in neurodegeneration, analyzing its concentrations in the CSF of AD and FTD patients. We recruited 76 participants: 22 patients with AD, 28 patients with FTD, and 26 controls. CSF p62 concentrations were significantly increased in AD and FTD patients when compared to controls, which persisted after adjusting for age (p = 0.01 and p = 0.008, respectively). In female FTD patients, p62 positively correlated with the neurodegenerative biomarkers t-Tau and p-Tau. A significant correlation between CSF p62 concentrations and several clinical features of AD was found. Our data show that p62 is increased in CSF of AD and FTD patients, suggesting a key role of autophagy in these two disorders. The levels of p62 in CSF may reflect an altered autophagic flux, and p62 could represent a potential biomarker of neurodegeneration.</p>

	<p>Multi-site resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data can facilitate learning-based approaches to train reliable models on more data. However, significant data heterogeneity between imaging sites, caused by different scanners or protocols, can negatively impact the generalization ability of learned models. In addition, previous studies have shown that graph convolution neural networks (GCNs) are effective in mining fMRI biomarkers. However, they generally ignore the potentially different contributions of brain regions- of-interest (ROIs) to automated disease diagnosis/prognosis. In this work, we propose a multi-site rs-fMRI adaptation framework with attention GCN (A2GCN) for brain disorder identification. Specifically, the proposed A2GCN consists of three major components: (1) a node representation learning module based on GCN to extract rs-fMRI features from functional connectivity networks, (2) a node attention mechanism module to capture the contributions of ROIs, and (3) a domain adaptation module to alleviate the differences in data distribution between sites through the constraint of mean absolute error and covariance. The A2GCN not only reduces data heterogeneity across sites, but also improves the interpretability of the learning algorithm by exploring important ROIs. Experimental results on the public ABIDE database demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance in fMRI-based recognition of autism spectrum disorders.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disease, characterized by the progressive degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord. Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear, evidence concerning the role of the clonotypic immune system is growing. Adaptive immunity cells often appear changed in number, or in terms of their activation profiles, both peripherally and centrally; however, their role in ALS appears conflictive. Data from human and animal model studies, which are currently reported in the literature, show that each subset of lymphocytes and their mediators may mediate a protective or toxic mechanism in ALS, affecting both its progression and risk of death. In the present review, an attempt is made to shed light on the actual role of cellular clonotypic immunity in ALS by integrating recent clinical studies and experimental observations.</p>

	<p>Our ability to perform voluntary actions and make choices is shaped by the motivation from having control over the resulting effects (agency) and positive outcomes (reward). We offer an overview of distinct and common behavioral and neural signatures of agency and reward. We discuss their typical and atypical developmental trajectories, focusing on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by neurodiverse processes underlying action selection. We propose that reduced sensitivity to agency and reward in ASD may be related to atypical multisensory processes and motor planning, with potential for understanding restricted and repetitive behaviors. We emphasize the limitations of the existing literature, and prospects for future research. Understanding the neurocognitive processes that shape the way people with ASD select actions and perceive outcomes is essential to support not only learning, but also volition and self-determination.</p>

     alt="Comparative analysis of astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex of primates: Insights into the evolution of human brain energetics"/>
<p>We quantified astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein in human and nonhuman primates. We report that astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells in layer I of Brodmann.s area 9 increased significantly with brain size enlargement and was greatest in humans. Roman numerals denote cortical layer. Scale bars = 25 µm.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are the main homeostatic cell of the brain involved in many processes related to cognition, immune response, and energy expenditure. It has been suggested that the distribution of astrocytes is associated with brain size, and that they are specialized in humans. To evaluate these, we quantified astrocyte density, soma volume, and total glia density in layer I and white matter in Brodmann's area 9 of humans, chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques. We found that layer I astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells were highest in humans and increased with brain size. Overall glia density in layer I and white matter were relatively invariant across brain sizes, potentially due to their important metabolic functions on a per volume basis. We also quantified two transporters involved in metabolism through the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). We expected these transporters would be increased in human brains due to their high rate of metabolic consumption and associated gene activity. While humans have higher EAAT2 cell density, GLUT1 vessel volume, and GLUT1 area fraction compared to baboons and chimpanzees, they did not differ from macaques. Therefore, EAAT2 and GLUT1 are not related to increased energetic demands of the human brain. Taken together, these data provide evidence that astrocytes play a unique role in both brain expansion and evolution among primates, with an emphasis on layer I astrocytes having a potentially significant role in human-specific metabolic processing and cognition.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Madeira cockroach <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i> is a nocturnal insect and a prominent model organism for the study of circadian rhythms. Its master circadian clock, controlling circadian locomotor activity and sleep–wake cycles, is located in the accessory medulla of the optic lobe. For a better understanding of brain regions controlled by the circadian clock and brain organization of this insect in general, we created a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of all neuropils of the cerebral ganglia based on anti-synapsin and anti-γ-aminobutyric acid immunolabeling of whole mount brains. Forty-nine major neuropils were identified and three-dimensionally reconstructed. Single-cell dye fills complement the data and provide evidence for distinct subdivisions of certain brain areas. Most neuropils defined in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> could be distinguished in the cockroach as well. However, some neuropils identified in the fruit fly do not exist as distinct entities in the cockroach while others are lacking in the fruit fly. In addition to neuropils, major fiber systems, tracts, and commissures were reconstructed and served as important landmarks separating brain areas. Being a nocturnal insect, <i>R. maderae</i> is an important new species to the growing collection of 3D insect brain atlases and only the second hemimetabolous insect, for which a detailed 3D brain atlas is available. This atlas will be highly valuable for an evolutionary comparison of insect brain organization and will greatly facilitate addressing brain areas that are supervised by the circadian clock.</p>

<p>Development of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins in the PGN of the cat.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic reticular nucleus receives axons from the thalamic sensory nuclei and the cerebral cortex. The visual part of this nucleus in carnivores is the perigeniculate nucleus located dorsal to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The perigeniculate nucleus participates in the modulation of visual processing and in the transition of synchronized slow rhythmicity during sleep into desynchronized high-frequency activity during arousal and consists of inhibitory neurons. The main neurochemical markers for perigeniculate neurons are glutamic acid decarboxylase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein parvalbumin. Previous studies of postnatal development focused on the morphological features of the perigeniculate nucleus; however, its neurochemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the postnatal development of perigeniculate neurons using immunohistochemical labeling of parvalbumin, two related Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (calretinin and calbindin), glutamic acid decarboxylase, and a common neuronal protein, NeuN, in kittens that were 0–123 days old and in adult cats. In parallel with the well-known dominant neuronal populations expressing parvalbumin and GAD67 and persisting until adulthood, transient populations expressing calretinin and calbindin were observed. The calbindin-positive neurons were similar to the main perigeniculate population and showed close morphological features and parvalbumin coexpression. In contrast, the calretinin-positive neurons differed in their morphological characteristics and did not express GAD67, thus distinguishing them from the majority of perigeniculate neurons. A possible link between these populations was revealed, and the development of thalamocortical processing is discussed.</p>

<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) neurons in the parabrachial region are a subset of <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing neurons that do not express <i>Pdyn</i>, <i>Calca</i>, or <i>Cck</i>.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) increases wakefulness. A small number of neurons in the brainstem express <i>Nps</i>. These neurons are located in or near the parabrachial nucleus (PB), but we know very little about their ontogeny, connectivity, and function. To identify <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons within the molecular framework of the PB region, we used in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and Cre-reporter labeling in mice. The primary concentration of <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons borders the lateral lemniscus at far-rostral levels of the lateral PB. Caudal to this main cluster, <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons scatter through the PB and form a secondary concentration medial to the locus coeruleus (LC). Most <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons in the PB region are <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing, and mutually exclusive with neurons expressing <i>Calca</i> or <i>Lmx1b</i>. Among <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing PB neurons, those expressing <i>Nps</i> are distinct from intermingled subsets expressing <i>Cck</i> or <i>Pdyn</i>. Examining <i>Nps</i> Cre-reporter expression throughout the brain identified novel populations of neurons in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. This information will help focus experimental questions about the connectivity and function of NPS neurons.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Quantitative data of biological systems provide valuable baseline information for understanding pathology, experimental perturbations, and computational modeling. In mouse colon, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed by myenteric neurons with multiaxonal (Dogiel type II) morphology, characteristic of intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs). Analogous neurons in other species and gut regions represent 5–35% of myenteric neurons. We aimed to quantify proportions of CGRP-immunopositive (CGRP+) myenteric neurons. Colchicine-treated wholemount preparations of proximal, mid, and distal colon were labeled for HuC/D, CGRP, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and peripherin (Per). The pan-neuronal markers (Hu+/Per+) co-labeled 94% of neurons. Hu+/Per– neurons comprised ∼6%, but Hu-/Per+ cells were rare. Thus, quantification was based on Hu+ myenteric neurons (8576 total; 1225 ± 239 per animal, <i>n</i> = 7). CGRP+ cell bodies were significantly larger than the average of all Hu+ neurons (329 ± 13 vs. 261 ± 12 μm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> &lt; .0001). CGRP+ neurons comprised 19% ± 3% of myenteric neurons without significant regional variation. NOS+ neurons comprised 42% ± 2% of myenteric neurons overall, representing a lower proportion in proximal colon, compared to mid and distal colon (38% ± 2%, 44% ± 2%, and 44% ± 3%, respectively). Peripherin immunolabeling revealed cell body and axonal morphology in some myenteric neurons. Whether all CGRP+ neurons were multiaxonal could not be addressed using peripherin immunolabeling. However, of 118 putatively multiaxonal neurons first identified based on peripherin immunoreactivity, all were CGRP+ (<i>n</i> = 4). In conclusion, CGRP+ myenteric neurons in mouse colon were comprehensively quantified, occurring within a range expected of a putative IPAN marker. All Per+ multiaxonal neurons, characteristic of Dogiel type II/IPAN morphology, were CGRP+.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic differentiation of presynaptic neurotransmitter-releasing machinery in the auditory brainstem during the prehearing period and its selective deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice"/>
<p>We identified protein-specific and age-dependent tonotopic distributions of five key presynaptic proteins in the developing auditory brainstem and their selective alterations in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. The tonotopic maturation of the presynaptic machinery may provide a potential mechanism for tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development of auditory circuits.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tonotopic organization is a fundamental feature of the auditory system. In the developing auditory brainstem, the ontogeny and maturation of neurotransmission progress from high to low frequencies along the tonotopic axis. To explore the underlying mechanism of this tonotopic development, we aim to determine whether the presynaptic machinery responsible for neurotransmitter release is tonotopically differentiated during development. In the current study, we examined vesicular neurotransmitter transporters and calcium sensors, two central players responsible for loading neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles and for triggering neurotransmitter release in a calcium-dependent manner, respectively. Using immunocytochemistry, we characterized the distribution patterns of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1 and 2, vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT), and calcium sensor synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and 2 in the developing mouse medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We identified tonotopic gradients of VGLUT1, VGAT, Syt1, and Syt2 in the first postnatal week, with higher protein densities in the more medial (high-frequency) portion of the MNTB. These gradients gradually flattened before the onset of hearing. In contrast, VGLUT2 was distributed relatively uniformly along the tonotopic axis during this prehearing period. In mice lacking Fragile X mental retardation protein, an mRNA-binding protein that regulates synaptic development and plasticity, progress to achieve the mature-like organization was altered for VGLUT1, Syt1, and Syt2, but not for VGAT. Together, our results identified novel organization patterns of selective presynaptic proteins in immature auditory synapses, providing a potential mechanism that may contribute to tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development.</p>

<p>Using extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging genetically targeted to different layer 5 cell classes, we characterize the spatial frequency (SF), temporal frequency (TF), and speed tuning of deep (layer 5/6) cortical neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual cortical areas anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM). We find that deep-layer neurons, like superficial layer neurons, are functionally specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies in different visual areas. However, we also found a larger range of preferred SFs and TFs than previously reported in superficial cortical layers. We also find that direction tuning is much more prominent for layer 5 extratelencephalically than layer 5 intratelencephalically projecting neurons in multiple visual areas.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mouse visual system consists of several visual cortical areas thought to be specialized for different visual features and/or tasks. Previous studies have revealed differences between primary visual cortex (V1) and other higher visual areas, namely, anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM), and their tuning preferences for spatial and temporal frequency. However, these differences have primarily been characterized using methods that are biased toward superficial layers of cortex, such as two-photon calcium imaging. Fewer studies have investigated cell types in deeper layers of these areas and their tuning preferences. Because superficial versus deep-layer neurons and different types of deep-layer neurons are known to have different feedforward and feedback inputs and outputs, comparing the tuning preferences of these groups is important for understanding cortical visual information processing. In this study, we used extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging targeted toward two different layer 5 cell classes to characterize their tuning properties in V1, AL, and PM. We find that deep-layer neurons, similar to superficial layer neurons, are also specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies, with the strongest differences between AL and V1, and AL and PM, but not V1 and PM. However, we note that the deep-layer neuron populations preferred a larger range of SFs and TFs compared to previous studies. We also find that extratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons are more direction selective than intratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons.</p>

     alt="Quantitative spatial analysis reveals that the local axons of lamina I projection neurons and interneurons exhibit distributions that predict distinct roles in spinal sensory processing"/>
<p>Quantitative analyses of spinal lamina I projection neurons (PNs) and interneurons (INs) revealed almost identical dendritic patterns but local axon collateral distribution patterns that are distinct. INs mostly establish connections within the superficial dorsal horn and may bridge its medial and lateral halves. PNs also relay their input locally, to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter and may link other ascending systems and participate directly in the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Our knowledge about the detailed wiring of neuronal circuits in the spinal dorsal horn (DH), where initial sensory processing takes place, is still very sparse. While a substantial amount of data is available on the somatodendritic morphology of DH neurons, the laminar and segmental distribution patterns and consequential function of individual axons are much less characterized. In the present study, we fully reconstructed the axonal and dendritic processes of 10 projection neurons (PNs) and 15 interneurons (INs) in lamina I of the rat, to reveal quantitative differences in their distribution. We also performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to test the predicted function of certain axon collaterals. In line with our earlier qualitative description, we found that lamina I INs in the lateral aspect of the superficial DH send axon collaterals toward the medial part and occupy mostly laminae I–III, providing anatomical basis for a lateromedial flow of information within the DH. Local axon collaterals of PNs were more extensively distributed including dorsal commissural axon collaterals that might refer to those reported earlier linking the lateral aspect of the left and right DHs. PN collaterals dominated the dorsolateral funiculus and laminae IV–VI, suggesting propriospinal and ventral connections. Indeed, patch-clamp recordings confirmed the existence of a dorsoventral excitatory drive upon activation of neurokinin-1 receptors that, although being expressed in various lamina I neurons, are specifically enriched in PNs. In summary, lamina I PNs and INs have almost identical dendritic input fields, while their segmental axon collateral distribution patterns are distinct. INs, whose somata reside in lamina I, establish local connections, may show asymmetry, and contribute to bridging the medial and lateral halves of the DH. PNs, on the other hand, preferably relay their integrated dendritic input to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter where it might be linked to other ascending pathways or the premotor network, resulting in a putative direct contribution to the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">HDAC6 Inhibition Reverses Cisplatin-Induced Mechanical Hypersensitivity via Tonic Delta Opioid Receptor Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral neuropathic pain induced by the chemotherapeutic cisplatin can persist for months to years after treatment. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors have therapeutic potential for cisplatin-induced neuropathic pain since they persistently reverse mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain in rodent models. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity in male and female mice by a 2 week treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor, administered 3 d after the last dose of cisplatin. Mechanical hypersensitivity in animals of both sexes treated with the HDAC6 inhibitor was temporarily reinstated by a single injection of the neutral opioid receptor antagonist 6&beta;-naltrexol or the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist naloxone methiodide. These results suggest that tonic peripheral opioid ligand-receptor signaling mediates reversal of cisplatin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity after treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor. Pointing to a specific role for  opioid receptors (DORs), <I>Oprd1</I> expression was decreased in DRG neurons following cisplatin administration, but normalized after treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor. Mechanical hypersensitivity was temporarily reinstated in both sexes by a single injection of the DOR antagonist naltrindole. Consistently, HDAC6 inhibition failed to reverse cisplatin-induced hypersensitivity when DORs were genetically deleted from advillin<sup>+</sup> neurons. Mechanical hypersensitivity was also temporarily reinstated in both sexes by a single injection of a neutralizing antibody against the DOR ligand met-enkephalin. In conclusion, we reveal that treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor induces tonic enkephalin-DOR signaling in peripheral sensory neurons to suppress mechanical hypersensitivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over one-fourth of cancer survivors suffer from intractable painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which can last for months to years after treatment ends. HDAC6 inhibition is a novel strategy to reverse CIPN without negatively interfering with tumor growth, but the mechanisms responsible for persistent reversal are not well understood. We built on evidence that the endogenous opioid system contributes to the spontaneous, apparent resolution of pain caused by nerve damage or inflammation, referred to as latent sensitization. We show that blocking the  opioid receptor or its ligand enkephalin unmasks CIPN in mice treated with an HDAC6 inhibitor (latent sensitization). Our work provides insight into the mechanisms by which treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor apparently reverses CIPN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Gap-Junction Mutation Reveals That Outer Hair Cell Extracellular Receptor Potentials Drive High-Frequency Cochlear Amplification</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cochlear amplification enables the enormous dynamic range of hearing through amplifying cochlear responses to low- to moderate-level sounds and compressing them to loud sounds. Amplification is attributed to voltage-dependent electromotility of mechanosensory outer hair cells (OHCs) driven by changing voltages developed across their cell membranes. At low frequencies, these voltage changes are dominated by intracellular receptor potentials (RPs). However, OHC membranes have electrical low-pass filter properties that attenuate high-frequency RPs, which should potentially attenuate amplification of high-frequency cochlear responses and impede high-frequency hearing. We made <I>in vivo</I> intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological measurements from the organ of Corti of male and female mice of the CBA/J strain, with excellent high-frequency hearing, and from the CD-1 mouse strain, which has sensitive hearing below 12 kHz but loses high-frequency hearing within a few weeks postpartum. The CD-1 mouse strain was transfected with an A88V mutation of the connexin 30 gap-junction protein. By blocking the action of the GJ protein to reduce input resistance, the mutation increased the OHC extracellular RP (ERP) magnitude and rescued high-frequency hearing. However, by increasing the organ of Corti resistance, the mutation rescued high-frequency hearing through preserving the OHC extracellular RP (ERP) magnitude. We measured the voltage developed across the basolateral membranes of OHCs, which controls their electromotility, for low- to high-frequency sounds in male and female mice of the CD-1 strain that expressed the A88V mutation. We demonstrate that ERPs, not RPs, drive OHC motility and cochlear amplification at high frequencies because at high frequencies, ERPs are not frequency attenuated, exceed RPs in magnitude, and are appropriately timed to provide cochlear amplification.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cochlear amplification, which enables the enormous dynamic range of hearing, is attributed to voltage-dependent electromotility of the mechanosensory outer hair cells (OHCs) driven by sound-induced voltage changes across their membranes. OHC intracellular receptor potentials are electrically low-pass filtered, which should hinder high-frequency hearing. We measured the intracellular and extracellular voltages that control OHC electromotility <I>in vivo</I> in a mouse strain with impaired high-frequency hearing. A gap-junction mutation of the strain rescued high-frequency hearing, increased organ of Corti resistance, and preserved large OHC extracellular receptor potentials but reduced OHC intracellular receptor potentials and impaired low-frequency hearing. We concluded intracellular potentials drive OHC motility at low frequencies and extracellular receptor potentials drive OHC motility and cochlear amplification at high frequencies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatotopy of Mouse Spinothalamic Innervation and the Localization of a Noxious Stimulus Requires Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma Expression by Phox2a Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anterolateral system (AS) neurons transmit pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain. Their morphology, anatomy, and physiological properties have been extensively characterized and suggest that specific AS neurons and their brain targets are concerned with the discriminatory aspects of noxious stimuli, such as their location or intensity, and their motivational/emotive dimension. Among the recently unraveled molecular markers of AS neurons is the developmentally expressed transcription factor Phox2a, providing us with the opportunity to selectively disrupt the embryonic wiring of AS neurons to gain insights into the logic of their adult function. As mice with a spinal-cord-specific loss of the netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) have increased AS neuron innervation of ipsilateral brain targets and defective noxious stimulus localization or topognosis, we generated mice of either sex carrying a deletion of <I>Dcc</I> in Phox2a neurons. Such <I>Dcc<sup>Phox2a</sup></I> mice displayed impaired topognosis along the rostrocaudal axis but with little effect on left-right discrimination and normal aversive responses. Anatomical tracing experiments in <I>Dcc<sup>Phox2a</sup></I> mice revealed defective targeting of cervical and lumbar AS axons within the thalamus. Furthermore, genetic labeling of AS axons revealed their expression of DCC on their arrival in the brain, at a time when many of their target neurons are being born and express <I>Ntn1</I>. Our experiments suggest a postcommissural crossing function for netrin-1:DCC signaling during the formation of somatotopically ordered maps and are consistent with a discriminatory function of some of the Phox2a AS neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How nociceptive (pain) signals are relayed from the body to the brain remains an important question relevant to our understanding of the basic physiology of pain perception. Previous studies have demonstrated that the AS is a main effector of this function. It is composed of AS neurons located in the spinal cord that receive signals from nociceptive sensory neurons that detect noxious stimuli. In this study, we generate a genetic miswiring of mouse AS neurons that results in a decreased ability to perceive the location of a painful stimulus. The precise nature of this defect sheds light on the function of different kinds of AS neurons and how pain information may be organized.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activity-Induced Cortical Glutamatergic Neuron Nascent Proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal activity initiates signaling cascades that culminate in diverse outcomes including structural and functional neuronal plasticity, and metabolic changes. While studies have revealed activity-dependent neuronal cell type-specific transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative analysis of cell-specific activity-induced dynamics in newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) synthesis <I>in vivo</I> has been complicated by cellular heterogeneity and a relatively low abundance of NSPs within the proteome in the brain. Here we combined targeted expression of mutant MetRS (methionine tRNA synthetase) in genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons with tight temporal control of treatment with the noncanonical amino acid, azidonorleucine, to biotinylate NSPs within a short period after pharmacologically induced seizure in male and female mice. By purifying peptides tagged with heavy or light biotin-alkynes and using direct tandem mass spectrometry detection of biotinylated peptides, we quantified activity-induced changes in cortical glutamatergic neuron NSPs. Seizure triggered significant changes in ~300 NSPs, 33% of which were decreased by seizure. Proteins mediating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity, including SynGAP1, Pak3, GEPH1, Copine-6, and collybistin, and DNA and chromatin remodeling proteins, including Rad21, Smarca2, and Ddb1, are differentially synthesized in response to activity. Proteins likely to play homeostatic roles in response to activity, such as regulators of proteastasis, intracellular ion control, and cytoskeleton remodeling proteins, are activity induced. Conversely, seizure decreased newly synthetized NCAM, among others, suggesting that seizure induced degradation. Overall, we identified quantitative changes in the activity-induced nascent proteome from genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons as a strategy to discover downstream mediators of neuronal plasticity and generate hypotheses regarding their function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity-induced neuronal and synaptic plasticity are mediated by changes in the protein landscape, including changes in the activity-induced newly synthesized proteins; however, identifying neuronal cell type-specific nascent proteome dynamics in the intact brain has been technically challenging. We conducted an unbiased proteomic screen from which we identified significant activity-induced changes in ~300 newly synthesized proteins in genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons within 20 h after pharmacologically induced seizure. Bioinformatic analysis of the dynamic nascent proteome indicates that the newly synthesized proteins play diverse roles in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity, chromatin remodeling, homeostatic mechanisms, and proteasomal and metabolic functions, extending our understanding of the diversity of plasticity mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Deprivation Selectively Reduces Thalamic Reticular Nucleus-Mediated Inhibition of the Auditory Thalamus in Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory loss leads to widespread cross-modal plasticity across brain areas to allow the remaining senses to guide behavior. While multimodal sensory interactions are often attributed to higher-order sensory areas, cross-modal plasticity has been observed at the level of synaptic changes even across primary sensory cortices. In particular, vision loss leads to widespread circuit adaptation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) even in adults. Here we report using mice of both sexes in which cross-modal plasticity occurs even earlier in the sensory-processing pathway at the level of the thalamus in a modality-selective manner. A week of visual deprivation reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) to the primary auditory thalamus (MGBv) without changes to the primary visual thalamus (dLGN). The plasticity of TRN inhibition to MGBv was observed as a reduction in postsynaptic gain and short-term depression. There was no observable plasticity of the cortical feedback excitatory synaptic transmission from the primary visual cortex to dLGN or TRN and A1 to MGBv, which suggests that the visual deprivation-induced plasticity occurs predominantly at the level of thalamic inhibition. We provide evidence that visual deprivation-induced change in the short-term depression of TRN inhibition to MGBv involves endocannabinoid CB1 receptors. TRN inhibition is considered critical for sensory gating, selective attention, and multimodal performances; hence, its plasticity has implications for sensory processing. Our results suggest that selective disinhibition and altered short-term dynamics of TRN inhibition in the spared thalamic nucleus support cross-modal plasticity in the adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Losing vision triggers adaptation of the brain to enhance the processing of the remaining senses, which can be observed as better auditory performance in blind subjects. We previously found that depriving vision of adult rodents produces widespread circuit reorganization in the primary auditory cortex and enhances auditory processing at a neural level. Here we report that visual deprivation-induced plasticity in adults occurs much earlier in the auditory pathway, at the level of thalamic inhibition. Sensory processing is largely gated at the level of the thalamus via strong cortical feedback inhibition mediated through the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). We found that TRN inhibition of the auditory thalamus is selectively reduced by visual deprivation, thus playing a role in adult cross-modal plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Ripples during NREM Sleep and Waking in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal ripples index the reconstruction of spatiotemporal neuronal firing patterns essential for the consolidation of memories in the cortex during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Recently, cortical ripples in humans have been shown to enfold the replay of neuron firing patterns during cued recall. Here, using intracranial recordings from 18 patients (12 female), we show that cortical ripples also occur during NREM in humans, with similar density, oscillation frequency (~90 Hz), duration, and amplitude to waking. Ripples occurred in all cortical regions with similar characteristics, unrelated to putative hippocampal connectivity, and were less dense and robust in higher association areas. Putative pyramidal and interneuron spiking phase-locked to cortical ripples during NREM, with phase delays consistent with ripple generation through pyramidal&ndash;interneuron feedback. Cortical ripples were smaller in amplitude than hippocampal ripples but were similar in density, frequency, and duration. Cortical ripples during NREM typically occurred just before the upstate peak, often during spindles. Upstates and spindles have previously been associated with memory consolidation, and we found that cortical ripples grouped cofiring between units within the window of spike timing-dependent plasticity. Thus, human NREM cortical ripples are as follows: ubiquitous and stereotyped with a tightly focused oscillation frequency; similar to hippocampal ripples; associated with upstates and spindles; and associated with unit cofiring. These properties are consistent with cortical ripples possibly contributing to memory consolidation and other functions during NREM in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In rodents, hippocampal ripples organize replay during sleep to promote memory consolidation in the cortex, where ripples also occur. However, evidence for cortical ripples in human sleep is limited, and their anatomic distribution and physiological properties are unexplored. Here, using human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that ripples occur throughout the cortex during waking and sleep with highly stereotyped characteristics. During sleep, cortical ripples tend to occur during spindles on the down-to-upstate transition, and thus participate in a sequence of sleep waves that is important for consolidation. Furthermore, cortical ripples organize single-unit spiking with timing optimal to facilitate plasticity. Therefore, cortical ripples in humans possess essential physiological properties to support memory and other cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retrosplenial and Hippocampal Synchrony during Retrieval of Old Memories in Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memory for events from the distant past relies on multiple brain regions, but little is known about the underlying neural dynamics that give rise to such abilities. We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex of two female rhesus macaques as they visually selected targets in year-old and newly acquired object-scene associations. Whereas hippocampal activity was unchanging with memory age, the retrosplenial cortex responded with greater magnitude alpha oscillations (10&ndash;15 Hz) and greater phase locking to memory-guided eye movements during retrieval of old events. A similar old-memory enhancement was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex but in a beta2/gamma band (28&ndash;35 Hz). In contrast, remote retrieval was associated with decreased gamma-band synchrony between the hippocampus and each neocortical area. The increasing retrosplenial alpha oscillation and decreasing hippocampocortical synchrony with memory age may signify a shift in frank memory allocation or, alternatively, changes in selection among distributed memory representations in the primate brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memory depends on multiple brain regions, whose involvement is thought to change with time. Here, we recorded neuronal population activity from the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex as nonhuman primates searched for objects embedded in scenes. These memoranda were either newly presented or a year old. Remembering old material drove stronger oscillations in the retrosplenial cortex and led to a greater locking of neural activity to search movements. Remembering new material revealed stronger oscillatory synchrony between the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. These results suggest that with age, memories may come to rely more exclusively on neocortical oscillations for retrieval and search guidance and less on long-range coupling with the hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structure-Function Dissociations of Human Hippocampal Subfield Stiffness and Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging and neurodegenerative diseases lead to decline in thinking and memory ability. The subfields of the hippocampus (HCsf) play important roles in memory formation and recall. Imaging techniques sensitive to the underlying HCsf tissue microstructure can reveal unique structure&ndash;function associations and their vulnerability in aging and disease. The goal of this study was to use magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), a noninvasive MR imaging-based technique that can quantitatively image the viscoelastic mechanical properties of tissue to determine the associations of HCsf stiffness with different cognitive domains across the lifespan. Eighty-eight adult participants completed the study (age 23&ndash;81 years, male/female 36/51), in which we aimed to determine which HCsf regions most strongly correlated with different memory performance outcomes and if viscoelasticity of specific HCsf regions mediated the relationship between age and performance. Our results revealed that both interference cost on a verbal memory task and relational memory task performance were significantly related to cornu ammonis 1&ndash;2 (CA1&ndash;CA2) stiffness (<I>p</I> = 0.018 and <I>p</I> = 0.011, respectively), with CA1&ndash;CA2 stiffness significantly mediating the relationship between age and interference cost performance (<I>p</I> = 0.031). There were also significant associations between delayed free verbal recall performance and stiffness of both the dentate gyrus&ndash;cornu ammonis 3 (DG&ndash;CA3; <I>p</I> = 0.016) and subiculum (SUB; <I>p</I> = 0.032) regions. This further exemplifies the functional specialization of HCsf in declarative memory and the potential use of MRE measures as clinical biomarkers in assessing brain health in aging and disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal subfields are cytoarchitecturally unique structures involved in distinct aspects of memory processing. Magnetic resonance elastography is a technique that can noninvasively image tissue viscoelastic mechanical properties, potentially serving as sensitive biomarkers of aging and neurodegeneration related to functional outcomes. High-resolution <I>in vivo</I> imaging has invigorated interest in determining subfield functional specialization and their differential vulnerability in aging and disease. Applying MRE to probe subfield-specific cognitive correlates will indicate that measures of subfield stiffness can determine the integrity of structures supporting specific domains of memory performance. These findings will further validate our high-resolution MRE method and support the potential use of subfield stiffness measures as clinical biomarkers in classifying aging and disease states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">History of Previous Midlife Estradiol Treatment Permanently Alters Interactions of Brain Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Signaling and Hippocampal Estrogen Synthesis to Enhance Cognitive Aging in a Rat Model of Menopause</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across species, including humans, elevated levels of brain estrogen receptor (ER) &alpha; are associated with enhanced cognitive aging, even in the absence of circulating estrogens. In rodents, short-term estrogen treatment, such as that commonly used in the menopausal transition, results in long-term increases in ER&alpha; levels in the hippocampus, leading to enhanced memory long after termination of estrogen treatment. However, mechanisms by which increased levels of brain ER&alpha; enhances cognitive aging remain unclear. Here we demonstrate in aging female rats that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which can activate ER via ligand-independent mechanisms, requires concomitant synthesis of brain-derived neuroestrogens to phosphorylate ER&alpha; via MAPK signaling, ultimately resulting in enhanced memory. In a rat model of menopause involving long-term ovarian hormone deprivation, hippocampal neuroestrogen activity decreases, altering IGF-1 activity and resulting in impaired memory. However, this process is reversed by short-term estradiol treatment. Forty days of estradiol exposure following ovariectomy results in maintenance of neuroestrogen levels that persist beyond the period of hormone treatment, allowing for continued interactions between IGF-1 and neuroestrogen signaling, elevated levels of hippocampal ER&alpha;, and ultimately enhanced memory. Collectively, results demonstrate that short-term estradiol use following loss of ovarian function has long-lasting effects on hippocampal function and memory by dynamically regulating cellular mechanisms that promote activity of ER&alpha; in the absence of circulating estrogens. Translational impacts of these findings suggest lasting cognitive benefits of short-term estrogen use near menopause and highlight the importance of hippocampal ER&alpha;, independent from the role of circulating estrogens, in regulating memory in aging females.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Declines in ovarian hormones following menopause coincide with increased risk of cognitive decline. Because of potential health risks, current recommendations are that menopausal estrogen therapy be limited to a few years. Long-term consequences for the brain and memory of this short-term midlife estrogen therapy are unclear. Here, in a rodent model of menopause, we determined mechanisms by which short-term midlife estrogen exposure can enhance hippocampal function and memory with cognitive benefits and molecular changes enduring long after termination of estrogen exposure. Our model indicates long-lasting benefits of maintaining hippocampal estrogen receptor function in the absence of ongoing estrogen exposure and suggests potential strategies for combating age-related cognitive decline.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CBP Is Required for Establishing Adaptive Gene Programs in the Adult Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Environmental factors and life experiences impinge on brain circuits triggering adaptive changes. Epigenetic regulators contribute to this neuroadaptation by enhancing or suppressing specific gene programs. The paralogous transcriptional coactivators and lysine acetyltransferases CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300 are involved in brain plasticity and stimulus-dependent transcription, but their specific roles in neuroadaptation are not fully understood. Here we investigated the impact of eliminating either CBP or p300 in excitatory neurons of the adult forebrain of mice from both sexes using inducible and cell type-restricted knock-out strains. The elimination of CBP, but not p300, reduced the expression and chromatin acetylation of plasticity genes, dampened activity-driven transcription, and caused memory deficits. The defects became more prominent in elderly mice and in paradigms that involved enduring changes in transcription, such as kindling and environmental enrichment, in which CBP loss interfered with the establishment of activity-induced transcriptional and epigenetic changes in response to stimulus or experience. These findings further strengthen the link between CBP deficiency in excitatory neurons and etiopathology in the nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How environmental conditions and life experiences impinge on mature brain circuits to elicit adaptive responses that favor the survival of the organism remains an outstanding question in neurosciences. Epigenetic regulators are thought to contribute to neuroadaptation by initiating or enhancing adaptive gene programs. In this article, we examined the role of CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300, two paralogous transcriptional coactivators and histone acetyltransferases involved in cognitive processes and intellectual disability, in neuroadaptation in adult hippocampal circuits. Our experiments demonstrate that CBP, but not its paralog p300, plays a highly specific role in the epigenetic regulation of neuronal plasticity gene programs in response to stimulus and provide unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroadaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Peripheral Auditory Nerve Impairment in a Mouse Model of Syndromic Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dysfunction of the peripheral auditory nerve (AN) contributes to dynamic changes throughout the central auditory system, resulting in abnormal auditory processing, including hypersensitivity. Altered sound sensitivity is frequently observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting that AN deficits and changes in auditory information processing may contribute to ASD-associated symptoms, including social communication deficits and hyperacusis. The MEF2C transcription factor is associated with risk for several neurodevelopmental disorders, and mutations or deletions of <I>MEF2C</I> produce a haploinsufficiency syndrome characterized by ASD, language, and cognitive deficits. A mouse model of this syndromic ASD (<I>Mef2c</I>-Het) recapitulates many of the <I>MEF2C</I> haploinsufficiency syndrome-linked behaviors, including communication deficits. We show here that <I>Mef2c</I>-Het mice of both sexes exhibit functional impairment of the peripheral AN and a modest reduction in hearing sensitivity. We find that MEF2C is expressed during development in multiple AN and cochlear cell types; and in <I>Mef2c</I>-Het mice, we observe multiple cellular and molecular alterations associated with the AN, including abnormal myelination, neuronal degeneration, neuronal mitochondria dysfunction, and increased macrophage activation and cochlear inflammation. These results reveal the importance of MEF2C function in inner ear development and function and the engagement of immune cells and other non-neuronal cells, which suggests that microglia/macrophages and other non-neuronal cells might contribute, directly or indirectly, to AN dysfunction and ASD-related phenotypes. Finally, our study establishes a comprehensive approach for characterizing AN function at the physiological, cellular, and molecular levels in mice, which can be applied to animal models with a wide range of human auditory processing impairments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first report of peripheral auditory nerve (AN) impairment in a mouse model of human <I>MEF2C</I> haploinsufficiency syndrome that has well-characterized ASD-related behaviors, including communication deficits, hyperactivity, repetitive behavior, and social deficits. We identify multiple underlying cellular, subcellular, and molecular abnormalities that may contribute to peripheral AN impairment. Our findings also highlight the important roles of immune cells (e.g., cochlear macrophages) and other non-neuronal elements (e.g., glial cells and cells in the stria vascularis) in auditory impairment in ASD. The methodological significance of the study is the establishment of a comprehensive approach for evaluating peripheral AN function and impact of peripheral AN deficits with minimal hearing loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of Activity-Induced Mitochondrial ATP Production Underlies the Synaptic Defects in a Drosophila Model of ALS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in the gene encoding vesicle-associated membrane protein B (VAPB) cause a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Expression of an ALS-related variant of <I>vapb</I> (<I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>) in <I>Drosophila</I> motor neurons results in morphologic changes at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) characterized by the appearance of fewer, but larger, presynaptic boutons. Although diminished microtubule stability is known to underlie these morphologic changes, a mechanism for the loss of presynaptic microtubules has been lacking. By studying flies of both sexes, we demonstrate the suppression of <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>-induced changes in NMJ morphology by either a loss of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels or the inhibition Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (CaM)-activated kinase II (CaMKII). These data suggest that decreased stability of presynaptic microtubules at <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I> NMJs results from hyperactivation of CaMKII because of elevated cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. We attribute the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyshomeostasis to delayed extrusion of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Suggesting that this defect in Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion arose from an insufficient response to the bioenergetic demand of neural activity, depolarization-induced mitochondrial ATP production was diminished in <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I> neurons. These findings point to bioenergetic dysfunction as a potential cause for the synaptic defects in <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>-expressing motor neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Whether the synchrony between the rates of ATP production and demand is lost in degenerating neurons remains poorly understood. We report that expression of a gene equivalent to an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-causing variant of vesicle-associated membrane protein B (VAPB) in fly neurons decouples mitochondrial ATP production from neuronal activity. Consequently, levels of ATP in mutant neurons are unable to keep up with the bioenergetic burden of neuronal activity. Reduced rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, which could result from insufficient energy to power Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases, results in the accumulation of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mutant neurons and leads to alterations in synaptic vesicle (SV) release and synapse development. These findings suggest that synaptic defects in a model of ALS arise from the loss of activity-induced ATP production.</p>

                Background: Airborne transmission is the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in the air. We carried out a systematic review to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies of the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched LitCovid, MedRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February 2020 to 30 May 2022 and included studies on airborne transmission. Data were dual extracted, and we assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. Results: We included 128 primary studies and 29 reviews on airborne SARS-CoV-2. Of the 128 primary studies, 105 (82%) reported data on RT-PCR from air samples, 28 (22%) report cycle threshold values and 36 (28%) copies per sample volume. All primary studies were observational. The research often lacked standard methods, standard sampling sizes and reporting items. We found 69 descriptions of different air samplers deployed. Of the 80 in-hospital studies that reported binary RT-PCR tests, 362/3079 air samples from 75 studies conducted in hospital ward environments were positive (median 8%, IQR=0 to 23%); 23 studies reported 74/703 RT-PCR positive air samples in the ICU setting (median 17%, IQR=0% to 38%) Thirty-eight studies reported potential air transmission in the outdoors or in the community. Twenty-six studies attempted viral culture, none of which definitively demonstrated that replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 could be recovered in the air. Conclusion:  SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable intermittently in the air in various settings. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on airborne transmission are needed. The lack of recoverable viral culture of SARS-CoV-2 from air samples prevents firm conclusions about the definitive role of airborne transmission in SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hypoxic preconditioning promotes survival of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell via expression of prosurvival and proangiogenic biomarkers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Contributing factors for improved survival of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AMSCs) cultured through hypoxia preconditioning, in example apoptosis inhibition involving BCL2 and HSP27 expression, trigger signal expression (VEGF), SCF expression, OCT-4 expression, and CD44+ expression. The objective if this study was to explain the mechanism and role of hypoxic preconditioning and the optimal duration of hypoxic preconditioning exposure to improve survival of h-AMSCs. Methods: An experimental laboratory explorative study (in vitro) with hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs cultures. This research was conducted through four stages. First, isolation of h-AMSCs culture from adipose tissue of patients. Second, the characterization of h-AMSCs from adipose tissue by phenotype (flowcytometry) through CD44+, CD90+ and CD45-expression before being pre-conditioned for hypoxic treatment. Third, the hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs culture (in vitro) was performed with an oxygen concentration of 1% for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Fourth, observation of survival from h-AMSCs culture was tested on the role of CD44+, VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, HSP27 with Flowcytometry and apoptotic inhibition by Tunnel Assay method. Results: The result of regression test showed that time difference had an effect on VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=-0.482) and hypoxia condition also influenced VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=0.774). The result of path analysis showed that SCF had effect on OCT-4 expression (p<0.001; β=0.985). The regression test results showed that time effects on HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.398) and hypoxia precondition also affects HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.847). Pathway analysis showed that BCL2 expression inhibited apoptosis (p=0.030; β=-0.442) and HSP27 expression also inhibited apoptosis (p<0,001;β=-0.487). Conclusion: Hypoxic preconditioning of h-AMSC culture has proven to increase the expression of VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, and BCL2 and HSP27. This study demonstrated and explained the existence of a new mechanism of increased h-AMSC survival in cultures with hypoxic preconditioning (O2 1%) via VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, and HSP 27.

                In this study we quantify the accuracy of scoring the quality of research grants using a finite set of distinct categories (1, 2, …., k), when the unobserved grant score is a continuous random variable comprising a true quality score and measurement error, both normally distributed. We vary the number of categories, the number of assessors that score the same grant and a signal-to-noise ratio parameter. We show that the loss of information of scoring a small number of categories (k > 5) compared to scoring on a continuous scale is very small, so that increasing the number of scoring categories is unlikely to lead to an improvement in the outcomes of scoring systems. In addition, we model the effect of grant assessors scoring too close to the mean and show that this results in only a very small reduction in the accuracy of scoring.

                Background: During menopause, bone density decreases, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) rapidly increases; a decrease in the estrogen level is a common factor in these phenomena. Methods: In this study, we focused on the fact that menopause is a spontaneous process, and aimed to derive the conditions that mitigate the decline in the osteo sono-assessment index (OSI), an index of bone mineral density (BMD), using a chemical equilibrium model. We attempted to establish the relationship between variables related to female hormone secretion (OSI, LDL-C) and a variable related to work capacity (physical work capacity [PWC] at 75% of maximal heart rate) by analogy, using the fact that Gibbs free energy, a thermodynamic variable related to spontaneous change, is related by three variables. Results: Consequently, if linearity is established between PWC and OSI when LDL-C is used as the standard, then the analogy of chemical equilibrium can be established between the deviation values of these three variables, with equilibrium constant K. Finally, the theoretically determined equilibrium model with constant K was applied to data obtained from the Sports Program Service (SPS) of the Yokohama Sports Medical Center. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the decrease in bone density could be alleviated by promoting an increase in LDL-C or by mitigating the decrease in PWC. In discussing personal health, mitigating bone density loss and maintaining a high work capacity are important components, which should also take into account the appropriate levels of LDL-C.

Proteins that are known only at a sequence level outnumber those with an experimental characterization by orders of magnitude. Classifying protein regions (domains) into homologous families can generate testable functional hypotheses for yet unannotated sequences. Existing domain family resources typically use at least some degree of manual curation: they grow slowly over time and leave a large fraction of the protein sequence space unclassified. We here describe automatic clustering by Density Peak Clustering of UniRef50 v. 2017_07, a protein sequence database including approximately 23M sequences. We performed a radical re-implementation of a pipeline we previously developed in order to allow handling millions of sequences and data volumes of the order of 3 TeraBytes. The modified pipeline, which we call DPCfam, finds ∼ 45,000 protein clusters in UniRef50. Our automatic classification is in close correspondence to the ones of the Pfam and ECOD resources: in particular, about 81% of medium-large Pfam families and 80% of ECOD families can be mapped to clusters generated by DPCfam. In addition, our protocol finds more than 14,000 clusters constituted of protein regions with no Pfam annotation, which are therefore candidates for representing novel protein families. These results are made available to the scientific community through a dedicated repository.

Microphysiological systems (MPS) are powerful tools for emulating human physiology and replicating disease progression <i>in vitro</i>. MPS could be better predictors of human outcome than current animal models, but mechanistic interpretation and <i>in vivo</i> extrapolation of the experimental results remain significant challenges. Here, we address these challenges using an integrated experimental-computational approach. This approach allows for <i>in silico</i> representation and predictions of glucose metabolism in a previously reported MPS with two organ compartments (liver and pancreas) connected in a closed loop with circulating medium. We developed a computational model describing glucose metabolism over 15 days of culture in the MPS. The model was calibrated on an experiment-specific basis using data from seven experiments, where HepaRG single-liver or liver-islet cultures were exposed to both normal and hyperglycemic conditions resembling high blood glucose levels in diabetes. The calibrated models reproduced the fast (i.e. hourly) variations in glucose and insulin observed in the MPS experiments, as well as the long-term (i.e. over weeks) decline in both glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. We also investigated the behaviour of the system under hypoglycemia by simulating this condition in <i>silico</i>, and the model could correctly predict the glucose and insulin responses measured in new MPS experiments. Last, we used the computational model to translate the experimental results to humans, showing good agreement with published data of the glucose response to a meal in healthy subjects. The integrated experimental-computational framework opens new avenues for future investigations toward disease mechanisms and the development of new therapies for metabolic disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ab initio predictions for 3D structure and stability of single- and double-stranded DNAs in ion solutions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zi-Chun Mu, Ya-Lan Tan, Ben-Gong Zhang, Jie Liu, Ya-Zhou Shi</p>

The three-dimensional (3D) structure and stability of DNA are essential to understand/control their biological functions and aid the development of novel materials. In this work, we present a coarse-grained (CG) model for DNA based on the RNA CG model proposed by us, to predict 3D structures and stability for both dsDNA and ssDNA from the sequence. Combined with a Monte Carlo simulated annealing algorithm and CG force fields involving the sequence-dependent base-pairing/stacking interactions and an implicit electrostatic potential, the present model successfully folds 20 dsDNAs (≤52nt) and 20 ssDNAs (≤74nt) into the corresponding native-like structures just from their sequences, with an overall mean RMSD of 3.4Å from the experimental structures. For DNAs with various lengths and sequences, the present model can make reliable predictions on stability, e.g., for 27 dsDNAs with/without bulge/internal loops and 24 ssDNAs including pseudoknot, the mean deviation of predicted melting temperatures from the corresponding experimental data is only ~2.0°C. Furthermore, the model also quantificationally predicts the effects of monovalent or divalent ions on the structure stability of ssDNAs/dsDNAs.

                Background: The academic environment is critical for advancing knowledge through research and training of students who will serve as researchers, advocates, and leaders in the future, yet there is limited data on how the higher institution-based research enterprise is being impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current study examines the perceived and expected impact of COVID-19 on engaging in a higher education institution setting, particularly focusing on student engagement in research and conduct of human subject research (HSR). Method: The authors collected an online survey with faculty and staff in a large US university system focused on education, research, and service (6/8/2020-7/10/2020; N=709). The authors performed bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models to examine the differences in research impact by HSR. Results: The majority of survey respondents (i.e., faculty and staff from a large US university system) perceived and expected at least some impact of COVID-19 on research and reported the impact to be negative. Researchers reported increased challenges in recruiting students for research activities and providing research-related learning opportunities for students. While COVID-19 impacted both HSR and non-HSR, HSR investigators have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Conclusions: Efforts are needed to further understand and overcome research challenges so that the university-based research environment can flourish for all researchers across disciplines and overcome the potentially lost learning opportunities for students. Lessons learned will help address future challenges to academic research activities and providing student research training.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Arithmetic in the signing brain: Differences and similarities in arithmetic processing between deaf signers and hearing non‐signers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Deaf signers and hearing non-signers have previously been shown to recruit partially different brain regions during simple arithmetic. In light of the triple code model, the differences were interpreted as relating to stronger recruitment of the verbal system of numerical processing, that is, left angular and inferior frontal gyrus, in hearing non-signers, and of the quantity system of numerical processing, that is, right horizontal intraparietal sulcus, for deaf signers. The main aim of the present study was to better understand similarities and differences in the neural correlates supporting arithmetic in deaf compared to hearing individuals. Twenty-nine adult deaf signers and 29 hearing non-signers were enrolled in an functional magnetic resonance imaging study of simple and difficult subtraction and multiplication. Brain imaging data were analyzed using whole-brain analysis, region of interest analysis, and functional connectivity analysis. Although the groups were matched on age, gender, and nonverbal intelligence, the deaf group performed generally poorer than the hearing group in arithmetic. Nevertheless, we found generally similar networks to be involved for both groups, the only exception being the involvement of the left inferior frontal gyrus. This region was activated significantly stronger for the hearing compared to the deaf group but showed stronger functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus in the deaf, compared to the hearing, group. These results lend no support to increased recruitment of the quantity system in deaf signers. Perhaps the reason for performance differences is to be found in other brain regions not included in the original triple code model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Methods to study adult hippocampal neurogenesis in humans and across the phylogeny</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus hosts the continuous addition of new neurons throughout life—a phenomenon named adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Here we revisit the occurrence of AHN in more than 110 mammalian species, including humans, and discuss the further validation of these data by single-cell RNAseq and other alternative techniques. In this regard, our recent studies have addressed the long-standing controversy in the field, namely whether cells positive for AHN markers are present in the adult human dentate gyrus (DG). Here we review how we developed a tightly controlled methodology, based on the use of high-quality brain samples (characterized by short postmortem delays and ≤24 h of fixation in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde), to address human AHN. We review that the detection of AHN markers in samples fixed for 24 h required mild antigen retrieval and chemical elimination of autofluorescence. However, these steps were not necessary for samples subjected to shorter fixation periods. Moreover, the detection of labile epitopes (such as Nestin) in the human hippocampus required the use of mild detergents. The application of this strictly controlled methodology allowed reconstruction of the entire AHN process, thus revealing the presence of neural stem cells, proliferative progenitors, neuroblasts, and immature neurons at distinct stages of differentiation in the human DG. The data reviewed here demonstrate that methodology is of utmost importance when studying AHN by means of distinct techniques across the phylogenetic scale. In this regard, we summarize the major findings made by our group that emphasize that overlooking fundamental technical principles might have consequences for any given research field.</p>

                The hypothalamus is a brain region that integrates signals from the periphery and the environment to maintain organismal homeostasis. To do so, specialized hypothalamic neuropeptidergic neurons control a range of processes, such as sleep, feeding, the stress response, and hormone release. These processes are altered with age, which can affect longevity and contribute to disease status. Technological advances, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, are upending assumptions about the transcriptional identity of cell types in the hypothalamus and revealing how distinct cell types change with age.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nested mechanosensory feedback actively damps visually guided head movements in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Executing agile locomotion requires animals to integrate sensory feedback, often from multiple sources. For example, human gaze is mediated by multiple feedback loops that integrate visual and vestibular information. A central challenge in studying biological feedback loops is that they are nested and dynamically coupled. Here, we develop a framework based on control theory for unraveling nested feedback systems and apply it to study gaze stabilization in the fruit fly (Drosophila). By combining experimental and mathematical methods to manipulate control topologies, we uncovered the role of body-generated mechanosensory feedback nested within visual feedback in the control of head movements. We discovered that visual feedback changed the tuning of head movements across visual motion frequencies whereas mechanosensory feedback damped head movements. Head saccades had slower dynamics when the body was free to move, further pointing to the role of damping via mechanosensory feedback. By comparing head responses between self-generated and externally generated body motion, we revealed a nonlinear gating of mechanosensory feedback that is motor-context dependent. Altogether, our findings reveal the role of nested feedback loops in flies and uncover mechanisms that reconcile differences in head kinematics between body-free and body-fixed flies. Our framework is generalizable to biological and robotic systems relying on nested feedback control for guiding locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Architecture of the chikungunya virus replication organelle</a></h4>

              
                <i>Alphaviruses</i> are mosquito-borne viruses that cause serious disease in humans and other mammals. Along with its mosquito vector, the <i>Alphaviru</i>s chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has spread explosively in the last 20 years, and there is no approved treatment for chikungunya fever. On the plasma membrane of the infected cell, CHIKV generates dedicated organelles for viral RNA replication, so-called spherules. Whereas structures exist for several viral proteins that make up the spherule, the architecture of the full organelle is unknown. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography to image CHIKV spherules in their cellular context. This reveals that the viral protein nsP1 serves as a base for the assembly of a larger protein complex at the neck of the membrane bud. Biochemical assays show that the viral helicase-protease nsP2, while having no membrane affinity on its own, is recruited to membranes by nsP1. The tomograms further reveal that full-sized spherules contain a single copy of the viral genome in double-stranded form. Finally, we present a mathematical model that explains the membrane remodeling of the spherule in terms of the pressure exerted on the membrane by the polymerizing RNA, which provides a good agreement with the experimental data. The energy released by RNA polymerization is found to be sufficient to remodel the membrane to the characteristic spherule shape.

                Tissue-resident macrophages represent a group of highly responsive innate immune cells that acquire diverse functions by polarizing towards distinct subpopulations. The subpopulations of macrophages that reside in skeletal muscle (SKM) and their changes during aging are poorly characterized. By single-cell transcriptomic analysis with unsupervised clustering, we found eleven distinct macrophage clusters in male mouse SKM with enriched gene expression programs linked to reparative, proinflammatory, phagocytotic, proliferative, and senescence-associated functions. Using a complementary classification, membrane markers LYVE1 and MHCII identified four macrophage subgroups: LYVE1-/MHCII<sup>hi</sup> (M1-like, classically activated), LYVE1+/MHCII<sup>lo</sup> (M2-like, alternatively activated), and two new subgroups, LYVE1+/MHCII<sup>hi</sup> and LYVE1-/MHCII<sup>lo</sup>. Notably, one new subgroup, LYVE1+/MHCII<sup>hi</sup>, had traits of both M2 and M1 macrophages, while the other new subgroup, LYVE1-/MHCII<sup>lo</sup>, displayed strong phagocytotic capacity. Flow cytometric analysis validated the presence of the four macrophage subgroups in SKM, and found that LYVE1- macrophages were more abundant than LYVE1+ macrophages in old SKM. A striking increase in proinflammatory markers (<i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> mRNAs) and senescence-related markers (<i>Gpnmb</i> and <i>Spp1</i> mRNAs) was evident in macrophage clusters from older mice. In sum, we have identified dynamically polarized SKM macrophages and propose that specific macrophage subpopulations contribute to the proinflammatory and senescent traits of old SKM.

                How the cuticles of the roughly 4.5 million species of ecdysozoan animals are constructed is not well understood. Here, we systematically mine gene expression datasets to uncover the spatiotemporal blueprint for how the chitin-based pharyngeal cuticle of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is built. We demonstrate that the blueprint correctly predicts expression patterns and functional relevance to cuticle development. We find that as larvae prepare to molt, catabolic enzymes are upregulated and the genes that encode chitin synthase, chitin cross-linkers, and homologs of amyloid regulators subsequently peak in expression. 48% of the gene products secreted during the molt are predicted to be intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), many of which belong to four distinct families whose transcripts are expressed in overlapping waves. These include the IDPAs, IDPBs, and IDPCs, which are introduced for the first time here. All four families have sequence properties that drive phase separation and we demonstrate phase-separation for one exemplar <i>in vitro</i>. This systematic analysis represents the first blueprint for cuticle construction and highlights the massive contribution that phase-separating materials make to the structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Therapeutic resistance in acute myeloid leukemia cells is mediated by a novel ATM/mTOR pathway regulating oxidative phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                While leukemic cells are susceptible to various therapeutic insults, residence in the bone marrow microenvironment typically confers protection from a wide range of drugs. Thus, understanding the unique molecular changes elicited by the marrow is of critical importance towards improving therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, we demonstrate that aberrant activation of oxidative phosphorylation serves to induce therapeutic resistance in FLT3 mutant human AML cells challenged with FLT3 inhibitor drugs. Importantly, our findings show that AML cells are protected from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition due to marrow-mediated activation of ATM, which in turn up-regulates oxidative phosphorylation via mTOR signaling. mTOR is required for the bone marrow stroma-dependent maintenance of protein translation, with selective polysome enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, despite FLT3 inhibition. To investigate the therapeutic significance of this finding, we tested the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib in primary human AML xenograft models. While marrow resident AML cells were highly resistant to quizartinib alone, the addition of everolimus induced profound reduction in tumor burden and prevented relapse. Taken together, these data provide a novel mechanistic understanding of marrow-based therapeutic resistance, and a promising strategy for improved treatment of FLT3 mutant AML patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A conditional strategy for cell-type specific labeling of endogenous excitatory synapses in Drosophila reveals subsynaptic architecture</a></h4>

              
                Chemical neurotransmission occurs at specialized contacts where presynaptic neurotransmitter release machinery apposes clusters of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors and signaling molecules. A series of elegantly complex events underlies the recruitment of pre- and postsynaptic proteins to sites of neuronal connection and enables the correct three-dimensional synaptic organization that underlies circuit processing and computation. To better study the developmental events of synaptogenesis in individual neurons, we need cell-type specific strategies to visualize the individual proteins at their endogenous levels at synapses. Though such strategies exist for a variety of presynaptic proteins, postsynaptic proteins remain less studied due to a paucity of reagents that allow visualization of endogenous individual postsynapses in a cell-type specific manner. To study excitatory postsynapses, we engineered dlg1[4K], a conditional, epitope-tagged marker of the excitatory postsynaptic density in Drosophila. In combination with binary expression systems, dlg1[4K] effectively labels postsynaptic regions at both peripheral neuromuscular and central synapses in larvae and adults. Using dlg1[4K], we find that distinct rules govern the postsynaptic organization of different adult neuron classes, that multiple binary expression systems can concurrently label pre- and postsynaptic regions of synapses in a cell-type-specific manner, and for the first time, visualize neuronal DLG1 at the neuromuscular junction. These results validate a novel strategy for conditional postsynaptic labeling without the caveats of overexpression and demonstrate new principles of subsynaptic organization. The use of dlg1[4K] marks a notable advancement in studying cell-type specific synaptic organization in Drosophila and the first example of a general postsynaptic marker to complement existing presynaptic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two forms of asynchronous release with distinctive spatiotemporal dynamics in central synapses</a></h4>

              
                Asynchronous release is a ubiquitous form of neurotransmitter release that persists for tens to hundreds of milliseconds after an action potential (AP). How asynchronous release is organized and regulated at the synaptic active zone (AZ) remains debatable. Using nanoscale-precision imaging of individual release events in rat hippocampal synapses, we observed two spatially distinct subpopulations of asynchronous events, ~75% of which occurred inside the AZ and with a bias towards the AZ center, while ~25% occurred outside of the functionally defined AZ, i.e., ectopically. The two subpopulations also differed markedly in temporal properties, with ectopic events occurring at significantly longer time intervals from synchronous events. Both forms of asynchronous release did not, to a large extent, utilize the same release sites as synchronous events. Both asynchronous event subpopulations also differ from synchronous events in some aspects of exo-endocytosis coupling. Specifically, for synchronous but not asynchronous events, coupling with the fast calcium-dependent endocytosis had a gradient decreasing from the AZ center towards its periphery. These results identify two distinct subpopulations of asynchronous release events with distinctive spatiotemporal organization and coupling to endocytic mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A marmoset brain cell census reveals persistent influence of developmental origin on neurons</a></h4>

              
                Within the vertebrate neocortex and other telencephalic structures, molecularly-defined neurons tend to segregate at first order into inhibitory (GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic) types. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing, analyzing over 2.4 million brain cells sampled from 16 locations in a primate (the common marmoset) to ask whether (1) neurons generally segregate by neurotransmitter status, and (2) neurons expressing the same neurotransmitters share additional molecular features in common, beyond the few genes directly responsible for neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Unexpectedly, we find the answer to both is "no": there is a surprising degree of transcriptional similarity between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons found in the same brain structure, and there is generally little in common between glutamatergic neurons residing in phylogenetically divergent brain structures. The origin effect is permanent: we find that cell types that cross cephalic boundaries in development retain the transcriptional identities of their birthplaces. GABAergic interneurons, which migrate widely, follow highly specialized and distinct distributions in striatum and neocortex. We use interneuron-restricted AAVs to reveal the morphological diversity of molecularly defined types. Our analyses expose how lineage and functional class sculpt the transcriptional identity and biodistribution of primate neurons.

	<p>Behavioural Activation (BA) is associated with a substantial evidence base for treatment of acute unipolar depression, and has promise as an easily disseminable psychological intervention for bipolar depression. Using a randomised multiple baseline case series design we examined the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted version of BA in a U.K. outpatient sample of 12 adults with acute bipolar depression. Participants were allocated at random to a 3&amp;amp;ndash;8 week wait period before being offered up to 20 sessions of BA. They completed outcome measures at intake, pre- and post-treatment and weekly symptom measures across the study period. Retention in therapy was high (11/12 participants completed the target minimum number of sessions), and all participants returning acceptability measures reported high levels of satisfaction with the intervention. No therapy-related serious adverse events were reported, nor were there exacerbations in manic symptoms that were judged to be a result of the intervention. The pattern of change on outcome measures is consistent with the potential for clinical benefit; six of the nine participants with a stable baseline showed clinically significant improvement on the primary outcome measure. The findings suggest adapted BA for bipolar depression is a feasible and acceptable approach that merits further investigation.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The approval process for MRI safety of implants includes physical observations and an experimental evaluation in artificial settings to simulate the in vivo effect. This contains the observation of temperature changes and artificial current generation by the magnetic field. From these findings, the safety of an implant and its effect on the patient can be estimated. MRI safety is based on an in vivo evaluation of adverse events after the approval process, but an actual analysis of the effect on different tissues is not followed. The effect of MRI scanning in cochlea implantees on their residual hearing as the correlate of the hair cell function is so far unknown, therefore the aim of the present study was to observe the effect of 3 T MRI on the residual hearing of cochlea implantees. Material and Methods: In this prospective study, we performed a 3 T MRI T2 2D MS Drive sequence in eight cochlea-implanted ears. Before and after the MRI scan, a bone conduction pure tone audiogram (BC PTA) was performed. All cochlea implantees had a pre-scanning threshold of low frequency residual hearing between 20 dB and 65 dB. Results: Low frequency mean residual hearing was not affected by the 3 T T2 2D MS Drive sequence. We observed a pre-scanning threshold at 250 Hz of 42.9 (SD 3.9) dB and for 500 Hz 57.1 (SD 6.4) dB. Post-scanning BC PTA was for 250 Hz 42.1 (SD 3.9) dB and for 500 Hz 57.1 (SD 5.7) dB. Conclusion: 3 T MRI scanning has no significant functional effect on the hair cells in cochlea implantees in low frequencies with a T2 2D MS Drive sequence.</p>

	<p>Olfactory hedonic evaluation is the primary dimension of olfactory perception and thus central to our sense of smell. It involves complex interactions between brain regions associated with sensory, affective and reward processing. Despite a recent increase in interest, several aspects of olfactory hedonic evaluation remain ambiguous: uncertainty surrounds the communication between, and interaction among, brain areas during hedonic evaluation of olfactory stimuli with different levels of pleasantness, as well as the corresponding supporting oscillatory mechanisms. In our study we investigated changes in functional interactions among brain areas in response to odor stimuli using electroencephalography (EEG). To this goal, functional connectivity networks were estimated based on phase synchronization between EEG signals using the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). Graph theoretic metrics were subsequently used to quantify the resulting changes in functional connectivity of relevant brain regions involved in olfactory hedonic evaluation. Our results indicate that odor stimuli of different hedonic values evoke significantly different interaction patterns among brain regions within the olfactory cortex, as well as in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Furthermore, significant hemispheric laterality effects have been observed in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, specifically in the beta ((13&amp;amp;ndash;30) Hz) and gamma ((30&amp;amp;ndash;40) Hz) frequency bands.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcriptional Profile of the Developing Subthalamic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a small, excitatory nucleus that regulates the output of basal ganglia motor circuits. The functions of the STN and its role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease are now well established. However, some basic characteristics like the developmental origin and molecular phenotype of neuronal subpopulations are still being debated. The classical model of forebrain development attributed the origin of STN within the diencephalon. Recent studies of gene expression patterns exposed shortcomings of the classical model. To accommodate these findings, the prosomeric model was developed. In this concept, STN develops within the hypothalamic primordium, which is no longer a part of the diencephalic primordium. This concept is further supported by the expression patterns of many transcription factors. It is interesting to note that many transcription factors involved in the development of the STN are also involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, the study of neurodevelopmental disorders could provide us with valuable information on the roles of these transcription factors in the development and maintenance of STN phenotype. In this review, we summarize historical theories about the developmental origin of the STN and interpret the gene expression data within the prosomeric conceptual framework. Finally, we discuss the importance of neurodevelopmental disorders for the development of the STN and its potential role in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neuronal excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance is a potential cause of neuronal network malfunctioning in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to cognitive dysfunction. Here, we used a novel approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to probe cortical excitability in different brain areas known to be directly involved in AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed TMS-EEG recordings targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC), the left posterior parietal cortex (l-PPC), and the precuneus (PC) in a large sample of patients with mild-to-moderate AD (n = 65) that were compared with a group of age-matched healthy controls (n = 21).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that patients with AD are characterized by a regional cortical hyperexcitability in the PC and, to some extent, in the frontal lobe, as measured by TMS-evoked potentials. Notably, cortical excitability assessed over the l-PPC was comparable between the 2 groups. Furthermore, we found that the individual level of PC excitability was associated with the level of cognitive impairment, as measured with Mini-Mental State Examination, and with corticospinal fluid levels of Aβ<sub>42</sub>.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data provide novel evidence that precuneus cortical hyperexcitability is a key feature of synaptic dysfunction in patients with AD. The current results point to the combined approach of TMS and EEG as a novel promising technique to measure hyperexcitability in patients with AD. This index could represent a useful biomarker to stage disease severity and evaluate response to novel therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Cell population dynamics in the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis: Remaining unknowns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus. The distinct developmental steps in the course of adult neurogenesis, including NSC activation, expansion, and neuronal integration, are increasingly well characterized down to the molecular level. However, substantial gaps remain in our knowledge about regulators and mechanisms involved in this biological process. This review highlights three long-standing unknowns. First, we discuss potency and identity of NSCs and the quest for a unifying model of short- and long-term self-renewal dynamics. Next, we examine cell death, specifically focusing on the early demise of newborn cells. Then, we outline the current knowledge on cell integration dynamics, discussing which (if any) neurons are replaced by newly added neurons in the hippocampal circuits. For each of these unknowns, we summarize the trajectory of studies leading to the current state of knowledge. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to fill the remaining gaps by taking advantage of novel technology to reveal currently hidden secrets in the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Altered expression response upon repeated gene repression in single yeast cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lea Schuh, Igor Kukhtevich, Poonam Bheda, Melanie Schulz, Maria Bordukova, Robert Schneider, Carsten Marr</p>

Cells must continuously adjust to changing environments and, thus, have evolved mechanisms allowing them to respond to repeated stimuli. While faster gene induction upon a repeated stimulus is known as reinduction memory, responses to repeated repression have been less studied so far. Here, we studied gene repression across repeated carbon source shifts in over 1,500 single <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells. By monitoring the expression of a carbon source-responsive gene, galactokinase 1 (<i>Gal1</i>), and fitting a mathematical model to the single-cell data, we observed a faster response upon repeated repressions at the population level. Exploiting our single-cell data and quantitative modeling approach, we discovered that the faster response is mediated by a shortened repression response delay, the estimated time between carbon source shift and Gal1 protein production termination. Interestingly, we can exclude two alternative hypotheses, i) stronger dilution because of e.g., increased proliferation, and ii) a larger fraction of repressing cells upon repeated repressions. Collectively, our study provides a quantitative description of repression kinetics in single cells and allows us to pinpoint potential mechanisms underlying a faster response upon repeated repression. The computational results of our study can serve as the starting point for experimental follow-up studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Widespread expression of the ancient HERV-K (HML-2) provirus group in normal human tissues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aidan Burn, Farrah Roy, Michael Freeman, John M. Coffin</p>

Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) transcripts are known to be highly expressed in cancers, yet their activity in nondiseased tissue is largely unknown. Using the GTEx RNA-seq dataset from normal tissue sampled at autopsy, we characterized individual expression of the recent HERV-K (HML-2) provirus group across 13,000 different samples of 54 different tissues from 948 individuals. HML-2 transcripts could be identified in every tissue sampled and were elevated in the cerebellum, pituitary, testis, and thyroid. A total of 37 different individual proviruses were expressed in 1 or more tissues, representing all 3 LTR5 subgroups. Nine proviruses were identified as having long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription, 7 of which belonged to the most recent LTR5HS subgroup. Proviruses of different subgroups displayed a bias in tissue expression, which may be associated with differences in transcription factor binding sites in their LTRs. Provirus expression was greater in evolutionarily older proviruses with an earliest shared ancestor of gorilla or older. HML-2 expression was significantly affected by biological sex in 1 tissue, while age and timing of death (Hardy score) had little effect. Proviruses containing intact <i>gag</i>, <i>pro</i>, and <i>env</i> open reading frames (ORFs) were expressed in the dataset, with almost every tissue measured potentially expressing at least 1 intact ORF (<i>gag</i>).

                Background: The development and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has provided the clearest path forward to eliminate community spread and thus end the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? Methods: We develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number Rt and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Results: Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. We then investigate the threat of localized outbreaks in low-vaccinated populations that have removed all social intervention mandates, and show that such populations could remain highly susceptible to major outbreaks particularly in the face of more easily transmissible variants.  Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex interplay involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extant social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of chewing-betel habits on blood glucose levels in the Karo ethnic community, Karo district [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The chewing Betel habit is a hereditary tradition from the ancestors of the Batak-Karo tribe, Indonesia. Karo people believe that chewing betel habit is their unifier. The chewing-betel habit process begins with concocting a mixture of ingredients such as betel leaf, lime, gambier, areca nut, and with or without tobacco addition, then chewed slowly. Our previous study showed that gambier extracts (Uncaria gambier Roxb), can reduce blood glucose levels(BGL) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)patients. This study aimed to analyze whether the habit of chewing betel can affect BGL in the Karo ethnic community in the Karo district. Methods: In total, 48 participants from the Karo community were divided into 4 groups (n=12 per group), namely: I. non-T2DM participants without chewing betel habits; II. non-T2DM participants with chewing-betel habit; III. T2DM participants without chewing-betel habit and IV. T2DM participants with chewing-betel habit. The sampling technique was consecutive sampling. The data were collected by interviews and blood sampling (fasting and 2 hours postprandial (2hPP)). The collected data were analyzed by paired t-test, Independent sample t-test, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney with a significance level of p-value <0.05. Results: This study showed that fasting BGL condition in group-I compared to group II (84.33±12.32 vs 81.00±4.84) mg/dl and group-III compared to group-IV (196.25±104.81 vs 150.00±42.45) mg/dl had no significant difference. Also, the BGL of 2hPP condition in group-I compared to group-II (111.25 ±22.62 vs 108.33±18.99) mg/dl, and group-III compared to group-IV (314.92±128.97 vs 229.25±58.26) mg/dl, in statistically there was no difference (p>0.05). Although the data showed that group-III was higher than group-IV. Conclusions: This study concludes that with or without chewing-betel habits affect blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes subjects (Groups III and IV).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptualizing university students’ food choices based on theory of planned behavior [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several students use hostel facilities offered by their colleges and universities while pursuing higher education. A crucial change is witnessed in their food habits during their stay at the campus, which is vastly different from their home experience. Method: The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand food choices of university students, while following the qualitative research methodology and the phenomenological approach. The snowball sampling method is applied to select participants for the study. We selected twenty-six undergraduate and postgraduate students pursuing programs in technical and health science from a private university at Udupi with residence in the university campus for two to four years. Interviews with candidates were conducted online and audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results: The transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to obtain themes, which were then conceptualized to develop the model based on theory of planned behavior. The duration of their stay in campus allowed students to gain a perspective on the food events and the food they consumed at university dining facility (UDF) guided by factors, such as taste, price, availability of time(during academic activity), accessibility to healthy food, academic stress and lack of knowledge on nutrition. Two factors emerged from the interviews, one, there was no display in the dining facility about the nutritional value of the food served; and, second, students preferred to dine out on unhealthy food rather than at the university because food from outside the campus , even though unhealthy, was easier on the pocket. Conclusion: The study provides insights into the role of UDF in serving healthy and nutritional food to students for better health and improved academic performance. This work brings to light the relationship between students’ food choices and their impact on academic performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HormonomicsDB: a novel workflow for the untargeted analysis of plant growth regulators and hormones [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabolomics is the simultaneous determination of all metabolites in a system. Despite significant advances in the field, compound identification remains a challenge. Prior knowledge of the compound classes of interest can improve metabolite identification. Hormones are a small signaling molecules, which function in coordination to direct all aspects of development, function and reproduction in living systems and which also pose challenges as environmental contaminants. Hormones are inherently present at low levels in tissues, stored in many forms and mobilized rapidly in response to a stimulus making them difficult to measure, identify and quantify.   Methods: An in-depth literature review was performed for known hormones, their precursors, metabolites and conjugates in plants to generate the database and an RShiny App developed to enable web-based searches against the database. An accompanying liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) protocol was developed with retention time prediction in Retip. A meta-analysis of 14 plant metabolomics studies was used for validation.   Results: We developed HormonomicsDB, a tool which can be used to query an untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) dataset against a database of more than 200 known hormones, their precursors and metabolites. The protocol encompasses sample preparation, analysis, data processing and hormone annotation and is designed to minimize degradation of labile hormones. The plant system is used a model to illustrate the workflow and data acquisition and interpretation. Analytical conditions were standardized to a 30 min analysis time using a common solvent system to allow for easy transfer by a researcher with basic knowledge of MS. Incorporation of synthetic biotransformations enables prediction of novel metabolites.   Conclusions: HormonomicsDB is suitable for use on any LC-MS based system with compatible column and buffer system, enables the characterization of the known hormonome across a diversity of samples, and hypothesis generation to reveal knew insights into hormone signaling networks.

                Introduction: Sleep is important in humans, and it is affected by lifestyle changes. Improper sleep leads to serious physiological problems and disorders that occurs in human brain/scalp. These physiological changes and electrical activity of the human brain are recorded as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This paper describes the detection of a major sleep disorder \textit{i.e.}, sleep apnea (SA).  Methods: In this paper, sleep apnea is measured using various artifacts taken from the subjects. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract characteristics from an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal and to detect sleep. This is used to determine whether a person has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or central sleep apnea (CSA). The wavelet technique is used to split the EEG signal into five frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma.  Results: For these five frequency bands, the mean, standard deviation, variance, maximum, minimum, and energy are computed.  Discussion: A sleep problem is detected based on these characteristics.

                The ethics of compulsive treatment (CT) is a medical, social and legal discussion that reemerged after the ratification by 181 countries of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The optional protocol of the UN-CRPD was ratified by 86 countries aiming to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. It also determined the need to review mental health laws as under this light treatment of persons with disabilities, particularly those with mental disorders, cannot accept the use of CT. This selective review of literature aims to clarify inputs from clinical psychiatry adding evidence to the multi-disciplinary discussion. It provides contradictory evidence on how patients experience CT and its impact on their mental health and treatment programs, also which are main reasons for the use of CT and what efforts in psychiatry have been made to reduce, replace and refine it.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quality of life of Jordanian menopausal working and retired women and its associated factors: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Life expectancy of Jordanian women has increased, indicating that the number of women entering menopausal age, during the prime of their working life, will also increase. Therefore, assessments of the quality of life (QoL) of working and retired women and factors associated with overall wellbeing, are essential for the provision of quality services and care. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 200 Jordanian women between the ages of 45 to 60 years old.  The Utian QOL tool was used to assess the quality of life among menopausal women.  Multiple regressions were used to determine predictors for QoL for the whole sample and for each group of working and retired women. Results: The study shows that the total QoL for women was 77.5 ±14.4, with a significant difference (p=.023) in total QoL and the occupational domain (p=.003) between working and retired women. Employed women with fewer chronic diseases and using frequent preventive measures had a higher QoL compared to others. Conclusion: Working itself might be an important indicator for better a quality of life among menopausal women. Better working conditions and more attention from the health care providers for the menopausal changes and the preventive measures could enhance women’s perceived QoL in addition to increasing their productivity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare and often severe disease characterized by central nervous system-restricted inflammatory vasculitis on histopathology. Diagnosis requires brain biopsy for confirmation and is suggested prior to starting immunotherapy when feasible. However, emerging evidence suggests that other neuroinflammatory conditions may have a clinical and radiographic phenotype that mimics small vessel primary angiitis, at times with overlapping pathologic features as well. Such diagnoses, including anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease and central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, can be non-invasively diagnosed with serum antibody or genetic testing that would prompt different monitoring and treatment paradigms. To determine the ultimate diagnosis of patients who were suspected prior to biopsy to have small vessel primary angiitis, we reviewed the clinical, radiographic and pathological features of a cohort of patients at a single center undergoing brain biopsy for non-oncologic indications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical data was retrospectively extracted from the medical record. Pathology and neuroimaging review was conducted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 21 patients over a 19-year time-period, of whom 14 (66.7%) were ultimately diagnosed with entities other than small vessel primary angiitis that would have obviated the need for brain biopsy. Diagnoses included anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease (n=9), central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n=3), anti-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor encephalitis (n=1), and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (n=1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights the importance of pursuing now readily available non-invasive testing for mimicking diagnoses before performing a brain biopsy for suspected small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Coordinating transcription and replication to mitigate their conflicts in early Drosophila embryos</a></h4>

              
                Early zygotic transcription in Drosophila embryos takes place entirely during the short S phases of nuclear division cycles. Cho et al. demonstrate that rapid onset of transcription depends on DNA replication in each cycle. Delayed initiation of transcription allows unimpeded elongation of nascent transcripts behind advancing replication forks.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">SMC complexes can traverse physical roadblocks bigger than their ring size</a></h4>

              
                If and how SMC proteins perform DNA loop extrusion on protein-decorated DNA is an ongoing debate. Pradhan et al. show that DNA-binding proteins do not pose barriers to DNA-loop-extruding SMC complexes. Roadblocks larger than the SMC ring size cannot inhibit loop extrusion, which points to a non-topological loop extrusion mechanism.

                Septins are involved in host-pathogen interactions. Aigal et al. show that septins are recruited to the attachment site of P. aeruginosa, which utilizes a surface lectin to bind to the host membrane, resulting in attachment, membrane deformation, and entry. Septins can prevent this invasion process by locally increasing membrane rigidity.

                Peters et al. show that visuomotor associative learning promotes visual responses in the mouse dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These responses are independent of behavioral context. They arise synchronously with learning, with a step-like increase that matches the increase in performance seen on the day when a mouse learns the visuomotor association.

                IL-17RA is the shared co-receptor for several IL-17 family members. Goepfert et al. show that IL-17 induces IL-17RA dimerization, which then drives the formation of a 2:2:2 hexameric signaling assembly with IL-17RC. Furthermore, IL-17RA dimerization potentiates IL-17 signaling in immortalized primary human keratinocytes, compared with cells expressing a dimerization-defective IL-17RA variant.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Downregulation of hepatic ceruloplasmin ameliorates NAFLD via SCO1-AMPK-LKB1 complex</a></h4>

              
                Xie et al. reveal that ceruloplasmin deletion restores hepatic copper in DIO mice and ameliorates NAFLD development via enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistically, they find that the chaperone SCO1 senses copper and activates AMPK by forming the SCO1-LKB1-AMPK complex.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Hypothalamic orexin prevents non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in obesity</a></h4>

              
                Tsuneki et al. reveal that central actions of orexin are required for preventing NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under diet-induced obese conditions. In this process, orexin attenuates hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated inflammation via the autonomic nervous system in addition to causing the anti-obese effect via promotion of physical activity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Stress-induced glucocorticoid desensitizes adrenoreceptors to gate the neuroendocrine response to somatic stress in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Physical and psychological stressors activate neuroendocrine secretion of corticosteroid. Noradrenaline circuits are critical to the neuroendocrine response to physical but not psychological stress. Jiang et al. show that stress-induced corticosteroids decrease noradrenaline sensitivity in the brain, which suppresses the response to subsequent physical stressors but leaves the psychological stress response intact.
