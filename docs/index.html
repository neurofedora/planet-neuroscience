">A Neural Network Model of Visual Attention Integrating Biased Competition and Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                We present a neural network model of visual attention (NNMVA) that integrates biased competition and reinforcement learning to capture key aspects of attentional behavior. The model combines self-attention mechanisms from Vision Transformers (ViTs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for working memory, and an actor critic reinforcement learning framework to map visual inputs to behavioral outputs. The self-attention mechanism simulates biased competition among artificial neural representations, determining their influence on working memory, which in turn provides top-down feedback to guide attention. Trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using reward feedback paralleling learning processes in non-human primates the NNMVA replicates key behavioral signatures of attention, such as improved performance and faster reaction times for cued stimuli. Manipulating the model's attention mechanisms affects performance in ways analogous to experimental manipulations in primate frontal eye fields and superior colliculus. Additionally, artificially inducing attentional biases alters value estimates and temporal difference (TD) errors, offering predictions about how attention may interact with dopamine related learning signals in the brain. Our findings suggest that reward-driven behavior alone can account for several key correlates of attention, providing a computational framework to explore the interplay between attention and reinforcement learning in both biological and artificial systems.

">Neural Context Reinstatement of Recurring Events</a></h4>

              
                Episodic recollection involves retrieving context information bound to specific events. However, autobiographical memory largely comprises recurrent, similar experiences that become integrated into joint representations. In the current study, we extracted a neural signature of temporal context from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether recalling a recurring event accompanies the reinstatement of one or multiple instances of its occurrence. We asked 52 young adults to study and recall lists of words that included both once-presented and repeated items. Participants recalled repeated items in association with neighboring list items from each occurrence, but with stronger clustering around the repetition's initial occurrence. Furthermore, multivariate spectral EEG analyses revealed that neural activity from just prior to the recall of these words resembled patterns of activity observed near the item's first occurrence, but not its second. Together, these results suggest that the initial occurrence of an event carries stronger temporal context associations than later repetitions.

">Medial prefrontal cortical neurotransmitters reactive to relapse-promoting and relapse-suppressing cues in rats trained to self-administer cocaine or alcohol</a></h4>

              
                Environmental cues conditioned to signal drug availability (S+) or omission (S-) activate specific neurons (neuronal ensembles/engram cells) within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to promote and suppress drug relapse in rats. However, the neurochemical source of such cue-specific activation remains unknown. In this study, we determined extracellular neurotransmitter fluctuations reactive to S+ vs. S- in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices of male rats trained to lever-press for cocaine or alcohol self-administration. In cocaine- or alcohol-trained rats exposed to S+, no significant neurotransmitter fluctuations were observed in IL or PL. In cocaine-trained rats exposed to S-, glutamate, serotonin, taurine and adenosine were increased in PL but not in IL. In alcohol-trained rats exposed to S-, glutamate was increased, while dopamine and GABA were decreased, in IL but not in PL. Although S+ reactive neurotransmitters driving neuronal activation in mPFC remains to be elucidated, glutamate is likely the source of such activation by S- in rats trained to self-administer cocaine or alcohol. While drugs used for self-administration and cue-conditioning appear to dictate the type and anatomical specificity of S- evoked neurotransmission within mPFC, glutamate may serve as a common therapeutic target to mimic relapse-suppression by S- across cocaine and alcohol use disorders (CUD and AUD). In contrast, serotonin, taurine and adenosine may serve as the targets in CUD, while dopamine and GABA may serve as the targets in AUD.

">Retrospective Attention Can Trigger Visual Perception Without Dependence on Either Cue Awareness or Target Reporting</a></h4>

              
                Retrospective attention, guided by cues after stimulus offset, enhances perception of threshold-level Gabor patches. The neural mechanisms underlying this effect, and its dependence on cue awareness and target reporting, remain unclear. Using EEG in report and no-report paradigms with visible and invisible post-cues, we found that orientation discrimination improved with retro-cues regardless of cue visibility. Compared to visible conditions, under invisible conditions, retro-cueing effects were weaker, limited to stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 66.67 ms, and linked to N2pc component. Visible retro-cueing effects persisted at SOAs of 100 ms, evoking strong P3b in report condition and weak VAN in no-report condition. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that in report conditions, neural processing of cued targets was earlier, stronger, and more generalized in the frontoparietal region; in no-report conditions, only cued targets were decoded in the parieto-occipital region. Our findings indicate that retrospective attention can trigger visual perception independently of cue awareness and the target reporting, thus contributing to current discussions on theories of consciousness.

">Sex differences in central amygdala glutamate responses to calcitonin gene-related peptide</a></h4>

              
                Women are disproportionately affected by chronic pain compared to men. While societal and environmental factors contribute to this disparity, sex-based biological differences in the processing of pain are also believed to play significant roles. The central lateral nucleus of the amygdala (CeLC) is a key region for the emotional-affective dimension of pain, and a prime target for exploring sex differences in pain processing since a recent study demonstrated sex differences in CGRP actions in this region. Inputs to CeLC from the parabrachial nucleus (PB) play a causal role in aversive processing, and release both glutamate and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP is thought to play a crucial role in chronic pain by potentiating glutamatergic signaling in CeLC. However, it is not known if this CGRP-mediated synaptic plasticity occurs similarly in males and females. Here, we tested the hypothesis that female CeLC neurons experience greater potentiation of glutamatergic signaling than males following endogenous CGRP exposure. Using trains of optical stimuli to evoke transient CGRP release from PB terminals in CeLC, we find that subsequent glutamatergic responses are preferentially potentiated in CeLC neurons from female mice. This potentiation was CGRP-dependent and involved a postsynaptic mechanism. This sex difference in CGRP sensitivity may explain sex differences in affective pain processing.

">Anterior cingulate neurons display subregion-specific interaction with frontal eye fields as revealed by combined antidromic stimulation and resting state imaging</a></h4>

              
                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to exert cognitive control over saccade generation in the frontal eye fields (FEF), but the nature of this interaction remains unclear. Although prior imaging studies have suggested ACC interacts with FEF, few studies have confirmed this by electrophysiological recordings. This study aimed to characterize the functional connectivity between ACC and medial and lateral FEF during cognitive saccade tasks. We combined resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) with single-unit electrophysiology in two macaque monkeys performing memory-guided saccade and pro-/anti-saccade tasks. Anti- and ortho-dromic stimulation was used to electrophysiologically identify ACC neurons mono- and polysynaptically connected to FEF. We analyzed ACC neuronal selectivity for different task aspects and correlated these properties with both positive and negative rs-fMRI functional connectivity between ACC and FEF subregions. Anti- and ortho-dromically identified ACC neurons were predominantly connected to medial FEF, which showed stronger positive functional connectivity with ACC compared to lateral FEF. Sites with higher proportions of task-selective neurons yielded stronger functional connectivity with FEF. This stronger functional connectivity was particularly related to the delay and saccadic periods of different cognitive saccade tasks. Using combined imaging and electrophysiology, our findings provide converging evidence for functional interactions between ACC and FEF, predominantly medial FEF regions which encode large amplitude saccades. The correlation between functional connectivity and task-related neuronal selectivity supports ACC's interaction with FEF in the modulation of saccade generation and cognitive control. Additionally, we report suggestive evidence that mono- and poly-synaptic connections may be related to positive functional connectivity, but we found no such relationship for negative functional connectivity (anticorrelations). These results advance our understanding of prefrontal cortical interactions in oculomotor control and the electrophysiological mechanisms of positive and negative resting-state functional connectivity.

">Can ERPs and neural oscillations be used to differentiate skilled and unskilled player performance in an ecologically valid sporting model?</a></h4>

              
                The present study seeks to identify neural correlates of high performance in ecological valid, sporting tasks and quantify the differences between high skilled and low skilled players. To do this, Esports is chosen to be the sporting model to facilitate clean brain activity recordings whilst playing sport, something that is considerably more challenging with traditional sports. Participants are first separated into a skilled or unskilled group based on their Esports performance using objective classification measures to identify the presence of a higher and lower performing groups. Their brain activity is then recorded as they complete a visuomotor psychophysics task and Esports aim-training tasks. The first task requires discrete movements, the second sequential movements. Results indicate that there are several key differences in the brain activity of skilled players that facilitate a higher level of performance. Firstly, skilled players display enhanced response in time-domain activity of occipital parietal electrodes, displaying significantly higher p100 amplitude (sensor-space) and higher p300 amplitude (source-space). Peak decoding using MVPA, classifying brain activity between skilled or unskilled players, is achieved during the first 300ms of the response. Furthermore, skilled players modulate visual attention, gated by alpha oscillations, to release the visual system before target onset. As a result, visual information is consciously accessed more readily to be utilized for a motor response. Skilled players show an increase in frontal-midline theta during Esports performance facilitating management of cognitive load and repeated execution of precise movements. Due to the nature of the model, applied implications are suggested for both coaches and athletes of all sports to utilize this research. Specifically, performance improvement of players could be facilitated by identifying deficits in their brain activity and talent identification, by observing the neural correlates reported in developing players. Future research should focus on adapting evoked, rather than induced brain activity recording during Esports competition.

">The development of aperiodic neural activity in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The neurophysiological mechanisms supporting brain maturation are fundamental to attention and memory capacity across the lifespan. Human brain regions develop at different rates, with many regions developing into the third and fourth decades of life. Here, in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/gsru7), we analyzed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from widespread brain regions in a large developmental cohort. Using task-based (i.e., attention to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93 - 54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5691), we mapped aperiodic (1/f-like) activity, a proxy of excitation:inhibition (E:I) balance with steeper slopes indexing inhibition and flatter slopes indexing excitation. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in gray matter volume are differentially associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices. Our findings establish developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity in localized brain regions and illuminate the development of PFC inhibitory control during adolescence in the development of attention and memory.

">Alternative EEG pre-processing pipelines can lead to conflicting conclusions regarding cortical excitation/inhibition ratio</a></h4>

              
                Confluent recent evidence indicates that the spectral slope of 1/f neurophysiological recordings is correspondent to cortical excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio. In this framework, a steeper power spectrum (i.e., one with a larger spectral exponent {beta}) is indicative of stronger inhibitory tone and thus lower E/I ratio, and vice versa. While the tools commonly utilized for estimating {beta} are mostly consistent, there appears to be a lack of standardization among data processing protocols for slope analysis. In this work our goal is to draw attention to a fundamental consequence of this issue, namely that even in a confined, comparative research environment, applying different pre-processing steps to electroencephalography (EEG) data can lead to conflicting conclusions in terms of the E/I ratio. To this end, we analyzed resting-state EEG recordings in two independent datasets, containing data collected with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), with the latter considered as a physiological state with stronger inhibitory tone. Our analysis confirmed consistently in both cohorts that applying different spatial filtering schemes in an otherwise identical analytical pipeline indicated a decrease in E/I ratio over the prefrontal cortex in one case, but not the other when transitioning from EO to EC. In contrast, this same pattern was apparent over the occipital cortex regardless of the pre-processing scheme. This empirical evidence calls for the development of a standardized data processing protocol for EEG-based analyses of the E/I ratio.

">Bichromatic exon-reporters reveal voltage-gated Ca2+-channel splice-isoform diversity across Drosophila neurons in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Every neuron contains the same genomic information but its complement of proteins is the product of countless neuron-specific steps including pre-mRNA splicing. Despite advances in RNA sequencing techniques, pre-mRNA splicing biases that favor one isoform over another are largely inscrutable in live neurons in situ. Here, in Drosophila, we developed bichromatic fluorescent reporters to investigate alternate splicing of cacophony - a gene that codes the pore-forming 1-subunit of the primary neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC). These reporters reveal a neuron-specific pattern of exon biases, including stereotypical differences between neurons of the same neurotransmitter type and ostensibly the same function. Information about exon splicing biases of individual neurons in vivo provides clues to the role of VGCC motifs and the role of those neurons in the context of local circuits. The application of this technology to a large gene such as cacophony provides a precedence for effective exon-reporter design for other Drosophila genes.

">Encoding opposing valences through frequency-dependent transmitter switching in single peptidergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Peptidergic neurons often co-express fast transmitters and neuropeptides in separate vesicles with distinct release properties. However, the release dynamics of each transmitter in various contexts have not been fully understood in behaving animals. Here, we demonstrate that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the external lateral subdivision of the parabrachial nucleus (CGRPPBel) encode opposing valence via differential release, rather than co-release, of glutamate and neuropeptides, according to firing rate. Glutamate is released preferentially at lower firing rates with minimal release at higher firing rates, whereas neuropeptides are released at higher firing rates, resulting in frequency-dependent switching of transmitters. Aversive stimuli evoke high frequency responses with accompanying neuropeptide release to encode negative valence, whereas appetitive stimuli evoke low frequency responses with glutamate release to encode positive valence. Our study reveals a previously unknown capability of single CGRPPBel neurons to bidirectionally encode valence via frequency-dependent differential release of transmitters in vivo.

">Projections between the globus pallidus externa and cortex span motor and non-motor regions</a></h4>

              
                The globus pallidus externa (GPe) is a heterogenous nucleus of the basal ganglia, with intricate connections to other basal ganglia nuclei, as well as direct connections to the cortex. The anatomic, molecular and electrophysiologic properties of cortex-projecting pallidocortical neurons are not well characterized. Here we show that pallidocortical neurons project to diverse motor and non-motor cortical regions, are organized topographically in the GPe, and segregate into two distinct electrophysiological and molecular phenotypes. In addition, we find that the GPe receives direct synaptic input back from deep layers of diverse motor and non-motor cortical regions, some of which form reciprocal connections onto pallidocortical neurons. These results demonstrate the existence of a fast, closed-loop circuit between the GPe and the cortex which is ideally positioned to integrate information about behavioral goals, internal states, and environmental cues to rapidly modulate behavior.

">Targeting Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor Type 1 (CRHR1) Neurons: Validating the Specificity of a Novel Transgenic Crhr1-FlpO Mouse</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling through its cognate receptors, CRHR1 and CRHR2, contributes to diverse stress-related functions in the mammalian brain. Whereas CRHR2 is predominantly expressed in choroid plexus and blood vessels, CRHR1 is abundantly expressed in neurons in discrete brain regions, including the neocortex, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. Activation of CRHR1 influences motivated behaviors, emotional states, and learning and memory. However, it is unknown whether alterations in CRHR1 signaling contribute to aberrant motivated behaviors observed, for example, in stressful contexts. These questions require tools to manipulate CRHR1 selectively. Here we describe and validate a novel Crhr1-FlpO mouse. Methods: Using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenesis, we engineered a transgenic mouse that expresses FlpO recombinase in CRHR1-expressing cells. We used two independent methods to assess the specificity of FlpO to CRHR1-expressing cells. First, we injected Crhr1-FlpO mice with Flp-dependent viruses expressing fluorescent reporter molecules. Additionally, we crossed the Crhr1-FlpO mouse with a transgenic Flp-dependent reporter mouse. CRHR1 and reporter molecules were identified using immunocytochemistry and visualized via confocal microscopy in several brain regions in which CRHR1 expression and function is established. Results: Expression of Flp-dependent viral constructs was highly specific to CRHR1-expressing cells in all regions examined (over 90% co-localization). In accord, robust and specific expression of the Flp-dependent transgenic reporter was observed in a reporter mouse, recapitulating endogenous CRHR1 expression. Conclusions: The Crhr1-FlpO mouse enables selective genetic access to CRHR1-expressing cells within the mouse brain. When combined with Cre-lox or site-specific recombinases, the mouse facilitates intersectional manipulations of CRHR1-expressing neurons.

">Challenges in inferring breathing rhythms from olfactory bulb local field potentials</a></h4>

              
                Odors convey useful navigational and episodic information, yet much of the chemical world remains inaccessible without active sampling through sniffing. To effectively interpret olfactory cues, the brain must unify odor-driven activity with respiratory cycles, making accurate respiratory measurements critical in understanding olfactory bulb (OB) dynamics. Previous studies have shown that behavioral signals are often present in primary sensory areas, and OB local field potentials (LFPs) have long been known to couple with respiration. Here we investigated whether OB LFPs can reliably recover the precise timing and frequency of respiration. Our results indicate that OB LFPs across multiple frequency bands align with respiratory cycles. Using time and frequency domain methods, we show that 2-12 Hz LFP oscillations effectively track respiratory frequency. However, a monotonic relationship between LFP-respiratory delay and sniffing frequency, which varies across animals, renders the recovery of precise respiratory events challenging. This work demonstrates the complex and individualized relationship between rodent respiration and OB LFPs, contributing to our understanding of how respiratory signals are represented in the OB.

">Targeted H3K9 acetylation at lncSox1 promoter by cell type-specific epigenome editing promotes intermediate progenitor proliferation in developing mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                The distribution and level of epigenetic (chromatin) marks have implications for differential regulatory effects at specific gene loci. Herein, we applied a protocol which combines in vivo electroporation and a CRISPR-dead (d)Cas9 system to probe and edit a specific chromatin mark in the epigenome of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) in developing mouse cortex. We found that the promoter of lncSox1, a long non-coding gene, is a key genomic locus for H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac) during IPC amplification. CRISPR-dCas9-mediated addition of H3K9ac at lncSox1 promoter resulted in lncSox1 upregulation, with attendant increase in IPC pool and augmented neurogenesis. Thus, we have identified dynamic regulation of lncSox1 as a major downstream target of H3 acetylation, and as part of an epigenetic mechanism involved in IPC proliferation during neocortex expansion. This finding is a proof-of-concept that our epigenome editing-based method can be used for manipulating specific epigenetic effectors to determine their (neuro)biological significance.

MOTIVATIONThe abundance of basal progenitors is critical for cortical neurogenesis during brain development. There is growing interest in identifying how specific epigenetic factors regulate the genesis and expansion of basal progenitor cell sub-populations, including intermediate progenitor cells. We established a protocol that allowed us to identify the involvement of a long non-coding RNA (lncSox1) in regulating the proliferation of intermediate progenitor cells under the influence of H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac). By enhancing H3K9ac at the promoter region of lncSox1 using a CRISPR-dCas9-mediated gene-editing tool, we were able to determine that lncSox1 upregulation is a downstream effect of H3K9ac acetylation and is necessary for intermediate progenitor pool amplification during cortical development.

Highlights- Identification of H3 acetylation-dependent expression of ncRNAs in developing cortex.
- Establishment of cell Cre/LoxP and CRISPR-dCas9-dependent H3K9ac epigenome editing.
- CRISPR-dCas9-mediated addition of H3K9ac at lncSox1 promoter resulted in lncSox1 upregulation.
- H3K9 acetylation at lncSox1 promoter enhances proliferation of TBR2-expressing IPCs.
- Targeted epigenome editing revealed lncSox1 as a key regulator of cortical development.

	<p>TDP-43 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that plays a central role in neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as TDP-43 proteinopathies. Under physiological conditions, TDP-43 is primarily localized to the nucleus, but in its pathological form it aggregates in the cytoplasm, contributing to neuronal death. Given its association with numerous diseases, particularly ALS and FTLD, the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 aggregation and its impact on neuronal function have been extensively investigated. However, little is still known about the spreading of this pathology from cell to cell. Recent research has unveiled the possibility that TDP-43 may possess prion-like properties. Specifically, misfolded TDP-43 aggregates can act as templates inducing conformational changes in native TDP-43 molecules and propagating the misfolded state across neural networks. This review summarizes the mounting and most recent evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies supporting the prion-like hypothesis and its underlying mechanisms. The prion-like behavior of TDP-43 has significant implications for diagnostics and therapeutics. Importantly, emerging strategies such as small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies, and gene therapies targeting TDP-43 propagation offer promising avenues for developing effective treatments. By elucidating the mechanisms of TDP-43 spreading, we therefore aim to pave the way for novel therapies for TDP-43-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <p>Successful behavior depends on the attentional state and other factors related to decision-making, which may modulate neuronal activity differently. Here, we investigated whether attentional state and behavioral outcome (i.e., whether a target is detected or missed) are distinguishable using the power and phase of local field potential recorded bilaterally from area V4 of two male rhesus monkeys performing a cued visual attention task. To link each trial's outcome to pairwise measures of attention that are typically averaged across trials, we used several methods to obtain single-trial estimates of spike count correlation and phase consistency. Surprisingly, while attentional location was best discriminated using gamma and high-gamma power, behavioral outcome was best discriminated by alpha power and steady-state visually evoked potential. Power outperformed absolute phase in attentional/behavioral discriminability, although single-trial gamma phase consistency provided reasonably high attentional discriminability. Our results suggest a dissociation between the neuronal mechanisms that regulate attentional focus and behavioral outcome.</p>

                <p>Here we test the stochastic dynamic operator (SDO) as a new framework for describing physiological signal dynamics relative to spiking or stimulus events. The SDO is a natural extension of existing spike-triggered average (STA) or stimulus-triggered average techniques currently used in neural analysis. It extends the classic STA to cover state-dependent and probabilistic responses where STA may fail. In simulated data, SDO methods were more sensitive and specific than the STA for identifying state-dependent relationships. We have tested SDO analysis for interactions between electrophysiological recordings of spinal interneurons, single motor units, and aggregate muscle electromyograms (EMG) of major muscles in the spinal frog hindlimb. When predicting target signal behavior relative to spiking events, the SDO framework outperformed or matched classical spike-triggered averaging methods. SDO analysis permits more complicated spike&ndash;signal relationships to be captured, analyzed, and interpreted visually and intuitively. SDO methods can be applied at different scales of interest where spike-triggered averaging methods are currently employed, and beyond, from single neurons to gross motor behaviors. SDOs may be readily generated and analyzed using the provided <I>SDO Analysis Toolkit</I>. We anticipate this method will be broadly useful for describing dynamical signal behavior and uncovering state-dependent relationships of stochastic signals relative to discrete event times.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1344/v1?src=rss">Migration, Urbanism and Health: Moving Toward Systems-Informed Policy and Practice [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Migration and displacement are pivotal determinants of urban health, influencing both direct and indirect health outcomes. Migrants may face unique health risks, often exacerbated by economic, social, and environmental factors encountered during transit or upon resettlement. As migration patterns shift due to geopolitical, climatic, and economic pressures, they reshape the global and urban policy landscapes in unpredictable ways, presenting challenges that will continue to evolve in the coming decades. Current legal frameworks, in many cases, do not adequately account for migrant populations, hindering policy responses and complicating the protection of migrant health. Therefore, effective urban health interventions must be inclusive of migrant populations and expand beyond healthcare services. A systems-thinking approach that recognizes the broader determinants of health—including housing, employment, social services, and urban infrastructure—is essential to address the intersecting challenges migrants face. Despite these challenges, migration remains crucial to the functioning of urban environments. Migrant workers consistently contribute to the healthy operation of cities, underpinning key infrastructure and services. However, to optimize policy responses and improve urban health outcomes, more robust data and evidence on the health risks and outcomes of migrants, as well as the structural drivers of migration, are needed. Moreover, macro factors such as climate change, future pandemics, and geopolitical shifts are likely to influence both migration dynamics and migrant health. To anticipate and respond to these evolving challenges, a systems-informed and holistic vision of urban health is required—one that integrates migration into the broader urban policy and planning frameworks to foster healthier, more resilient cities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-517/v3?src=rss">Association between Hematological Parameters and Severity of COVID-19 disease [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study aimed to determine the relationships between hematological parameters- hemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Counts (TLC), platelet counts, Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), Absolute Lymphocyte Counts (ALC), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII), Neutrophil Monocyte Ratio (NMR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and the severity of COVID-19 disease and their use in predicting severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods and Material This was a prospective, observational, single-center study of 573 symptomatic adult inpatients of COVID 19 admitted to our tertiary care center. Statistical analysis used The above-mentioned hematological parameter levels were noted and compared between the two categories of COVID-19 disease, namely non-severe and severe COVID-19 using logistic regression methods. Their cut-off values were detected using the ROC curve. Results The median TLC, ANC, NLR, SII, NMR, PLR were notably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that NMR (OR=1.029, p=0.006) and ALC (OR=0.999, p=0.002) were statistically significant independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Conclusions The hematological parameters mentioned, can be used for predicting severe COVID-19 disease at admission. ALC and NMR levels could be used as hematological markers to predict severity of COVID-19 in adult patients with their cut off values being < 1105 cells/cubic millimeter and > 10.434 respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-709/v2?src=rss">The Relationship Between Mental Health and Periodontal Disease: Insights from NHANES Data [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data (secondary dataset) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011–2012 and NHANES 2013–2014 cycles, relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.’s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates (demographical characteristics) impacting periodontal disease were considered, and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health’s impact on periodontal disease. Results Among the 2764 Participants, more than a quarter (29.1%) were aged over 60 years, 52% were females. Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried Participants affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between Participants with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Our findings suggest trends in periodontal disease prevalence linked to mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance. However, the absence of statistically significant findings calls for caution in interpreting these relationships. We recommend that future studies further investigate these potential associations to provide a clearer understanding.

                Introduction The social media landscape has undergone radical changes and has revolutionized consumer perspectives, purchasing habits, and behaviors. Amidst this emerging trend is the rise of influencer marketing and its impact on the purchase intentions of followers. The objective is to explore the characteristics of influencers that contribute to their credibility. This research aims to explore the role of consumers’ attitude toward brands on their intention to adopt brands endorsed by influencers. Methods This cross-sectional research was undertaken among GenZ in the urban landscape of India. Data collected was analyzed using SmartPLS4 software. Findings Trust, expertise, and similarity were the significant antecedents of the formation of influencer credibility. Attractiveness did not have a significant influence on influencer credibility. A complementary partial mediation of Attitude towards a brand is observed in the association between influencer credibility and the purchase intention of followers. Attitude towards the video also had a significant positive influence on purchase intention. Conclusion The study found that Gen Z places little importance on an influencer’s attractiveness, as it has no significant impact on credibility. However, attitude toward the brand strongly influenced purchase intention and partially mediated the relationship between influencer credibility and purchase intention.

Autism is a developmental disability. Research demonstrated that children with autism benefit from early diagnosis and early intervention. Genetic factors are considered major contributors to the development of autism. Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), has been evaluated in phenotype prediction, but this method has been limited in its application to autism. We developed a DL model, the Separate Translated Autism Research Neural Network (STAR-NN) model to predict autism status. The model was trained and tested using whole exome sequencing data from 43,203 individuals (16,809 individuals with autism and 26,394 non-autistic controls). Polygenic scores from common variants and the aggregated count of rare variants on genes were used as input. In STAR-NN, protein truncating variants, possibly damaging missense variants and mild effect missense variants on the same gene were separated at the input level and merged to one gene node. In this way, rare variants with different level of pathogenic effects were treated separately. We further validated the performance of STAR-NN using an independent dataset, including 13,827 individuals with autism and 14,052 non-autistic controls. STAR-NN achieved a modest ROC-AUC of 0.7319 on the testing dataset and 0.7302 on the independent dataset. STAR-NN outperformed other traditional ML models. Gene Ontology analysis on the selected gene features showed an enrichment for potentially informative pathways including potassium ion transport.

                <p>by Linjie Luo, Li Liu, Lili She, Haoran Zhang, Nannan Zhang, Yaqin Wang, Yuting Ni, Fugui Chen, Fengying Wan, Yuqiu Dai, Guoping Zhu, Zhong Zhao</p>

Shoot stem cells, harbored in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), play key roles during post-embryonic development of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and function as the origin of plant aerial tissues. Multiple transcription factors are involved in the sophisticated transcriptional regulation of stem cell homeostasis, with the <i>WUSCHEL</i> (<i>WUS</i>)/<i>CLAVATA3</i> (<i>CLV3</i>) negative feedback loop playing a central role. WUS acts as a master regulator in maintaining stem cells through its transcriptional regulatory activity including repressive and activating abilities. Although the interaction between WUS and TOPLESS confers the repressive activity of WUS in transcriptional control, the mechanism by which WUS activates gene expression remains elusive. Here, we showed that DORNRÖSCHEN competitively interacts with WUS and disturbs the WUS homodimer, which recruits BRAHMA to activate <i>CLV3</i> expression via nucleosome depletion for maintaining the stem cell pool.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dopamine (DA) signaling is evoked by both food and drugs that humans come to abuse. Moreover, physiological state (e.g., hunger versus satiety) can modulate the response. However, there is great heterogeneity among DA neurons. Limited studies have been performed that could resolve the interaction between physiological state and drug responsivity across groups of DA neurons. Here, we measured the activity of neurons in transgenic Tg (th2:GCaMP7s) zebrafish larva that expresses a calcium indicator (GCaMP7s) in A11 (posterior tuberculum) and a part of A14 (caudal hypothalamus and intermediate hypothalamus) DA populations located in the hypothalamus of the larval zebrafish. Fish were recorded in one of two physiological states: ad-libitum fed (AL) and food deprived (FD) and before and after acute exposure to different doses of the stimulant drug amphetamine (0, 0.7, and 1.5 μM). We quantified fluorescence change, activity duration, peak rise/fall time, and latency in the calcium spikes of the DA neurons. Our results show that baseline DA neuron activity amplitude, spike duration, and correlation between inter- and intra-DA neurons were higher in the FD than in the AL state. Dose-dependent AMPH treatment further increased the intensity of these parameters in the neuron spikes but only in the FD state. The DA activity correlation relatively increased in AL state post-AMPH treatment. Given that hunger increases drug reactivity and the probability of relapse to drug seeking, the results support populations of DA neurons as potential critical mediators of the interaction between physiological state and drug reinforcement.</p>

                Background Projects enable the resolution of problems and alter societal realities, assuming they represent the optimal choices to modify living conditions positively. If projects are deemed intelligent solutions to problems, why do they fail? This question will be addressed in this article through bibliometric analysis. Methods A bibliometric analysis was conducted on the success or failure factors influencing social investment projects, through a descriptive study with search equations, utilizing a comparative matrix to analyze 32 articles from Scopus and 22 from Web of Science. Results As a result, the number of publications, the themes addressed, and their origins between 2018 and 2023 were identified. The VOSviewer software allowed for identifying keywords and their relationships; with this input, a review of scientific production was conducted to subsequently identify the factors influencing projects and how they have been addressed within their contexts. Conclusions In conclusion, it was found that both the factors influencing success or failure in projects are permeated by the environment and the impact of political, social, and economic factors, in addition to the interaction of elements related to soft and hard skills.

                Endometriosis is a common chronic non curable neuro-inflammatory condition, which can cause endometriosis-related pelvic pain (ERPP). Sufferers may struggle with side effects and/or risks from conventional medical and surgical treatments, or not get pain relief. Increasing numbers of endometriosis patients wish to explore holistic management with fewer side effects, however it is important that medical professionals maintain an evidence-based practice for recommended treatments. We present up-to-date evidence of holistic strategies used for managing ERPP including nutrition, body and mind therapies, acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the use of adjunct devices such as phallus length reducers and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Recent findings: Nutrition: Gluten-free, low-nickel and high intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids diets improve ERPP. Low FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols), plant-based diet and antioxidant vitamin supplementation is helpful including those with concurrent irritable bowel syndrome. Body and Mind: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is beneficial in postoperative pain reduction, whilst mindfulness has been shown to reduce pain scores and dyschezia. Progressive muscle relaxation therapy and regular yoga sessions improve ERPP and Quality of life. Acupuncture: Acupuncture and moxibustion show improved pain scores compared to conventional therapies alone. Adjunct devices: TENS improves deep dyspareunia and reduces the number of days pain is experienced. Summary: Holistic management strategies for ERPP should be incorporated into routine counselling when discussing conservative, medical and or surgical treatments for endometriosis. The growing evidence presented for the use of holistic management strategies gives hope to those patients who cannot have, or don’t respond to conventional approaches and as an adjunct alongside standard treatments. These findings should be incorporated into the routine counselling when seeing patients in the gynaecology outpatient setting presenting with chronic pelvic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1147/v2?src=rss">Psychological well-being of travellers on long-distance shipping voyages: A systematic review protocol [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The psychosocial well-being of every individual is as important as the well-being of long-distance voyages, especially that they have to spend longer hours and days travelling to their destinations with all the experiences of adventure and adversities characterizing the journey. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the psychosocial well-being of long-distance seafarers on board shipping vessels to gain an understanding of their psychological and social well-being with the objective of ameliorating the adversities associated with these travels. A systematic review will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (2020) statement. The databases to be searched for the data will be limited to Scopus, Web of Science, and Advanced Google Scholar using keywords selected by the reviewers. Meta-analysis, narrative synthesis, or both will be used depending on the extent of heterogeneity across eligible observational studies included in the review. Some specific countries will be selected for data extraction, and only data published in English will be included. It is expected that the findings from this review will bring to bear if these categories of seafarers are prone to risks that affect their psychosocial wellbeing and if so discovered. This protocol was registered with the PROSPERO. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024517277(08/03/2024)

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1341/v1?src=rss">Describing and optimising travel distances in amateur football and handball in Germany [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Humanity faces dual existential crises of biodiversity loss and global warming. Acknowledging the environmental impact of sports, the United Nations is calling on the sports sector to take the lead in fighting climate change and adopting climate-neutral practices. Research on the greenhouse gas emissions of amateur league play is evolving but to date there are few studies that have described the travel patterns for large samples of teams and explored ways to reduce travel. Methods Travel distances for the 2022/23 season were calculated for 339 amateur football and handball teams playing in different leagues in Bavaria. The program Gurobi was utilised to optimise the grouping of teams in order to reduce travel by car. Results The study showed that playing in a higher amateur league most often resulted in longer travel distances for both women’s and men’s sports. Some amateur teams had to travel up to 2,958 kilometres for one season of play. All 339 teams combined travelled a total of 474,231 km (1398.9 per team in average) for away matches in the 2022/23 season of play. Optimising the groups in which teams play can reduce total travel distances by up to 19.7% while keeping the number of games played constant. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel distances in amateur football and handball, despite being shorter than those of professional teams, contribute significantly to carbon emissions. Due to the greater number of amateur teams and the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is crucial to explore ways of reducing travel in amateur sports. This touches on ethical issues regarding how much travel that causes greenhouse gas emissions is justified in amateur play. Algorithm based optimisation of which teams play against each other appears to be a straightforward, cost-effective, and scalable method for reducing travel emissions in amateur sports.

                Objective The shift to online learning during COVID-19 led to increased musculoskeletal discomforts and impacted students’ quality of life. Neck pain (NP), once a minor issue, has become more prevalent due to prolonged electronic device use in new learning methods. This study aims to measure the prevalence of NP among University of Sharjah (UOS) students during the COVID-19 online learning period and to investigate the factors that provoked it. Methods This study focused on young adult students aged 17-26 and did not consider gender or athletic status due to the university’s demographics and pandemic restrictions. Demographic data, Neck Disability Index (NDI) assessments, and pain management information were gathered and analyzed using SPSS 24 through univariate and bivariate methods. Results The prevalence of NP during COVID-19, among 325 UOS students was found to be 62.7%, 64.41% of which had NP at the time of doing the survey. NDI scores were found to be skewed. The median was 16% which indicates mild NP while the interquartile range was 19.11. Most participants reported experiencing posterior neck pain (38.77%), primarily attributed to prolonged sitting (81.23%). Factors such as lifting, personal care, and emotional well-being were found to have a significant impact on NDI. Participants who did not seek medical attention exhibited significantly higher levels of neck pain disability, as measured by the NDI. The median NDI score for this group was 20, with an interquartile range of 16.89 while, those who sought medical attention had a higher median NDI score of 34 with interquartile range of 22. Conclusion This study highlights the prevalence of neck pain among UOS students, emphasizing the need for postural improvements and further research on prevention strategies in the UAE.

                Passive acoustic monitoring of soundscapes and biodiversity produces vast amounts of audio recordings, but the management and analyses of these raw data present technical challenges. A multitude of software solutions exist, but none can fulfil all purposes required for the management, processing, navigation, and analysis of acoustic data. The field of ecoacoustics needs a software tool that is free, evolving, and accessible. We take a step in that direction and present ecoSound-web: an open-source, online platform for ecoacoustics designed and built by ecologists and software engineers. ecoSound-web can be used for storing, re-sampling, organising, analysing, and sharing soundscape recording or metadata projects. Specifically, it allows manual annotation of soniferous animals and soundscape components, automatic annotation with deep-learning models for all birds and for UK bat species, peer-reviewing annotations, analysing audio in time and frequency dimensions, computing alpha acoustic indices, and providing reference sound libraries for different taxa. We present ecoSound-web’s structure and features, and describe its operation for typical use cases such as sampling bird and bat communities, using a primate call library, and the analysis of soundscape components and acoustic indices. ecoSound-web is available from: https://github.com/ecomontec/ecoSound-web

                Background Nanoparticles (NPs) hold promise as alternatives to antibiotics in the fight against multi-drug-resistant bacteria. However, concerns about their cytotoxicity, particularly their effects on mammalian cells, must be thoroughly addressed to ensure therapeutic safety. Amphiphilic Janus NPs, which have segregated hydrophobic and polycationic ligands on two hemispheres, have previously been shown to exhibit potent antibacterial activity. Methods In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of amphiphilic Janus NPs in immune and cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity assays were performed to assess the effects of Janus NPs on cell viability and membrane integrity, with a particular focus on how internalization of the nanoparticles influenced cellular responses. Results The results revealed that both immune and cancer cells exhibited negligible cytotoxic effects when exposed to Janus NPs. However, phagocytic immune cells demonstrated greater susceptibility to membrane damage and viability loss, suggesting that internalization plays a significant role in nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity. Conclusions Amphiphilic Janus NPs show great potential as highly effective antibacterial agents with minimal cytotoxicity. While immune cells may be more vulnerable to nanoparticle-induced damage due to their internalization capacity, these findings support the further investigation of Janus NPs for clinical applications.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/be1653dc-bbd1-48e2-8d2e-5ceb484bae3c/ana27124-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="Enhancement of Glutamate Uptake as Novel Antiseizure Approach: Preclinical Proof of Concept"/>
<p>Allosteric activation of glutamate uptake as novel antiseizure approach.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excitotoxicity is a common hallmark of epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Thus, here, we studied the protective effects of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b>, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of glutamate uptake in epilepsy models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> was evaluated in a range of acute and chronic seizure models, while its adverse effect profile was assessed in a panel of standard tests in rodents. The effect of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on glutamate uptake was assessed in COS-7 cells expressing the transporter. WAY 213613, a selective competitive EAAT2 inhibitor, was used to probe the reversal of the enhanced glutamate uptake in the same transporter expression system. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses were used to study a potential influence of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on GLT-1 expression in mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> showed robust protection in a panel of animal models of seizures and epilepsy, including the maximal electroshock- and 6 Hz-induced seizures, corneal kindling, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindling, as well as seizures induced by pilocarpine or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Importantly, <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> displayed a favorable adverse effect profile in the rotarod, the minimal motor impairment, and the Irwin tests. <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> enhanced glutamate uptake in vitro and this effect was abolished by WAY 213613, while no influence on GLT-1 expression in vivo was observed after repeated treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, our results show that <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> has favorable tolerability and provides robust preclinical efficacy against seizures. Thus, allosteric enhancement of EAAT2 function could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity.

                Cortical responses to stimuli vary depending on context and expectation. Adding insight into this process, Furutachi et al. recently demonstrated that higher-order thalamic input to visual cortex cooperates with interneurons to augment responses to unexpected stimuli, consistent with a body of literature implicating top-down modulation and local inhibition in predictive processing.

                Rab11-Rab8 cascade is important in primary ciliogenesis, acute lumen formation, neurite outgrowth, and so forth. Saha et al. demonstrate, by advanced fluorescence imaging, that the Rab11-Rab8 cascade mediated by Rabin8 functions by a membrane conversion mechanism and uncover that this cascade is important for Rab8 association with membrane tubules.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101652">Bilateral regulation of EGFR activity and local PI(4,5)P2 dynamics in mammalian cells observed with superresolution microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Anionic lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood, as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR. Here, we visualized both EGFR and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy. The EGFR and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ, the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Artificial reduction in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. Thus, EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98366">Unveiling the influence of tumor and immune signatures on immune checkpoint therapy in advanced lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the variability among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in their responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Recognizing that patients with advanced-stage NSCLC rarely qualify for surgical interventions, it becomes crucial to identify biomarkers that influence responses to ICI therapy. We conducted an analysis of single-cell transcriptomes from 33 lung cancer biopsy samples, with a particular focus on 14 core samples taken before the initiation of palliative ICI treatment. Our objective was to link tumor and immune cell profiles with patient responses to ICI. We discovered that ICI non-responders exhibited a higher presence of CD4+ regulatory T cells, resident memory T cells, and TH17 cells. This contrasts with the diverse activated CD8+ T cells found in responders. Furthermore, tumor cells in non-responders frequently showed heightened transcriptional activity in the NF-kB and STAT3 pathways, suggesting a potential inherent resistance to ICI therapy. Through the integration of immune cell profiles and tumor molecular signatures, we achieved an discriminative power (area under the curve [AUC]) exceeding 95% in identifying patient responses to ICI treatment. These results underscore the crucial importance of the interplay between tumor and immune microenvironment, including within metastatic sites, in affecting the effectiveness of ICIs in NSCLC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99000">Heparan sulphate binding controls in vivo half-life of the HpARI protein family</a></h4>

              
                The parasitic nematode <i>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</i> secretes the HpARI family, which bind to IL-33, either suppressing (HpARI1 and HpARI2) or enhancing (HpARI3) responses to the cytokine. We previously showed that HpARI2 also bound to DNA via its first complement control protein (CCP1) domain. Here, we find that HpARI1 can also bind DNA, while HpARI3 cannot. Through the production of HpARI2/HpARI3 CCP1 domain-swapped chimeras, DNA-binding ability can be transferred, and correlates with in vivo half-life of administered proteins. We found that HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) also binds to the extracellular matrix component heparan sulphate (HS), and structural modelling showed a basic charged patch in the CCP1 domain of HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) which could facilitate these interactions. Finally, a mutant of HpARI2 was produced which lacked DNA and HS binding, and was also shown to have a short half-life in vivo. Therefore, we propose that during infection the suppressive HpARI1 and HpARI2 proteins have long-lasting effects at the site of deposition due to DNA and/or extracellular matrix interactions, while HpARI3 has a shorter half-life due to a lack of these interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87668">Foxtrot migration and dynamic over-wintering range of an Arctic raptor</a></h4>

              
                Advances in tracking technologies have revealed the diverse migration patterns of birds, which are critical for range mapping and population estimation. Population trends are usually estimated in breeding ranges where birds remain stationary, but for species that breed in remote areas like the Arctic, these trends are often assessed in over-wintering ranges. Assessing population trends during the wintering season is challenging due to the extensive movements of birds in these ranges, which requires a deep understanding of the movement dynamics. However, these movements remain understudied, particularly in the mid-latitudes, where many Arctic breeders overwinter, increasing uncertainty in their ranges and numbers. Here, we show that the Arctic breeding raptor Rough-legged buzzard, which overwinters in the mid-latitudes, has a specific wintering strategy. After migrating ca. 1500 km from the Arctic to mid-latitudes, the birds continue to move throughout the entire over-wintering period, traveling another 1000 km southwest and then back northeast as the snowline advances. This continuous movement makes their wintering range dynamic throughout the season. In essence, this movement represents an extension of the quick migration process, albeit at a slower pace, and we have termed this migration pattern ‘foxtrot migration’, drawing an analogy to the alternating fast and slow movements of the foxtrot dance. These results highlight the potential errors in range mapping from single mid-winter surveys and emphasize the importance of this migration pattern in assessing the conservation status of bird species. Understanding this migration pattern could help to correctly estimate bird populations in over-wintering ranges, which is especially important for species that nest in hard-to-reach regions such as the Arctic.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90695">Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia integrate into mouse retina and recapitulate features of endogenous microglia</a></h4>

              
                Microglia exhibit both maladaptive and adaptive roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and have emerged as a cellular target for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including those affecting the retina. Replacing maladaptive microglia, such as those impacted by aging or over-activation, with exogenous microglia that can enable adaptive functions has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate microglia replacement as an approach for retinal diseases, we first employed a protocol to efficiently generate human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia in quantities sufficient for in vivo transplantation. These cells demonstrated expression of microglia-enriched genes and showed typical microglial functions such as LPS-induced responses and phagocytosis. We then performed xenotransplantation of these hiPSC-derived microglia into the subretinal space of adult mice whose endogenous retinal microglia have been pharmacologically depleted. Long-term analysis post-transplantation demonstrated that transplanted hiPSC-derived microglia successfully integrated into the neuroretina as ramified cells, occupying positions previously filled by the endogenous microglia and expressed microglia homeostatic markers such as P2ry12 and Tmem119. Furthermore, these cells were found juxtaposed alongside residual endogenous murine microglia for up to 8 months in the retina, indicating their ability to establish a stable homeostatic state in vivo. Following retinal pigment epithelial cell injury, transplanted microglia demonstrated responses typical of endogenous microglia, including migration, proliferation, and phagocytosis. Our findings indicate the feasibility of microglial transplantation and integration in the retina and suggest that modulating microglia through replacement may be a therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative retinal diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97033">Visualization of endogenous G proteins on endosomes and other organelles</a></h4>

              
                Classical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling takes place in response to extracellular stimuli and involves receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins located at the plasma membrane. It has recently been established that GPCR signaling can also take place from intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes that contain internalized receptors and ligands. While the mechanisms of GPCR endocytosis are well understood, it is not clear how well internalized receptors are supplied with G proteins. To address this gap, we use gene editing, confocal microscopy, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer to study the distribution and trafficking of endogenous G proteins. We show here that constitutive endocytosis is sufficient to supply newly internalized endocytic vesicles with 20–30% of the G protein density found at the plasma membrane. We find that G proteins are present on early, late, and recycling endosomes, are abundant on lysosomes, but are virtually undetectable on the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the medial-trans Golgi apparatus. Receptor activation does not change heterotrimer abundance on endosomes. Our findings provide a subcellular map of endogenous G protein distribution, suggest that G proteins may be partially excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles, and are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes and other intracellular compartments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97298">Neuropeptide Bursicon and its receptor-mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form of Cacopsylla chinensis</a></h4>

              
                Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. <i>Cacopsylla chinensis</i> exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor <i>CcTRPM</i> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <i>C. chinensis</i> by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <i>C. chinensis</i>. Firstly, we identified <i>CcBurs-α</i> and <i>CcBurs-β</i> as two typical subunits of Bursicon in <i>C. chinensis</i>, which were regulated by low temperature (10 °C) and <i>CcTRPM</i>. Subsequently, <i>CcBurs-α</i> and <i>CcBurs-β</i> formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>CcBurs-R</i> acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets <i>CcBurs-R</i>, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of <i>C. chinensis</i>. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89815">Archaic introgression contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and cardiovascular traits in human high-altitude populations from the Himalayas</a></h4>

              
                It is well established that several <i>Homo sapiens</i> populations experienced admixture with extinct human species during their evolutionary history. Sometimes, such a gene flow could have played a role in modulating their capability to cope with a variety of selective pressures, thus resulting in archaic adaptive introgression events. A paradigmatic example of this evolutionary mechanism is offered by the <i>EPAS1</i> gene, whose most frequent haplotype in Himalayan highlanders was proved to reduce their susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness and to be introduced in the gene pool of their ancestors by admixture with Denisovans. In this study, we aimed at further expanding the investigation of the impact of archaic introgression on more complex adaptive responses to hypobaric hypoxia evolved by populations of Tibetan/Sherpa ancestry, which have been plausibly mediated by soft selective sweeps and/or polygenic adaptations rather than by hard selective sweeps. For this purpose, we used a combination of composite-likelihood and gene network-based methods to detect adaptive loci in introgressed chromosomal segments from Tibetan WGS data and to shortlist those presenting Denisovan-like derived alleles that participate to the same functional pathways and are absent in populations of African ancestry, which are supposed to do not have experienced Denisovan admixture. According to this approach, we identified multiple genes putatively involved in archaic introgression events and that, especially as regards <i>TBC1D1</i>, <i>RASGRF2</i>, <i>PRKAG2</i>, and <i>KRAS</i>, have plausibly contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and of certain cardiovascular traits in high-altitude Himalayan peoples. These findings provided unprecedented evidence about the complexity of the adaptive phenotype evolved by these human groups to cope with challenges imposed by hypobaric hypoxia, offering new insights into the tangled interplay of genetic determinants that mediates the physiological adjustments crucial for human adaptation to the high-altitude environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101221">FABP4-mediated lipid accumulation and lipolysis in tumor-associated macrophages promote breast cancer metastasis</a></h4>

              
                A high density of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is associated with poorer prognosis and survival in breast cancer patients. Recent studies have shown that lipid accumulation in TAMs can promote tumor growth and metastasis in various models. However, the specific molecular mechanisms that drive lipid accumulation and tumor progression in TAMs remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), unlike saturated ones, are more likely to form lipid droplets in murine macrophages. Specifically, unsaturated FAs, including linoleic acids (LA), activate the FABP4/CEBPα pathway, leading to triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet formation. Furthermore, FABP4 enhances lipolysis and FA utilization by breast cancer cell lines, which promotes cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Notably, a deficiency of FABP4 in murine macrophages significantly reduces LA-induced lipid metabolism. Therefore, our findings suggest FABP4 as a crucial lipid messenger that facilitates unsaturated FA-mediated lipid accumulation and lipolysis in TAMs, thus contributing to the metastasis of breast cancer.

">Cerebellar-Prefrontal Connectivity Predicts Negative Symptom Severity Across the Psychosis Spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Background: Negative symptom severity predicts functional outcome and quality life in people with psychosis. However, negative symptoms are poorly responsive to antipsychotic medication and existing literature has not converged on their neurobiological basis. Previous work in small schizophrenia samples has observed that lower cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity is associated with higher negative symptom severity and demonstrated in a separate neuromodulation experiment that increasing cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity reduced negative symptom severity. We sought to expand this finding to test associations between cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity with negative symptom severity and cognitive performance in a large, transdiagnostic sample of individuals with psychotic disorders. Methods: In this study, 260 individuals with psychotic disorders underwent resting-state MRI and clinical characterization. Negative symptom severity was measured using the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale, and cognitive performance was assessed with the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry. Using a previously identified cerebellar region as a seed, we performed seed to whole brain analyses and regressed connectivity against negative symptom severity, using age and sex as covariates. Results: Consistent with prior work, we identified relationships between higher cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity and lower negative symptom severity (r=-0.17, p=.007). Higher cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity was also associated with better delayed verbal learning (r=.13, p=.034). Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence supporting the relationship between cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity and negative symptom severity and cognitive performance. Larger, randomized, sham-controlled neuromodulation studies should test if increasing cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity leads to reductions in negative symptoms in psychosis.

">Sudden sensory events trigger modality-independent responses across layers in the mouse neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Sudden sensory events trigger widespread electrocortical responses and noticeable changes in an animal's behavior. It remains unclear, though, how this "surprise" signal is generated via afferent sensory input and represented by neuronal ensembles. Using in vivo electrophysiology, here we recorded the activity of different cortical areas across layers in awake head-fixed mice, while presenting sensory stimuli of different modalities and saliencies. When brief, salient stimuli were delivered at long intervals, we found prominent responses across cortical areas regardless of the stimulus modalities, resembling those observed in human electroencephalography. These responses were larger and emerged earlier in the infragranular layer than in the granular layer of the primary sensory cortex. At short inter-stimulus intervals, in contrast, only modality-specific responses were observed in the corresponding primary sensory cortex. These results indicate that sensory information travels through multiple ascending pathways, in particular, supra-modal surprise signals via non-classical sensory pathways to the cortex.

">Mental Tasks Induce Common Modulations of Oscillations in Cortex and Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                We investigated whether the same modulations in spinal motor neurons parallel power modulations of cortical oscillations induced by mental tasks. We recruited 15 participants and recorded high-density electromyography signals (HD-EMG) from the tibialis anterior muscle, as well as electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The cumulative spike train (CST) was computed from the activity of spinal motor neurons decoded from HD-EMG signals. The participants performed sustained dorsiflexion concurrent with foot motor imagery, hand motor imagery, mental arithmetic, or no specific mental task. We found significant power correlations between CST and EEG across trials irrespective of the mental task and across mental tasks at the intra-muscular coherence peak ({tau}_trial = 0.08 {+/-} 0.10, {tau}_task = 0.33 {+/-} 0.19, respectively; mean {+/-} std. dev.). CST power in beta and low-gamma bands could provide a novel control signal for neural interface applications, as power changes in these bands are not translated into actual force changes. To evaluate the potential of CST bands as a control signal, we classified the mental tasks from CST bandpower with a linear classifier and obtained classification accuracies slightly but significantly above chance level (30% {+/-} 5%; chance level = 25%). These results show for the first time that mental tasks can modulate the power of cortical and spinal oscillations concurrently. This supports the notion that movement-unrelated oscillations can leak down from the cortex to the spinal level. We further show that mental tasks can be classified from CST, although further research is necessary to boost the classification performance to an adequate level for neural interface applications.

">Pathological tau alters head direction signaling and induces spatial disorientation</a></h4>

              
                Disorientation is an early symptom of dementia, suggesting impairments in neural circuits responsible for head direction signaling. The anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADn) exhibits early and selective vulnerability to pathological misfolded forms of tau (ptau), a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and ageing. The ADn contains a high density of head direction (HD) cells; their disruption may contribute to spatial disorientation. To test this, we virally expressed human tau in the ADn of adult mice. HD-ptau mice were defined by ptau+ cells in the ADn and ptau+ axon terminals in postsynaptic target regions. Despite being able to learn spatial memory tasks, HD-ptau mice exhibited increased looping behavior during spatial learning and made a greater number of head turns during memory recall, consistent with disorientation. Using in vivo extracellular recordings, we identified ptau-expressing ADn cells and found that ADn cells from HD-ptau mice had reduced directionality and altered burst firing. These data suggest that ptau alters HD signaling, leading to impairments in spatial orientation.

                Brain activity at a resting state and functional connectivity represent individuals' neural configurations that can be used to predict various performance and trait measures. Yet, most of the previous empirical demonstrations of this phenomena are limited to using resting-state neuroimaging to predict a single task performance/trait measure, and a few studies that predicted multiple task performance/traits measures employed conceptually similar tasks to produce converging evidence for their topic of investigation. In the current paper, we applied RID-Rihazcek phase synchrony, a nonlinear time-frequency-based method for neural computation, to resting-state EEG data and simultaneously predicted a wide variety of measures: standard shooting task performance and novel verbal communication-based team shooting task performance in a simulator, visuo-spatial tracking task performance (Neurotracker), executive function (verbal fluency task), fluid and crystalized Intelligence (Multidimensional Aptitude Battery II: MAB-II), and neurocognitive functioning (Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics-4: ANAM-4) with the average R2 = .60. Our findings show great promise for RID-Rihazcek phase synchrony and resting-state EEG in general to be used in aptitude assessment.

">Convolutional neural network models describe the encoding subspace of local circuits in auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Auditory cortex encodes information about nonlinear combinations of spectro-temporal sound features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide an architecture for generalizable encoding models that can predict time-varying neural activity evoked by natural sounds with substantially greater accuracy than established models. However, the complexity of CNNs makes it difficult to discern the computational properties that support their improved performance. To address this limitation, we developed a method to visualize the tuning subspace captured by a CNN. Single-unit data was recorded using high channel-count microelectrode arrays from primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake, passively listening ferrets during presentation of a large natural sound set. A CNN was fit to the data, replicating approaches from previous work. To measure the tuning subspace, the dynamic spectrotemporal receptive field (dSTRF) was measured as the locally linear filter approximating the input-output relationship of the CNN at each stimulus timepoint. Principal component analysis was then used to reduce this very large set of filters to a smaller subspace, typically requiring 2-10 filters to account for 90% of dSTRF variance. The stimulus was projected into the subspace for each neuron, and a new model was fit using only the projected values. The subspace model was able to predict time-varying spike rate nearly as accurately as the full CNN. Sensory responses could be plotted in the subspace, providing a compact model visualization. This analysis revealed a diversity of nonlinear responses, consistent with contrast gain control and emergent invariance to spectrotemporal modulation phase. Within local populations, neurons formed a sparse representation by tiling the tuning subspace. Narrow spiking, putative inhibitory neurons showed distinct patterns of tuning that may reflect their position in the cortical circuit. These results demonstrate a conceptual link between CNN and subspace models and establish a framework for interpretation of deep learning-based models.

                Axonal spheroids are hallmark features of neurodegeneration, forming along degenerating axons and contributing to disease progression. Despite their ubiquity across degenerative etiologies, the dynamics of spheroid disappearance, as well as their interactions with glial cells, remain poorly understood. Here, using an in vivo zebrafish model of peripheral nerve injury, we identified several patterns of spheroid disappearance that are regulated by Schwann cells. These results describe spheroid dynamics across their lifetimes, establish a role for the extra-axonal environment in altering spheroid outcomes, and identify a cellular mechanism whereby spheroid fates are altered.

">Cortical contributions to attentional orienting and response cancellation in action stopping</a></h4>

              
                Action cancellation involves the termination of planned or initiated movement. Contemporary models of action cancellation, such as the Pause-then-Cancel model, propose that this occurs via a two-stage process, initiated in the cortex by the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Previous experimental work using electromyography (EMG) has identified that the cancellation of actions can involve the partial activation of the responding muscles, which does not result in an overt behavioural response. In this study, we used functional near-infrared spectroscropy (fNIRS) to investigate the neural correlates of these partial responses in a modified stopping task (a response- and stimulus-selective stop-signal task). We controlled for the attentional effects that have long confounded action cancellation research by comparing responses to stop stimuli with those to ignore stimuli. We identified stopping-related activity in the preSMA but not the IFG, consistent with predictions of the Pause-then-Cancel model. Additionally, we observed increased preSMA activity in trials where no partial responses occurred, potentially due to the cumulative effect of different inhibitory processes in those trials. This study highlights the utility of combining fNIRS and EMG in examining the cortical correlates and dynamic processes involved in action cancellation.

                Adolescence is a critical period in human development, marked by rapid changes in brain structure and function, influenced, in part, by sex steroids. During adolescence, females may initiate the use of hormonal contraception, which suppresses ovarian production of estradiol and progesterone. Here, we examined the impact of hormonal contraceptive use on adolescent brain structures using magnetic resonance imaging data from 1,234 individuals from the ABCD Study (average age = 14 years). We investigated differences in cortical thickness, surface area, and volume in hormonal contraceptive-users compared to non-users. Statistically significant differences were observed in several regions, and differences in cortical thickness of the paracentral gyrus survived familywise error correction. Estradiol, testosterone and DHEA levels negatively correlated with cortical thickness, surface area, and volume across both hormonal contraceptive-users and non-users only at an uncorrected threshold. These findings highlight the need to further study longitudinal effects of hormonal contraceptives and endogenous hormone changes on brain development in the ABCD Study and related datasets as these data become available.

                Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of microtubules (MTs) endow them with specific properties that are essential for key cellular functions, such as axonal transport. Polyglutamylation, a PTM that accumulates in long-lived MTs, has been linked to neurodegeneration in the cerebellum when in excess. While hyperglutamylation of MTs leads to neurodegeneration and disrupts the function of specific neuronal subtypes like Purkinje cells, cortical neurons, and hippocampal excitatory neurons, little is known about its impact on inhibitory interneurons and their functional integration into local networks. In this study, we generated a conditional knockout mouse model to deplete cytosolic carboxypeptidase 1 (Ccp1) in GABAergic neurons, a key MT deglutamylase expressed by hippocampal interneurons. Our findings reveal that the loss of Ccp1 has a profound effect on hippocampal parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons, impairing their axonal transport and reducing their perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal cells (PCs) in the CA2 region of the hippocampus.

Here, we propose an automated cell detection algorithm that accounts for and subtracts the inhomogeneous background by avoiding high-intensity pixels in the blur filtering calculation. Cells were detected by intensity thresholding in the background-subtracted image, and the algorithm's performance was tested on NeuN- and c-Fos-stained images in the mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus. In addition, applications in c-Fos positive cell counting and the quantification for the expression level in double-labeled cells were demonstrated. Our method of automated detection after background assumption (ADABA) offers the advantage of high-throughput and unbiased analysis in regions with complex biological structures that produce inhomogeneous background.

">Perineuronal nets on CA2 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-expressing cells differentially regulate hippocampal dependent memory</a></h4>

              
                Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are a specialized extracellular matrix that surround certain populations of neurons, including (inhibitory) parvalbumin (PV) expressing-interneurons throughout the brain and (excitatory) CA2 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus. PNNs are thought to regulate synaptic plasticity by stabilizing synapses and as such, could regulate learning and memory. Most often, PNN functions are queried using enzymatic degradation with chondroitinase, but that approach does not differentiate PNNs on CA2 neurons from those on adjacent PV cells. To disentangle the specific roles of PNNs on CA2 pyramidal cells and PV neurons in behavior, we generated conditional knockout mouse strains with the primary protein component of PNNs, aggrecan (Acan), deleted from either CA2 pyramidal cells (Amigo2 Acan KO) or from PV cells (PV Acan KO). Male and female animals of each strain were tested for social, fear, and spatial memory, as well as for reversal learning. We found that Amigo2 Acan KO animals, but not PV Acan KO animals, had impaired social memory and reversal learning. PV Acan KOs, but not Amigo2 Acan KOs had impaired contextual fear memory. These findings demonstrate independent roles for PNNs on each cell type in regulating hippocampal-dependent memory. We further investigated a potential mechanism of impaired social memory in the Amigo2 Acan KO animals and found reduced input to CA2 from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM), which signals social novelty. Additionally, Amigo2 Acan KOs lacked a social novelty-related local field potential response, suggesting that CA2 PNNs may coordinate functional SuM connections and associated physiological responses to social novelty.

">BLAKOR inputs to the BNST regulate social stress-escalated alcohol consumption</a></h4>

              
                Background: Aversive social experiences can lead to escalated drug consumption and increase the risk of relapse to drug seeking. Individuals who consume alcohol to alleviate the effects of social stress are more likely to develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Repeated social defeat stress (SDS) enhances the rewarding and reinforcing effects of alcohol. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie social stress-escalated alcohol drinking are not well understood. Here we explored the role of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (Dyn/KOR) system in regulating social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Methods: Male and female mice were subjected to repeated SDS for 10 days following which they were left undisturbed in their home cages. They were then subject to intermittent access (IA) two-bottle choice alcohol consumption procedure. The effects of systemic and BNST-specific KOR antagonism using the selective KOR antagonist NorBNI on stress-escalated drinking were evaluated. Using chemogenetic approaches in Oprk1-Cre mice, we examined the role of KOR expressing cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLAKORs) and BLAKOR-BNST pathway in social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Results: Repeated SDS increased alcohol consumption and preference in both males and females. Systemic KOR antagonism attenuated SDS- escalated alcohol consumption in both males and females. BNST -specific KOR antagonism also attenuated stress-escalated drinking in males. Finally, selective chemogenetic activation of BLAKORs and BKAKOR-BNST pathway attenuated social stress-escalated alcohol consumption in both sexes. Conclusion: Our results suggest a significant role for BLAKOR projections to the BNST in regulating social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Our results provide further evidence that the Dyn/KOR system maybe a viable target for medications development to treat comorbid stress and AUD.

">Paired and solitary ionocytes in the zebrafish olfactory epithelium</a></h4>

              
                The sense of smell is generated by electrical currents that are influenced by the concentration of ions in olfactory sensory neurons and mucus. In contrast to the extensive morphological and molecular characterization of sensory neurons, there has been little description of the cells that control ion concentrations in the zebrafish olfactory system. Here, we report the molecular and ultrastructural characterization of zebrafish olfactory ionocytes. Transcriptome analysis suggests that the zebrafish olfactory epithelium contains at least three different ionocyte types, which resemble Na+/K+-ATPase-rich (NaR), Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC), and H+-ATPase-rich (HR) cells, responsible for calcium, chloride, and pH regulation, respectively, in the zebrafish skin. NaR-like and HR-like ionocytes are usually adjacent to one another, whereas NCC-like cells are usually solitary. The distinct subtypes are differentially distributed: NaR-like/HR-like cell pairs are found broadly within the olfactory epithelium, whereas NCC-like cells reside within the peripheral non-sensory multiciliated cell zone. Comparison of gene expression and serial-section electron microscopy analysis indicates that the NaR-like cells wrap around the HR-like cells and are connected to them by shallow tight junctions. The development of olfactory ionocyte subtypes is also differentially regulated, as pharmacological Notch inhibition leads to a loss of NaR-like and HR-like cells, but does not affect NCC-like ionocyte number. These results provide a molecular and anatomical characterization of olfactory ionocytes in a stenohaline freshwater teleost. The paired ionocytes suggest that both transcellular and paracellular transport regulate ion concentrations in the olfactory epithelium, while the solitary ionocytes may enable independent regulation of multiciliated cells.

">Adducins regulate morphology and fate of neural progenitors during neocortical neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian neocortex is mediated by an increase in the proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells. However, the molecular machinery controlling the proliferation of apical and basal progenitors during neocortical development is still poorly understood. Here we show that the three actin-associated morpho-regulatory adducins (ADD1-3), underlie the abundance of basal progenitors in developing mouse and ferret neocortex in vivo and in human cortical organoids. Over expression of adducins in embryonic mouse neocortex increases the number of protrusions of basal progenitors, leading to an increase in their proliferative capacity and neuronal output. Conversely, knock-out of ADD1 in human cortical organoids, which also leads to down-regulation of other adducins, results in reduced proliferation of progenitors and aberrant neurogenesis. Hence, we show that adducins underlie the proliferation and fate of neural progenitors, which are key cellular features underlying the progression of mammalian neurogenesis.

	<p>The vestibular function is in synergism with the oculomotor vergence. Vertigo may be related to vergence disorders and conversely, vestibular pathologies may affect vergence. To consolidate this hypothesis, we conducted a study at the vestibular orthoptic clinic of the Bastogne Hospital. Fourteen patients with vertigo history appearing 2 weeks to 8 years ago, aged 30 to 65 years were studied; at the moment of the eye movement study, no patient had acute attack of vertigo. The origin of vertigo varied (Meniere&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, organic pathology, sensitivity to visual movement). An assessment with objective measurement of vergence (single-step protocol) was carried out with the REMOBI technology coupled with binocular video-oculography in sitting and standing positions. Four neuro-rehabilitation sessions of vergence eye movements were performed with the double-step in-depth protocol, alternating sitting and standing positions to involve different postural and vestibular functions. An assessment of vergence was done again 1 to 2 months later. The initial assessment revealed problems of magnitude and/or speed or variability of vergence for 11 of the patients relative to controls (published by the group in previous studies). After neuro-rehabilitation, an improvement was observed in eight patients. Patients reported a clear improvement of their self confidence in moving in the space. Posture measures done before rehabilitation comparing eyes fixating or closed or while making near&amp;amp;ndash;far vergence eye movements indicated lower medio-lateral acceleration when doing vergence eye movements in patients with vertigo history of functional origin. The results are in favor of the hypothesis of a symbiosis between vergence and vestibular function and the interest of diagnosis and rehabilitation of the vergence disorder in patients with vertigo history in the absence of acute vertigo attack.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Musical pleasure is considered to be induced by prediction errors (surprise), as suggested in neuroimaging studies. However, the role of temporal changes in musical features in reward processing remains unclear. Utilizing the Information Dynamics of Music (IDyOM) model, a statistical model that calculates musical surprise based on prediction errors in melody and harmony, we investigated whether brain activities associated with musical pleasure, particularly in the &amp;amp;theta;, &amp;amp;beta;, and &amp;amp;gamma; bands, are induced by prediction errors, similar to those observed during monetary rewards. Methods: We used the IDyOM model to calculate the information content (IC) of surprise for melody and harmony in 70 musical pieces across six genres; eight pieces with varying IC values were selected. Electroencephalographic data were recorded during listening to the pieces, continuously evaluating the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; subjective pleasure on a 1&amp;amp;ndash;4 scale. Time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency analysis of electroencephalographic data was conducted, followed by general linear model analysis to fit the power-value time course in each frequency band to the time courses of subjective pleasure and IC for melody and harmony. Results: Significant positive fits were observed in the &amp;amp;beta; and &amp;amp;gamma; bands in the frontal region with both subjective pleasure and IC for melody and harmony. No significant fit was observed in the &amp;amp;theta; band. Both subjective pleasure and IC are associated with increased &amp;amp;beta; and &amp;amp;gamma; band power in the frontal regions. Conclusions: &amp;amp;beta; and &amp;amp;gamma; oscillatory activities in the frontal regions are strongly associated with musical rewards induced by prediction errors, similar to brain activity observed during monetary rewards.</p>

	<p>Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is defined as a self-reported perception of cognitive decline that occurs without clear objective signs of cognitive impairment. There is still uncertainty in the literature about the reliability of SCD as an accurate indicator of the early stages of major neurocognitive disorders. Furthermore, objectifying cognitive impairment in SCD is difficult, mainly due to the insensitivity of the assessment instruments. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential contribution of the face-name associative recognition test (FNART) to the objective identification of memory impairment in SCD. Method: A research sample of 69 adults with SCD and 69 healthy controls (HCs) recruited in the community were administered in the FNART, which included 32 photographs of neutral faces associated with 32 first names. Results: The total score of the HC group in the FNART was significantly better than that of the SCD group. Moreover, analyses based on the serial position of the stimuli showed that the SCD group performed significantly worse than the HC group only for the middle items (stimuli placed at the beginning or end of learning lists are more likely to be recalled than those presented in the middle), while no primacy and recency effects were found in the HCs. Conclusions: These findings indicate that associative episodic memory is more vulnerable in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) compared to those without cognitive complaints. Additionally, they suggest that the FNART may be effective in identifying cognitive decline in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>Background: In this narrative review, we have surveyed results obtained from a research program dealing with the role of semantic memory disorders as a predictor of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Objectives: In this research program, we have taken into account many different putative markers, provided of a different complexity in the study of the semantic network. These markers ranged from the number of words produced on a semantic fluency task to the following: (a) the discrepancy between scores obtained on semantic vs. phonemic word fluency tests; (b) the presence, at the single-word level, of features (such as a loss of low typical words on a category verbal fluency task) typical of a degraded semantic system; or (c) the presence of more complex phenomena (such as the semantic distance between consecutively produced word pairs) concerning the organization of the semantic network. In the present review, all these studies have been presented, providing separate subsections for (a) methods, (b) results, and (c) a short discussion. Some tentative general conclusions have been drawn at the end of the review. We found that at baseline all these markers are impaired in MCI patients who will later convert to AD, but also that they do not necessarily show a linear worsening during the progression to AD and allow one to make different predictions about the time of development of AD. Our conclusions were that, rather than searching for the best marker of conversion, we should use a range of different markers allowing us to obtain the information most appropriate to the goal of our investigation.</p>

	<p>Background: Helminth infections are associated with cognitive deficits, especially in school-age children. Deworming treatment in heavily infected children improves their short- and long-term memory recall. In mice, intraperitoneal helminth infection with Taenia crassiceps (T. crassiceps) shows sexual dimorphism in terms of the parasite load, immune response, hormone levels, and behavioral changes. We have previously shown poorer short-term memory performance and changes in the concentrations of cytokines and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, which were replicated in this study. The molecular changes in other brain structures, such as those related to reproduction, are unknown. Methods: Male and female Balb/cAnN mice were chronically infected with T. crassiceps larvae. We determined the peritoneal parasite load and established the presence of cytokines and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus. Results: The parasite load was higher in female than male infected mice, as expected. In the hippocampus, the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin increased in males but decreased in females. In contrast, in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus, the neurotransmitters assessed showed no statistical differences. The cytokine profiles were different in each brain structure. The TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; levels in the olfactory bulb and the IL-4 levels in the hippocampus of infected mice were dimorphic; IFN-&amp;amp;gamma; was augmented in both male and female infected animals, although the increase was higher in infected males. Conclusions: The brain responds to peripheral infection with cytokine levels that vary from structure to structure. This could be a partial explanation for the dimorphic behavioral alterations associated with infection, it also demonstrates the synergic interaction between the immune, the endocrine, and the nervous systems.</p>

                Recent evidence suggests that the development of gut microbiota during infancy affects several metabolic, immune, and endocrine pathways in humans. An imbalance in gut microbiota diversity or function, also known as dysbiosis, not only affects early child growth and development, but is also linked with the development of chronic, non-communicable diseases in later life. The Child Health And Microbiome Development Study – Pakistan (CHAMP) study aimed to longitudinally assess gut microbiota development and associated factors (maternal, child, and demographic) during early childhood in populations residing in malnutrition-endemic communities in Pakistan. A prospective cohort of mother-infant pairs (n=70) will be recruited from District Swat, Pakistan, and followed for two years. Complete information about demographic characteristics, anti-natal and post-natal care, dietary intake, feeding practices, and child health will be collected at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, mid-upper arm circumference, and head circumference), dry blood spots, and fecal samples were also collected. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from Khyber Medical University, Pakistan. The study is also registered on clincaltrial.gov (Ref no: NCT05793294). The study findings will help researchers understand gut microbiota development, associated factors, and their impact on longitudinal growth in infants during the first two years of life.

                Abstract Background F-keratin forms an evolutionary conserved nanocomposite which allows birds to fly. Structural models for F-keratin are all based on the pioneering X-ray diffraction studies on seagull F-keratin, first published in 1932, confirmed for other species and refined over the years. There is, however, no experimental proof because native F-keratin does not form a perfect molecular crystal as required for structure determination. Methods Peacock’s tail feathers were systematically re-investigated by taking diffraction patterns at different rotation angles. Using the recently developed AlphaFold algorithm, a collection of 3D models of arbitrarily truncated and multiplied Pavo cristatus F-keratin sequences was created. The shape, dimensions, density and interfacial exposure of functionally relevant amino acid side chains of the calculated 3D building blocks were used as the initial selection criteria for filamentous F-keratin precursors. Full reproducibility of in silico folding and agreement with previous results from mechanical testing, biochemical analyses and SAXS experiments was mandatory for suggesting the tentative structure for the novel F-keratin repeating unit. Results The filament of the F-keratin polymer is an alternating arrangement of two units called "N-block" and "C-block": Four strands AA 1–52 form a disulfide-stabilized twisted parallelepiped, with 89° internal rotation within eight levels of β-sandwiches. Four strands AA 81–100 form a two-level “β-sandwich” in which aromatic residues provide resilience, like vertebral discs in a spinal column. The pitch of an N+C-block octamer is 10 nm. Solidification may involve "C-blocks" to temporarily mold into "C-wedges" of 18° tilt, which align F-keratin into laterally amorphous fiber-reinforced composites of 9.5 nm axial periodicity. This experimentally significant distance corresponds to the fully stretched AA 53–80 matrix segment. The deformed “spinal column” unwinds under compression when F-keratin filaments perfectly align horizontally into stacked sheets in the solid state. Conclusions At present, the tentative structure presented here is without alternatives.

                <p>by J. Roadnight Sheehan, Astrid S. de Wijn, Thales Souza Freire, Ran Friedman</p>

Resistance to therapy is a major clinical obstacle to treatment of cancer and communicable diseases. Drug selection in treatment of patients where the disease is showing resistance to therapy is often guided by IC<sub>50</sub> or fold-IC<sub>50</sub> values. In this work, through a model of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), we contest using fold-IC<sub>50</sub> values as a guide for treatment selection. CML is a blood cancer that is treated with Abl1 inhibitors, and is often seen as a model for targeted therapy and drug resistance. Resistance to the first-line treatment occurs in approximately one in four patients. The most common cause of resistance is mutations in the Abl1 enzyme. Different mutant Abl1 enzymes show resistance to different Abl1 inhibitors and the mechanisms that lead to resistance for various mutation and inhibitor combinations are not fully known, making the selection of Abl1 inhibitors for treatment a difficult task. We developed a model based on information of catalysis, inhibition and pharmacokinetics, and applied it to study the effect of three Abl1 inhibitors on mutants of the Abl1 enzyme. From this model, we show that the relative decrease of product formation rate (defined in this work as “inhibitory reduction prowess”) is a better indicator of resistance than an examination of the size of the product formation rate or fold-IC<sub>50</sub> values for the mutant. We also examine current ideas and practices that guide treatment choice and suggest a new parameter for selecting treatments that could increase the efficacy and thus have a positive impact on patient outcomes.

                <p>by Suraya Muzafar, Ramith R. Nair, Dan I. Andersson, Omar M. Warsi</p>

Previous work shows that a host’s resident microbial community can provide resistance against an invading pathogen. However, this community is continuously changing over time due to adaptive mutations, and how these changes affect the invasion resistance of these communities remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we used an experimental evolution approach in synthetic communities of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium to investigate how the invasion resistance of this community against a bacterium expressing a virulent phenotype, i.e., colicin secretion, changes over time. We show that evolved communities accumulate mutations in genes involved in carbon metabolism and motility, while simultaneously becoming less resistant to invasion. By investigating two-species competitions and generating a three-species competition model, we show that this outcome is dependent on the strength of interspecies interactions. Our study demonstrates how adaptive changes in microbial communities can make them more prone to the detrimental effects of an invading species.

Protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) methylate histone and non-histone proteins to regulate biological outcomes such as development and disease including viral infection. While PKMTs have been extensively studied for modulating the antiviral responses via host gene regulation, their role in methylation of proteins encoded by viruses and its impact on host–pathogen interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we discovered distinct nucleo-cytoplasmic form of euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1<sup>N/C</sup>), a PKMT, that phase separates into viral inclusion bodies (IBs) upon cytoplasmic RNA-virus infection (Sendai Virus). EHMT1<sup>N/C</sup> interacts with cytoplasmic EHMT2 and methylates SeV-Nucleoprotein upon infection. Elevated nucleoprotein methylation during infection correlated with coalescence of small IBs into large mature platforms for efficient replication. Inhibition of EHMT activity by pharmacological inhibitors or genetic depletion of EHMT1<sup>N/C</sup> reduced the size of IBs with a concomitant reduction in replication. Additionally, we also found that EHMT1 condensation is not restricted to SeV alone but was also seen upon pathogenic RNA viral infections caused by Chandipura and Dengue virus. Collectively, our work elucidates a new mechanism by which cytoplasmic EHMT1 acts as proviral host factor to regulate host–pathogen interaction.

Humans experience many influenza infections over their lives, resulting in complex and varied immunological histories. Although experimental and quantitative analyses have improved our understanding of the immunological processes defining an individual’s antibody repertoire, how these within-host processes are linked to population-level influenza epidemiology in humans remains unclear. Here, we used a multilevel mathematical model to jointly infer antibody dynamics and individual-level lifetime influenza A/H3N2 infection histories for 1,130 individuals in Guangzhou, China, using 67,683 haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay measurements against 20 A/H3N2 strains from repeat serum samples collected between 2009 and 2015. These estimated infection histories allowed us to reconstruct historical seasonal influenza patterns in humans and to investigate how influenza incidence varies over time, space, and age in this population. We estimated median annual influenza infection rates to be approximately 19% from 1968 to 2015, but with substantial variation between years; 88% of individuals were estimated to have been infected at least once during the study period (2009 to 2015), and 20% were estimated to have 3 or more infections in that time. We inferred decreasing infection rates with increasing age, and found that annual attack rates were highly correlated across all locations, regardless of their distance, suggesting that age has a stronger impact than fine-scale spatial effects in determining an individual’s antibody profile. Finally, we reconstructed each individual’s expected antibody profile over their lifetime and inferred an age-stratified relationship between probability of infection and HI titre. Our analyses show how multi-strain serological panels provide rich information on long-term epidemiological trends, within-host processes, and immunity when analysed using appropriate inference methods, and adds to our understanding of the life course epidemiology of influenza A/H3N2.

                <p>by Gulnara Tagirdzhanova, Paul Saary, Ellen S. Cameron, Carmen C. G. Allen, Arkadiy I. Garber, David Díaz Escandón, Andrew T. Cook, Spencer Goyette, Veera Tuovinen Nogerius, Alfredo Passo, Helmut Mayrhofer, Håkon Holien, Tor Tønsberg, Lisa Y. Stein, Robert D. Finn, Toby Spribille</p>

In lichen research, metagenomes are increasingly being used for evaluating symbiont composition and metabolic potential, but the overall content and limitations of these metagenomes have not been assessed. We reassembled over 400 publicly available metagenomes, generated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), constructed phylogenomic trees, and mapped MAG occurrence and frequency across the data set. Ninety-seven percent of the 1,000 recovered MAGs were bacterial or the fungal symbiont that provides most cellular mass. Our mapping of recovered MAGs provides the most detailed survey to date of bacteria in lichens and shows that 4 family-level lineages from 2 phyla accounted for as many bacterial occurrences in lichens as all other 71 families from 16 phyla combined. Annotation of highly complete bacterial, fungal, and algal MAGs reveals functional profiles that suggest interdigitated vitamin prototrophies and auxotrophies, with most lichen fungi auxotrophic for biotin, most bacteria auxotrophic for thiamine and the few annotated algae with partial or complete pathways for both, suggesting a novel dimension of microbial cross-feeding in lichen symbioses. Contrary to longstanding hypotheses, we found no annotations consistent with nitrogen fixation in bacteria other than known cyanobacterial symbionts. Core lichen symbionts such as algae were recovered as MAGs in only a fraction of the lichen symbioses in which they are known to occur. However, the presence of these and other microbes could be detected at high frequency using small subunit rRNA analysis, including in many lichens in which they are not otherwise recognized to occur. The rate of MAG recovery correlates with sequencing depth, but is almost certainly influenced by biological attributes of organisms that affect the likelihood of DNA extraction, sequencing and successful assembly, including cellular abundance, ploidy and strain co-occurrence. Our results suggest that, though metagenomes are a powerful tool for surveying microbial occurrence, they are of limited use in assessing absence, and their interpretation should be guided by an awareness of the interacting effects of microbial community complexity and sequencing depth.

                <p>by Patricia Garcia, Ruben Celador, Tomas Edreira, Yolanda Sanchez</p>

Cellular asymmetry begins with the selection of a discrete point on the cell surface that triggers Rho-GTPases activation and localized assembly of the cytoskeleton to establish new growth zones. The cylindrical shape of fission yeast is organized by microtubules (MT) that deliver the landmark Tea1–Tea4 complex at the cell tips to define the growth poles. However, only a few <i>tea1</i>Δ cells mistaken the direction of growth, indicating that they manage to detect their growth sites. Here, we show that Rgf1 (Rho1-GEF) and Tea4 are components of the same complex and that Rgf1 activity toward Rho1 is required for strengthen Tea4 at the cell tips. Moreover, in cells lacking Tea1, selection of the correct growth site depends on Rgf1 and on a correctly polarized actin cytoskeleton, both necessary for Rho1 activation at the pole. We propose an actin-dependent mechanism driven by Rgf1–Rho1 that marks the poles independently of MTs and the Tea1–Tea4 complex.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27104?af=R">Association of Reperfusion and Procedural Characteristics with Endovascular Thrombectomy Outcomes in Large Core Stroke: Sub‐Analysis from the SELECT2 Trial</a></h4>

              
                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was shown to be safe and efficacious in patients with large core stroke in multiple randomized controlled trials. However, the impact of reperfusion and other procedural metrics on EVT outcomes in this population has not been well-characterized.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From the SELECT2 trial, we evaluated the association between reperfusion status, first-pass effect (near-complete or complete reperfusion [extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) 2c-3] in 1 pass), procedure time and primary technique (aspiration vs stent-retriever) with functional outcomes in patients receiving EVT across ASPECTS (3 vs 4 vs 5) and core estimate strata (&lt;70 vs ≥70ml, &lt;100 vs ≥100ml, and &lt;150 vs ≥150ml).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 180 patients who received thrombectomy, 144 (80%) achieved successful reperfusion (eTICI 2b-3) and demonstrated better clinical outcomes (adjusted generalized odds ratios [aGenOR]: 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–2.15), compared with unsuccessful reperfusion. Results were consistent across ASPECTS and core estimate strata. Additionally, complete or near-complete reperfusion (eTICI 2c-3) was associated with better functional outcome (aGenOR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.33–2.97) in patients achieving successful reperfusion. Functional outcome point estimates favored those with first-pass-effect (42 of 167 (25%), aGenOR: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.96–2.24). Longer procedure time was associated with worse modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution (aGenOR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87–0.96, <i>p</i>-value = 0.001 for 10 minutes increment). Aspiration-first technique was used in 43 of 154 (25%) patients and was not associated with higher reperfusion (88% vs 78%, <i>p</i> = 0.18) or better functional outcome (aGenOR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.50–1.10) as compared with stent-retriever first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>

                Cancer remains a public concern and leading cause of death worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common form of liver cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The number of cases is expected to double by 2040, according to GLOBOCAN 2020. Patients are usually diagnosed with advanced-stage HCC, which limits the number of effective treatment options. Oral-targeted therapies involving sorafenib and lenvatinib remain the first-line treatment option, which has recently been replaced by immunotherapy. Due to economic issues and ease of administration, the vast majority prefer oral systemic therapy. Sorafenib and lenvatinib, which belongs to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have few limitations of having large inter-individual variability in absorption, genetic polymorphisms, poor patient adherence to oral regimen limiting its long-term therapy. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring can overcome the limitations of TKIs and help individualise the dosage regimen with minimal adverse events. Therefore, this simple and rapid method using latest equipment enabled with ultra-high speed, high-sensitivity analysis (LCMS-8045) is expected to bring a change in clinical practice to improve the efficacy and safety of medication for optimal patient benefits.

                Introduction Health systems worldwide are struggling to ensure the affordability of medicines. Prescription, dispensing, and pharmaceutical expenditures are key variables that highlight the need to understand how global scientific evidence is generated against factors (implicit and non-explicit) that influence these variables. Objectives To provide a panorama of scientific production on drug prescription and dispensing, and its relationship with pharmaceutical expenditure in health systems worldwide. Methods A five-stage scientometric mapping was performed based on a systematic search of 8 databases. The five stages are: i) retrieval, ii) migration, iii) analysis, iv) visualization and v) interpretation. Results A corpus of evidence from 103 systematic literature reviews was obtained, screened and sifted, visualizing the countries, authors, databases, journals, institutions and time periods that contributed most to evidence generation. Central research themes are identified and phenomena related to article publication are discussed. Conclusions The analysis reveals a clear leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States in scientific production on prescribing, dispensing and pharmaceutical expenditure in health systems worldwide. This scientific production is mainly focused on financing policies, pharmaceutical incentives and interventions, and rational use of medicines. There is also evidence of the scarcity of scientific production in Latin American publications and authors, which could generate interest for future research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1332/v1?src=rss">Promoting Healthy Reading Strategies as a Self-Care Alternative to Self-Medication among University Students in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Healthy reading habits can improve concentration, critical thinking, information retention, and educational success skills. However, the lack of it among university students often leads to immense academic demands and pressures, particularly during examinations. This could result in self-medication and nonmedical use of drugs to cope with pressure and could negatively affect their physical and mental health, well-being, as well as academic performance. There is also the risk of the long-term effects of medication dependence, addiction, and decreased cognitive function. Therefore, establishing healthy reading habits is essential to student self-care and holistic well-being. This study used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), guidelines, and protocols to review published data between 2010 and 2024 from Sage Journals, African Journal Online, ProQuest Dissertations, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Twelve selected articles were thematically analysed, and social cognitive theoretical lenses guided interpretation and analysis. The review revealed the prevalence of medication misuse among university students, risk factors for drug misuse, interventions to reduce medication misuse, and the role of policymaking in supporting drug misuse among university students. Based on the findings, recommendations were made to address self-medication and promote healthy reading habits and students’ well-being.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98853">SLC35G1 is a highly chloride-sensitive transporter responsible for the basolateral membrane transport in intestinal citrate absorption</a></h4>

              
                The intestinal absorption of essential nutrients, especially those not readily biosynthesized, is a critical physiological process for maintaining homeostasis. Numerous studies have indicated that intestinal absorption is mediated by various membrane transporters. Citrate, a crucial bioactive compound produced as an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, is absorbed in the small intestine through carrier-mediated systems because of its high hydrophilicity. While the luminal absorption of citrate is mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>-dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (NaDC1/SLC13A2), the mechanism governing the release of the transported citrate into the bloodstream remains unknown. Here, we explored the transporters responsible for intestinal citrate absorption at the basolateral membrane, focusing on highly expressed orphan transporters in the small intestine as candidates. Consequently, SLC35G1, originally identified as a partner of stromal interaction molecule 1, a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein, was found to play a role in the intestinal absorption of citrate at the basolateral membrane. Furthermore, our results revealed that SLC35G1-mediated citrate transport was diminished by chloride ions at physiologically relevant extracellular concentrations. This suggests that SLC35G1, to our best knowledge, is the first transporter identified to be extremely sensitive to chloride ions among those functioning on the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. This study provides valuable insights into the intestinal absorption of citrate and significantly contributes to elucidating the poorly understood molecular basis of the intestinal absorption system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95873">Astrocyte aquaporin mediates a tonic water efflux maintaining brain homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Brain water homeostasis not only provides a physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glia in brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channel. How astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis in basal physiology remains to be understood. We report that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiber photometry in mobile mice. We then show that aquaporin-mediated constant water efflux maintains astrocyte volume and osmotic equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83424">Precise control of neural activity using dynamically optimized electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Neural implants have the potential to restore lost sensory function by electrically evoking the complex naturalistic activity patterns of neural populations. However, it can be difficult to predict and control evoked neural responses to simultaneous multi-electrode stimulation due to nonlinearity of the responses. We present a solution to this problem and demonstrate its utility in the context of a bidirectional retinal implant for restoring vision. A dynamically optimized stimulation approach encodes incoming visual stimuli into a rapid, greedily chosen, temporally dithered and spatially multiplexed sequence of simple stimulation patterns. Stimuli are selected to optimize the reconstruction of the visual stimulus from the evoked responses. Temporal dithering exploits the slow time scales of downstream neural processing, and spatial multiplexing exploits the independence of responses generated by distant electrodes. The approach was evaluated using an experimental laboratory prototype of a retinal implant: large-scale, high-resolution multi-electrode stimulation and recording of macaque and rat retinal ganglion cells ex vivo. The dynamically optimized stimulation approach substantially enhanced performance compared to existing approaches based on static mapping between visual stimulus intensity and current amplitude. The modular framework enabled parallel extensions to naturalistic viewing conditions, incorporation of perceptual similarity measures, and efficient implementation for an implantable device. A direct closed-loop test of the approach supported its potential use in vision restoration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97854">Mechano-regulation of GLP-1 production by Piezo1 in intestinal L cells</a></h4>

              
                Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a gut-derived hormone secreted by intestinal L cells and vital for postprandial glycemic control. As open-type enteroendocrine cells, whether L cells can sense mechanical stimuli caused by chyme and thus regulate GLP-1 synthesis and secretion is unexplored. Molecular biology techniques revealed the expression of Piezo1 in intestinal L cells. Its level varied in different energy status and correlates with blood glucose and GLP-1 levels. Mice with L cell-specific loss of Piezo1 (<i>Piezo1</i> IntL-CKO) exhibited impaired glucose tolerance, increased body weight, reduced GLP-1 production and decreased CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway under normal chow diet or high-fat diet. Activation of the intestinal Piezo1 by its agonist Yoda1 or intestinal bead implantation increased the synthesis and secretion of GLP-1, thus alleviated glucose intolerance in diet-induced-diabetic mice. Overexpression of Piezo1, Yoda1 treatment or stretching stimulated GLP-1 production and CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway, which could be abolished by knockdown or blockage of Piezo1 in primary cultured mouse L cells and STC-1 cells. These experimental results suggest a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for GLP-1 production in L cells, which could offer new insights into diabetes treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85755">Dynamic readout of the Hh gradient in the Drosophila wing disc reveals pattern-specific tradeoffs between robustness and precision</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the principles underlying the design of robust, yet flexible patterning systems is a key problem in developmental biology. In the Drosophila wing, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling determines patterning outputs using dynamical properties of the Hh gradient. In particular, the pattern of collier (col) is established by the steady-state Hh gradient, whereas the pattern of decapentaplegic (dpp), is established by a transient gradient of Hh known as the Hh overshoot. Here we use mathematical modeling to suggest that this dynamical interpretation of the Hh gradient results in specific robustness and precision properties. For instance, the location of the anterior border of col, which is subject to self-enhanced ligand degradation is more robustly specified than that of dpp to changes in morphogen dosage, and we provide experimental evidence of this prediction. However, the anterior border of dpp expression pattern, which is established by the overshoot gradient is much more precise to what would be expected by the steady-state gradient. Therefore, the dynamical interpretation of Hh signaling offers tradeoffs between

                The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia (HUA) and gout. However, it remains unclear whether probiotics residing in the host gut, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, can prevent HUA development. Herein, we isolated <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> SQ001 from the cecum of HUA geese and conducted in vitro assays on uric acid (UA) and nucleoside co-culture. Metabolomics and genome-wide analyses, revealed that this strain may promote nucleoside uptake and hydrolysis through its nucleoside hydrolase gene. The functional role of <i>iunH</i> gene was confirmed via heterologous expression and gene knockout studies. Oral administration of <i>L. plantarum</i> SQ001 resulted in increased abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> species and reduced serum UA levels. Furthermore, it downregulated hepatic xanthine oxidase, a key enzyme involved in UA synthesis, as well as renal reabsorption protein GLUT9, while enhancing the expression of renal excretion protein ABCG2. Our findings suggest that <i>L. plantarum</i> has potential to ameliorate gut microbial dysbiosis with HUA, thereby offering insights into its potential application as a probiotic therapy for individuals with HUA or gout.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93766">PKA regulation of neuronal function requires the dissociation of catalytic subunits from regulatory subunits</a></h4>

              
                Protein kinase A (PKA) plays essential roles in diverse cellular functions. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of endogenous PKA upon activation remain debated. The classical model predicts that PKA catalytic subunits dissociate from regulatory subunits in the presence of cAMP, whereas a second model proposes that catalytic subunits remain associated with regulatory subunits following physiological activation. Here, we report that different PKA subtypes, as defined by the regulatory subunit, exhibit distinct subcellular localization at rest in CA1 neurons of cultured hippocampal slices. Nevertheless, when all tested PKA subtypes are activated by norepinephrine, presumably via the β-adrenergic receptor, catalytic subunits translocate to dendritic spines but regulatory subunits remain unmoved. These differential spatial dynamics between the subunits indicate that at least a significant fraction of PKA dissociates. Furthermore, PKA-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity and transmission can be supported only by wildtype, dissociable PKA, but not by inseparable PKA. These results indicate that endogenous PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits dissociate to achieve PKA function in neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93232">Autophagosome development and chloroplast segmentation occur synchronously for piecemeal degradation of chloroplasts</a></h4>

              
                Plants distribute many nutrients to chloroplasts during leaf development and maturation. When leaves senesce or experience sugar starvation, the autophagy machinery degrades chloroplast proteins to facilitate efficient nutrient reuse. Here, we report on the intracellular dynamics of an autophagy pathway responsible for piecemeal degradation of chloroplast components. Through live-cell monitoring of chloroplast morphology, we observed the formation of chloroplast budding structures in sugar-starved leaves. These buds were then released and incorporated into the vacuolar lumen as an autophagic cargo termed a Rubisco-containing body. The budding structures did not accumulate in mutants of core autophagy machinery, suggesting that autophagosome creation is required for forming chloroplast buds. Simultaneous tracking of chloroplast morphology and autophagosome development revealed that the isolation membranes of autophagosomes interact closely with part of the chloroplast surface before forming chloroplast buds. Chloroplasts then protrude at the site associated with the isolation membranes, which divide synchronously with autophagosome maturation. This autophagy-related division does not require DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 5B, which constitutes the division ring for chloroplast proliferation in growing leaves. An unidentified division machinery may thus fragment chloroplasts for degradation in coordination with the development of the chloroplast-associated isolation membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96178">Formation of a giant unilocular vacuole via macropinocytosis-like process confers anoikis resistance</a></h4>

              
                Cell survival in metazoans depends on cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or to neighboring cells. Loss of such attachment triggers a type of programmed cell death known as anoikis, the acquisition of resistance to which is a key step in cancer development. The mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance remain unclear, however. The intracellular F-actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in sensing the loss of cell–ECM attachment, but how its disruption affects cell fate during such stress is not well understood. Here, we reveal a cell survival strategy characterized by the formation of a giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac) in the cytoplasm of the cells whose actin cytoskeleton is disrupted during loss of matrix attachment. Time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy showed that large vacuoles with a diameter of &gt;500 nm accumulated early after inhibition of actin polymerization in cells in suspension culture, and that these vacuoles subsequently coalesced to form a GUVac. GUVac formation was found to result from a variation of a macropinocytosis-like process, characterized by the presence of inwardly curved membrane invaginations. This phenomenon relies on both F-actin depolymerization and the recruitment of septin proteins for micron-sized plasma membrane invagination. The vacuole fusion step during GUVac formation requires PI(3)P produced by VPS34 and PI3K-C2α on the surface of vacuoles. Furthermore, its induction after loss of matrix attachment conferred anoikis resistance. Our results thus show that the formation of a previously unrecognized organelle promotes cell survival in the face of altered actin and matrix environments.

	<p>Mixed Reality (MR) technology possesses profound and extensive potential across a multitude of domains, including, but not limited to industry, healthcare, and education. However, prolonged use of MR devices to watch stereoscopic content may lead to visual fatigue. Since visual fatigue involves multiple brain regions, our study aims to explore the topological characteristics of brain networks derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Because the Phase-Locked Value (PLV) is capable of effectively measuring the phase synchronization relationship between brain regions, it was calculated between all pairs of channels in both comfort and fatigue states. Subsequently, a sparse brain network was constructed based on PLV by applying an appropriate threshold. The node properties (betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, node efficiency) and edge properties (characteristic path length) were calculated based on the corresponding brain network within specific frequency bands for both comfort and fatigue states. In analyzing the PLV of brain connectivity in comfort and fatigue states, a notable enhancement in brain connectivity is observed within the alpha, theta, and delta frequency bands during fatigue status. By analyzing the node and edge properties of brain networks, it is evident that the mean values of these properties in the fatigue state were higher than those in the comfort state. By analyzing the node and edge properties at a local level, the average difference in betweenness centrality, clustering coefficients, and nodal efficiency across the three EEG frequency bands was computed to find significant brain regions. The main findings are as follows: Betweenness centrality primarily differs in frontal and parietal regions, with minor involvement in temporal and central regions. The clustering Coefficient mainly varies in the frontal region, with slight differences being seen in the temporal and occipital regions. Nodal efficiency primarily varies in the frontal, temporal, and central regions, with minor differences being seen in the parietal and occipital regions. Edge property analysis indicates that there is a higher occurrence of long-distance connections among brain regions during the fatigue state, which reflects a loss of synaptic transmission efficiency on a global level. Our study plays a crucial role in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying visual fatigue, potentially providing insights that could be applied to high-demand cognitive fields where prolonged use of MR devices leads to visual fatigue.</p>

	<p>Dyslexia&amp;amp;ndash;dysorthographia is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the symptoms appear during the person&amp;amp;rsquo;s development (generally around the age of 7 or 8) and persist throughout life. The study of this written language disorder mainly focuses on children, principally in the clinical, cognitive science and neuroscience fields. The importance and originality of this study are that it investigates the impact of dyslexia&amp;amp;ndash;dysorthographia on written production in young adults (students) with dyslexia, from a psycholinguistic perspective. To do this, students and matched-control individuals were asked to produce written texts on the same theme. These productions were then analysed, observing on-line indicators, such as pause location and duration. The current investigation found that students with dyslexia still have important difficulties with writing and their lack of automation in spelling has consequences on the transcription and planning process: although they have the same handwriting speed, pressure and word rate as control students, they make longer pauses before words, especially before short and long words, words involving grammatical inflexion, grammatical words and punctuation.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of chiropractic care using resting electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), clinical health assessments (Fitbit), and Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29). Methods: Seventy-six people with chronic low back pain (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD: 45 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 years, 33 female) were randomised into control (n = 38) and chiropractic (n = 38) groups. EEG and SEPs were collected pre and post the first intervention and post 4 weeks of intervention. PROMIS-29 was measured pre and post 4 weeks. Fitbit data were recorded continuously. Results: Spectral analysis of resting EEG showed a significant increase in Theta, Alpha and Beta, and a significant decrease in Delta power in the chiropractic group post intervention. Source localisation revealed a significant increase in Alpha activity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) post intervention and post 4 weeks. A significant decrease in N30 SEP peak amplitude post intervention and post 4 weeks was found in the chiropractic group. Source localisation demonstrated significant changes in Alpha and Beta power within the DMN post-intervention and post 4 weeks. Significant improvements in light sleep stage were observed in the chiropractic group along with enhanced overall quality of life post 4 weeks, including significant reductions in anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions: These findings indicate that many health benefits of chiropractic care are due to altered brain activity.</p>

                <p>Each olfactory cortical hemisphere receives ipsilateral odor information directly from the olfactory bulb and contralateral information indirectly from the other cortical hemisphere. Since neural projections to the olfactory cortex (OC) are disordered and nontopographic, spatial information cannot be used to align projections from the two sides like in the visual cortex. Therefore, how bilateral information is integrated in individual cortical neurons is unknown. We have found, in mice, that the odor responses of individual neurons to selective stimulation of each of the two nostrils are significantly correlated, such that odor identity decoding optimized with information arriving from one nostril transfers very well to the other side. Nevertheless, these aligned responses are asymmetric enough to allow decoding of stimulus laterality. Computational analysis shows that such matched odor tuning is incompatible with purely random connections but is explained readily by Hebbian plasticity structuring bilateral connectivity. Our data reveal that despite the distributed and fragmented sensory representation in the OC, odor information across the two hemispheres is highly coordinated.</p>

                <p>Age-related brain changes affect sleep and are reflected in properties of sleep slow-waves, however, the precise mechanisms behind these changes are still not completely understood. Here, we adapt a previously established whole-brain model relating structural connectivity changes to resting state dynamics, and extend it to a slow-wave sleep brain state. In particular, starting from a representative connectome at the beginning of the aging trajectory, we have gradually reduced the inter-hemispheric connections, and simulated sleep-like slow-wave activity. We show that the main empirically observed trends, namely a decrease in duration and increase in variability of the slow waves are captured by the model. Furthermore, comparing the simulated EEG activity to the source signals, we suggest that the empirically observed decrease in amplitude of the slow waves is caused by the decrease in synchrony between brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/11/ENEURO.0294-24.2024?rss=1">An Indirect Pathway from the Rat Interstitial Nucleus of Cajal to the Vestibulocerebellum Involved in Vertical Gaze Holding</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neural network, including the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), functions as an oculomotor neural integrator involved in the control of vertical gaze holding. Impairment of the vestibulocerebellum (VC), including the flocculus (FL), has been shown to affect vertical gaze holding, indicating that the INC cooperates with the VC in controlling this function. However, a network between the INC and VC has not been identified. In this study, we aimed to obtain anatomical evidence of a neural pathway from the INC to the VC (the INC-VC pathway) in rats. Injection of dextran-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 or adeno-associated virus 2-retro (AAV2retro) expressing GFP into the FL or another VC region (uvula/nodulus) did not reveal any retrogradely labeled neurons in the INC, suggesting that INC neurons do not project directly to the VC. Rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing experiments revealed that the INC-VC pathway is mediated via synaptic connections with the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) and medial vestibular nucleus (MVN). The INC neurons in the INC-VC pathway were mainly localized bilaterally within the rostral region of the INC. Transsynaptic tracing experiments involving the INC-FL pathway revealed that INC neurons connected to the FL via the bilateral PHN and MVN. These results indicate that the INC-VC pathway is not a direct pathway but is mediated via the PHN and MVN. These findings can provide clues for understanding the network mechanisms responsible for vertical gaze holding.</p>

                <p>Experience- and activity-dependent transcription is a candidate mechanism to mediate development and refinement of specific cortical circuits. Here, we demonstrate that the activity-dependent transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) is required in both presynaptic layer (L) 4 and postsynaptic L2/3 mouse (male and female) somatosensory (S1) cortical neurons for development of this specific synaptic connection. While postsynaptic deletion of <I>Mef2c</I> weakens L4 synaptic inputs, it has no effect on inputs from local L2/3, contralateral S1, or the ipsilateral frontal/motor cortex. Similarly, homozygous or heterozygous deletion of <I>Mef2c</I> in presynaptic L4 neurons weakens L4 to L2/3 excitatory synaptic inputs by decreasing presynaptic release probability. Postsynaptic MEF2C is specifically required during an early postnatal, experience-dependent, period for L4 to L2/3 synapse function, and expression of transcriptionally active MEF2C (MEF2C-VP16) rescues weak L4 to L2/3 synaptic strength in sensory-deprived mice. Together, these results suggest that experience- and/or activity-dependent transcriptional activation of MEF2C promotes development of L4 to L2/3 synapses. Additionally, MEF2C regulates the expression of many pre- and postsynaptic genes in postnatal cortical neurons. Interestingly, MEF2C was necessary for activity-dependent expression of many presynaptic genes, including those that function in transsynaptic adhesion and neurotransmitter release. This work provides mechanistic insight into the experience-dependent development of specific cortical circuits.</p>

                <p>Impaired inhibitory synapse development is suggested to drive neuronal hyperactivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and epilepsy. We propose a novel mechanism by which astrocytes control the development of parvalbumin (PV)-specific inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus, implicating ephrin-B/EphB signaling. Here, we utilize genetic approaches to assess functional and structural connectivity between PV and pyramidal cells (PCs) through whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, immunohistochemical analysis, and behaviors in male and female mice. While inhibitory synapse development is adversely affected by PV-specific expression of EphB2, a strong candidate ASD risk gene, astrocytic ephrin-B1 facilitates PV-&gt;PC connectivity through a mechanism involving EphB signaling in PV boutons. In contrast, the loss of astrocytic ephrin-B1 reduces PV-&gt;PC connectivity and inhibition, resulting in increased seizure susceptibility and an ASD-like phenotype. Our findings underscore the crucial role of astrocytes in regulating inhibitory circuit development and discover a new role of EphB2 receptors in PV-specific inhibitory synapse development.</p>

                <p>The precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals plays a crucial role in the physiological functions of neurons. Here, we investigated the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cultured hippocampal neurons from both female and male rats. In cultured hippocampal neurons, glucocorticoids inhibited the spontaneous somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes generated by Kv2.1-organized Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains. Furthermore, glucocorticoids rapidly reduced the cell surface expressions of Kv2.1 and Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 channels in hippocampal neurons. In HEK293 cells transfected with Kv2.1 alone, glucocorticoids significantly reduced the surface expression of Kv2.1 with little effect on K<sup>+</sup> currents. In HEK293 cells transfected with Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 alone, glucocorticoids inhibited Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 currents but had no effect on the cell surface expression of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2. Notably, in the presence of wild-type Kv2.1, glucocorticoids caused a decrease in the surface expression of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 channels in HEK293 cells. However, this effect was not observed in the presence of nonclustering Kv2.1S586A mutant channels. Live-cell imaging showed that glucocorticoids rapidly decreased Kv2.1 clusters on the plasma membrane. Correspondingly, Western blot results indicated a significant increase in the cytoplasmic level of Kv2.1, suggesting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 clusters. Glucocorticoids rapidly decreased the intracellular cAMP concentration and the phosphorylation level of PKA in hippocampal neurons. The PKA inhibitor H89 mimicked the effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.1, while the PKA agonist forskolin abrogated the effect. In conclusion, glucocorticoids rapidly suppress Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in hippocampal neurons by promoting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 channel clusters through reducing PKA activity.</p>

                <p>Different people listening to the same story may converge upon a largely shared interpretation while still developing idiosyncratic experiences atop that shared foundation. What linguistic properties support this individualized experience of natural language? Here, we investigate how the "concrete&ndash;abstract" axis&mdash;the extent to which a word is grounded in sensory experience&mdash;relates to within- and across-subject variability in the neural representations of language. Leveraging a dataset of human participants of both sexes who each listened to four auditory stories while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that neural representations of "concreteness" are both reliable across stories and relatively unique to individuals, while neural representations of "abstractness" are variable both within individuals and across the population. Using natural language processing tools, we show that concrete words exhibit similar neural representations despite spanning larger distances within a high-dimensional semantic space, which potentially reflects an underlying representational signature of sensory experience&mdash;namely, imageability&mdash;shared by concrete words but absent from abstract words. Our findings situate the concrete&ndash;abstract axis as a core dimension that supports both shared and individualized representations of natural language.</p>

                <p>Estimating the direction of functional connectivity (FC) can help further elucidate complex brain function. However, the estimation of directed FC at the voxel level in fMRI data, and evaluating its performance, has yet to be done. We therefore developed a novel directed seed-based connectivity analysis (SCA) method based on normalized pairwise Granger causality that provides greater detail and accuracy over ROI-based methods. We evaluated its performance against 145 cortical retrograde tracer injections in male and female marmosets that were used as ground truth cellular connectivity on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each injection, and we achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.95 for undirected and 0.942 for directed SCA in the case of high cell count threshold. This indicates that SCA can reliably estimate the strong cellular connections between voxels in fMRI data. We then used our directed SCA method to analyze the human default mode network (DMN) and found that dlPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and temporal lobe were separated from other DMN regions, forming part of the language-network that works together with the core DMN regions. We also found that the cerebellum (Crus I-II) was strongly targeted by the posterior parietal cortices and dlPFC, but reciprocal connections were not observed. Thus, the cerebellum may not be a part of, but instead a target of, the DMN and language-network. Summarily, our novel directed SCA method, visualized with a new functional flat mapping technique, opens a new paradigm for whole-brain functional analysis.</p>

                <p>Hyperbilirubinemia (HB) is a key risk factor for hearing loss in neonates, particularly premature infants. Here, we report that bilirubin (BIL)-dependent cell death in the auditory brainstem of neonatal mice of both sexes is significantly attenuated by ZD7288, a blocker for hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel-mediated current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>), or by genetic deletion of HCN1. GABAergic inhibitory interneurons predominantly express HCN1, on which BIL selectively acts to increase their intrinsic excitability and mortality by enhancing HCN1 activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane targeting. Chronic BIL elevation in neonatal mice in vivo increases the fraction of spontaneously active interneurons and their firing frequency, <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>, and death, compromising audition at the young adult stage in HCN1<sup>+/+</sup>, but not in HCN1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> genotype. We conclude that HB preferentially targets HCN1 to injure inhibitory interneurons, fueling a feedforward loop in which lessening inhibition cascades hyperexcitability, Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, neuronal death, and auditory impairments. These findings rationalize HCN1 as a potential target for managing HB encephalopathy.</p>

                <p>Systemic study of pathogenic pathways and interrelationships underlying genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) facilitates the identification of new targets for effective treatments. Recently available large-scale multiomics datasets provide opportunities to use computational approaches for such studies. Here, we devised a novel <unl>di</unl>sease <unl>g</unl>ene <unl>id</unl>entification (digID) computational framework that consists of a semi-supervised deep learning classifier to predict AD-associated genes and a protein&ndash;protein interaction (PPI) network-based analysis to prioritize the importance of these predicted genes in AD. digID predicted 1,529 AD-associated genes and revealed potentially new AD molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets including GNAI1 and GNB1, two G-protein subunits that regulate cell signaling, and KNG1, an upstream modulator of CDC42 small G-protein signaling and mediator of inflammation and candidate coregulator of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Analysis of mRNA expression validated their dysregulation in AD brains but further revealed the significant spatial patterns in different brain regions as well as among different subregions of the frontal cortex and hippocampi. Super-resolution STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) further demonstrated their subcellular colocalization and molecular interactions with APP in a transgenic mouse model of both sexes with AD-like mutations. These studies support the predictions made by digID while highlighting the importance of concurrent biological validation of computationally identified gene clusters as potential new AD therapeutic targets.</p>

                <p>Words offer a unique opportunity to separate the processing mechanisms of object subcomponents from those of the whole object, because the phonological or semantic information provided by the word subcomponents (i.e., sublexical information) can conflict with that provided by the whole word (i.e., lexical information). Previous studies have revealed some of the specific brain regions and temporal information involved in sublexical information processing. However, a comprehensive spatiotemporal neural network for sublexical processing remains to be fully elucidated due to the low temporal or spatial resolutions of previous neuroimaging studies. In this study, we recorded stereoelectroencephalography signals with high spatial and temporal resolutions from a large sample of 39 epilepsy patients (both sexes) during a Chinese character oral reading task. We explored the activated brain regions and their connectivity related to three sublexical effects: phonological regularity (whether the whole character's pronunciation aligns with its phonetic radical), phonological consistency (whether characters with the same phonetic radical share the same pronunciation), and semantic transparency (whether the whole character's meaning aligns with its semantic radical). The results revealed that sublexical effects existed in the inferior frontal gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobe, and middle occipital gyrus. Additionally, connectivity from the middle occipital gyrus to the postcentral gyrus and from postcentral gyrus to the fusiform gyrus was associated with the sublexical effects. These findings provide valuable insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of sublexical processing and object recognition in the brain.</p>

                <p>Plasticity in the subcortical motor basal ganglia&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cerebellar network plays a key role in the acquisition and control of long-term memory for new procedural skills, from the formation of population trajectories controlling trained motor skills in the striatum to the adaptation of sensorimotor maps in the cerebellum. However, recent findings demonstrate the involvement of a wider cortical and subcortical brain network in the consolidation and control of well-trained actions, including a brain region traditionally associated with declarative memory&mdash;the hippocampus. Here, we probe which role these subcortical areas play in skilled motor sequence control, from sequence feature selection during planning to their integration during sequence execution. An fMRI dataset (<I>N</I> = 24; 14 females) collected after participants learnt to produce four finger press sequences entirely from memory with high movement and timing accuracy over several days was examined for both changes in BOLD activity and their informational content in subcortical regions of interest. Although there was a widespread activity increase in effector-related striatal, thalamic, and cerebellar regions, in particular during sequence execution, the associated activity did not contain information on the motor sequence identity. In contrast, hippocampal activity increased during planning and predicted the order of the upcoming sequence of movements. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus preorders movements for skilled action sequences, thus contributing to the higher-order control of skilled movements that require flexible retrieval. These findings challenge the traditional taxonomy of episodic and procedural memory and carry implications for the rehabilitation of individuals with neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                <p>Key event-related potentials (ERPs) of perceptual decision-making such as centroparietal positivity (CPP) elucidate how evidence is accumulated toward a given choice. Furthermore, this accumulation can be impacted by visual target selection signals such as the N2 contralateral (N2c). How these underlying neural mechanisms of perceptual decision-making are influenced by the spatial congruence of distractors relative to target stimuli remains unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in humans of both sexes to investigate the effect of distractor spatial congruency (same vs different hemifield relative to targets) on perceptual decision-making. We confirmed that responses for perceptual decisions were slower for spatially incongruent versus congruent distractors of high salience. Similarly, markers of target selection (N2c peak amplitude) and evidence accumulation (CPP slope) were found to be lower when distractors were spatially incongruent versus congruent. To evaluate the effects of congruency further, we applied drift diffusion modeling to participant responses, which showed that larger amplitudes of both ERPs were correlated with shorter nondecision times when considering the effect of congruency. The modeling also suggested that congruency's effect on behavior occurred prior to and during evidence accumulation when considering the effects of the N2c peak and CPP slope. These findings point to spatially incongruent distractors, relative to congruent distractors, influencing decisions as early as the initial sensory processing phase and then continuing to exert an effect as evidence is accumulated throughout the decision-making process. Overall, our findings highlight how key electrophysiological signals of perceptual decision-making are influenced by the spatial congruence of target and distractor.</p>

                Background Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) or Leriche syndrome, is a form of peripheral arterial disease involving the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. The presentation of AIOD ranges from asymptomatic cases to limb-threatening emergencies. Advances and innovations in endovascular devices have replaced traditional surgical interventions for the management of AIOD. Here we report a case of a 52-year-old man presenting with AIOD managed by endovascular approach using kissing stent technique. Case presentation A 52-year-old man, with history of chronic coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, long-standing hypertension, and a significant history of smoking, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of long-standing bilateral claudication which recently progressed to rest pain. A history of AIOD was previously established. AIOD (TASC II Type D) diagnosis was made by lower extremity duplex ultrasound and CT angiography. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with kissing stent technique. The patient was discharged 4 days after the procedure without any significant complaints, received best medical therapy. Conclusion Endovascular interventions present excellent alternatives to surgical techniques in the treatment of complex AIOD. Herein we presented an endovascular treatment of AIOD utilizing the kissing stent technique which showed satisfactory outcomes.

                Background The population is increasingly demanding a better quality of life in their territories, which requires better urban planning. This study aims to find out the effectiveness of urban planning implemented by local governments on citizen satisfaction. Method A systematic literature review was conducted exploring the evolution of the state-of-the-art databases in Scopus, WOS and Dimensions, involving a relevant selection of empirical studies on the effectiveness of urban planning on citizen satisfaction, using quality criteria and the application of the PRISMA diagram. Results The findings in the various empirical contributions find converging in three main blocks the contributions related to: (i) Urban planning as a catalyst for the impact of citizen satisfaction, given that using the planning tool will lead to the development of local policies based on the Neoliberalism approach for smart urban development; (ii) Theoretical contributions for urban planning that contextualises a modernist planning based on a multidimensional aspect to address quality of life for modern well-being and (iii) Smart planning for citizen satisfaction for the design and implementation of public governance reforms aimed at optimising urban planning management at the local level for smart urban city development. Conclusion There is strong theoretical and empirical support that is closely linked to sustainable development, happiness, public space, urban growth, urban areas, satisfied customers and urban residents. Future research should examine the relative weight of urban planning dimensions and effectiveness in the sustainable development of territories and citizen satisfaction.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results Of the 10777 records, 11 randomized controlled studies attained the inclusion criteria. The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Complexities in obturation and difficulties in disinfection are the major problems that make endodontic treatment very time-consuming. A new perspective is needed to reduce the working time as well as to answer these two problems. Until now, none of the established obturation techniques for root canal filling can guarantee a perfect seal. Solid substances cannot be manipulated easily to fill the tiny branches of the root canal system hermetically. At the same time, anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, especially Enterococcus faecalis, are very dominant in endodontic infections discussion. As shown in many studies, it is extremely difficult to perfectly disinfect Enterococcus faecalis even by using some irrigating solutions with strong antibacterial properties. Under anaerobic conditions, the invasion efficiency of facultative anaerobes is increased. In case irrigation and disinfection cannot totally eliminate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, a new strategy is also needed to deal with the bacteria that still survive in the root canal. Oxygen can fill the root canal system with ease, eliminate anaerobes, and prevent facultative anaerobes from being pathogenic. Therefore, using oxygen as obturation biomaterial after proper cleaning and shaping procedures is expected to solve the two major endodontic problems. The aim of this article was to discuss a new possible concept of dental restoration system that uses an oxygen-permeable membrane to decrease the time required in endodontic treatment. The membrane is placed at the orifice of a duct created to connect the entire root canal system with free air outside the restoration. The function of the membrane is more or less similar to the mask used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it enables the oxygen to circulate while preventing any fluid, debris, and microorganisms from passing. We hypothesize that the oxygen circulating in the root canal system will also act as an antimicrobial agent that is constantly renewed.

                Background Endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has been the gold standard since it was established in 1991. Various graft configurations have been developed to overcome the limitations of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), including contralateral gate cannulation (CGC). We propose a new device and technique intended to simplify endovascular AAA repair, along with reports of its application in six patients. Intervention The Taofan and Kang (T&K) bidirectional endovascular aortic repair (B-EVAR (B-EVAR) device uses a main-body stent graft, two-limb extensions, and bare metal stent. The procedure involved accessing the right and left femoral arteries, followed by standard aortography evaluation using a pigtail catheter through the contralateral femoral access. The main body stent graft is deployed through ipsilateral femoral access using a balloon catheter, while the contralateral gate is cannulated with a hydrophilic coated wire. Both balloons were inflated simultaneously to ensure that the wires were in different lumens. Contralateral and ipsilateral extensions were deployed using a limb extension stent graft. Standard aortography evaluation was repeated. Result T&K B-EVAR pilot procedures proved successful in various cases, from simple to complex anatomy, and even with varied graft stent deployment strategies. None of the patients had complications or prolonged length of stay (LOS). Follow-up CT did not reveal any high-pressure endoleaks. Conclusion T&K B-EVAR has been proven to simplify endovascular AAA repair in six patients with excellent results. It is also reproducible, potentially universally applicable, and can offer operators ease of use, faster procedure times, reduced fluoroscopy times, and reduced contrast usage.

                Background Excess nitrogen (N) loading to coastal ecosystems impairs estuarine water quality. Land management decisions made within estuarine watersheds have a direct impact on downstream N delivery. Natural features within watersheds can act as landscape sinks for N, such as wetlands, streams and ponds that transform dissolved N into gaseous N, effectively removing it from the aquatic system. Identifying and evaluating these landscape sinks and their spatial relationship to N sources can help managers understand the effects of alternative decisions on downstream resources. Methods The N-Sink approach uses widely available GIS data to identify landscape sinks within HUC-12 (or larger) catchments, estimate their N removal potential and map the effect of those sinks on N movement through the catchment. Static maps are produced to visualize N removal efficiency, transport and delivery, the latter in the form of an index. The R package nsink was developed to facilitate data acquisition, processing and visualization. Results nsink creates static maps for a specific HUC-12, or users can visit the University of Connecticut website to explore previously mapped areas. Users can investigate specific flowpaths interactively by clicking on any location within the catchment. A flowpath is generated with a table describing N removal along each segment. We describe the motivation behind developing nsink, discuss implementation in R, and present two use case examples. nsink is available from https://github.com/USEPA/nsink. Conclusions N-Sink is a decision support tool created for local decision-makers and NGOs to facilitate better understanding of the relationship between land use and downstream N delivery. Local decision-makers that have prioritized N mitigation in their long-term planning can use nsink to better understand the potential impact of proposed development projects, zoning variances, and land acquisition or restoration. nsink also allows resource economists to investigate the tradeoffs among different, often costly, N reduction strategies.

                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                <p>by John H. Tay, Arthur Kocher, Sebastian Duchene</p>

Our understanding of the evolution of many microbes has been revolutionised by the molecular clock, a statistical tool to infer evolutionary rates and timescales from analyses of biomolecular sequences. In all molecular clock models, evolutionary rates and times are jointly unidentifiable and ‘calibration’ information must therefore be used. For many organisms, sequences sampled at different time points can be employed for such calibration. Before attempting to do so, it is recommended to verify that the data carry sufficient information for molecular dating, a practice referred to as evaluation of temporal signal. Recently, a fully Bayesian approach, BETS (Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal), was proposed to overcome known limitations of other commonly used techniques such as root-to-tip regression or date randomisation tests. BETS requires the specification of a full Bayesian phylogenetic model, posing several considerations for untangling the impact of model choice on the detection of temporal signal. Here, we aimed to (i) explore the effect of molecular clock model and tree prior specification on the results of BETS and (ii) provide guidelines for improving our confidence in molecular clock estimates. Using microbial molecular sequence data sets and simulation experiments, we assess the impact of the tree prior and its hyperparameters on the accuracy of temporal signal detection. In particular, highly informative priors that are inconsistent with the data can result in the incorrect detection of temporal signal. In consequence, we recommend: (i) using prior predictive simulations to determine whether the prior generates a reasonable expectation of parameters of interest, such as the evolutionary rate and age of the root node, (ii) conducting prior sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the posterior to the choice of prior, and (iii) selecting a molecular clock model that reasonably describes the evolutionary process.

Prolyl-4-hydroxylase subunit alpha3 (P4HA3) is a triple helical procollagen synthesis protein. The role of P4HA3 in cancer development is not well known and lacks comprehensive analyses among human cancers. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between P4HA3 expression and anti-tumor immunity and its prognostic value in pan-cancer. P4HA3 expression was analyzed from TIMER2.0, GTEx, GEPIA2.0 and TCGA databases. Genetic and DNA methylation alterations, survival analysis and proteins co-expression analysis of P4HA3 in cBio Cancer Genomics Portal, TCGA, GSCA and TIMER2.0. The correlation between P4HA3 expression and immune infiltration was analyzed by TIDE, XCELL, MCPCOUNTER, and EPIC. We performed EdU and transwell experiments to evaluate the influence of P4HA3 on the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of different tumors. Patients derived xenograft (PDX) and subcutaneous transplantation models were utilized to explore the correlation between P4HA3 and immunotherapy response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Among 33 types of cancers, P4HA3 had generally different expression between different tumors, further analysis showed that the expression of P4HA3 was correlated with the cells infiltration of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The expression of P4HA3 was positively with the cell proliferation markers and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Moreover, P4HA3 deficiency inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of tumor cells, and promoted anti-tumor immunotherapy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. This pan-cancer analysis of P4HA3 provides a comprehensive understanding of its oncogenic and prognosis role in different cancers, P4HA3 abnormal expression could be a useful biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy in cancer patients.

                <p>by Jonathan Eden, Ekaterina Ivanova, Etienne Burdet</p>

Physically connected humans have been shown to exploit the exchange of haptic forces and tactile information to improve their performance in joint action tasks. As human interactions are increasingly mediated through robots and networks it is important to understand the impact that network features such as lag and noise may have on human behaviour. In this paper, we investigated interaction with a human-like robot controller that provides similar haptic communication behaviour as human-human interaction and examined the influence and compensation mechanisms for delay and noise on haptic communication. The results of our experiments show that participants can perceive a difference between noise and delay, and make use of compensation mechanisms to preserve performance in both cases. However, while noise is compensated for by increasing co-contraction, delay compensation could not be explained by this strategy. Instead, computational modelling suggested that a distinct mechanism is used to compensate for the delay and yield an efficient haptic communication.

<p>Eight alternative or off-label treatments have been identified that all have plausible mechanisms for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and some benefits in small, flawed clinical trials. Created with <a target="_blank"

<p>There are no dramatically effective pharmacological treatments for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a complex disease with multiple underlying mechanisms, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome alteration, and antiretroviral activity. We sifted through 15 years of reviews by a group called ALSUntangled to identify 8 alternative and off-label treatments that target ≥1 of these mechanisms, and have ≥1 human trial suggesting meaningful benefits. Given the overlapping pathological mechanisms of the highlighted products, we suggest that combinations of these treatments targeting diverse mechanisms might be worthwhile for future amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy development.
