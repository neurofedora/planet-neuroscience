              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Morphometric analysis of lungfish endocasts elucidates early dipnoan palaeoneurological evolution</a></h4>

              
                The lobe-finned fish, lungfish (Dipnoi, Sarcoptergii), have persisted for ~400 million years from the Devonian Period to present day. The evolution of their dermal skull and dentition is relatively well understood, but this is not the case for the central nervous system. While the brain has poor preservation potential and is not currently known in any fossil lungfish, substantial indirect information about it and associated structures (e.g. labyrinths) can be obtained from the cranial endocast. However, before the recent development of X-ray tomography as a palaeontological tool, these endocasts could not be studied non-destructively, and few detailed studies were undertaken. Here, we describe and illustrate the endocasts of six Palaeozoic lungfish from tomographic scans. We combine these with six previously described digital lungfish endocasts (4 fossil and 2 recent taxa) into a 12-taxon dataset for multivariate morphometric analysis using 17 variables. We find that the olfactory region is more highly plastic than the hindbrain, and undergoes significant elongation in several taxa. Further, while the semicircular canals covary as an integrated module, the utriculus and sacculus vary independently of each other. Functional interpretation suggests that olfaction has remained a dominant sense throughout lungfish evolution, and changes in the labyrinth may potentially reflect a change from nektonic to near-shore environmental niches. Phylogenetic implications show that endocranial form fails to support monophyly of the ‘chirodipterids’. Those with elongated crania similarly fail to form a distinct clade, suggesting these two paraphyletic groups have converged towards either head elongation or truncation driven by non-phylogenetic constraints.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Behavioral Receptive Field for Ocular Following in Monkeys: Spatial Summation and Its Spatial Frequency Tuning</a></h4>

              
                <p>In human and nonhuman primates, reflexive tracking eye movements can be initiated at very short latency in response to a rapid shift of the image. Previous studies in humans have shown that only a part of the central visual field is optimal for driving ocular following responses. Herein, we have investigated spatial summation of motion information, across a wide range of spatial frequencies and speeds of drifting gratings by recording short-latency ocular following responses in macaque monkeys. We show that the optimal stimulus size for driving ocular responses cover a small (diameter, &lt;20&deg;), central part of the visual field that shrinks with higher spatial frequency. This signature of linear motion integration remains invariant with speed and temporal frequency. For low and medium spatial frequencies, we found a strong suppressive influence from surround motion, evidenced by a decrease of response amplitude for stimulus sizes larger than optimal. Such suppression disappears with gratings at high frequencies. The contribution of peripheral motion was investigated by presenting grating annuli of increasing eccentricity. We observed an exponential decay of response amplitude with grating eccentricity, the decrease being faster for higher spatial frequencies. Weaker surround suppression can thus be explained by sparser eccentric inputs at high frequencies. A difference-of-Gaussians model best renders the antagonistic contributions of peripheral and central motions. Its best-fit parameters coincide with several, well known spatial properties of area MT neuronal populations. These results describe the mechanism by which central motion information is automatically integrated in a context-dependent manner to drive ocular responses.</p>

                Motivation: Genotyping error can impact downstream single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analyses. Simulating various modes and levels of error can help investigators better understand potential biases caused by miscalled genotypes. Methods: We have developed and validated vcferr, a tool to probabilistically simulate genotyping error and missingness in variant call format (VCF) files. We demonstrate how vcferr could be used to address a research question by introducing varying levels of error of different type into a sample in a simulated pedigree, and assessed how kinship analysis degrades as a function of the kind and type of error. Software availability: vcferr is available for installation via PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/vcferr/) or conda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/vcferr). The software is released under the MIT license with source code available on GitHub (https://github.com/signaturescience/vcferr)

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detecting, extracting, and mapping of inland surface water using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager: A case study of Pune district, India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Recent developments in optical satellite remote sensing have led to a new era in the detection of surface water with its changing dynamics. This study presents the creation of surface water inventory for a part of Pune district (an administrative area), in India using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and a multi spectral water indices method. Methods: A total of 13 Landsat 8 OLI cloud free images were analyzed for surface water detection. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) spectral index method was employed to enhance the water pixels in the image. Water and non-water areas in the map were discriminated using the threshold slicing method with a trial and error approach. The accuracy analysis based on kappa coefficient and percentage of the correctly classified pixels was presented by comparing MNDWI maps with corresponding Joint Research Centre (JRC) Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) images. The changes in the surface area of eight freshwater reservoirs within the study area (Bhama Askhed, Bhatghar, Chaskaman, Khadakwasala, Mulashi, Panshet, Shivrata, and Varasgaon) for the year 2016 were analyzed and compared to GSWE time series water databases for accuracy assessment. The annual water occurrence map with percentage water occurrence on a yearly basis was also prepared. Results: The kappa coefficient agreement between MNDWI images and GSWE images is in the range of 0.56 to 0.96 with an average agreement of 0.82 indicating a strong level of agreement. Conclusions: MNDWI is easy to implement and is a sufficiently accurate method to separate water bodies from satellite images. The accuracy of the result depends on the clarity of image and selection of an optimum threshold method. The resulting accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithm will improve with implementation of automatic threshold selection methods and comparative studies for other spectral indices methods.

                Background: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a life-threatening ailment caused by diabetes. Several growth factors, as well as their various combinations, have shown promising effect in aiding diabetic foot ulcer healing. However, contradictory or paradoxical results are often available, and debates about this issue are ongoing. Therefore, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and placebo in healing diabetic foot ulcers. Methods: The database search included relevant English literature from Cochrane Library, PubMed, Google Scholar, Elsevier, and EMBASE that was published between 2009 and 2021. Inclusion criteria included type 1 and 2 diabetic patients with foot wounds focusing on complete healing rate. Exclusion criteria included combined therapy, non-human studies, reviews, and protocols. To assess the quality of each study, biases regarding random sequence generation, allocation concealment, participant and personnel blinding, outcome assessment blinding and incomplete outcome data were thoroughly identified. Results: Eight randomized control trials comprising 620 patients (337 in EGF group, 283 in placebo group), were included in this meta-analysis. EGF achieved a significantly higher complete healing rate than placebo after four weeks of treatment, with relative risk (RR): 3.04 (0.50, 18.44) and heterogeneity (Chi2 = 6.46, df = 2 (P = 0.04) I2 = 69 %). Notably, the healing frequency in the placebo group was 17%, whereas the healing frequency in the epidermal growth factor group was 34%. Likewise, after eight weeks of treatment, the relative risk and heterogeneity were RR: 2.59 (1.42, 4.72) and (Chi2 =7.92, df= 4 (p= 0.09): I2= 49%), respectively. Moreover, the risk ratio at 12 weeks was RR: 1.01 (0.42, 2.46), and heterogeneity was (Chi2 =8.55, df= 2 (p= 0.01): I2= 77%). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that EGF significantly promotes wound healing, and could be recommended as an effective and safe treatment for DFUs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Heatmaps and consensus clustering for ego network exploration [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Researchers need visualization methods (using statistical and interactive techniques) to efficiently perform quality assessments and glean insights from their data. Data on networks can particularly benefit from more advanced techniques since typical visualization methods, such as node-link diagrams, can be difficult to interpret. We use heatmaps and consensus clustering on network data and show they can be combined to easily and efficiently explore nonparametric relationships among the variables and networks that comprise an ego network data set. Methods: We used ego network data from the Québec Adipose and Lifestyle Investigation in Youth (QUALITY) cohort used to evaluate this method. The data consists of 35 networks centered on individuals (egos), each containing a maximum of 10 nodes (alters). These networks are described through 41 variables: 11 describing the ego (e.g. fat mass percentage), 18 describing the alters (e.g. frequency of physical activity) and 12 describing the network structure (e.g. degree). Results: Four stable clusters were detected. Cluster one consisted of variables relating to the interconnectivity of the ego networks and the locations of interaction, cluster two consisted of the ego’s age, cluster three contained lifestyle variables and obesity outcomes and cluster four was comprised of variables measuring alter importance and diet. Conclusions: This exploratory method using heatmaps and consensus clustering on network data identified several important associations among variables describing the alters’ lifestyle habits and the egos’ obesity outcomes. Their relevance has been identified by studies on the effect of social networks on childhood obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thalamic deep brain stimulation paradigm to reduce consciousness: Cortico-striatal dynamics implicated in mechanisms of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle J. Redinbaugh, Mohsen Afrasiabi, Jessica M. Phillips, Niranjan A. Kambi, Sounak Mohanta, Aeyal Raz, Yuri B. Saalmann</p>

Anesthetic manipulations provide much-needed causal evidence for neural correlates of consciousness, but non-specific drug effects complicate their interpretation. Evidence suggests that thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can either increase or decrease consciousness, depending on the stimulation target and parameters. The putative role of the central lateral thalamus (CL) in consciousness makes it an ideal DBS target to manipulate circuit-level mechanisms in cortico-striato-thalamic (CST) systems, thereby influencing consciousness and related processes. We used multi-microelectrode DBS targeted to CL in macaques while recording from frontal, parietal, and striatal regions. DBS induced episodes of abnormally long, vacant staring with low-frequency oscillations here termed vacant, perturbed consciousness (VPC). DBS modulated VPC likelihood in a frequency-specific manner. VPC events corresponded to decreases in measures of neural complexity (entropy) and integration (Φ*), proposed indices of consciousness, and substantial changes to communication in CST circuits. During VPC, power spectral density and coherence at low frequencies increased across CST circuits, especially in thalamo-parietal and cortico-striatal pathways. Decreased consciousness and neural integration corresponded to shifts in cortico-striatal network configurations that dissociated parietal and subcortical structures. Overall, the features of VPC and implicated networks were similar to those of absence epilepsy. As this same multi-microelectrode DBS method–but at different stimulation frequencies–can also increase consciousness in anesthetized macaques, it can be used to flexibly address questions of consciousness with limited confounds, as well as inform clinical investigations of other consciousness disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The accuracy of absolute differential abundance analysis from relative count data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kimberly E. Roche, Sayan Mukherjee</p>

Concerns have been raised about the use of relative abundance data derived from next generation sequencing as a proxy for absolute abundances. For example, in the differential abundance setting, compositional effects in relative abundance data may give rise to spurious differences (false positives) when considered from the absolute perspective. In practice however, relative abundances are often transformed by renormalization strategies intended to compensate for these effects and the scope of the practical problem remains unclear. We used simulated data to explore the consistency of differential abundance calling on renormalized relative abundances versus absolute abundances and find that, while overall consistency is high, with a median sensitivity (true positive rates) of 0.91 and specificity (1—false positive rates) of 0.89, consistency can be much lower where there is widespread change in the abundance of features across conditions. We confirm these findings on a large number of real data sets drawn from 16S metabarcoding, expression array, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq experiments, where data sets with the greatest change between experimental conditions are also those with the highest false positive rates. Finally, we evaluate the predictive utility of summary features of relative abundance data themselves. Estimates of sparsity and the prevalence of feature-level change in relative abundance data give reasonable predictions of discrepancy in differential abundance calling in simulated data and can provide useful bounds for worst-case outcomes in real data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Local and collective transitions in sparsely-interacting ecological communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stav Marcus, Ari M. Turner, Guy Bunin</p>

Interactions in natural communities can be highly heterogeneous, with any given species interacting appreciably with only some of the others, a situation commonly represented by sparse interaction networks. We study the consequences of sparse competitive interactions, in a theoretical model of a community assembled from a species pool. We find that communities can be in a number of different regimes, depending on the interaction strength. When interactions are strong, the network of coexisting species breaks up into small subgraphs, while for weaker interactions these graphs are larger and more complex, eventually encompassing all species. This process is driven by the emergence of new allowed subgraphs as interaction strength decreases, leading to sharp changes in diversity and other community properties, and at weaker interactions to two distinct collective transitions: a percolation transition, and a transition between having a unique equilibrium and having multiple alternative equilibria. Understanding community structure is thus made up of two parts: first, finding which subgraphs are allowed at a given interaction strength, and secondly, a discrete problem of matching these structures over the entire community. In a shift from the focus of many previous theories, these different regimes can be traversed by modifying the interaction strength alone, without need for heterogeneity in either interaction strengths or the number of competitors per species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysis of the docking property of host variants of hACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 in a large cohort</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hyojung Paik, Jimin Kim, Sangjae Seo</p>

The recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is threatening global health. However, an understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with human cells, including the physical docking property influenced by the host’s genetic diversity, is still lacking. Here, based on germline variants in the UK Biobank covering 502,543 individuals, we revealed the molecular interactions between human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is the representative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, and COVID-19 infection. We identified six nonsense and missense variants of hACE2 from 2585 subjects in the UK Biobank covering 500000 individuals. Using our molecular dynamics simulations, three hACE2 variants from 2585 individuals we selected showed higher levels of binding free energy for docking in the range of 1.44–3.69 kcal/mol. Although there are diverse contributors to SARS-CoV-2 infections, including the mobility of individuals, we analyzed the diagnosis records of individuals with these three variants of hACE2. Our molecular dynamics simulations combined with population-based genomic data provided an atomistic understanding of the interaction between hACE2 and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

                Spatial and spatio-temporal data are used in a wide range of fields including environmental, health and social disciplines. Several packages in the statistical software R have been recently developed as clients for various databases to meet the growing demands for easily accessible and reliable spatial data. While documentation on how to use many of these packages exist, there is an increasing need for a one stop repository for tutorials on this information. In this paper, we present rspatialdata a website that provides a collection of data sources and tutorials on downloading and visualising spatial data using R. The website includes a wide range of datasets including administrative boundaries of countries, Open Street Map data, population, temperature, vegetation, air pollution, and malaria data. The goal of the website is to equip researchers and communities with the tools to engage in spatial data analysis and visualisation so that they can address important local issues, such as estimating air pollution, quantifying disease burdens, and evaluating and monitoring the United Nation’s sustainable development goals.

                Background: Rice cultivation is considered significant methane (CH4) emission source. Rice straw (RS) incorporation into the soil is a critical factor that produces higher CH4 emissions. The RS waterlogging approach on the soil surface potentially reduces CH4 emissions due to increasing RS decomposition in aerobic conditions. However, the hypothesis has not been entirely determined. The study aimed to examine CH4 emissions under RS waterlogging on surface water compared with RS incorporation into the soil. Methods: We carried out a microcosm experiment in a screen-house with two treatments, including (i) RS incorporation into the soil and (ii) RS waterlogging on the soil surface in triplicates. We compared the CH4 emissions and CH4 accumulation for the off-growing and rice-sowing periods. Yield-scaled CH 4 emission was assessed based on total methane emission and rice yield. Results: The results demonstrated that RS waterlogging reduced CH4 emissions by 16.9% compared to RS incorporation. During the rice-growing period, total CH4 emissions from RS waterlogging accounted for 36% of the incorporation treatment. Under RS waterlogging, high CH4 emissions during the off-sowing stage were disclosed. The difference between yield-scaled CH4 emissions was not significant. Conclusions: RS waterlogging is a feasible option to alternate conventional RS incorporation toward lower CH4 emissions from rice production. Ameliorating CH4 emission mitigation by RS waterlogging during off-sowing is recommended for future works.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with knowledge and awareness of stroke among the Lebanese population: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evaluation of the knowledge about stroke in the general population is extremely vital as it prevents stroke development, limits complications, and achieves better quality of life.  We assume that the general Lebanese population lacks awareness about stroke and its associated complications. This study aims to evaluate stroke knowledge and determine the factors associated with stroke awareness among the general Lebanese population. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics and the identification of risk factors, warning signs, stroke consequences, and early response to stroke symptoms. A total of 551 Lebanese adults without a history of stroke filled in an online self-reported questionnaire publicly shared on social applications. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with poor knowledge of stroke.  Results: Among the 551 participants enrolled, 403 (74.2%) were females and 312 (56.7%) were under 30 years of age. Females compared to males and employed compared to unemployed had significantly higher odds of identifying at least one risk factor (OR=4.3 [95%CI=1.1;16.8] and 6 [95%CI=1.2;29.6], respectively). Also, when compared to unemployed, employed participants had significantly higher odds of recognizing at least one of the early stroke symptoms (OR=3.3 [95%CI=1.2;8.9]) and identifying at least one of the stroke consequences (OR=5.3 [95%CI=1.1;25.9]). Reaching a university level of education compared to a school level was associated with significantly higher odds (OR=2.3 [95%CI=1.1;4.8]) of taking a patient to a hospital. Conclusion: Well-educated, employed, and female participants were more knowledgeable about stroke. Tailored interventions focusing on individuals with inadequate stroke literacy are needed. Further studies, more representative of the general Lebanese population with a larger sample size, are necessary to confirm our findings.

                Background: Islamic money market mutual funds have become an alternative to conventional investment instruments. This research has novelty in determining the variables of mutual fund performance by combining risk and return factors, asset allocation policy variables, and investment manager performance, which have a high impact on the return and risk level in reducing the risk of loss on investment. In addition, this research was conducted on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds that have not been studied before.  Methods: This research uses data on Islamic money market mutual funds registered with the Financial Services Authority in Indonesia. The performance of Islamic money market mutual funds was calculated using the Sharpe Method and tested using multiple regression analysis.  Results: The results showed that the asset allocation policy, investment manager performance, and the level of risk simultaneously have a significant effect on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds in Indonesia; however, partially, there is no significant effect between (1) the asset allocation policy on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds in Indonesia: (2) investment manager performance on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds in Indonesia, and (3) the level of risk on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds in Indonesia.   Conclusions: The results indicated that optimization of returns and risks was needed by considering the composition of asset allocation, choosing the right investment manager, and conducting a good risk level analysis to obtain optimal Islamic money market mutual fund performance.

                Cholesterol granuloma is a rare non-infectious disease. Currently, there are no established guidelines, leaving the clinician to decide the best practice for each patient. A 43-year-old woman presented to the Surgery Clinic at Siloam General Hospital, Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, with the primary complaint of a painful mass located in her left breast over the previous week before being admitted to the hospital. The mass was found abruptly and was accompanied by severe pain and fever. On inspection, peau d’orange, nipple retraction, tenderness, and warmth of the skin were observed. Ultrasonography suggested a malignant mass. The primary diagnosis was breast cancer, with a secondary differential diagnosis of breast abscess. An open biopsy was chosen because a breast abscess was the possible diagnosis. The biopsy results showed characteristics of cholesterol granuloma. Following the operation, the pain score was notably reduced as the operation showed a satisfactory result. The primary purpose of this case report was to illustrate a case of breast abscess caused by cholesterol granuloma, in which open excisional biopsy and drainage was superior for pain reduction and faster recovery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dental education during the pandemic – cross-sectional lecturer-side evaluation for the use of digital teaching concepts [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant restrictions on dental teaching. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the attitudes of faculty members towards digital teaching formats and the effort creating digital lectures. We hypothesized that on the lecturer side there is no difference between the various digital teaching concepts in terms of workload and effort and that there is no increase in workload and effort when switching to digital teaching concepts. Methods: All German dental faculties were invited to the online survey by an anonymous voluntary questionnaire from January to April 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions that could be answered with a visual analog scale, free text answers, or with fixed answer options. Data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and an exploratory data analysis (α=0.05). Results: Before the pandemic, 24.8% of the participating lecturers were using digital teaching and 64.4% had no previous experience. After the outbreak of the pandemic 100% of the dental teaching was initially held online. More than 80% of the lecturers stated that they offer online lectures (86.1%), online seminars (81.2%), and/or online bedside teaching (33.7%). 88.1% see face-to-face teaching as the preferred teaching format. The lecturers also see the greatest opportunities for interaction in the area of analog teaching and significantly worse in synchronous and asynchronous digital teaching. In the course of the pandemic, respondents' attitudes towards online teaching improved in the median of 24.0 to a median of 50.0. Conclusions: Faculty members have positively changed their attitudes towards online teaching formats over the course of the pandemic. Although they see the greatest learning success in conventional face-to-face teaching formats and the creation of digital lectures is associated with a higher effort, they want more online lessons in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of ingestion of red dragon fruit extract on levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase after strenuous exercise in rats (Rattus norvegicus) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prolonged activation of skeletal muscles causes a decrease in the production of fatigue. Exercise with strenuous intensity causes an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). An increase in free radicals causes oxidative stress resulting in damage to cell function to mitochondrial dysfunction, and fatigue. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant potential of red dragon fruit (RDF) to delay fatigue due to oxidative stress, which improves cell function in mitochondria. Methods: 25 male rats (Rattus norvegicus) aged three months were divided into five groups: Group K1 was N.A. (No Activity) but drinking and eating; Group K2 performed strenuous exercise without RDF treatment; Groups 3, 4, and 5 (P1, P2 and P3, respectively) performed strenuous exercise and were treated with 75 mg kg-1.bw, 150 mg kg-1.bw, and 300 mg kg-1.bw of RDF extract, respectively. The exercise for the rats involved intense swimming for 20 minutes every day, four days a week for 31 days.  Malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured with the ELISA and histopathology for muscle soleus and lung tissue. Results: Strenuous exercise followed by RDF extract ingestion was compared for fatigue in terms of duration and time; before (24.55±1.38 minute) and after (95.31±7.82 minute) and led to a significant difference of 39% (p<0.01). The study also compared MDA before and after RDF extract ingestion in the K2 vs. the P1 group (p<0.05). At the same time, P2 differed more significantly (p<0.01). This indicated a spread of free radicals and featured histopathological damage of muscle cells. However, ingestion of RDF extract leads to improvement of soleus muscle cells; thus, repairs cell function, delaying fatigue. Conclusion: This study confirmed that strenuous exercise, which causes an increase in ROS, intensifies free radicals with RDF extract ingestion and declines oxidative stress, repairing cell function and delaying fatigue.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of natural products use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity and hospitalization: A self-reported cross-sectional survey study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using available resources is essential to reduce the health burden of disease. The severity of COVID-19 is affected by nutritional status. In this study the effect of natural product use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity and hospitalization was explored. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Between March and July 2021, a self-administered survey was conducted in Jordan. Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were ≥18 years old were the study population. Study measures included the use of natural products, COVID-19 severity, and hospitalization status. A multivariate regression model was used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age (mean ± SD) of the study sample (n=2,148) was 40.25 ± 15.58 years old. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the regular intake of carnation (OR [0.56], CI [0.37–0.85]), onion (OR [0.69], CI [0.52–0.92]), lemon (OR [0.68], CI [0.51–0.90]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.66], CI [0.50–0.89]) before infection were associated with a substantial reduction in COVID-19 severity (P<0.01). Also, the consumption of carnation (OR [0.55], CI [0.34–0.88]), lemon (OR [0.57], CI [0.42–0.78]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.61], CI [0.44–0.84]) were associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of COVID-19-induced hospitalization (P<0.01). Conclusions: Regular consumption of carnation, lemon, and citrus fruits before infection was associated with better outcomes for COVID-19. Studies on other populations are required to confirm these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has metastasis to the orbit, consequences in anaemia: A paediatric unusual case of Bangladesh. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a significant risk of spreading to other parts of the body early, orbital and ocular surrounding tissues metastases are uncommon. Case Report: This paper described a 16-year-old patient diagnosed with a locally advanced NPC and ocular metastasis and was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. One of the rare early presentations is orbital metastases with vision problems. Discussion: Orbital metastases in children are considerably more uncommon. Cachexia and malnutrition are prevalent problems in people with cancer, affecting life and longevity. Anaemia is a severe issue for nasopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Conclusion: Orbital metastases frequently arise in advanced stages of the disease and in the scenario of many metastases the persistence of therapy and the nasopharyngeal cancer patient's standard of living is linked to the occurrence of anaemia. In addition, to predict the prognosis of individuals with NPC, pretreatment laboratory profiles should be evaluated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The human amniotic epithelium confers a bias to differentiate toward the neuroectoderm lineage in human embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) derive from the epiblast and have pluripotent potential. To maintain the conventional conditions of the pluripotent potential in an undifferentiated state, inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (iMEF) is used as a feeder layer. However, it has been suggested that hESC under this conventional condition (hESC-iMEF) is an artifact that does not correspond to the <i>in vitro</i> counterpart of the human epiblast. Our previous studies demonstrated the use of an alternative feeder layer of human amniotic epithelial cells (hAEC) to derive and maintain hESC. We wondered if the hESC-hAEC culture could represent a different pluripotent stage than that of naïve or primed conventional conditions, simulating the stage in which the amniotic epithelium derives from the epiblast during peri-implantation. Like the conventional primed hESC-iMEF, hESC-hAEC has the same levels of expression as the 'pluripotency core'; and does not express markers of naïve pluripotency. However, it presents a downregulation of HOX genes and genes associated with the endoderm and mesoderm and it exhibits an increase in the expression of ectoderm lineage genes, specifically in the anterior neuroectoderm. Transcriptome analysis showed in hESC-hAEC an upregulated signature of genes coding for transcription factors involved in neural induction and forebrain development, and the ability to differentiate into a neural lineage was superior in comparison with conventional hESC-iMEF. We propose that the interaction of hESC with hAEC confers hESC a biased potential that resembles the anteriorized epiblast, which is predisposed to form the neural ectoderm.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A single exposure to altered auditory feedback causes observable sensorimotor adaptation in speech</a></h4>

              
                Sensory errors induce two types of behavioral changes: rapid compensation within a movement and longer-term adaptation of subsequent movements. Although adaptation is hypothesized to occur whenever a sensory error is perceived (including after a single exposure to altered feedback), adaptation of articulatory movements in speech has only been observed after repeated exposure to auditory perturbations, questioning both current theories of speech sensorimotor adaptation as well as the universality of more general theories of adaptation. We measured single-exposure or 'one-shot' learning in a large dataset in which participants were exposed to intermittent, unpredictable perturbations of their speech acoustics. On unperturbed trials immediately following these perturbed trials, participants adjusted their speech to oppose the preceding shift, demonstrating that learning occurs even after a single exposure to auditory error. These results provide critical support for current theories of sensorimotor adaptation in speech and align speech more closely with learning in other motor domains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-uniform distribution of dendritic nonlinearities differentially engages thalamostriatal and corticostriatal inputs onto cholinergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                The tonic activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) is modified differentially by their afferent inputs. Although their unitary synaptic currents are identical, in most CINs cortical inputs onto distal dendrites only weakly entrain them, whereas proximal thalamic inputs trigger abrupt pauses in discharge in response to salient external stimuli. To test whether the dendritic expression of the active conductances that drive autonomous discharge contribute to the CINs' capacity to dissociate cortical from thalamic inputs, we used an optogenetics-based method to quantify dendritic excitability in mouse CINs. We found that the persistent sodium (NaP) current gave rise to dendritic boosting, and that the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current gave rise to a subhertz membrane resonance. This resonance may underlie our novel finding of an association between CIN pauses and internally-generated slow wave events in sleeping non-human primates. Moreover, our method indicated that dendritic NaP and HCN currents were preferentially expressed in proximal dendrites. We validated the non-uniform distribution of NaP currents: pharmacologically; with two-photon imaging of dendritic back-propagating action potentials; and by demonstrating boosting of thalamic, but not cortical, inputs by NaP currents. Thus, the localization of active dendritic conductances in CIN dendrites mirrors the spatial distribution of afferent terminals and may promote their differential responses to thalamic <i>vs.</i> cortical inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metabolic requirement for GOT2 in pancreatic cancer depends on environmental context</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial glutamate-oxaloacetate (GOT2) is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), a mechanism by which cells transfer reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondria. GOT2 is a key component of mutant KRAS (KRAS*)-mediated rewiring of glutamine metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Here, we demonstrate that the loss of GOT2 disturbs redox homeostasis and halts proliferation of PDA cells in vitro. GOT2 knockdown (KD) in PDA cell lines in vitro induced NADH accumulation, decreased Asp and α-ketoglutarate (αKG) production, stalled glycolysis, disrupted the TCA cycle, and impaired proliferation. Oxidizing NADH through chemical or genetic means resolved the redox imbalance induced by GOT2 KD, permitting sustained proliferation. Despite a strong in vitro inhibitory phenotype, loss of GOT2 had no effect on tumor growth in xenograft PDA or autochthonous mouse models. We show that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment (TME), release the redox active metabolite pyruvate, and culturing GOT2 KD cells in CAF conditioned media (CM) rescued proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, blocking pyruvate import or pyruvate-to-lactate reduction prevented rescue of GOT2 KD in vitro by exogenous pyruvate or CAF CM. However, these interventions failed to sensitize xenografts to GOT2 KD in vivo, demonstrating the remarkable plasticity and differential metabolism deployed by PDA cells in vitro and in vivo. This emphasizes how the environmental context of distinct pre-clinical models impacts both cell-intrinsic metabolic rewiring and metabolic crosstalk with the tumor microenvironment (TME).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cancer type classification using plasma cell-free RNAs derived from human and microbes</a></h4>

              
                The utility of cell-free nucleic acids in monitoring cancer has been recognized by both scientists and clinicians. In addition to human transcripts, a fraction of cell-free nucleic acids in human plasma were proven to be derived from microbes and reported to have relevance to cancer. To obtain a better understanding of plasma cell-free RNAs (cfRNAs) in cancer patients, we profiled cfRNAs in ~300 plasma samples of 5 cancer types (colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, and esophageal cancer) and healthy donors (HDs) with RNA-seq. Microbe-derived cfRNAs were consistently detected by different computational methods when potential contaminations were carefully filtered. Clinically relevant signals were identified from human and microbial reads, and enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of downregulated human genes and higher prevalence torque teno viruses both suggest that a fraction of cancer patients were immunosuppressed. Our data support the diagnostic value of human and microbe-derived plasma cfRNAs for cancer detection, as an area under the ROC curve of approximately 0.9 for distinguishing cancer patients from HDs was achieved. Moreover, human and microbial cfRNAs both have cancer type specificity, and combining two types of features could distinguish tumors of five different primary locations with an average recall of 60.4%. Compared to using human features alone, adding microbial features improved the average recall by approximately 8%. In summary, this work provides evidence for the clinical relevance of human and microbe-derived plasma cfRNAs and their potential utilities in cancer detection as well as the determination of tumor sites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolutionary history of human spindle genes includes back-and-forth gene flow with Neandertals</a></h4>

              
                Proteins associated with the spindle apparatus, a cytoskeletal structure that ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division, experienced an unusual number of amino acid substitutions in modern humans after the split from the ancestors of Neandertals and Denisovans. Here, we analyze the history of these substitutions and show that some of the genes in which they occur may have been targets of positive selection. We also find that the two changes in the kinetochore scaffold 1 (KNL1) protein, previously believed to be specific to modern humans, were present in some Neandertals. We show that the <i>KNL1</i> gene of these Neandertals shared a common ancestor with present-day Africans about 200,000 years ago due to gene flow from the ancestors (or relatives) of modern humans into Neandertals. Subsequently, some non-Africans inherited this modern human-like gene variant from Neandertals, but none inherited the ancestral gene variants. These results add to the growing evidence of early contacts between modern humans and archaic groups in Eurasia and illustrate the intricate relationships among these groups.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Engineered natural killer cells impede the immunometabolic CD73-adenosine axis in solid tumors</a></h4>

              
                Immunometabolic reprogramming due to adenosine produced by CD73 (encoded by the 5'-ectonucleotidase gene <i>NT5E</i>) is a recognized immunosuppressive mechanism contributing to immune evasion in solid tumors. Adenosine is not only known to contribute to tumor progression, but it has specific roles in driving dysfunction of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we engineered human NK cells to directly target the CD73-adenosine axis by blocking the enzymatic activity of CD73. In doing so, the engineered NK cells not only impaired adenosinergic metabolism driven by the hypoxic uptake of ATP by cancer cells in a model of non-small-cell lung cancer, but also mediated killing of tumor cells due to the specific recognition of overexpressed CD73. This resulted in a 'single agent' immunotherapy that combines antibody specificity, blockade of purinergic signaling, and killing of targets mediated by NK cells. We also showed that CD73-targeted NK cells are potent <i>in vivo</i> and result in tumor arrest, while promoting NK cell infiltration into CD73<sup>+</sup> tumors and enhancing intratumoral activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correspondence between the layered structure of deep language models and temporal structure of natural language processing in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Deep language models (DLMs) provide a novel computational paradigm for how the brain processes natural language. Unlike symbolic, rule-based models from psycholinguistics, DLMs encode words and their context as continuous numerical vectors. These "embeddings" are constructed by a sequence of layered computations to ultimately capture surprisingly sophisticated representations of linguistic structures. How does this layered hierarchy map onto the human brain during natural language comprehension? In this study, we used ECoG to record neural activity in language areas along the superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus while human participants listened to a 30-minute spoken narrative. We supplied this same narrative to a high-performing DLM (GPT2-XL) and extracted the contextual embeddings for each word in the story across all 48 layers of the model. We next trained a set of linear encoding models to predict the temporally-evolving neural activity from the embeddings at each layer. We found a striking correspondence between the layer-by-layer sequence of embeddings from GPT2-XL and the temporal sequence of neural activity in language areas. In addition, we found evidence for the gradual accumulation of recurrent information along the linguistic processing hierarchy. However, we also noticed additional neural processes that took place in the brain, but not in DLMs, during the processing of surprising (unpredictable) words. These findings point to a connection between language processing in humans and DLMs where the layer-by-layer accumulation of contextual information in DLM embeddings matches the temporal dynamics of neural activity in high-order language areas.

                Individual differences in striatal dopamine synthesis capacity have been associated with working memory capacity, trait impulsivity and spontaneous eye-blink rate (sEBR), as measured with readily available and easily administered, off-the-shelf tests. Such findings have raised the suggestion that individual variation in dopamine synthesis capacity, estimated with expensive and invasive brain positron emission tomography (PET) scans, can be approximated with simple, more pragmatic tests. However, direct evidence for the relationship between these simple trait measures and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity has been limited and inconclusive. We measured striatal dopamine synthesis capacity using [18F]-FDOPA PET in a large sample of healthy volunteers (N=94) and assessed the correlation with simple, short tests of working memory capacity, trait impulsivity, and sEBR. We additionally explored the relationship with an index of subjective reward sensitivity. None of these trait measures correlated significantly with striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, nor did they have out-of-sample predictive power. Bayes Factor analyses indicated the evidence was in favor of absence of correlations for all but subjective reward sensitivity. These results warrant caution for using these off-the-shelf trait measures as proxies of striatal dopamine synthesis capacity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perturbations of a causal synaptic molecular network in autism and schizophrenia revealed with multiplexed imaging</a></h4>

              
                The complex functions of neuronal synapses in the central nervous system depend on their tightly interacting, compartmentalized molecular network of hundreds of proteins spanning the pre- and post-synaptic sites. This biochemical system is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, with identified common synaptopathologies and numerous risk genes associated with synaptic function. However, it remains unclear how the synaptic molecular network is altered in these disorders, and whether effects are common to distinct genetic perturbations. Here, we applied PRISM, a quantitative single-synapse multiplexed imaging technique, to systematically probe the effects of RNAi knockdown of 16 autism- and schizophrenia-associated genes on the simultaneous distribution of 10 synaptic proteins. This enabled the identification of novel phenotypes in synapse compositions and distributions. We applied Bayesian network inference to construct and validate a predictive model of causal hierarchical dependencies among eight proteins of the excitatory synapse. The resulting conditional dependence relationships could only be accessed via measurement which is both single-synapse and multiprotein, unique to PRISM. Finally, we show that central features of the network are similarly affected across distinct gene knockdowns. These results offer insight into the convergent molecular etiology of these debilitating, hereditary and highly polygenic disorders, as well as offering a novel, general framework for probing subcellular molecular networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel processing relies on a distributed, low-dimensional cortico-cerebellar architecture</a></h4>

              
                A characteristic feature of human cognition is our ability to 'multi-task' - performing two or more tasks in parallel - particularly when one task is well-learned. How the brain supports this capacity remains poorly understood. Most past studies have focussed on identifying the areas of the brain - typically the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - that are required to navigate information processing bottlenecks. In contrast, we take a systems neuroscience approach to test the hypothesis that the capacity to conduct effective parallel processing relies on a distributed architecture that interconnects the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum. The latter structure contains over half of the neurons in the adult human brain, and is well-suited to support the fast, effective, dynamic sequences required to perform tasks relatively automatically. By delegating stereotyped within-task computations to the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex can be freed up to focus on the more challenging aspects of performing the tasks in parallel. To test this hypothesis, we analysed task-based fMRI data from 50 participants who performed a task in which they either balanced an avatar on a screen ('Balance'), performed serial-7 subtractions ('Calculation') or performed both in parallel ('Dual-Task'). Using a set of approaches that include dimensionality reduction, structure-function coupling and time-varying functional connectivity, we provide robust evidence in support of our hypothesis. We conclude that distributed interactions between the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are crucially involved in parallel processing in the human brain.

                Emotionally expressive faces evoke enhanced neural responses in multiple brain regions, a phenomenon thought to depend critically on the amygdala. This emotion-related modulation is evident even in primary visual cortex (V1), providing a potential neural substrate by which emotionally salient stimuli can affect perception. How does emotional valence information, computed in the amygdala, reach V1? Here we use high-resolution functional MRI to investigate the layer profile and retinotopic distribution of neural activity specific to emotional facial expressions. Across three experiments, human participants viewed centrally presented face stimuli varying in emotional expression and performed a gender judgment task. We found that facial valence sensitivity was evident only in superficial cortical layers and was not restricted to the retinotopic location of the stimuli, consistent with diffuse feedback-like projections from the amygdala. Together, our results provide a feedback mechanism by which the amygdala directly modulates activity at the earliest stage of visual processing.

                Voxel-wise encoding models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art predictive models of brain activity evoked by natural movies. Despite the superior predictive performance of CNN-based models, the huge number of parameters in these models have made them difficult to interpret for domain experts. Here, we investigate the role of model compression in building more interpretable and more stable CNN-based voxel-wise models. We used (1) structural compression techniques to prune less important CNN filters and connections, (2) a receptive field compression method to choose the model receptive fields with optimal center and size, and (3) principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the model. We demonstrate that the compressed models offer a more stable interpretation of voxel-wise pattern selectivity compared to uncompressed models. Furthermore, our receptive field compressed models reveal that the optimal model receptive fields become larger along the ventral visual pathway, as the receptive fields become more centralized. Overall, our findings unveil the role of model compression in building more interpretable voxel-wise models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amplified cortical neural responses as animals learn to use novel activity patterns</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral cortex supports representations of the world in patterns of neural activity, used by the brain to make decisions and guide behavior. Past work has found diverse or limited changes in the primary sensory cortex in response to learning, suggesting the key computations might occur in downstream regions. Alternatively, sensory cortical changes may be central to learning. To study changes in sensory cortical representations, we trained mice to recognize entirely novel, non-sensory patterns of cortical activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) created by direct optogenetic stimulation. As animals learned to use these novel patterns, we found their detection abilities improved by an order of magnitude or more. The behavioral change was accompanied by large increases in V1 neural responses to fixed optogenetic input. Neural response amplification to novel optogenetic inputs had little effect on existing visual sensory responses. Amplification would seem to be desirable to improve decision-making in a detection task, and thus these data suggest adult cortical plasticity plays a significant role in improving the detection of novel sensory inputs during learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">S-EBM: Generalising event-based modelling of disease progression for simultaneous events</a></h4>

              
                Estimating the temporal evolution of biomarker abnormalities in disease informs understanding of early disease processes and facilitates subject staging, which may augment the development of early therapeutic interventions and provide personalised treatment tools. Event-based modelling of disease progression (EBM) is a data-driven technique for inferring a sequence of biomarker abnormalities, or events, from cross-sectional or short-term longitudinal datasets and has been applied to a variety of different diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventional EBM (C-EBM) assumes the sequence of biomarker abnormalities occurs in series, with one biomarker event per disease progression stage. However, events may occur simultaneously, for example due to the presence of shared causal factors, a property which cannot be inferred from C-EBM. Here we introduce simultaneous EBM (S-EBM), a generalisation of C-EBM to enable estimation of simultaneous events. S-EBM can estimate a wider range of sequence types than C-EBM while being fully backward compatible with the original model. Using simulated data, we firstly demonstrate the inability of C-EBM to infer simultaneous events. We next assess the accuracy of S-EBM against ground truth data and subsequently demonstrate a real-world example application to sequence disease progression in AD. Simulations show that C-EBM can not discern serial events with high biomarker variance from simultaneous events, preventing its use for inferring simultaneous events. S-EBM has high estimation accuracy against ground truth for a range of sequence types (fully simultaneous, partially simultaneous, serial), number of biomarkers and biomarker variances. When applied to Alzheimer's disease biomarker data from ADNI, S-EBM estimated a sequence where events within sets of biomarker domains occur simultaneously. Accumulation of total and phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid; performance on RAVLT, ADAS-Cog and MMSE cognitive test scores; and volumetric decline in temporal regional brain volumes, were better described as groups of simultaneous events rather than a single set of serial events (likelihood ratio >> 1,000). Furthermore, C-EBM may be confidently incorrect regarding the serial ordering. S-EBM may be applied to prospective and retrospective biomarker data to refine understanding of disease progression and generate new hypotheses regarding disease aetiology and spread.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of age and sex on dendritic D2 autoreceptor inhibition in substantia nigra dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons are required for voluntary movement and reward learning, and advanced age is associated with motor and cognitive decline. In the midbrain, D2-type autoreceptors located on dendrodendritic synapses between dopamine neurons control cell firing through G protein-activated potassium (GIRK) channels. We previously showed that aging disrupts dopamine neuron pacemaker firing in mice, but only in males. Here we show that D2-receptor inhibitory postsynaptic currents (D2-IPSCs) in aged male mice are moderately smaller compared to young males as well as females, regardless of age. Local application of dopamine revealed a reduction in the amplitude of the D2-receptor currents in old males compared to young, pointing to a postsynaptic mechanism that could not be explained by impairment of the GIRK channels or degeneration of the dendritic arbor. Kinetic analysis showed no differences in D2-IPSCs in old versus young mice or between sexes. Potentiation of D2-IPSCs by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is also conserved in aging, indicating preservation of plasticity mechanisms. These findings have implications for understanding dopamine transmission in aging in both sexes and could explain in part the increased susceptibility of males to SNc degeneration of dopamine neurons in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD).

                Cell type is hypothesized to be a key determinant of the role of a neuron within a circuit. However, it is unknown whether a neuron's transcriptomic type influences the timing of its activity in the intact brain. In other words, can transcriptomic cell type be extracted from the time series of a neuron's activity? To address this question, we developed a new deep learning architecture that learns features of interevent intervals across multiple timescales (milliseconds to >30 min). We show that transcriptomic cell class information is robustly embedded in the timing of single neuron activity recorded in the intact brain of behaving animals (calcium imaging and extracellular electrophysiology), as well as in a bio-realistic model of visual cortex. In contrast, we were unable to reliably extract cell identity from summary measures of rate, variance, and interevent interval statistics. We applied our analyses to the question of whether transcriptomic subtypes of excitatory neurons represent functionally distinct classes. In the calcium imaging dataset, which contains a diverse set of excitatory Cre lines, we found that a subset of excitatory cell types are computationally distinguishable based upon their Cre lines, and that excitatory types can be classified with higher accuracy when considering their cortical layer and projection class. Here we address the fundamental question of whether a neuron, within a complex cortical network, embeds a fingerprint of its transcriptomic identity into its activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter connectivity in uncinate fasciculus accounts for visual attention span in developmental dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                The present study aimed to investigate the role of connectivity disruptions in two fiber pathways, the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and the frontal aslant tract (FAT), in developmental dyslexia and determine the relationship between the connectivity of these pathways and behavioral performance in children with dyslexia. A total of 26 French children with dyslexia and 31 age-matched control children were included. Spherical deconvolution tractography was used to reconstruct the two fiber pathways. Hindrance-modulated oriented anisotropy (HMOA) was used to measure the connectivity of each fiber pathway in both hemispheres. The boys with dyslexia showed reduced HMOA in the UF compared to control boys, but this difference was not observed in girls. Furthermore, HMOA of the UF correlated with individual differences in the visual attention span in participants with dyslexia. All significant results found in HMOA of the UF were verified in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the UF using standard diffusion imaging model. This study suggests a differential sex effect on the connectivity disruption in the UF in developmental dyslexia. It also indicates that the UF may play an essential role in the visual attention span deficit in developmental dyslexia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The specificity of different-distance connections in human structural connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Brain structural connectomes underpin complex cognitive processes. To date, abundant organizational features have been distilled by network-based tools, including hubs, modules, and small-worldness. However, these features are often devoid of spatial characteristics which directly shape connection formation. By considering the spatial embedding of brain networks, we reveal the connection specificity, that is, the similarity of similar-distance connections and the dissimilarity of different-distance connections. It is induced by the whole-brain connection length distribution, allowing areas to send and receive diverse signals through different-distance connections. Based on it, areas' functional repertoires are associated with their connection length profiles, and meanwhile, length dispersion and clustering coefficients can be integrated into a hierarchy whose age-related degeneration may be related to cognitive decline. These results construct a putative bridge between brain spatial, topological, and functional features, expanding our understanding of how different architectures complement and reinforce each other to achieve complicated brain functions.

	<p>Neurological disorders are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular factors and uremic toxins are involved with cognitive impairment in CKD. In addition, vascular dementia-induced alterations in the structure and function of the hippocampus can lead to deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. However, regardless of this clinical evidence, the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in patients with CKD is not fully understood. We used male Sprague Dawley rats and performed 5/6 nephrectomy to observe the changes in behavior, field excitatory postsynaptic potential, and immunostaining of the hippocampus following CKD progression. We measured the hippocampus volume on magnetic resonance imaging scans in the controls (n = 34) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) hemodialysis patients (n = 42). In four cognition-related behavior assays, including novel object recognition, Y-maze, Barnes maze, and classical contextual fear conditioning, we identified deficits in spatial working memory, learning and memory, and contextual memory, as well as the ability to distinguish familiar and new objects, in the rats with CKD. Immunohistochemical staining of Na+/H+ exchanger1 was increased in the hippocampus of the CKD rat models. We performed double immunofluorescent staining for aquaporin-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein and then verified the high coexpression in the hippocampus of the CKD rat model. Furthermore, results from recoding of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the hippocampus showed the reduced amplitude and slope of fEPSP in the CKD rats. ESRD patients with cognitive impairment showed a significant decrease in the hippocampus volume compared with ESRD patients without cognitive impairment or the controls. Our findings suggest that uremia resulting from decreased kidney function may cause the destruction of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and hippocampus-related cognitive impairment in CKD.</p>

	<p>Background: Frameless robot-assisted deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an innovative technique for leads implantation. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of this technique using the Sinovation SR1 robot. Methods: 35 patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease who accepted conventional frame-based DBS surgery (n = 18) and frameless robot-assisted DBS surgery (n = 17) by the same group of neurosurgeons were analyzed. The coordinate of the tip of the intended trajectory was recorded as xi, yi, and zi. The actual position of lead implantation was recorded as xa, ya, and za. The vector error was calculated by the formula of &amp;amp;radic;(xi &amp;amp;minus; xa)2 + (yi &amp;amp;minus; ya)2 + (zi &amp;amp;minus; za)2 to evaluate the accuracy. Results: The vector error was 1.52 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.53 mm (range: 0.20&amp;amp;ndash;2.39 mm) in the robot-assisted group and was 1.77 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.67 mm (0.59&amp;amp;ndash;2.98 mm) in the frame-based group with no significant difference between two groups (p = 0.1301). In 10.7% (n = 3) frameless robot-assisted implanted leads, the vector error was greater than 2.00 mm with a maximum offset of 2.39 mm, and in 35.5% (n = 11) frame-based implanted leads, the vector error was larger than 2.00 mm with a maximum offset of 2.98 mm. Leads were more posterior than planned trajectories in the robot-assisted group and more medial and posterior in the conventional frame-based group. Conclusions: Awake frameless robot-assisted DBS surgery was comparable to the conventional frame-based technique in the accuracy and precision for leads implantation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification and targeting of a unique NaV1.7 domain driving chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Despite identification of several small molecules directly targeting the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, none has been clinically successful. We reported that preventing addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) on the NaV1.7-interacting cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) blocked NaV1.7 functions and was antinociceptive in rodents. Here, we discovered a 15 amino acid CRMP2 regulatory sequence (CRS) unique to NaV1.7 that is essential for this regulatory coupling. CRMP2 preferentially bound to the NaV1.7 CRS over other isoforms. Substitution of the NaV1.7 CRS with the homologous domains from the other eight voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms decreased tetrodotoxin-sensitive NaV1.7 currents in rodent sensory neurons. A cell-penetrant version of NaV1.7-CRS reduced NaV1.7 currents and trafficking, decreased presynaptic NaV1.7 localization, reduced spinal neurotransmitter release, and reversed mechanical allodynia in a rat spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. Interfering with NaV1.7-CRMP2 coupling did not produce motor impairment and spared thermal, inflammatory, and post-surgical nociception. As proof-of-concept for NaV1.7-targeted gene therapy, we found that NaV1.7-CRS packaged into an adeno-associated virus recapitulated the effects on NaV1.7 function in both rodent and rhesus macaque sensory neurons and both reversed and prevented the development of mechanical allodynia in a neuropathic pain model in male and female rodents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In-vivo fast non-linear microscopy reveals impairment of fast axonal transport induced by molecular motor imbalances in the brain of zebrafish larvae</a></h4>

              
                Cargo transport by molecular motors along microtubules is essential for the function of eucaryotic cells, in particular neurons in which axonal transport defects constitute the early pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Mainly studied in motor and sensory neurons, axonal transport is still difficult to characterize in neurons of the brain in absence of appropriate in vivo tools. Here, we measured fast axonal transport by tracing the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) nanocrystals endocytosed by brain neurons of zebrafish (Zf) larvae. Thanks to the optical translucency of Zf larvae and of the perfect photostability of nanoKTP SHG, we achieved a high scanning speed of 20 frames (of {approx}90 mx60 m size) per second in Zf brain. We focused our study on endosomal transport in axons of known polarization, separately analyzing kinesin and dynein motor-driven displacements. To validate our assay, we used either loss-of-function mutations of dynein or kinesin 1 or the dynein inhibitor dynapyrazole, and quantified several transport parameters. We successfully demonstrated that dynapyrazole reduces nanoKTP mobile fraction and retrograde run length consistently, while the retrograde run length increased in kinesin 1 mutants. Taking advantage of nanoKTP SHG directional emission, we also quantified fluctua- tions of endosome orientation. Thus, by combining endocytosis of nanocrystals having non-linear response, fast two-photon microscopy, and high-throughput analysis, we are able to finely monitor fast axonal transport in vivo in the brain of a vertebrate, and re- veal subtle axonal transport alterations. The high spatiotemporal resolution achieved in our model may be relevant to precisely investigate axonal transport impairment associated to disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromechanical Coupling is Reflected in the Spatial Organization of the Spinal Motoneuron Pools</a></h4>

              
                The anatomy of muscles is complex, so that a given movement can result from the activity of multiple muscle combinations, a concept termed redundancy. The central nervous system must resolve this redundancy to produce coordinated and efficient motion. One proposed mechanism that simplifies motor control is through the neural embedding of musculoskeletal dynamics. We have shown previously that the musculoskeletal anatomy of the upper extremity is organized in functional agonistic and antagonistic groups through mechanical coupling. However, it remains unknown if the neural anatomy of the spinal motoneuron pools somatotopically embeds this musculoskeletal anatomy. Here, we develop a three-dimensional model of the macaque cervical spinal cord and a corresponding OpenSim model of the upper extremity to characterize the structure-function relationship of spinal motoneurons innervating upper limb musculature. We hypothesize that the motoneuron pools of agonistic muscles that perform a coordinated action are located closer together in the spinal cord compared to antagonistic muscles. We used the spinal cord model to quantify the spatial relationship between motoneuron pools, and we used the OpenSim model to quantify the functional relationship between muscles. We used a hierarchical clustering analysis compare the structural and functional relationships. We found that the spatial organization of motoneuron pools in the spinal cord broadly mimics the anatomical relationships between muscle lengths and moment arms. Furthermore, within the same segment, the motoneurons innervating synergistic muscles were located closer to each other than to the motoneurons innervating antagonistic muscles, while across segments the motoneurons innervating specific antagonistic groups of muscles were colocalized. These results suggest that the mechanical coupling of the musculoskeletal system is embedded in the spinal cord anatomy underlying the modular organization of the neural motor control system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel planning through an optimal neural subspace in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Preparatory activity in motor cortex may facilitate movement execution by representing movement parameters (representational theory) or by initializing movement-related dynamics to an optimal state (dynamical system theory). Here, we confronted these two theories using neural data from non-human primates. We analyzed the structure of preparatory activity in a task where animals needed to plan two movements simultaneously. Contrary to what the representational theory predicted, we did not find evidence for the concurrent representation of the two movements. Instead, our data revealed that parallel planning was achieved by adjusting preparatory activity to an intermediate state that served as an optimal initial condition to generate both movements. This optimization quantitatively explained fluctuations in the animals' behavior, and directly supported the dynamical system theory. Together, these results uncover a simple mechanism for planning multiple movements in parallel, and shed light on an enduring debate about the nature of preparatory activity in motor cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reducing Merkel cell activity in the whisker follicle disrupts cortical encoding of whisker movement amplitude and velocity</a></h4>

              
                Merkel cells (MCs) and associated primary sensory afferents of the whisker follicle-sinus complex robustly code whisker self-movement, angle, and whisk phase during whisking. However, direct evidence of their roles in encoding whisker movement at cortical level is currently missing. To this end, spiking activity of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (wS1) neurons was measured in response to varying whisker deflection amplitude and velocity in transgenic mice with previously established reduced mechanoelectrical coupling at MC-associated afferents. Under reduced MC activity, wS1 neurons exhibited increased sensitivity to whisker deflection. This appeared to arise from a lack of variation in response magnitude to varying whisker deflection amplitude and velocity. This latter effect was further indicated by weaker variation in the temporal profile of the evoked spiking activity when whisker deflection amplitude and velocity varied. Nevertheless, under reduced MC activity, wS1 neurons retained the ability to discriminate stimulus features based on the timing of the first post-stimulus spike. Collectively, results from this study suggest that MCs contribute to both cortical encoding of whisker amplitude and velocity predominantly by tuning cortical response magnitude and by patterning evoked spiking activity, rather than in tuning cortical response latency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variability in cognitive task performance in early adolescence is associated with stronger between-network anticorrelation and future attention problems</a></h4>

              
                Background Intra-individual variability (IIV) during cognitive task performance is a key behavioral index of attention and consistent marker of ADHD. In adults, lower IIV has been associated with anticorrelation between the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) - thought to underlie effective allocation of attention. However, whether these behavioral and neural markers of attention are (i) associated with each other and (ii) can predict future attention-related deficits has not been examined in a developmental, population-based cohort. Methods We examined relationships at the baseline visit between IIV on three cognitive tasks, DMN-DAN anticorrelation, and parent-reported attention problems using the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study (n=11,878 participants, aged 9-10, female=47.8%). We also investigated whether behavioral and neural markers of attention at baseline predicted attention problems, 1, 2, and 3 years later. Results At baseline, greater DMN-DAN anticorrelation was associated with lower IIV across all three cognitive tasks (unstandardized {beta}: 0.22-0.25). Older age at baseline was associated with stronger DMN-DAN anticorrelation and lower IIV ({beta}: -0.005--0.0004). Weaker DMN-DAN anticorrelation and IIV were cross-sectionally associated with attention problems ({beta}: 1.41-7.63). Longitudinally, lower IIV at baseline was associated with less severe attention problems, 1-3 years later, after accounting for baseline attention problems ({beta}: 0.288-0.77). Conclusions The results suggest that IIV in early adolescence is associated with worsening attention problems in a representative cohort of US youth. Attention deficits in early adolescence may be important for understanding and predicting future cognitive and clinical outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Network Architecture Constrains Age-related Cortical Thinning</a></h4>

              
                Age-related cortical atrophy, approximated by cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance imaging, follows a characteristic pattern over the lifespan. Although its determinants remain unknown, mounting evidence demonstrates correspondence between the connectivity profiles of structural and functional brain networks and cortical atrophy in health and neurological disease. Here, we performed a cross-sectional multimodal neuroimaging analysis of 2633 individuals from a large population-based cohort to characterize the association between age-related differences in cortical thickness and functional as well as structural brain network topology. We identified a widespread pattern of age-related cortical thickness differences including hotspots of strong age effects located in brain areas with high centrality (structural network hubs). Regional age-related differences were furthermore strongly correlated within the structurally defined node neighborhood. The overall pattern of thickness differences as well as its change throughout the later lifespan was found to be anchored in the functional network hierarchy as encoded by macroscale functional connectivity gradients. Lastly, the identified difference pattern covaried significantly with cognitive and motor performance. Our findings indicate that connectivity profiles of functional and structural brain networks might act as organizing principles behind age-related cortical thinning as an imaging surrogate of cortical atrophy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CNS myelination requires VAMP2/3-mediated membrane expansion in oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Myelin is required for rapid nerve signaling and is emerging as a key driver of CNS plasticity and disease. How myelin is built and remodeled remains a fundamental question of neurobiology. Central to myelination is the ability of oligodendrocytes to add vast amounts of new cell membrane, expanding their surface areas by many thousand-fold. However, how oligodendrocytes add new membrane to build or remodel myelin is unknown. Here, we show that CNS myelin membrane addition requires exocytosis mediated by the vesicular SNARE proteins VAMP2/3. Genetic inactivation of VAMP2/3 in myelinating oligodendrocytes caused severe hypomyelination and premature death without overt loss of oligodendrocytes. Through live imaging, we discovered that VAMP2/3-mediated exocytosis drives membrane expansion within myelin sheaths to initiate wrapping and power sheath elongation. In conjunction with membrane expansion, mass spectrometry of oligodendrocyte surface proteins revealed that VAMP2/3 incorporates axon-myelin adhesion proteins that are collectively required to form nodes of Ranvier. Together, our results demonstrate that VAMP2/3-mediated membrane expansion in oligodendrocytes is indispensable for myelin formation, uncovering a cellular pathway that could sculpt myelination patterns in response to activity-dependent signals or be therapeutically targeted to promote regeneration in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular contributions to ictal population signals</a></h4>

              
                The amplitude of ictal activity is a defining feature of epileptic seizures, but the determinants of this amplitude have not been studied. Pathological synchronization of neuronal activity is assumed to be the main driver of increased ictal amplitudes. However, cell intrinsic changes that drive pathological neuronal discharges may also contribute to ictal amplitude. Clinically, ictal amplitudes are measured electrographically (using e.g. EEG, ECoG, and depth electrodes), but these methods do not enable the assessment of the contributions of the amplitudes of individual neurons as well as synchronization to the amplitude of the ictal signal. We therefore measured ictal population activity by recording both electrographic local field potentials (LFP) and neuronal calcium levels, the latter measured using optical imaging of neuronal transgenic calcium-sensitive fluorophores. Spontaneous seizure activity was first assessed in an awake, behaving mouse model of focal cortical injury, using paired GCaMP6-based calcium imaging and LFP electrical recording. Spontaneous recurrent seizures were then measured in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC), with a combination of GCaMP7 calcium imaging and LFP recordings. OHSC is an in vitro preparation in which all electrical and calcium signals could be unambiguously ascribed to the epileptic network. Population-averaged calcium activity was highly correlated with the time integral of electrographic field recordings, both in vivo and in vitro. We found that cell intrinsic changes were the largest contributor to the population signal during seizure onset. In other words, the network signal was not merely the summation of highly synchronous physiological activity, but that individual neurons were generating pathological discharges. During frank seizure, individual neurons continued to generate pathological activity, which also became highly synchronized. Interestingly, recruitment of newly active neurons accounted for only a small fraction of synchronous activity, particularly in vivo, revealing that network synchrony was largely due to reactivation of the same population of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticostriatal Beta Power Changes Associated with Cognitive Function in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive impairment (CI) is the most frequent nonmotor symptom in Parkinsons Disease (PD) and is associated with deficits in executive functions such as working memory. Previous studies have demonstrated that caudate beta power underlies learning and working memory. Decreased dopamine in motor cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits results in increased beta power and PD motor symptoms. Analogous changes in cognitive CSTC circuits, including the caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), may contribute to PD CI. A better understanding of anatomic structures and neurophysiologic changes associated with working memory deficits is needed to develop potential neuromodulatory treatment strategies for PD CI. The objective of our study is to evaluate neurophysiologic changes underlying cognitive dysfunction in PD patients via direct local field potential recordings during deep brain stimulation surgery. Fifteen patients were included, one of which completed 2 minutes of resting state data collection while the other fourteen completed resting state collection and task based data collection with a verbal working memory 2-back task with feedback. LFP signals from DLPFC (50 channels) and caudate (25 channels) were sampled at 1000Hz, demeaned by channel and aligned to task events of encoding and feedback. Correlations of resting state beta power and pre-operative neuropsychological testing as well as caudate volumes were performed. Beta power decreased in both DLPFC and caudate during encoding and was significantly different for correct and incorrect trials, whereas beta power increased in DLPFC and caudate during feedback and was significantly different for correct and incorrect trials. Beta power during encoding was inversely correlated with memory scores on pre-operative neuropsychological testing. Understanding neurophysiologic correlates of cognitive dysfunction within cognitive CSTC circuits will aid in development of novel neuromodulatory therapies for patients with PD CI and other cognitive disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult neural stem cells and neurogenesis are resilient to intermittent fasting</a></h4>

              
                Intermittent fasting (IF) is a promising non-pharmacological strategy to counteract ageing which has been shown to increase the number of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus of mice. However, it is still unclear which steps of the adult neurogenesis process are regulated by IF. The number of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) decreases with age in an activation-dependent manner. To counteract the loss of the stem cell pool, adult NSCs are mostly found in an inactive, quiescent state which ensures their long-term maintenance. We aimed to determine if and how IF impacts the activity and maintenance of adult NSCs in the hippocampus. We chose an every-other-day fasting protocol with food re-administration at night, which we found effectively induces fasting features and preserves the circadian activity pattern of mice. To determine the effects of IF on NSCs and all following steps in the neurogenic lineage, we combined fasting with lineage tracing and label retention assays. We found that IF does not affect NSC activation or maintenance. Contrary to previous reports, we also found that IF does not increase hippocampal neurogenesis. We obtained the same results regardless of strain, sex, diet length, tamoxifen administration or new-born neuron identification method. Our data suggest that NSCs maintain homeostasis upon IF and that this intervention is not a reliable strategy to increase adult neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal structural change of gray matter before and after hemispherotomy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hemispherotomy is an effective surgery developed to treat refractory epilepsy caused by diffuse unihemispheric pathologies. Post-surgery neuroplastic mechanisms supporting behavioral recovery after left and right hemispherotomy as well as their difference remain largely unclear. Methods: In a large cohort of 57 pediatric patients who underwent hemispherotomy, voxel-wise GMV in unaffected regions (contralesional cerebrum and bilateral cerebellum) and behavioral abilities were assessed before and after surgery. Using linear mixed models, we evaluated changes in GMV and behavioral scores, and how GMV changes correlated with improvements in behavioral scores. In addition, three machine learning regression algorithms were applied to assess whether preoperative GMV can predict postoperative behavior. Results: In the two patient groups (29 left hemispherotomy patients, age of surgery mean {+/-} standard deviation = 3.5 {+/-} 2.5; 28 right hemispherotomy patients, age of surgery 4.6 {+/-} 2.5), widespread increases in the postoperative GMV in the contralateral cerebrum and ipsilateral cerebellum but decreases in the postoperative GMV in the contralateral cerebellum were consistently observed. Importantly, the decrease in GMV in the contralateral cerebellum was significantly correlated with improvement in behavioral scores in right but not left hemispherotomy patients. Moreover, the preoperative GMV around the most longitudinally changed locations significantly predicted postoperative behavioral scores in left but not right hemispherotomy patients. Conclusions: Our findings indicate an important role for the contralateral cerebellum in the recovery after right hemispherotomy, and postoperative behavioral scores can be predicted with preoperative GMV features.

                The reportability of spontaneous thinking relies significantly on attention and arousal. As these cognitive faculties change with age, we aimed at testing how spontaneous mental state reportability is influenced accordingly. Using experience sampling, 20 senior (65-75yrs) and 20 young participants (20-30yrs) were prompted to report mind-wandering (MW), mind-blanking (MB), or sensory-related (S) mental states at random times. Attention was assessed with the Attentional Style Questionnaire, and arousal with continuous monitoring of pupil diameter. First, we found more MW occurrences than MB or S across all participants. For young responders, we replicated that MW was more prevalent in easily-distracted participants. In seniors, though, MW was more prevalent in participants with a higher focused attentional style. In senior participants who reported being more easily distracted, MW was associated with lower arousal (pupil constriction) and MB with higher arousal (pupil dilation), reversing the pattern found for young adults and focused seniors. We propose that these effects may result from intentional MW, during which senior participants allocate attentional resources to mentally engage inwards, as opposed to younger participants who get more easily distracted by their own mental activity leading to unintentional MW. Together, our results highlight age-dependent mechanisms by which attentional style and pupil-linked arousal regulate the reportability of spontaneous mental states across age.

                Working memory (WM) and timing are generally considered distinct cognitive functions, but similar neural signatures have been implicated in both. To explore the hypothesis that WM and timing may rely on shared neural mechanisms, we used psychophysical tasks that contained either task-irrelevant timing or WM components. In both cases the task-irrelevant component influenced performance. RNN simulations revealed that cue-specific neural sequences, which multiplexed WM and time, emerged as the dominant regime that captured the behavioral findings. Over the course of training RNN dynamics transitioned from low-dimensional ramps to high-dimensional neural sequences, and depending on task requirements, steady-state or ramping activity was also observed. Analysis of RNN structure revealed that neural sequences relied primarily on inhibitory connections, and could survive the deletion of all excitatory-to-excitatory connections. Our results suggest that in some instances WM is encoded in time-varying neural activity because of the importance of predicting when WM will be used.

                The central serotoninergic system is critical for stress responsivity and social behavior, and its dysregulations has been centrally implicated in virtually all neuropsychiatric disorders. Genetic serotonin depletion animal models could provide a tool to elucidate the causes and mechanisms of diseases and to develop new treatment approaches. Previously mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) have been developed, showing altered behaviors and neurotransmission. However, the effect of congenital serotonin deficiency on emotional and social behavior in rats is still largely unknown, as are the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we used Tph2 knockout (Tph2-/-) male rat model to study how the lack of serotonin in the rat brain affects anxiety-like and social behaviors. Since oxytocin is centrally implicated in these behaviors, we furthermore explored whether effects of Tph2 knockout on behavior would relate to changes in the oxytocin system. We show that Tph2-/- rats display reduced anxiety-like behavior and a high level of aggression in social interactions. In addition, oxytocin receptor expression was increased in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortex, paraventricular nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus and some subregions of hippocampus, which was paralleled by increased levels of oxytocin in the medial frontal cortex, paraventricular nucleus, but not the dorsal raphe nucleus, central amygdala and hippocampus. In conclusion, our study demonstrated reduced anxiety but exaggerated aggression in Tph2-/- male rats and reveals for the first time a potential involvement of altered oxytocin system function.

                Vendor differences are thought to affect Pavlovian conditioning in rats. After observing possible differences in sign-tracking and goal-tracking behaviour with rats from different breeding colonies, we performed an empirical replication of the effect. 40 male Long-Evans rats from Charles River colonies 'K72' and 'R06' received 11 Pavlovian conditioned approach training sessions (or "autoshaping"), with a lever as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and 10% sucrose as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Each 58-min session consisted of 12 CS-US trials. Paired rats (n = 15/colony) received the US following lever retraction. Unpaired control rats (n = 5/colony) received sucrose during the inter-trial interval. Next, we evaluated the conditioned reinforcing properties of the CS, by determining whether rats would learn to nose-poke into a new, active (vs. inactive) port to receive CS presentations alone (no sucrose). Preregistered confirmatory analyses showed that during autoshaping sessions, Paired rats made significantly more CS-triggered entries into the sucrose port (i.e., goal-tracking) and lever activations (sign-tracking) than Unpaired rats did, demonstrating acquisition of the CS-US association. Confirmatory analyses showed no effects of breeding colony on autoshaping. During conditioned reinforcement testing, analysis of data from Paired rats alone showed significantly more active vs. inactive nosepokes, suggesting that in these rats, the lever CS acquired incentive motivational properties. Analysing Paired rats alone also showed that K72 rats had higher Pavlovian Conditioned Approach scores than R06 rats did. Thus, breeding colony can affect outcome in Pavlovian conditioned approach studies, and animal breeding source should be considered as a covariate in such work.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The rostral zona incerta: a subcortical integrative hub and potential DBS target for OCD</a></h4>

              
                Background: The zona incerta (ZI) is involved in mediating survival behaviors and is connected to a wide range of cortical and subcortical structures, including key basal ganglia nuclei. Based on these connections and their links to behavioral modulation, we propose the ZI is a connectional hub for mediating between top-down and bottom-up control and a possible target for deep brain stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder. Methods: We analyzed the trajectory of cortical fibers to the ZI in nonhuman and human primates, based on tracer injections in monkeys and high-resolution diffusion MRI in humans. The organization of cortical and subcortical connections with the ZI were identified in the nonhuman primate studies. Results: Monkey anatomic data and human dMRI data showed a similar trajectory of fibers/streamlines to the ZI. PFC/ACC terminals all converge within the rostral ZI (ZIr), with dorsal and lateral areas most prominent. Motor areas terminate caudally. Dense subcortical reciprocal connections included the thalamus, medial hypothalamus, substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, reticular formation, and pedunculopontine nucleus and a dense nonreciprocal projection to the lateral habenula (LHb). Additional connections included amygdala, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal grey. Conclusions: Dense connections with dorsal and lateral PFC/ACC cognitive control areas and LHb and SN/VTA coupled with inputs from the amygdala, hypothalamus, and brainstem, suggests that the ZIr is a subcortical hub positioned to modulate between top-down and bottom-up control. A DBS electrode placed in the ZIr would involve both connections common to other DBS sites, but also would capture several critically distinctive connections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced brain structure-function tethering in transmodal cortex revealed by high-frequency eigenmodes</a></h4>

              
                The brain's structural connectome supports signal propagation between neuronal elements, shaping diverse coactivation patterns that can be captured as functional connectivity. While the link between structure and function remains an ongoing challenge, the prevailing hypothesis is that the structure-function relationship may itself be gradually decoupled along a macroscale functional gradient spanning unimodal to transmodal regions. However, this hypothesis is strongly constrained by the underlying models which may neglect requisite signaling mechanisms. Here, we transform the structural connectome into a set of orthogonal eigenmodes governing frequency-specific diffusion patterns and show that regional structure-function relationships vary markedly under different signaling mechanisms. Specifically, low-frequency eigenmodes, which are considered sufficient to capture the essence of the functional network, contribute little to functional connectivity reconstruction in transmodal regions, resulting in structure-function decoupling along the unimodal-transmodal gradient. In contrast, high-frequency eigenmodes, which are usually on the periphery of attention due to their association with noisy and random dynamical patterns, contribute significantly to functional connectivity prediction in transmodal regions, inducing gradually convergent structure-function relationships from unimodal to transmodal regions. Although the information in high-frequency eigenmodes is weak and scattered, it effectively enhances the structure-function correspondence by 35% in unimodal regions and 56% in transmodal regions. Altogether, our findings suggest that the structure-function divergence in transmodal areas may not be an intrinsic property of brain organization, but can be narrowed through multiplexed and regionally specialized signaling mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oscillatory mechanisms of intrinsic brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies of hemodynamic fluctuations have shown specific network-based organization of the brain at rest, yet the neurophysiological underpinning of these networks in human brain remain unclear. Here, we recorded resting-state activities of neuronal populations in the key regions of default mode network (DMN, posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex), frontoparietal network (FPN, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule), and salience network (SN, anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) from 42 human participants using intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). We observed stronger within-network connectivity of the DMN, FPN and SN in broadband iEEG power, stronger phase synchronization within the DMN across theta and alpha bands, and weaker phase synchronization within the FPN in delta, theta and alpha band. We also found positive power correlations in high frequency band (70-170Hz) and negative power correlations in alpha and beta band for FPN-DMN and FPN-SN. Robust negative correlations in DMN-SN were found in alpha, beta and gamma band. These findings provide intracranial electrophysiological evidence in support of the network model for intrinsic organization of human brain and shed light on the way how the brain networks communicate at rest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale capture of hidden fluorescent labels for training generalizable markerless motion capture models</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in deep learning-based markerless pose estimation have dramatically improved the scale and ease with which body landmarks can be tracked in studies of animal behavior. However, pose estimation for animals in a laboratory setting still faces some specific challenges. Researchers typically need to manually generate new training data for each experimental setup and visual environment, limiting the generalizability of this approach. With each network being trained from scratch, different investigators track distinct anatomical landmarks and analyze the resulting kinematic data in idiosyncratic ways. Moreover, much of the movement data is discarded: only a few sparse landmarks are typically labeled, due to the inherent scale and accuracy limits of manual annotation. To address these issues, we developed an approach, which we term GlowTrack, for generating large training datasets that overcome the relatively modest limits of manual labeling, enabling deep learning models that generalize across experimental contexts. The key innovations are: a) an automated, high-throughput approach for generating hidden labels free of human error using fluorescent markers; b) a multi-camera, multi-light setup for generating large amounts of training data under diverse visual conditions; and c) a technique for massively parallel tracking of hundreds of landmarks simultaneously using computer vision feature matching algorithms, providing dense coverage for kinematic analysis at a resolution not currently available. These advances yield versatile deep learning models that are trained at scale, laying the foundation for standardized behavioral pipelines and more complete scrutiny of animal movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cohort-mean measured macromolecules lead to more robust linear-combination modeling than subject-specific or parameterized ones</a></h4>

              
                Expert consensus recommends linear-combination modeling (LCM) of proton MR spectra with sequence-specific simulated metabolite basis function and experimentally derived macromolecular (MM) basis functions. Measured MM basis functions have been derived from metabolite-nulled spectra averaged across a small cohort. The use of subject-specific instead of cohort-averaged measured MM basis functions has not been studied. Furthermore, measured MM basis functions are not widely available to non-expert users, who commonly rely on parameterized MM signals internally simulated by LCM software. To investigate the impact of the choice of MM modeling, this study, therefore, compares metabolite level estimates between different MM modeling strategies (cohort-mean measured; subject-specific measured; parameterized) in a lifespan cohort and characterizes its impact on metabolite-age associations. 102 conventional (TE = 30 ms) and metabolite-nulled (TI = 650 ms) PRESS datasets, acquired from the medial parietal lobe in a lifespan cohort (20-70 years of age), were analyzed in Osprey. Short-TE spectra were modeled in Osprey using six different strategies to consider the macromolecular baseline. Fully tissue- and relaxation-corrected metabolite levels were compared between MM strategies. Model performance was evaluated by model residuals, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the impact on metabolite-age associations. The choice of MM strategy had a significant impact on metabolite level estimates. The estimates agreed relatively well between different MM strategies (r > 0.6) and had no major impact on the variance. The lowest relative model residuals and AIC values were found for the cohort-mean measured MM. Metabolite-age associations were consistently found for two major singlet signals (tCr, tCho) for all MM strategies, but varied substantially for highly J-coupled metabolites. A variance partition analysis indicated that up to 44% of the total variance was related to the choice of MM strategy. Additionally, the variance partition analysis reproduced the metabolite-age association for tCr and tCho found in the simpler correlation analysis. In summary, the inclusion of a single high-SNR MM basis function (cohort-mean) leads to more robust metabolite estimation (lower model residuals and AIC values) compared to MM strategies with more degrees of freedom (Gaussian parametrization) or subject-specific MM information. Integration of multiple LCM analyses into a single statistical model potentially improves the robustness in the detection of underlying effects (e.g. metabolite vs age), reduces algorithm-based bias, and estimates algorithm-related variance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phenotypic screening using waveform analysis of calcium dynamics in primary cortical cultures</a></h4>

              
                At present, in vitro phenotypic screening methods are widely used for drug discovery. In the field of epilepsy research, measurements of neuronal activity have been utilized for predicting efficacy of anti-epileptic drugs. Fluorescence measurements of calcium oscillations in neurons are commonly used for measurement of neuronal activities, and some anti-epileptic drugs have been evaluated using this assay technique. However, changes in waveforms were not quantified in previous reports. Here, we have developed a high-throughput screening system containing a new analysis method for quantifying waveforms, and our method has successfully enabled simultaneous measurement of calcium oscillations in a 96-well plate. Features of waveforms were extracted automatically and allowed the characterization of some anti-epileptic drugs using principal component analysis. Moreover, we have shown that trajectories in accordance with the concentrations of compounds in principal component analysis plots were unique to the mechanism of anti-epileptic drugs. We believe that an approach that focuses on the features of calcium oscillations will lead to better understanding of the characteristics of existing anti-epileptic drugs and allow prediction of the mechanism of action of novel drug candidates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural substrate of sex-dependent modulation of motivation by value</a></h4>

              
                While there is emerging evidence of sex differences in decision-making behavior, the neural substrates that underlie such differences remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in mice performing a value-based decision-making task, while choices are similar between the sexes, motivation to engage in the task is modulated by action value in females more strongly than in males. Inhibition of activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons that project to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) disrupts this relationship between value and motivation preferentially in females, without affecting choice in either sex. In line with these effects, in females compared to males, ACC-DMS neurons have stronger representations of negative outcomes, and more neurons are active when the value of the chosen option is low. In contrast, the representation of each choice is similar between the sexes. Thus, we identify a neural substrate that contributes to sex-specific modulation of motivation by value.

	<p>The locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system modulates many visceral and cognitive functions, while LC-NE dysfunction leads to neurological and neurodegenerative conditions such as sleep disorders, depression, ADHD, or Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Innovative viral-vector and gene-engineering technology combined with the availability of cell-specific promoters enabled regional targeting and selective control over phenotypically specific populations of neurons. We transduced the LC-NE neurons in adult male rats by delivering the canine adenovirus type 2-based vector carrying the NE-specific promoter PRSx8 and a light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 receptor (ChR2) directly in the LC or retrogradely from the LC targets. The highest ChR2 expression level was achieved when the virus was delivered medially to the trigeminal pathway and ~100&amp;amp;mu;m lateral to the LC. The injections close or directly in the LC compromised the tissue integrity and NE cell phenotype. Retrograde labeling was more optimal given the transduction of projection-selective subpopulations. Our results highlight a limited inference of ChR2 expression from representative cases to the entire population of targeted cells. The actual fraction of manipulated neurons appears most essential for an adequate interpretation of the study outcome. The actual fraction of manipulated neurons appears most essential for an adequate interpretation of the study outcome. Thus, besides the cell-type specificity and the transduction efficiency, the between-subject variability in the proportion of the remaining viral-transduced targeted cell population must be considered in any functional connectivity study.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have revealed highly reproducible patterns of temporally lagged brain activity in healthy human adults. However, it is unknown whether temporal organization of intrinsic activity is altered in migraines or if it relates to migraine chronification. In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, temporal features of intrinsic activity were investigated using resting-state lag analysis, and 39 episodic migraine patients, 17 chronic migraine patients, and 35 healthy controls were assessed. Temporally earlier intrinsic activity in the hippocampal complex was revealed in the chronic migraine group relative to the other two groups. We also found earlier intrinsic activity in the medial prefrontal cortex in chronic compared with episodic migraines. Both migraine groups showed earlier intrinsic activity in the lateral temporal cortex and sensorimotor cortex compared with the healthy control group. Across all patients, headache frequency negatively correlated with temporal lag of the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal complex. Disrupted propagation of intrinsic activity in regions involved in sensory, cognitive and affective processing of pain may contribute to abnormal brain function during migraines. Decreased time latency in the lateral temporal cortex and sensorimotor cortex may be common manifestations in episodic and chronic migraines. The temporal features of the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal complex were associated with migraine chronification.</p>

	<p>The presence of neurological symptoms within the clinical range of COVID-19 disease infection has increased. This paper presents the situation of a 45-year-old man having the medical antecedent diabetes mellitus, who presented to the emergency department with fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms, nine days following vaccination with the Ad26.COV2-S COVID-19 vaccine. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on nasal polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Two weeks after the presentation, he developed Tolosa&amp;amp;ndash;Hunt Syndrome, an autoimmune phenomenon, with painful left ophthalmoplegia. Significant improvement was seen in terms of his discomfort; however, ptosis and ocular mobility improved only moderately after treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, and the patient was discharged on a new insulin regimen. The patient returned after four weeks and the neurological exam results showed significant signs of right hemiparesis, mixed aphasia, incomplete left ophthalmoplegia, severe headache, and agitation; after a few days, the patient experienced a depressed level of consciousness and coma. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s clinical condition worsened and, unfortunately, he died. MRI brain images revealed multiple ischemic strokes, meningitis, infectious vasculitis, and hemorrhagic encephalitis, which are all serious complications of COVID-19.</p>

                The nervous system detects environmental and internal stimuli and relays this information to immune cells via neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. This is essential to respond appropriately to immunogenic threats and to support system homeostasis. Lymph nodes (LNs) act as sentinels where adaptive immune responses are generated. They are richly innervated by peripheral sympathetic and sensory nerves, which are responsible for the local secretion of neurotransmitters by sympathetic fibers, such as norepinephrine, and neuropeptides by sensory fibers, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The age of reason: Functional brain network development during childhood</a></h4>

              
                Human childhood is characterized by dramatic changes in the mind and brain. However, little is known about the large-scale intrinsic cortical network changes that occur during childhood due to methodological challenges in scanning young children. Here, we overcome this barrier by using sophisticated acquisition and analysis tools to investigate functional network development in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years (n = 92). At multiple spatial scales, age is positively associated with brain network segregation. At the system level, age was associated with segregation of systems involved in attention from those involved in abstract cognition, and with integration among attentional and perceptual systems. Associations between age and functional connectivity are most pronounced in visual and medial prefrontal cortex, the two ends of a gradient from perceptual, externally oriented cortex to abstract, internally oriented cortex. These findings suggest that both ends of the sensory-association gradient may develop early, in contrast to the classical theories that cortical maturation proceeds from back to front, with sensory areas developing first and association areas developing last. More mature patterns of brain network architecture, controlling for age, were associated with better visuospatial reasoning abilities. Our results suggest that as cortical architecture becomes more specialized, children become more able to reason about the world and their place in it.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pathway-specific inputs to the superior colliculus support flexible triggering of innate behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral flexibility requires the ability to modify the feedforward transmission of sensory information. The superior colliculus mediates visually guided innate defensive behaviors via cell-type specific projections. However, how brain-wide inputs to the superior colliculus are organized to modulate visual processing and enable flexible behavior remains unknown. To determine these rules, we focused on inhibitory projection (Gad2) neurons. Trans-synaptic tracing and neuronal recordings revealed that Gad2 neurons projecting to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd) and the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG) form two separate anatomical and functional populations, where each circuit received a different set of non-retinal inputs. Inhibiting LGd or PBG projecting Gad2 neurons resulted in opposing effects on behavior; increasing freezing or escape probability to visual looming stimuli, respectively. These data suggest that projection-specific sampling of brain-wide inputs provide a circuit design principle that enables feed-forward transfer of visual threat to be independently adjusted to produce context specific behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangling Hierarchical and Sequential Computations during Sentence Processing.</a></h4>

              
                Sequence processing in humans is thought to rely on two distinct mechanisms: the computation of transition probabilities between adjacent elements and the extraction of larger hierarchical structures. Previous studies indicate that both mechanisms contribute to auditory sequence processing, but whether language processing involves one or the other remains debated. To address this issue, we designed a linguistic version of the local-global auditory test, which contrasts sequential versus hierarchical violations of expectations in sentences, and we searched for violation responses in both human magnetoencephalography and computational models. We found that in models, both mechanisms coexist, whereas humans only show hierarchical structure effects. Our results suggest that human sentence processing is dominated by structure-based computations and robust to sequential effects. They point to major differences between language processing in humans versus neural models and, within humans, between the processing of linguistic sentences versus non-linguistic sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Na+/K+ pump dominates control of glycolysis in hippocampal dentate granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Cellular ATP that is consumed to perform energetically expensive tasks must be replenished by new ATP through the activation of metabolism. Neuronal stimulation, an energetically demanding process, transiently activates aerobic glycolysis, but the precise mechanism underlying this glycolysis activation has not been determined. We previously showed that neuronal glycolysis is correlated with Ca2+ influx, but is not activated by feedforward Ca2+ signaling (Diaz-Garcia, Meyer, et al., 2021). Since ATP-powered Na+ and Ca2+ pumping activities are increased following stimulation to restore ion gradients and are estimated to consume most neuronal ATP, we aimed to determine if they are coupled to neuronal glycolysis activation. By using two-photon imaging of fluorescent biosensors and dyes in dentate granule cell somas of acute mouse hippocampal slices, we observed that production of cytoplasmic NADH, a byproduct of glycolysis, is strongly coupled to changes in intracellular Na+, while intracellular Ca2+ could only increase NADH production if both forward Na+/Ca2+ exchange and Na+/K+ pump activity were intact. Additionally, antidromic stimulation-induced intracellular [Na+] increases were reduced >50% by blocking Ca2+ entry. These results indicate that neuronal glycolysis activation is predominantly a response to an increase in activity of the Na+/K+ pump, which is strongly potentiated by Na+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger during extrusion of Ca2+ following stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisensory learning binds modality-specific neurons into a cross-modal memory engram</a></h4>

              
                Associating multiple sensory cues with objects and experience is a fundamental brain process that improves object recognition and memory performance. However, neural mechanisms that bind sensory features during learning and augment memory expression are unknown. Here we demonstrate multisensory appetitive and aversive memory in Drosophila. Combining colors and odors improved memory performance, even when each sensory modality was tested alone. Temporal control of neuronal function revealed visually-selective mushroom body Kenyon Cells (KCs) to be required for both enhancement of visual and olfactory memory after multisensory training. Voltage imaging in head-fixed flies showed that multisensory learning binds activity between streams of modality-specific KCs, so that unimodal sensory input generates a multimodal neuronal response. Binding occurs between regions of the olfactory and visual KC axons, which receive valence-relevant dopaminergic reinforcement, and is propagated downstream. Dopamine locally releases GABA-ergic inhibition to permit specific microcircuits within KC-spanning serotonergic neurons to function as an excitatory bridge between the previously modality-selective KC streams. Cross-modal binding thereby expands the olfactory memory engram by recruiting visual path KCs to become odor responsive. This broadening of the engram improves memory performance after multisensory learning and permits a single sensory feature to retrieve the memory of the multimodal experience.

	<p>Menopause accelerates increases in arterial stiffness and decreases cognitive performances. The objective of this study was to compare cognitive performances in physically active pre- and post-menopausal females and their relationship with arterial stiffness. We performed a cross-sectional comparison of blood pressure, carotid&amp;amp;ndash;femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) and cognitive performances between physically active late pre- and early post-menopausal females. Systolic (post-menopause&amp;amp;mdash;pre-menopause: +6 mmHg [95% CI &amp;amp;minus;1; +13], p = 0.27; &amp;amp;#331;2 = 0.04) and diastolic (+6 mmHg [95% CI +2; +11], p = 0.06; &amp;amp;#331;2 = 0.12) blood pressures, and cf-PWV (+0.29 m/s [95% CI &amp;amp;minus;1.03; 1.62], p = 0.48; &amp;amp;#331;2 = 0.02) did not differ between groups. Post-menopausal females performed as well as pre-menopausal females on tests evaluating executive functions, episodic memory and processing speed. Group differences were observed on the computerized working memory task. Post-menopausal females had lower accuracy (p = 0.02; &amp;amp;#331;2 = 0.25) but similar reaction time (p = 0.70; &amp;amp;#331;2 &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, this performance was inversely associated with the severity of menopausal symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.38; p = 0.05). These results suggest that arterial stiffness and performance on tests assessing episodic memory and processing speed and executive functions assessing inhibition and switching abilities did not differ between physically active pre- and post-menopausal females. However, post-menopausal females had lower performance on a challenging condition of a working memory task, and this difference in working memory between groups cannot be explained by increased arterial stiffness.</p>

	<p>Maternal obesity results in programmed offspring hyperphagia and obesity. The increased offspring food intake is due in part to the preferential differentiation of hypothalamic neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) to orexigenic (AgRP) vs. anorexigenic (POMC) neurons. The altered neurogenesis may involve hypothalamic bHLH (basic helix&amp;amp;ndash;loop&amp;amp;ndash;helix) neuroregulatory factors (Hes1, Mash1, and Ngn3). Whilst the underlying mechanism remains unclear, it is known that mitochondrial function is critical for neurogenesis and is impacted by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&amp;amp;alpha;. Obesity is associated with the activation of inflammation and oxidative stress pathways. In obese pregnancies, increased levels of TNF&amp;amp;alpha; are seen in maternal and cord blood, indicating increased fetal exposure. As TNF&amp;amp;alpha; influences neurogenesis and mitochondrial function, we tested the effects of TNF&amp;amp;alpha; and reactive oxidative species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on hypothalamic NPC cultures from newborn mice. TNF&amp;amp;alpha; treatment impaired NPC mitochondrial function, increased ROS production and NPC proliferation, and decreased the protein expression of proneurogenic Mash1/Ngn3. Consistent with this, AgRP protein expression was increased and POMC was decreased. Notably, treatment with H2O2 produced similar effects as TNF&amp;amp;alpha; and also reduced the protein expression of antioxidant SIRT1. The inhibition of STAT3/NF&amp;amp;kappa;B prevented the effects of TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, suggesting that TNF&amp;amp;alpha; mediates its effects on NPCs via mitochondrial-induced oxidative stress that involves both signaling pathways.</p>

	<p>Background: Theory of mind (ToM) is a fundamental aspect of social cognition. Previous studies on age-related changes in mentalizing processes have provided conflicting results. This study aims to investigate the age-related changes in the cognitive and affective components of ToM throughout adulthood. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-eight healthy participants divided into five age groups (18&amp;amp;ndash;40 years old; 41&amp;amp;ndash;50 years old; 51&amp;amp;ndash;60 years old; 61&amp;amp;ndash;70 years; 71&amp;amp;ndash;80 years old) underwent tasks assessing the cognitive (ToM Picture Sequencing Task, TMPS, and the Advanced Test of ToM, ATT) and affective (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, RMET, and the Emotion Attribution Task, EAT) components of ToM, in both verbal and nonverbal modality. Results: Regarding affective ToM, both the youngest- and middle-old adult groups (61 to 80 years) performed worse than the young and youngest-middle adult groups (18 to 50 years) in the RMET, but no significant differences were found in the EAT. Regarding cognitive ToM, the middle-old adult group (71 to 80 years) performed worse than the young adult group (18 to 40 years) only in the TMPS, but no significant differences were found in the ATT. Conclusion: Rather than a general decline in ToM, our results provide evidence regarding selective changes in ToM in older adults, further confirming the dissociation of cognitive and affective ToM.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in the Alcohol-Mediated Modulation of BLA Network States</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Alcohol use, reported by 85% of adults in the United States, is highly comorbid with mood disorders, like generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is an area of the brain that is heavily implicated in both mood disorders and alcohol use disorder. Importantly, the modulation of BLA network/oscillatory states via parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic interneurons has been shown to control the behavioral expression of fear and anxiety. Further, PV interneurons express a high density of  subunit-containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs), which are sensitive to low concentrations of alcohol. Therefore, we hypothesized that the effects of alcohol may modulate BLA network states that have been associated with fear and anxiety behaviors via -GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs on PV interneurons in the BLA. Given the impact of ovarian hormones on the expression of -GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs, we also examined the ability of alcohol to modulate local field potentials in the BLA from male and female C57BL/6J and <I>Gabrd</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice after acute and repeated exposure to alcohol. Here, we demonstrate that acute and repeated alcohol can differentially modulate oscillatory states in male and female C57BL/6J mice, a process that involves -GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs. This is the first study to demonstrate that alcohol is capable of altering network states implicated in both anxiety and alcohol use disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Robust, Long-Term Video EEG Monitoring in a Porcine Model of Post-Traumatic Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>To date, post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) research in large-animal models has been limited. Recent advances in neocortical microscopy have made possible new insights into neocortical PTE. However, it is very difficult to engender convincing neocortical PTE in rodents. Thus, large-animal models that develop neocortical PTE may provide useful insights that also can be more comparable to human patients. Because gyrencephalic species have prolonged latent periods, long-term video EEG recording is required. Here, we report a fully subcutaneous EEG implant with synchronized video in freely ambulatory swine for up to 13 months during epileptogenesis following bilateral cortical impact injuries or sham surgery The advantages of this system include the availability of a commercially available system that is simple to install, a low failure rate after surgery for EEG implantation, radiotelemetry that enables continuous monitoring of freely ambulating animals, excellent synchronization to video to EEG, and a robust signal-to-noise ratio. The disadvantages of this system in this species and age are the accretion of skull bone, which entirely embedded a subset of skull screws and EEG electrodes, and the inability to rearrange the EEG electrode array. These disadvantages may be overcome by splicing a subdural electrode strip to the electrode leads so that skull growth is less likely to interfere with long-term signal capture and by placing two implants for a more extensive montage. This commercially available system in this bilateral cortical impact swine model may be useful to a wide range of investigators studying epileptogenesis in PTE.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The efferent pathway strengthens the auditory system for optimal performance by fine-tuning the response and protecting the inner ear from noise-induced damage. Although it has been well documented that efference helps defend against hair cell and synaptic extinction, the mechanisms of its otoprotective role have still not been established. Specifically, the effect of efference on an individual hair cell&rsquo;s recovery from mechanical overstimulation has not been demonstrated. In the current work, we explored the impact of efferent stimulation on this recovery using <I>in vitro</I> preparations of hair cells situated in the sacculi of American bullfrogs (<I>Rana catesbeiana</I>). In the absence of efferent stimulus, exposure of a hair bundle to high-amplitude mechanical deflection detuned it from its oscillatory regime, with the extent of detuning dependent on the applied signal. Efferent actuation concomitant with the hair bundle&rsquo;s relaxation from a high-amplitude deflection notably changed the recovery profile and often entirely eliminated the transition to quiescence. Our findings indicate that the efferent system acts as a control mechanism that determines the dynamic regime in which the hair cell is poised.</p>

                Background: The purpose of this study was to reveal the macroeconomic determinants that companies take into account when scheduling initial public offerings (IPOs). Methods: For this purpose, the relationship between the frequency of the IPOs and the selected macroeconomic indicators in the stock market of the G-7 countries for the period 1999-2020 was examined by panel data analysis method. A random effect model was used as econometric model in the analysis, and the Driscoll-Kraay resistant standard estimator developed against deviations was used in the application of the model. Results: According to the results of the analysis, it was determined that stock market returns have a positive and significant effect on the volume of public offerings. Conclusions: Based on our findings, it can be concluded that companies take into account the periods when stock market returns are relatively high for timing the IPO.

                Biological agents and infectious pathogens have the potential to cause very significant harm, as the natural occurrence of disease and pandemics makes clear. As a way to better understand the risk of Global Catastrophic Biological Risks due to human activities, rather than natural sources, this paper reports on a dataset of 71 incidents involving either accidental or purposeful exposure to, or infection by, a highly infectious pathogenic agent. There has been significant effort put into both reducing the risk of purposeful spread of biological weapons, and biosafety intended to prevent the exposure to, or release of, dangerous pathogens in the course of research. Despite these efforts, there are incidents of various types that could potentially be controlled or eliminated by different lab and/or bioweapon research choices and safety procedures. The dataset of events presented here was compiled during a project conducted in 2019 to better understand biological risks from anthropic sources. The events which are listed are unrelated to clinical treatment of naturally occurring outbreaks, and are instead entirely the result of human decisions and mistakes. While the events cover a wide range of cases, the criteria used covers a variety of events previously scattered across academic, policy, and other unpublished or not generally available sources.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Growth kinetics of multiple Acinetobacter baumannii resistotype after meropenem-based antibiotic combination exposure [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections, but the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) has rendered it ineffective in the vast majority of cases. Combination therapy has grown in popularity over the last decade; this study aims to analyze A.baumannii growth kinetics after exposure to meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam compared with meropenem and amikacin antibiotic combinations in clinically relevant concentrations.  Methods: This experimental laboratory study was conducted on the A.baumannii ATCC 19606 isolate and three clinical isolates that were intermediate or resistant to tested antibiotics. Meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam, as well as meropenem and amikacin, were tested at four different concentrations against isolates. Turbidity measurements were taken at predetermined time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours following exposure; bacterial concentration was enumerated using the agar plate method, with the results plotted in a time-kill curve.   Results: A bactericidal effect was achieved in isolates that were intermediate to ampicillin sulbactam and resistant to meropenem after the administration of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam combination with a concentration of 4 µg/ml and 16/8 µg/ml, respectively. The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam demonstrated bacteriostatic activity against isolates that were resistant to both antibiotics. Isolates treated with resistant antibiotics showed an increased growth rate compared to the growth control.  Conclusion: The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam could be a promising combination therapy in treating CRAB infections. The mechanism and degree of antibiotic resistance in the isolates affect the efficacy of antibiotic combinations; further research is needed to corroborate the findings of this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The disconnect between researcher ambitions and reality in achieving impact in the Earth & Environmental Sciences – author survey [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is an increasing desire for research to provide solutions to the grand challenges facing our global society, such as those expressed in the UN SDGs (“real-world impact”). Herein, we undertook an author survey to understand how this desire influenced the choice of research topic, choice of journal, and preferred type of impact. Methods: We conducted a survey of authors who had published in >100 of our Earth & Environmental Science journals. The survey was sent to just under 60,000 authors and we received 2,695 responses (4% response rate).   Results: Respondents indicated that the majority of their research (74%) is currently concerned with addressing urgent global needs, whilst 90% of respondents indicated that their work either currently contributed to meeting real-world problems or that it would be a priority for them in the future; however, the impetus for this research focus seems to be altruistic researcher desire, rather than incentives or support from publishers, funders, or their institutions. Indeed, when contextualised within existing reward and incentive structures, respondents indicated that citations or downloads were more important to them than contributing to tackling real-world problems. Conclusions: At present, it seems that the laudable and necessary ambition of researchers in the Earth & Environmental Sciences to contribute to the tackling of real-world problems, such as those included in the UN SDGs, is seemingly being lost amidst the realities of being a researcher, owing to the prioritisation of other forms of impact, such as citations and downloads.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A simple approach for extending up to the ultra-relativistic limit the theory of a non-relativistic Fermi gas [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The theory of a Fermi gas constitutes a useful physical model with multiple applications from solid state to stellar physics. The theory of a non-relativistic Fermi gas is relatively simple when compared with the one for a relativistic Fermi gas. Therefore, it would be useful if a rigorous theory of a relativistic Fermi gas could be constructed like the theory of a non-relativistic Fermi gas. Methods: Such a theory, for T > 0 K, is presented here. It is based on using a recently reported formula for the energies of a relativistic spin-0 particle in a three-dimensional infinite well. The Pauli exclusion principle is used for taking care of the fermion nature of the particles forming a Fermi gas. Results: A unified description of a Fermi gas at low temperatures is presented. This description is valid from the non-relativistic to the ultra-relativistic limits. Moreover, it is simple. The theory follows the relatively simple approach often used for constructing the theory of a non-relativistic Fermi gas.    Conclusions: The ultra-relativistic results reported here are often obtained using a different approach than the one used in this work. These results are not new, but they corroborate the correctness of the presented approach. In addition, the relative simplicity of the approach presented in this work allows for teaching the theory of a relativistic Fermi gas in introductory quantum mechanics courses.

                Introduction : Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in children. Estimate potentially preventable variables that impact the length of hospital stay are a priority to reduce the costs associated with this disease. This study aims to identify clinical variables associated with length of hospital stay of bronchiolitis in children in a tropical middle-income country Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 417 infants with bronchiolitis in tertiary centers in Colombia. All medical records of all patients admitted through the emergency department were reviewed. To identify factors independently associated we use negative binomial regression model, to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and adjust for potential confounding variables Results : The median of the length of hospital stay was 3.68 days, with a range of 0.74 days to 29 days, 138 (33.17%) of patients have a hospital stay of 5 or more days. After modeling and controlling for potential confounders age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD,  chest indrawing, detection of RSV, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS Conclusions : Our results show that in infants with bronchiolitis, detection of RSV, age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD,  chest indrawing, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS. As a potentially modifiable risk factor, efforts to reduce the probability of RSV infection can reduce the high medical cost associates with prolonged LOS in bronchiolitis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strategies for promoting sustainable use and conservation of indigenous chicken breeds in Sub-Saharan Africa: Lessons from low-income countries [version 3; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This review explores innovative and sustainable strategies for the utilization and conservation of indigenous chickens (IC) (Gallus domesticus) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), drawing lessons from selected low-income countries. Small-scale farmers (SSF) have kept IC for hundreds of years to meet their households' nutritional needs, incomes, and social-cultural and religious uses. The commitment exhibited by SSF to keeping IC has made them the significant custodians of essential animal genetic resources AnGR in most low-income countries. Between 1991 and 2012, Zambia's private breeders invested over US$95 million in the commercial poultry sector, resulting in over a 100% increase in the annual production of day-old chicks to 65 million. However, high production costs and low market access hindered rural farmers' full participation, hence their continued dependence on IC breeds. The erosion of AnGR poses the biggest threat to IC in SSA. The Food and Agriculture Organisation, an international body of the United Nations, highlighted that over 3.5% of chicken breeds were extinct, 33% were at risk, and nearly 67% were of unknown status. Poultry diseases, lack of sustainable conservation strategies and poor use have significantly contributed to these losses. In 2012, 60% of IC were reportedly diseased in parts of SSA. The continued loss of IC-AnGR may negatively impact rural livelihoods, and future research and breeding programs in poultry may suffer. This paper reviews IC sector in parts of SSA, the socioeconomic, cultural and religious roles of IC and lessons on researcher-community-stakeholder strategies from selected low-income countries. The paper draws a conclusion and outlines some recommendations for future research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Non-zero mean alpha oscillations revealed with computational model and empirical data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alina A. Studenova, Arno Villringer, Vadim V. Nikulin</p>

Ongoing oscillations and evoked responses are two main types of neuronal activity obtained with diverse electrophysiological recordings (EEG/MEG/iEEG/LFP). Although typically studied separately, they might in fact be closely related. One possibility to unite them is to demonstrate that neuronal oscillations have non-zero mean which predicts that stimulus- or task-triggered amplitude modulation of oscillations can contribute to the generation of evoked responses. We validated this mechanism using computational modelling and analysis of a large EEG data set. With a biophysical model, we indeed demonstrated that intracellular currents in the neuron are asymmetric and, consequently, the mean of alpha oscillations is non-zero. To understand the effect that neuronal currents exert on oscillatory mean, we varied several biophysical and morphological properties of neurons in the network, such as voltage-gated channel densities, length of dendrites, and intensity of incoming stimuli. For a very large range of model parameters, we observed evidence for non-zero mean of oscillations. Complimentary, we analysed empirical rest EEG recordings of 90 participants (50 young, 40 elderly) and, with spatio-spectral decomposition, detected at least one spatially-filtred oscillatory component of non-zero mean alpha oscillations in 93% of participants. In order to explain a complex relationship between the dynamics of amplitude-envelope and corresponding baseline shifts, we performed additional simulations with simple oscillators coupled with different time delays. We demonstrated that the extent of spatial synchronisation may obscure macroscopic estimation of alpha rhythm modulation while leaving baseline shifts unchanged. Overall, our results predict that amplitude modulation of neural oscillations should at least partially explain the generation of evoked responses. Therefore, inference about changes in evoked responses with respect to cognitive conditions, age or neuropathologies should be constructed while taking into account oscillatory neuronal dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model-based translation of DNA damage signaling dynamics across cell types</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Muriel M. Heldring, Lukas S. Wijaya, Marije Niemeijer, Huan Yang, Talel Lakhal, Sylvia E. Le Dévédec, Bob van de Water, Joost B. Beltman</p>

Interindividual variability in DNA damage response (DDR) dynamics may evoke differences in susceptibility to cancer. However, pathway dynamics are often studied in cell lines as alternative to primary cells, disregarding variability. To compare DDR dynamics in the cell line HepG2 with primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), we developed a HepG2-based computational model that describes the dynamics of DDR regulator p53 and targets MDM2, p21 and BTG2. We used this model to generate simulations of virtual PHHs and compared the results to those for PHH donor samples. Correlations between baseline p53 and p21 or BTG2 mRNA expression in the absence and presence of DNA damage for HepG2-derived virtual samples matched the moderately positive correlations observed for 50 PHH donor samples, but not the negative correlations between p53 and its inhibitor MDM2. Model parameter manipulation that affected p53 or MDM2 dynamics was not sufficient to accurately explain the negative correlation between these genes. Thus, extrapolation from HepG2 to PHH can be done for some DDR elements, yet our analysis also reveals a knowledge gap within p53 pathway regulation, which makes such extrapolation inaccurate for the regulator MDM2. This illustrates the relevance of studying pathway dynamics in addition to gene expression comparisons to allow reliable translation of cellular responses from cell lines to primary cells. Overall, with our approach we show that dynamical modeling can be used to improve our understanding of the sources of interindividual variability of pathway dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of actin filaments and cis binding in cadherin clustering and patterning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qilin Yu, Taeyoon Kim, Vijay Rajagopal</p>

Cadherins build up clusters to maintain intercellular contact through trans and cis (lateral) bindings. Meanwhile, interactions between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton through cadherin/F-actin linkers can affect cadherin dynamics by corralling and tethering cadherin molecules locally. Despite many experimental studies, a quantitative, mechanistic understanding of how cadherin and actin cytoskeleton interactions regulate cadherin clustering does not exist. To address this gap in knowledge, we developed a coarse-grained computational model of cadherin dynamics and their interaction with the actin cortex underlying the cell membrane. Our simulation predictions suggest that weak cis binding affinity between cadherin molecules can facilitate large cluster formation. We also found that cadherin movement inhibition by actin corralling is dependent on the concentration and length of actin filaments. This results in changes in cadherin clustering behaviors, as reflected by differences in cluster size and distribution as well as cadherin monomer trajectory. Strong cadherin/actin binding can enhance trans and cis interactions as well as cadherin clustering. By contrast, with weak cadherin/actin binding affinity, a competition between cadherin-actin binding and cis binding for a limited cadherin pool leads to temporary and unstable cadherin clusters.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal control of the spatial allocation of COVID-19 vaccines: Italy as a case study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joseph Chadi Lemaitre, Damiano Pasetto, Mario Zanon, Enrico Bertuzzo, Lorenzo Mari, Stefano Miccoli, Renato Casagrandi, Marino Gatto, Andrea Rinaldo</p>

While campaigns of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are underway across the world, communities face the challenge of a fair and effective distribution of a limited supply of doses. Current vaccine allocation strategies are based on criteria such as age or risk. In the light of strong spatial heterogeneities in disease history and transmission, we explore spatial allocation strategies as a complement to existing approaches. Given the practical constraints and complex epidemiological dynamics, designing effective vaccination strategies at a country scale is an intricate task. We propose a novel optimal control framework to derive the best possible vaccine allocation for given disease transmission projections and constraints on vaccine supply and distribution logistics. As a proof-of-concept, we couple our framework with an existing spatially explicit compartmental COVID-19 model tailored to the Italian geographic and epidemiological context. We optimize the vaccine allocation on scenarios of unfolding disease transmission across the 107 provinces of Italy, from January to April 2021. For each scenario, the optimal solution significantly outperforms alternative strategies that prioritize provinces based on incidence, population distribution, or prevalence of susceptibles. Our results suggest that the complex interplay between the mobility network and the spatial heterogeneities implies highly non-trivial prioritization strategies for effective vaccination campaigns. Our work demonstrates the potential of optimal control for complex and heterogeneous epidemiological landscapes at country, and possibly global, scales.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Dynamin is primed at endocytic sites for ultrafast endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Imoto et al. demonstrate that a splice variant of Dynamin 1, Dyn1xA, mediates vesicle scission during ultrafast endocytosis. For such a rapid event, Dyn1xA molecules are concentrated at endocytic zones through molecular condensation with Syndapin 1. This cache of Dyn1xA accelerates the kinetics of endocytosis by 100-fold.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Motor learning selectively strengthens cortical and striatal synapses of motor engram neurons</a></h4>

              
                In this study, Hwang, Roth, et al. find that motor learning recruits a population of engram neurons in the motor cortex that are reactivated during task performance. Motor learning leads to selective remodeling of dendritic spines and strengthening of outputs to the striatum of M1 engram neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Novelty and uncertainty regulate the balance between exploration and exploitation through distinct mechanisms in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Cockburn et al. show that novelty and uncertainty are used by the human brain to guide distinct exploration strategies. Uncertainty-directed exploration considers the prospective benefit of new information, whereas novelty motivates exploration by inflating the brain’s expectation of reward, offering a feasible decomposition of an otherwise intractable explore/exploit dilemma.
