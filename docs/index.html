              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Piezo2 voltage-block regulates mechanical pain sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                PIEZO2 mechanosensitive channels are required for normal touch sensation. However, PIEZO2 channels are almost completely blocked at negative resting membrane potentials. We show that PIEZO2 voltage-block can be relieved by mutations at a conserved Arginine (R2756) which dramatically sensitizes the channel to mechanical stimuli. We generated Piezo2R2756H/R2756H and Piezo2R2756K/R2756K knock-in mice to ask how voltage regulates the endogenous mechanosensitivity of sensory neurons. Surprisingly, mechanosensitive currents in nociceptors, neurons that detect noxious mechanical stimuli, were substantially sensitized in Piezo2 knock-in mice, but touch receptors were largely unaffected. Piezo2 knock-in mice were hypersensitive to noxious mechanical stimuli as their nociceptors acquired properties similar to ultrasensitive touch receptors. Thus, mechanical pain sensitivity can be tuned by voltage-block of PIEZO2 channels, a channel property potentially amenable for pharmacological modulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comprehensive monitoring of tissue composition using in vivo imaging of cell nuclei and deep learning</a></h4>

              
                Comprehensive analysis of tissue composition has so far been limited to ex vivo approaches. Here, we introduce NuClear (Nucleus-instructed tissue composition using deep learning), an approach combining in vivo two-photon imaging of histone 2B-eGFP-labeled cell nuclei with subsequent deep learning-based identification of cell types from structural features of the respective cell nuclei. This allowed us to classify all cells per imaging volume (0.25 mm3 containing ~25000 cells) and identify their position in 3D space in a non-invasive manner using only a single label. NuClear opens a window to study changes in relative abundance and location of all major brain cell types in individual mice over extended time periods, enabling comprehensive studies of changes in cellular composition in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Endogenous Circadian Clock Machinery in Cortical NG2-Glia Regulates Cellular Proliferation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The molecular circadian clock can be found throughout the body and is essential for the synchronizing cellular physiology with the 24 h day. However, the role of the clock in regulating the regenerative potential of the brain has not been explored. We report here that murine NG2-glia, the largest population of proliferative cells in the mature central nervous system, rhythmically express circadian clock genes in a 24 h period, including the critical clock component <I>Bmal1</I> RNA and BMAL1 protein. Interestingly, daily NG2-glia proliferation preferentially occurs during the time of day in which <I>Bmal1</I> expression is high, while conditional knockout of <I>Bmal1</I> decreases both cortical NG2-glia density and cellular proliferation. Furthermore, in a neurotrauma model, we show that pathology-induced NG2-glia proliferation is also dependent on <I>Bmal1</I> expression. Because circadian rhythm disturbances are common in neurologic disorders across the life span, including in traumatic brain injury, these findings bear significant implications for cellular regeneration in brain injuries and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Measuring Nonapoptotic Caspase Activity with a Transgenic Reporter in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity (NACA) in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that NACA influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple <I>in vivo</I> caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathologic models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Characteristics and Impact of the rNST GABA Network on Neural and Behavioral Taste Responses</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST), the initial CNS site for processing gustatory information, is comprised of two major cell types, glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Although many investigators have described taste responses of rNST neurons, the phenotypes of these cells were unknown. To directly compare the response characteristics of both inhibitory and noninhibitory neurons, we recorded from mice expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) under the control of GAD65, a synthetic enzyme for GABA. We observed that chemosensitive profiles of GABAergic taste neurons (G+<SUB>TASTE</SUB>) were similar to non-GABA taste neurons (G-<SUB>TASTE</SUB>) but had much lower response rates. We further observed a novel subpopulation of GABA cells located more ventrally in the nucleus that were unresponsive to taste stimulation (G+<SUB>UNR</SUB>), suggesting pathways for inhibition initiated by centrifugal sources. This preparation also allowed us to determine how optogenetic activation of the rNST GABA network impacted the taste responses of G-<SUB>TASTE</SUB> neurons. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry suppressed gustatory responses of G-<SUB>TASTE</SUB> neurons across all qualities and chemosensitive types of neurons. Although the tuning curves of identified G-<SUB>TASTE</SUB> were modestly sharpened, the overall shape of response profiles and the ensemble pattern remained highly stable. These neurophysiological effects were consistent with the behavioral consequences of activating GAD65-expressing inhibitory neurons using DREADDs. In a brief-access licking task, concentration-response curves to both palatable (sucrose, maltrin) and unpalatable (quinine) stimuli were shifted to the right when GABA neurons were activated. Thus, the rNST GABAergic network is poised to modulate taste intensity across the qualitative and hedonic spectrum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessing the impacts of conservation volunteering on participant wellbeing: a systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Volunteers and citizen scientists have become an essential element of most nature conservation and restoration activities due to lack of resources but also due to the wish to engage and interact with local communities where conservation activities take place. Environmental or conservation volunteering is also considered to be a key resource in achieving much needed, ambitious nature restoration programs. Practical conservation work and various forms of environmental enhancement along with recreational and therapeutic use of natural or green and blue spaces have been studied for some time. The value of volunteers and the work is widely acknowledged but few studies have been carried out on the impacts of participating on the volunteers themselves. Using this protocol, a study will be undertaken to assess how impacts of participation have been assessed and reported in the literature; what these reported impacts are; how these are related to reported barriers and motivations for volunteering and whether they are affected by the region or country of study. Methods: This paper will identify studies that have described and assessed impacts of conservation and restoration volunteering on participants at an individual level, with a specific focus on physical, mental or societal wellbeing of individuals. Representative studies were sought from major search engines and relevant stakeholder publications, including both peer-reviewed and ‘grey literature’ in predominantly English language publications, published between 2000 and 2020. A priori inclusion criteria consisted of those publications and reports on studies with volunteer and community participants and which described impacts of, motivations for and barriers to participation. After a critical appraisal, a total of 105 articles were selected for further analysis to provide a narrative and mixed methods synthesis of the evidence base.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reduction of chickens use to perform in vitro pre-screening of novel anticoccidials by miniaturisation and increased throughput of the current Eimeria tenella compound-screening model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We have developed an in vitro model for the evaluation of potential anticoccidial properties of novel compounds aimed to control chicken coccidiosis, a costly disease for the poultry industry. This disease is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria (Apicomplexa), and it is mainly controlled by chemoprophylaxis with ionophores and chemical anticoccidials; however, there is an overall agreement about the limitation of these traditional drugs and the need to improve current methods of control. Anticoccidial activities of novel compounds is currently evaluated by expensive experiments that involve large numbers of chickens. The use of our in vitro model for the pre-screening of essential oils led to a reduction of 67% of the chickens used in the in vivo trials for validation. Eimeria parasites can only complete their life cycle in their animal host, therefore chickens are required for their propagation as they cannot be propagated in vitro. In this study, we describe how further optimisation of this in vitro model by miniaturisation can have an additional impact in reduction of the number of chickens used for the generation of parasite stocks for provision of the in vitro model. We have estimated that the use of one chicken could support the evaluation of 10 compounds with a 96-well plate format versus only two compounds with a 24-well plate format, which means an 80% reduction in chicken use. In this study we have proved that the miniaturisation into a 96-well plate format perfectly mimics the invasion and replication observed before in the 24-well plate format. In addition, the 96-well plate format has allowed the simultaneous pre-screening of higher numbers of anticoccidial drugs at different concentrations following streamlined protocols in a more cost-effective way, factors that are beneficial for a wider uptake of the model by other researchers investigating anticoccidial compounds.

                Background: Little is known about psychosocial characteristics, including loneliness, anxiety, and depression, present in preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between these psychosocial characteristics and amyloid accumulation in cognitively normal older adults with and without preclinical AD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A global Clinical Dementia Rating® Scale score of 0 was required for enrollment. Cortical amyloid burden was measured using [11C] Pittsburgh compound B or [18F]-Florbetapir PET tracers. Centiloids were used to synchronize measures. Demographic characteristics and measures of loneliness, anxiety, and depression were collected via self-report. Spearman’s correlation was used to examine relationships between amyloid and psychosocial characteristics. Results: The 108 participants had a mean age of 75.0 and an average amyloid burden of 22.2. Higher amyloid accumulation was significantly associated with greater loneliness. Conclusions: Additional research is needed with a larger, more diverse sample to examine these psychosocial characteristics in preclinical AD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolated from contaminated areas of Majengo slum in Meru County, Kenya [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Antimicrobial drug resistance is of great concern today. Infections by the antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli, including enteropathogenic as well as enterotoxigenic strains have been reported as a major cause of deaths, especially among young children in low- and middle-income countries. This has been augmented by antimicrobial misuse, over the counter availability and poor sanitation especially in low income areas. This study aimed at characterizing antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli isolated from sanitation environments of the Majengo slum in Meru County, Kenya Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 61 samples from soil, water and drains swabs. These were tested against five antimicrobial drugs by the Kirby disk diffusion method. Results: A total of 42 (69%) of the samples had Escherichia coli. These recorded antimicrobial drug susceptibility as follows: Out of the five antimicrobial agents used, ceftazidime 28 (66.67%) showed the highest sensitivity followed by ciprofloxacin 26 (61.90%) and imepenem 25 (59.52%) respectively. cefotaxime and cefoxitin showed least sensitivity at 14 (33.33%) and 13 (30.95%) respectively. In intermediate imepenem and ciprofloxacin were the highest with 12 (28.57%) followed by cefotaxime 10 (23.81%). The least intermediate was observed in ceftazidime and cefoxitin both at 7 (16.67%).  The highest resistance was observed in cefoxitin 22 (52.38%), followed by cefotaxime at 18 (42.86%). Ciprofloxacin, imepenem and ceftazidime had the lowest resistance 4 (9.52%), 5 (11.91%) and 7 (16.67%) respectively. The p-value <0.05 was considered significant to the study.   Conclusions: This study showed that Escherichia coli isolated from Majengo is pathogenic and resistant to antibiotics. Detection of Escherichia coli poses a great risk in the spread of resistant strains in human. Proper sanitation and hygiene awareness practices should be provided through education to the residents of this area.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale-the Thai Translation (ASEX-Thai): Reliability and validity in Thai patients with mental disorders [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sexual dysfunction is common among patients with mental disorders but receives less clinical attention, especially in Thailand and other Asian countries. The Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale-the Thai Translation (ASEX-Thai), a self-rated, brief, questionnaire is a potential tool for screening for sexual dysfunction in this population. Our study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of ASEX-Thai in Thai patients with mental disorders. Methods: We enrolled 202 patients from an outpatient psychiatric department at a tertiary hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Demographic data, clinical data, and diagnosis of sexual dysfunction were assessed. ASEX-Thai was done, and we analyzed the test’s psychometric properties.  Results: Most participants were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (48%). There was a positive correlation between the ASEX-Thai and sexual dysfunction diagnosis (r = 0.402, p < 0.001). The KMO coefficient was 0.77 and Barlett’s sphericity test was significant (χ 2 = 409.76, p<0.001). A score of ≥ 17 points of the ASEX-Thai was the most suitable for sexual dysfunction screening (sensitivity 77.23 %, and specificity 58.42 %). For reliability, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (0.831) showed good internal consistency. Conclusions: The ASEX-Thai is a valid and reliable self-rated questionnaire for screening for sexual dysfunction among Thai patients with mental disorders. The test could help clinicians to evaluate this undetected condition and deliver proper interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Concentration fluctuations in growing and dividing cells: Insights into the emergence of concentration homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chen Jia, Abhyudai Singh, Ramon Grima</p>

Intracellular reaction rates depend on concentrations and hence their levels are often regulated. However classical models of stochastic gene expression lack a cell size description and cannot be used to predict noise in concentrations. Here, we construct a model of gene product dynamics that includes a description of cell growth, cell division, size-dependent gene expression, gene dosage compensation, and size control mechanisms that can vary with the cell cycle phase. We obtain expressions for the approximate distributions and power spectra of concentration fluctuations which lead to insight into the emergence of concentration homeostasis. We find that (i) the conditions necessary to suppress cell division-induced concentration oscillations are difficult to achieve; (ii) mRNA concentration and number distributions can have different number of modes; (iii) two-layer size control strategies such as sizer-timer or adder-timer are ideal because they maintain constant mean concentrations whilst minimising concentration noise; (iv) accurate concentration homeostasis requires a fine tuning of dosage compensation, replication timing, and size-dependent gene expression; (v) deviations from perfect concentration homeostasis show up as deviations of the concentration distribution from a gamma distribution. Some of these predictions are confirmed using data for <i>E. coli</i>, fission yeast, and budding yeast.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dual STDP processes at Purkinje cells contribute to distinct improvements in accuracy and speed of saccadic eye movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lorenzo Fruzzetti, Hari Teja Kalidindi, Alberto Antonietti, Cristiano Alessandro, Alice Geminiani, Claudia Casellato, Egidio Falotico, Egidio D’Angelo</p>

Saccadic eye-movements play a crucial role in visuo-motor control by allowing rapid foveation onto new targets. However, the neural processes governing saccades adaptation are not fully understood. Saccades, due to the short-time of execution (20–100 ms) and the absence of sensory information for online feedback control, must be controlled in a ballistic manner. Incomplete measurements of the movement trajectory, such as the visual endpoint error, are supposedly used to form internal predictions about the movement kinematics resulting in predictive control. In order to characterize the synaptic and neural circuit mechanisms underlying predictive saccadic control, we have reconstructed the saccadic system in a digital controller embedding a spiking neural network of the cerebellum with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules driving parallel fiber—Purkinje cell long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD). This model implements a control policy based on a dual plasticity mechanism, resulting in the identification of the roles of LTP and LTD in regulating the overall quality of saccade kinematics: it turns out that LTD increases the accuracy by decreasing visual error and LTP increases the peak speed. The control policy also required cerebellar PCs to be divided into two subpopulations, characterized by burst or pause responses. To our knowledge, this is the first model that explains in mechanistic terms the visual error and peak speed regulation of ballistic eye movements in forward mode exploiting spike-timing to regulate firing in different populations of the neuronal network. This elementary model of saccades could be extended and applied to other more complex cases in which single jerks are concatenated to compose articulated and coordinated movements.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Distinct phosphorylation states of mammalian CaMKIIβ control the induction and maintenance of sleep</a></h4>

Ueda</p>

The reduced sleep duration previously observed in <i>Camk2b</i> knockout mice revealed a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)β as a sleep-promoting kinase. However, the underlying mechanism by which CaMKIIβ supports sleep regulation is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that activation or inhibition of CaMKIIβ can increase or decrease sleep duration in mice by almost 2-fold, supporting the role of CaMKIIβ as a core sleep regulator in mammals. Importantly, we show that this sleep regulation depends on the kinase activity of CaMKIIβ. A CaMKIIβ mutant mimicking the constitutive-active (auto)phosphorylation state promotes the transition from awake state to sleep state, while mutants mimicking subsequent multisite (auto)phosphorylation states suppress the transition from sleep state to awake state. These results suggest that the phosphorylation states of CaMKIIβ differently control sleep induction and maintenance processes, leading us to propose a “phosphorylation hypothesis of sleep” for the molecular control of sleep in mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A prebiotic basis for ATP as the universal energy currency</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Silvana Pinna, Cäcilia Kunz, Aaron Halpern, Stuart A. Harrison, Sean F. Jordan, John Ward, Finn Werner, Nick Lane</p>

ATP is universally conserved as the principal energy currency in cells, driving metabolism through phosphorylation and condensation reactions. Such deep conservation suggests that ATP arose at an early stage of biochemical evolution. Yet purine synthesis requires 6 phosphorylation steps linked to ATP hydrolysis. This autocatalytic requirement for ATP to synthesize ATP implies the need for an earlier prebiotic ATP equivalent, which could drive protometabolism before purine synthesis. Why this early phosphorylating agent was replaced, and specifically with ATP rather than other nucleoside triphosphates, remains a mystery. Here, we show that the deep conservation of ATP might reflect its prebiotic chemistry in relation to another universally conserved intermediate, acetyl phosphate (AcP), which bridges between thioester and phosphate metabolism by linking acetyl CoA to the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP. We confirm earlier results showing that AcP can phosphorylate ADP to ATP at nearly 20% yield in water in the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions. We then show that Fe<sup>3+</sup> and AcP are surprisingly favoured. A wide range of prebiotically relevant ions and minerals failed to catalyse ADP phosphorylation. From a panel of prebiotic phosphorylating agents, only AcP, and to a lesser extent carbamoyl phosphate, showed any significant phosphorylating potential. Critically, AcP did not phosphorylate any other nucleoside diphosphate. We use these data, reaction kinetics, and molecular dynamic simulations to infer a possible mechanism. Our findings might suggest that the reason ATP is universally conserved across life is that its formation is chemically favoured in aqueous solution under mild prebiotic conditions.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG and aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG among patients with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) and healthy controls, to determine whether seropositive cases fulfilled their respective diagnostic criteria, to compare characteristics and outcomes in children with POMS versus MOG-IgG-associated disease (MOGAD), and identify clinical features associated with final diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with POMS and healthy controls were enrolled at 14 US sites through a prospective case–control study on POMS risk factors. Serum AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG were assessed using live cell-based assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AQP4-IgG was negative among all 1,196 participants, 493 with POMS and 703 healthy controls. MOG-IgG was positive in 30 of 493 cases (6%) and zero controls. Twenty-five of 30 patients positive with MOG-IgG (83%) had MOGAD, whereas 5 of 30 (17%) maintained a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) on re-review of records. MOGAD cases were more commonly in female patients (21/25 [84%] vs 301/468 [64%]; <i>p</i> = 0.044), younger age (mean = 8.2 ± 4.2 vs 14.7 ± 2.6 years; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), more commonly had initial optic nerve symptoms (16/25 [64%] vs 129/391 [33%]; <i>p</i> = 0.002), or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM; 8/25 [32%] vs 9/468 [2%]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and less commonly had initial spinal cord symptoms (3/20 [15%] vs 194/381 [51%]; <i>p</i> = 0.002), serum Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) positivity (11/25 [44%] vs 445/468 [95%]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), or cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands (5/25 [20%] vs 243/352 [69%]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG were not identified among healthy controls confirming their high specificity for pediatric central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease. Five percent of those with prior POMS diagnoses ultimately had MOGAD; and none had AQP4-IgG positivity. Clinical features associated with a final diagnosis of MOGAD in those with suspected MS included initial ADEM phenotype, younger age at disease onset, and lack of EBV exposure.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by initial involvement of the olfactory bulb/amygdala or autonomic nerves followed by nigral degeneration. Although autonomic innervation strictly regulates multiorgan systems, including endocrine functions, circulation, and digestion, how dysautonomia in PD affects systemic metabolism has not been identified. In this study, we tried to estimate the pathogenic linkage of PD by nuclear medicine techniques, trans-omic analysis of blood samples, and cultured cell experiments.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thyroid mediastinum ratio of <sup>123</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy was measured in 1,158 patients with PD. Furthermore, serum exosome miRNA transcriptome analysis and plasma metabolome analysis followed by trans-omic analysis were performed in patients with de novo PD and age-matched healthy control persons. Additionally, thyroid hormone was administered to skeletal muscle and liver derived cells to evaluate the effect of hypothyroidism for these organs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sympathetic denervation of thyroid correlating with its cardiac denervation was confirmed in 1,158 patients with PD by MIBG scintigraphy. Among patients with drug-naïve PD, comprehensive metabolome analysis revealed decreased levels of thyroxine and insufficient fatty acid β-oxidation, which positively correlate with one another. Likewise, both plasma metabolome data and transcriptome data of circulating exosomal miRNAs, revealed specific enrichment of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) axis. Finally, association of thyroid hormone with PPARα-dependent β-oxidation regulation was confirmed by in vitro experiments.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that interorgan communications between the thyroid and liver are disorganized in the early stage of PD, which would be a sensitive diagnostic biomarker for PD. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Actigraphy enables home screening of REM behavior disorder in Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a potentially harmful, often overlooked sleep disorder affecting up to 70% of Parkinson's disease patients. Current diagnosis relies on nocturnal video-polysomnography, which is an expensive and cumbersome exam requiring specific clinical expertise. Here, we explored the use of wrist actigraphy to enable automatic RBD diagnoses in home settings.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty-six Parkinson's patients underwent two-week home wrist actigraphy, followed by two in-lab evaluations. Patients were classified as RBD vs. non-RBD based on dream enactment history and video-polysomnography. We comprehensively characterized patients’ movement patterns during sleep using actigraphic signals. We then trained machine learning classification algorithms to discriminate patients with or without RBD using the most relevant features. Classification performance was quantified with respect to clinical diagnosis, separately for in-lab and at-home recordings. Performance was further validated in a control group of non-PD patients with other sleep conditions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>To characterize RBD, actigraphic features extracted from both (i) individual movement episodes and (ii) global nocturnal activity were critical. RBD patients were more active overall, and exhibited movements that were shorter, of higher magnitude, and more scattered in time. Using these features, our classification algorithms reached an accuracy of 92.9±8.16% during in-clinic tests. When validated on home recordings in Parkinson's patients, accuracy reached 100% over a two-week window, and was 94.4% in non-PD control patients. Features showed robustness across tests and conditions.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>These results open new perspectives for faster, cheaper, and more regular screening of sleep disorders, both for routine clinical practice and clinical trials.</p>

                Cytokine storms, oxidative stress, and hyperglycemia can enhance the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, T2D may change the functional and structural heart. However, some signaling pathways, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia, can play in T2D, and various pathomechanics and pathophysiology involved in T2D are not understood. Moreover, it is well documented that the non-coding RNAs are potentially pivotal molecules in oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death signaling pathways. Hence, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs may have vital roles in oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolism, T2D, and cardiovascular systems. Non-coding RNAs can target hub gene networks and suppress or trigger various cascades. Furthermore, lifestyle is the other factor that may affect the prevalence of T2D. A sedentary lifestyle and excessive sitting can enhance inflammation, oxidative stress, and hyperglycemia. Here, we attempt to comprehend the role of hub genes, non-coding RNAs, and unhealthy lifestyles on the pathomechanics and pathophysiology of diabetic vascular complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainability of the regional financial system: a case study of the Northwestern Federal District [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This article provides an assessment of the sustainability of Russian regions’ financial systems. The study is based on the methods of generalization and synthesis, correlation-regression analysis, and multivariate classification. Since the structure of the regional financial system is complex, several works are devoted to studying its sustainability issues. The relevance of the study topic is confirmed by the lack of a systematic approach to assessing the integral index of sustainability and the possibility of using various tools in determining the complex indicator. Methods: This  methodology with application of mathematical statistics methods makes it possible to assess the financial system sustainability in four sectors, to include the leading indicators in the assessment, and to identify regions with extreme values of debt burden indicators. The method was tested for the regions of the Northwestern Federal District (NWFD) for the period 2010 - 2019  to classify the regions according to three levels of debt sustainability. Data collection from the 1st January to 30th April 2022 included statistical data from government open internet sources, sectors studied relate to government, and municipal budgets in the NWFD. Authors analyzed regional debt sustainability indicators and identified themes in the field of sustainability studies for the NWFD. Results: An increased level of financial system sustainability was observed among the  NWFD regions in the corporative and personal finance sectors, indicating a significant contribution of businesses and households to maintaining the balance and sustainability of the financial system in Russia as a whole. The results of the study also identified that the NWFD regions belong to three clusters: cluster 1 - high debt sustainability; cluster 2 - medium debt sustainability; and cluster 3 - low debt sustainability. Conclusions: The study results allowed the identification of regions with a constantly high level of debt, financial, and corporative sustainability.

                In a recent study, Zhang, Roy, and colleagues have shown that neurons in the parafascicular (PF) thalamus project to three distinct neural structures in the basal ganglia. The neural circuits identified in the study were associated with specific motor and non-motor symptoms in a Parkinson’s disease (PD) mouse model. The findings provide potential actionable therapeutic targets for this disease.

                Kim et al. show that the transcriptional repressor Capicua (CIC) regulates YAP1 expression in human cancer. CIC-mediated YAP1 suppression occurs through non-consensus GGAA repeat motifs. CIC loss increases YAP1 expression to drive tumor progression. YAP inhibition in CIC-deficient cancers overcomes drug resistance and limits tumor growth.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">E2F1 transcription factor mediates a link between fat and islets to promote β cell proliferation in response to acute insulin resistance</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive β cell proliferation in response to insulin resistance is a compensatory pathway to increase functional β cell mass. Shirakawa et al. reveal that potential circulating factors from adipocytes drive β cell multiplication via insulin signaling-independent E2F1 and CENP-A pathways in response to S961-induced acute insulin resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Single-cell profiling of peripheral neuroblastic tumors identifies an aggressive transitional state that bridges an adrenergic-mesenchymal trajectory</a></h4>

              
                Yuan et al. undertook single-cell RNA sequencing on 10 peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNTs), including neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma. They used single-cell gene expression to model interconverting malignant cell transitions between the so-called adrenergic and mesenchymal cell types and identify an aggressive bridging cell type referred to as “transitional” cells.

                It has been shown that GRP-GRPR neuropeptide signaling in the SCN is important for contagious itch behavior in mice. Gao et al. find that SCN-projecting ipRGCs are sufficient to relay itch information from the retina to the SCN by releasing neuropeptide PACAP to activate the GRP-GRPR pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Targeting A-kinase anchoring protein 12 phosphorylation in hepatic stellate cells regulates liver injury and fibrosis in mouse models</a></h4>

              
                Trans-differentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to activated state potentiates liver fibrosis through release of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, distorting the liver architecture. Since limited antifibrotics are available, pharmacological intervention targeting activated HSCs may be considered for therapy. A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) is a scaffolding protein that directs protein kinases A/C (PKA/PKC) and cyclins to specific locations spatiotemporally controlling their biological effects. It has been shown that AKAP12’s scaffolding functions are altered by phosphorylation. In previously published work, observed an association between AKAP12 phosphorylation and HSC activation. In this work, we demonstrate that AKAP12’s scaffolding activity toward the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident collagen chaperone, heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47) is strongly inhibited by AKAP12’s site-specific phosphorylation in activated HSCs. CRISPR-directed gene editing of AKAP12’s phospho-sites restores its scaffolding toward HSP47, inhibiting HSP47’s collagen maturation functions, and HSC activation. AKAP12 phospho-editing dramatically inhibits fibrosis, ER stress response, HSC inflammatory signaling, and liver injury in mice. Our overall findings suggest a pro-fibrogenic role of AKAP12 phosphorylation that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention in liver fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental evidence that group size generates divergent benefits of cooperative breeding for male and female ostriches</a></h4>

              
                Cooperative breeding allows the costs of parental care to be shared, but as groups become larger, such benefits often decline as competition increases and group cohesion breaks down. The counteracting forces of cooperation and competition are predicted to select for an optimal group size, but variation in groups is ubiquitous across cooperative breeding animals. Here, we experimentally test if group sizes vary because of sex differences in the costs and benefits of cooperative breeding in captive ostriches, <i>Struthio camelus,</i> and compare this to the distribution of group sizes in the wild. We established 96 groups with different numbers of males (1 or 3) and females (1, 3, 4, or 6) and manipulated opportunities for cooperation over incubation. There was a clear optimal group size for males (one male with four or more females) that was explained by high costs of competition and negligible benefits of cooperation. Conversely, female reproductive success was maximised across a range of group sizes due to the benefits of cooperation with male and female group members. Reproductive success in intermediate sized groups was low for both males and females due to sexual conflict over the timing of mating and incubation. Our experiments show that sex differences in cooperation and competition can explain group size variation in cooperative breeders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Drosophila ZAD zinc finger protein Kipferl guides Rhino to piRNA clusters</a></h4>

              
                RNA interference systems depend on the synthesis of small RNA precursors whose sequences define the target spectrum of these silencing pathways. The <i>Drosophila</i> Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) variant Rhino permits transcription of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) precursors within transposon-rich heterochromatic loci in germline cells. Current models propose that Rhino’s specific chromatin occupancy at piRNA source loci is determined by histone marks and maternally inherited piRNAs, but also imply the existence of other, undiscovered specificity cues. Here, we identify a member of the diverse family of zinc finger associated domain (ZAD)-C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins, Kipferl, as critical Rhino cofactor in ovaries. By binding to guanosine-rich DNA motifs and interacting with the Rhino chromodomain, Kipferl recruits Rhino to specific loci and stabilizes it on chromatin. In <i>kipferl</i> mutant flies, Rhino is lost from most of its target chromatin loci and instead accumulates on pericentromeric Satellite arrays, resulting in decreased levels of transposon targeting piRNAs and impaired fertility. Our findings reveal that DNA sequence, in addition to the H3K9me3 mark, determines the identity of piRNA source loci and provide insight into how Rhino might be caught in the crossfire of genetic conflicts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hepatic inactivation of murine Surf4 results in marked reduction in plasma cholesterol</a></h4>

              
                PCSK9 negatively regulates low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) abundance on the cell surface, leading to decreased hepatic clearance of LDL particles and increased levels of plasma cholesterol. We previously identified SURF4 as a cargo receptor that facilitates PCSK9 secretion in HEK293T cells (Emmer et al., 2018). Here, we generated hepatic SURF4-deficient mice (<i>Surf4<sup>fl/fl</sup> Alb-Cre<sup>+</sup></i>) to investigate the physiologic role of SURF4 <i>in vivo</i>. <i>Surf4<sup>fl/fl</sup> Alb-Cre<sup>+</sup></i> mice exhibited normal viability, gross development, and fertility. Plasma PCSK9 levels were reduced by ~60% in <i>Surf4<sup>fl/fl</sup> Alb-Cre<sup>+ </sup></i>mice, with a corresponding ~50% increase in steady state LDLR protein abundance in the liver, consistent with SURF4 functioning as a cargo receptor for PCSK9. Surprisingly, these mice exhibited a marked reduction in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels out of proportion to the partial increase in hepatic LDLR abundance. Detailed characterization of lipoprotein metabolism in these mice instead revealed a severe defect in hepatic lipoprotein secretion, consistent with prior reports of SURF4 also promoting the secretion of apolipoprotein B. Despite a small increase in liver mass and lipid content, histologic evaluation revealed no evidence of steatohepatitis or fibrosis in <i>Surf4<sup>fl/fl</sup> Alb-Cre<sup>+</sup></i> mice. Acute depletion of hepatic SURF4 by CRISPR/Cas9 or liver-targeted siRNA in adult mice confirms these findings. Together, these data support the physiologic significance of SURF4 in the hepatic secretion of PCSK9 and APOB-containing lipoproteins and its potential as a therapeutic target in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Machine learning-assisted elucidation of CD81-CD44 interactions in promoting cancer stemness and extracellular vesicle integrity</a></h4>

              
                Tumor-initiating cells with reprogramming plasticity or stem-progenitor cell properties (stemness) are thought to be essential for cancer development and metastatic regeneration in many cancers; however, elucidation of the underlying molecular network and pathways remains demanding. Combining machine learning and experimental investigation, here we report CD81, a tetraspanin transmembrane protein known to be enriched in extracellular vesicles (EVs), as a newly identified driver of breast cancer stemness and metastasis. Using protein structure modeling and interface prediction-guided mutagenesis, we demonstrate that membrane CD81 interacts with CD44 through their extracellular regions in promoting tumor cell cluster formation and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in human and mouse models. In-depth global and phosphoproteomic analyses of tumor cells deficient with CD81 or CD44 unveils endocytosis-related pathway alterations, leading to further identification of a quality-keeping role of CD44 and CD81 in EV secretion as well as in EV-associated stemness-promoting function. CD81 is co-expressed along with CD44 in human circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and enriched in clustered CTCs that promote cancer stemness and metastasis, supporting the clinical significance of CD81 in association with patient outcomes. Our study highlights machine learning as a powerful tool in facilitating the molecular understanding of new molecular targets in regulating stemness and metastasis of TNBC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Telocytes regulate macrophages in periodontal disease</a></h4>

              
                Telocytes (TCs) or interstitial cells are characterised in vivo by their long projections that contact other cell types. Although telocytes can be found in many different tissues including the heart<sup>1</sup>, lung<sup>2</sup> and intestine<sup>3</sup>, their tissue-specific roles are poorly understood. Here we identify a specific cell signalling role for telocytes in the periodontium whereby telocytes regulate macrophage activity. We performed scRNA-seq and lineage tracing to identify telocytes and macrophages in mouse periodontium in homeostasis and periodontitis and carried out HGF signalling inhibition experiments using Tivantinib. We show that telocytes are quiescent in homeostasis, however, they proliferate and serve as a major source of HGF in periodontitis. Macrophages receive telocyte-derived HGF signals and shift from an M1 to a M1/M2 state. Our results reveal the source of HGF signals in periodontal tissue and provide new insights into the function of telocytes in regulating macrophage behaviour in periodontitis through HGF/Met cell signalling, that may provide a novel approach in periodontitis treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Age-dependent aggregation of ribosomal RNA-binding proteins links deterioration in chromatin stability with challenges to proteostasis</a></h4>

              
                Chromatin instability and protein homeostasis (proteostasis) stress are two well-established hallmarks of aging, which have been considered largely independent of each other. Using microfluidics and single-cell imaging approaches, we observed that, during the replicative aging of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, a challenge to proteostasis occurs specifically in the fraction of cells with decreased stability within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). A screen of 170 yeast RNA-binding proteins identified ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-binding proteins as the most enriched group that aggregate upon a decrease in rDNA stability induced by inhibition of a conserved lysine deacetylase Sir2. Further, loss of rDNA stability induces age-dependent aggregation of rRNA-binding proteins through aberrant overproduction of rRNAs. These aggregates contribute to age-induced proteostasis decline and limit cellular lifespan. Our findings reveal a mechanism underlying the interconnection between chromatin instability and proteostasis stress and highlight the importance of cell-to-cell variability in aging processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolution of manipulative cheating</a></h4>

              
                A social cheat is typically assumed to be an individual that does not perform a cooperative behaviour, or performs less of it, but can still exploit the cooperative behaviour of others. However, empirical data suggests that cheating can be more subtle, involving evolutionary arms races over the ability to both exploit and resist exploitation. These complications have not been captured by evolutionary theory, which lags behind empirical studies in this area. We bridge this gap with a mixture of game-theoretical models and individual-based simulations, examining what conditions favour more elaborate patterns of cheating. We found that as well as adjusting their own behaviour, individuals can be selected to manipulate the behaviour of others, which we term 'manipulative cheating'. Further, we found that manipulative cheating can lead to dynamic oscillations (arms races), between selfishness, manipulation, and suppression of manipulation. Our results can help explain both variation in the level of cheating, and genetic variation in the extent to which individuals can be exploited by cheats.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Neurodata Without Borders ecosystem for neurophysiological data science</a></h4>

              
                The neurophysiology of cells and tissues are monitored electrophysiologically and optically in diverse experiments and species, ranging from flies to humans. Understanding the brain requires integration of data across this diversity, and thus these data must be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). This requires a standard language for data and metadata that can coevolve with neuroscience. We describe design and implementation principles for a language for neurophysiology data. Our open-source software (Neurodata Without Borders, NWB) defines and modularizes the interdependent, yet separable, components of a data language. We demonstrate NWB’s impact through unified description of neurophysiology data across diverse modalities and species. NWB exists in an ecosystem, which includes data management, analysis, visualization, and archive tools. Thus, the NWB data language enables reproduction, interchange, and reuse of diverse neurophysiology data. More broadly, the design principles of NWB are generally applicable to enhance discovery across biology through data FAIRness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A shared neural code for social interaction encoding and memory in the human superior temporal sulcus</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing and remembering social information is a crucial cognitive skill. Neural patterns in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) support our ability to perceive others' social interactions. However, despite the prominence of social interactions in memory, the neural basis of retrieving social interactions is still unknown. To fill this gap, we investigated the brain mechanisms underlying memory of others' social interactions during free spoken recall of a naturalistic movie. By applying machine learning-based fMRI encoding analyses to densely labeled movie and recall data we found that STS activity patterns evoked by viewing social interactions predicted neural responses to social interaction memories. This finding suggests that the STS contains high-level conceptual, representations of social interactions, and its reactivation underlies our ability to remember others' interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estrogen receptor beta in the central amygdala regulates the deleterious behavioral and neuronal consequences of repeated social stress in female rats</a></h4>

              
                While over 95% of the population has reported experiencing extreme stress or trauma, females of reproductive age develop stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders at twice the rate of males. This suggests that ovarian hormones may facilitate neural processes that increase stress susceptibility and underlie the heightened rates of these disorders, like depression and anxiety, that result from stress exposure in females. However, there is contradicting evidence in the literature regarding estrogen's role in stress-related behavioral outcomes. Estrogen signaling through estrogen receptor beta (ERb) has been traditionally thought of as anxiolytic, but recent studies suggest estrogen exhibits distinct effects in the context of stress. Furthermore, ERb is found abundantly in many stress-sensitive brain loci, including the central amygdala (CeA), in which transcription of the vital stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), can be regulated by an estrogen response element. Therefore, these experiments sought to identify the role of CeA ERb activity during stress on behavioral outcomes in naturally cycling, adult, female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were exposed to an ethological model of vicarious social stress, witness stress (WS), in which they experienced the sensory and psychological aspects of an aggressive social defeat encounter between two males. Following stress, rats exhibited stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the marble burying task, and, finally, brain analysis revealed increased ERb and CRF specifically within the CeA following exposure to stress cues. Subsequent experiments were designed to target this receptor in the CeA using microinjections of the ERb antagonist, PHTPP, prior to each stress session. Sucrose preference, acoustic startle, and marble burying tasks determined that blocking ERb in the CeA during WS prevented the development of depressive-,anxiety-like, and hypervigilant behaviors. Additionally, brain analysis revealed a long-term decrease of intra-CeA CRF expression in PHTPP-treated rats. These experiments indicate that ERb signaling in the CeA, through its effects on CRF, contributes to the development of negative valence behaviors that result from exposure to repeated social stress in female rats.

                When we are following someone when there are multiple speakers, are we just paying attention to the sound the speaker makes, the word the speaker uses, or are we aligning our minds to the attended speaker? In this process, selective attention plays a critical role. Previous studies have mainly focused on attention modulation on the single types of features from the speaker. However, attending to a speaker needs an integrative process: the sound waves, which represent acoustic features, should be heard; the meaning of the text, which represents semantic features, needs to be understood; listeners and speakers need to form a common grounding during the process, which represent the inter-brain feature. We still do not know how our brain entrains different types of features from the speaker in an integrative way. In this study, naturalistic speech was adopted to explore attention modulation. The natural language processing models and the flourishing inter-brain recording methods were adopted to qualify the different types of information from the speaker. Our study revealed that attention modulated the acoustic, semantic, and speaker's neural activity in an integrative way. When the listener pays attention to a speaker, the sound is the first to be processed: The neural activity in the theta band entrains the acoustic feature with a latency of 200~350 ms. Then, the meaning of the attended speech is parsed: the delta band modulates the attention with a latency of 200~600 ms. The listener entrains the speaker's neural activity 5 seconds before the speech onset. The entrainment of the acoustic feature and the semantic feature is correlated with each other. Only the entrainment of the attended speaker has a significant negative correlation with the comprehension score. Together, these results illustrate an integrative view of how our brain is selectively entrained to different types of information from the speaker.

                We present the first analysis of the connectome of the vertical lobe (VL) of Octopus vulgaris, a brain structure mediating the acquisition of long-term memory in this behaviorally advanced mollusk. Serial section electron microscopy revealed new types of interneurons, cellular components of extensive modulatory systems, and multiple synaptic motifs. The sensory input to the VL is conveyed via {approx}1,800,000 axons that sparsely innervate two parallel and interconnected feedforward networks formed by the two AM types, simple AMs (SAMs) and complex AMS (CAMs). SAMs make up 89.3% of the 25,000,000 AMs, each receiving synaptic input from only a single input neuron on its non-bifurcating primary neurite, suggesting that each input neuron is represented in only {approx}12 SAMs. The CAMs, a newly described amacrine type, comprise 1.6% of the amacrine population. Their bifurcating neurites integrate multiple inputs from the input axons and SAMs. While the SAM network appears to feedforward sparse memorizable sensory representations into the VL output layer, the CAMs appear to monitor global activity and feedforward a balancing inhibition for sharpening the stimulus-specific VL output. While sharing morphological and wiring features with circuits supporting associative learning in other animals, the VL has evolved a unique circuit that enables associative learning based strictly on feedforward information flow.

                The murine oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model is one of the most widely used animal models of ischemic retinopathy, mimicking hallmark pathophysiology of initial vaso-obliteration (VO) resulting in ischemia that drives neovascularization (NV). In addition to NV and VO, human ischemic retinopathies including Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) are characterized by increased vascular tortuosity. Vascular tortuosity is an indicator of disease severity, need to treat, and treatment response in ROP. Current literature investigating novel therapeutics in the OIR model report their effects on NV and VO, but no standardized quantification of vascular tortuosity exists to date despite this metric's relevance to human disease in clinics. The current proof-of-concept study applied a computer-based image analysis algorithm capable of calculating standardized measurements of vascular tortuosity. Quantification of vascular tortuosity correlated with disease activity in OIR analogously to that observed in infants with ROP. Treatment of OIR mice with anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (aflibercept) rescued vascular tortuosity in the model. Altogether, these data demonstrated that vascular tortuosity is a quantifiable feature of the OIR model and may be used as an outcome measurement in future studies investigating new treatment modalities for retinal ischemia.

                Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Individuals with MDD exhibit decreased motivation and deficits in reward processing along with chronically elevated levels of the 'stress hormone,' cortisol. However, the mechanistic relationship between chronically elevated cortisol and behavioral deficits in motivation and reward processing remains unclear. Given that women are diagnosed with MDD at twice the rate of men, it is important to understand whether the mechanisms linking chronically elevated cortisol to the symptoms of MDD differ by sex. Methods: We used subcutaneous implants to chronically elevate free plasma corticosterone (rodent homolog of cortisol; 'CORT') in male and female mice and examined changes in behavior and dopamine system function. We used operant training to assay reward-guided motivation and high-performance liquid chromatography to quantify striatal dopamine content. We assessed dopamine transporter (DAT) function using ex vivo slice imaging and in vivo fiber photometry in combination with a fluorescent dopamine sensor, dLight1.3b. We further quantified DAT expression and phosphorylation using western blot. Results: We found that chronic CORT treatment impaired reward-seeking in both sexes. In female but not male mice, CORT treatment reduced dopamine content in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). In male but not female mice, the function of the dopamine transporter (DAT) was impaired in DMS. Conclusions: Chronic elevation of CORT impairs reward-seeking by impairing dopaminergic transmission in the DMS, but via different mechanisms in male and female mice. A better understanding of these sex-specific mechanisms could lead to new directions in MDD diagnosis and treatment.

                While the time-of-day significantly impacts motor performance, its effect on motor learning has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigated the influence of the time-of-day on skill acquisition (i.e., skill improvement immediately after a training-session) and consolidation (i.e., skill retention after a time interval). Three groups were trained at 10 a.m. (G10am), 3 p.m. (G3pm), or 8 p.m. (G8pm) on a finger-tapping task. We recorded the skill (i.e. the ratio between movement duration and accuracy), before and immediately after the training to evaluate skill acquisition, and after 24 hours, to measure skill consolidation. We did not observe any difference in acquisition according to the time of the day. However, we found an improvement in performance 24 hours after the evening training (G8pm) while the morning (G10am) and the afternoon (G3pm) groups deteriorated and stabilized their performance, respectively. Furthermore, two control experiments (G8wake and G8sleep) supported the idea that a night of sleep contributes to the skill consolidation of the evening group. These results show an influence of time-of-day on the consolidation process, with better consolidation when the training is carried out in the evening. This finding may have an important impact on the planning of training programs in sports, clinical, or experimental domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Validating MEG source imaging of resting state oscillatory patterns with an intracranial EEG atlas</a></h4>

              
                Background: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a widely used non-invasive tool to estimate brain activity with high temporal resolution. However, due to the ill-posed nature of the MEG source imaging (MSI) problem, the ability of MSI to identify accurately underlying brain sources along the cortical surface is still uncertain and requires validation. Method: We validated the ability of MSI to estimate the background resting state activity of 45 healthy participants by comparing it to the intracranial EEG (IEEG) atlas (https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca/). First, we applied wavelet-based Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM) as an MSI technique. Next, we converted MEG source maps into intracranial space, by applying a forward model to the MEG reconstructed source maps and estimated virtual IEEG (VIEEG) potentials on each IEEG channel location and quantitatively compared those with actual IEEG signals from the atlas for 38 regions of interest in the canonical frequency bands. Results: The MEG spectra were more accurately estimated in the lateral regions compared to the medial regions. The regions with higher amplitude in the VIEEG than in the IEEG were more accurately recovered. In the deep regions, MEG estimated amplitudes were largely underestimated and the spectra were poorly recovered. Moreover, the MEG largely overestimated oscillatory peaks in the alpha band, especially in the anterior and deep regions. This is possibly due to higher phase synchronization of alpha oscillations over extended regions, exceeding the spatial sensitivity of IEEG but detected by MEG. Importantly, we found that MEG estimated spectra were more comparable to spectra from the IEEG atlas after the aperiodic components were removed. Conclusion: This study identifies brain regions and frequencies for which MEG source analysis is likely to be reliable, a promising step towards resolving the uncertainty in recovering intracerebral activity from non-invasive MEG studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Highly synchronized cortical circuit dynamics mediate spontaneous pain</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neural dynamics mediate information processing for the cerebral cortex, implicated in fundamental biological processes, such as vision and olfaction, in addition to neurological and psychiatric diseases. Spontaneous pain is a key feature of human neuropathic pain. Whether spontaneous pain pushes cortical network into an aberrant state, and if so, whether it can be brought back to a 'normal' operating range to ameliorate pain are unknown. Using a clinically relevant mouse model of neuropathic pain with robust spontaneous pain-like behavior, we report that orofacial spontaneous pain activated a specific area within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), displaying synchronized neural dynamics revealed by intravital two-photon calcium imaging. This synchronization was underpinned by local GABAergic interneuron hypoactivity. Pain-induced cortical synchronization could be attenuated by manipulating local S1 networks or clinically effective pain therapies. Specifically, both chemogenetic inhibition of pain-related c-Fos-expressing neurons, and selective activation of GABAergic interneurons, significantly attenuated S1 synchronization. Clinically effective pain therapies including carbamazepine and nerve root decompression could also dampen S1 synchronization. More importantly, restoring a 'normal' range of neural dynamics, through attenuating pain-induced S1 synchronization, alleviated pain-like behavior. These results suggest spontaneous pain pushes S1 regional network into a synchronized state, whereas reversal of this synchronization alleviates pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slow neural oscillations explain temporal fluctuations in distractibility</a></h4>

              
                Human environments comprise various sources of distraction, which often occur unexpectedly in time. The proneness to distraction (i.e., distractibility) is posited to be independent of attentional sampling of targets, but its temporal dynamics and neurobiological basis are largely unknown. Brain oscillations in the theta band (3--8 Hz) have been associated with fluctuating neural excitability, which is hypothesised here to explain rhythmic modulation of distractibility. In a pitch discrimination task with unexpected auditory distractors (N = 30), we show that distractor-evoked neural responses in the electroencephalogram and perceptual susceptibility to distraction were co-modulated and cycled approximately 3--5 times per second. Pre-distractor neural phase in left inferior frontal and insular cortex regions explained fluctuating distractibility. Thus, human distractibility is not constant but fluctuates on a sub-second timescale. Furthermore, slow neural oscillations subserve the behavioural consequences of a hitherto largely unexplained but ever-increasing phenomenon in modern environments -- distraction by unexpected sound.

                The dorsal telencephalon (i.e. the pallium) exhibits high anatomical diversity across vertebrate classes. The mammalian dorsal pallium accommodates a six layered-structure, the neocortex, whereas the teleostean dorsal pallium possesses various compartmentalized structures among species. The development, function and evolution of the fish dorsal pallium remain unillustrated. Here, we analyzed the structure and epigenetic landscapes of cell lineages in the telencephalon of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) which possesses a clearly delineated dorsal pallium (the Dd2 region). We found that different pallial regions, including Dd2, are formed by mutually exclusive clonal units, and that each pallium compartment exhibits a distinct epigenetic landscape. In particular, Dd2 possesses a unique open chromatin pattern that preferentially targets synapse-related genes. Indeed, Dd2 shows a high density of synapses, which might reflect strong plasticity. Finally, we identified several transcription factors as candidate regulators for the Dd2, which are partially shared with the human neocortex and hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using light and X-ray scattering to untangle complex neuronal orientations and validate diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Disentangling human brain connectivity requires an accurate description of neuronal trajectories. However, a detailed mapping of axonal orientations is challenging because axons can cross one another on a micrometer scale. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) can be used to infer neuronal connectivity because it is sensitive to axonal alignment, but it has limited resolution and specificity. Scattered Light Imaging (SLI) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveal neuronal orientations with microscopic resolution and high specificity, respectively. Here, we combine both techniques to achieve a cross-validated framework for imaging neuronal orientations, with comparison to dMRI. We evaluate brain regions that include unidirectional and crossing fiber tracts in human and vervet monkey brains. We find that SLI, SAXS, and dMRI all agree regarding major fiber pathways. SLI and SAXS further quantitatively agree regarding fiber crossings, while dMRI overestimates the amount of crossing fibers. In SLI, we find a reduction of peak distance with increasing out-of-plane fiber angles, confirming theoretical predictions, validated against both SAXS and dMRI. The combination of scattered light and X-ray imaging can provide quantitative micrometer 3D fiber orientations with high resolution and specificity, enabling detailed investigations of complex tract architecture in the animal and human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A galanin-positive population of lumbar spinal cord neurons modulates sexual behavior and arousal</a></h4>

              
                During sex, male arousal increases up to the ejaculatory threshold, allowing genital sensory input to trigger ejaculation. While copulation and arousal increase are thought to be centrally regulated, ejaculation is a reflex controlled by a spinal circuit, whose activity is strongly inhibited by descending input from the brain, bearing no role on the regulation of sexual behavior up until the arousal threshold. However, this hypothesis remains untested. To tackle this problem, we combined genetic approaches with electrophysiological and behavioral analysis to functionally map the spinal circuit controlling the main muscle involved in sperm expulsion, the bulbospongiosus muscle (BSM). We found that BSM motor neurons (BSM-MNs) receive direct synaptic input from a group of galanin-expressing (Gal+) interneurons located in the upper lumbar spinal cord. Furthermore, the Gal+ population is progressively activated during sexual behavior and receives genital sensory input. Electrical and optogenetic activation of the Gal+ neurons evoked activity in BSM-MNs and BSM after spinalization. Interestingly, these effects were dependent on the behavioral state of the male and drastically decreased with repeated stimulation. Moreover, genetic ablation of the Gal+ neurons severely impacted the latency to ejaculate and the structure of the copulatory sequence. Taken together, our results imply an unexpected involvement of the spinal cord in the control of copulatory behavior, sexual arousal and in the post-ejaculatory refractory period, in addition to its well established role in ejaculation.

                Wearable sensors are the technological breakthrough of this decade. The promise is that devices like smart watches will soon monitor many bodily states, providing data to predict illnesses and optimize performance. While many studies examine the validity of wearable signals, much less attention is paid to their reliability. Here we argue that reliable measurements are crucial for indexing physiological states in the daily life of participants. We offer a framework and several statistical tools for assessing the reliability of sensors. The framework is tested using several brands of commercially available photoplethysmography-based wrist-worn heart rate sensors. The results show that (1) different brands of wearable sensors of heart rate have different between-participant reliability, (2) reliability of heart rate and especially heart rate variability varies along with the intensity of activity participants engage in, (3) reliability of heart rate and especially heart rate variability is higher during sleep than during wakefulness. We conclude that reliability of a wearable sensor is not fixed but varies across different contexts and circumstances. Estimating reliability is thus a useful way to quantify measurement fidelity for a particular research question, a specific new experimental procedure, or a special target population.

                The N-type calcium channel, CaV2.2 is key to neurotransmission from the primary afferent terminals of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to their post-synaptic targets in the spinal cord. In this study we have utilized CaV2.2_HA knock-in mice, because the exofacial epitope tag in CaV2.2_HA enables accurate detection and localization of endogenous CaV2.2. CaV2.2_HA knock-in mice were used as a source of DRGs to exclusively study the presynaptic expression of N-type calcium channels in co-cultures between DRG neurons and wild-type spinal cord neurons. CaV2.2_HA is strongly expressed on the cell surface, particularly in TRPV1-positive small and medium DRG neurons. Super-resolution images of the presynaptic terminals revealed an increase in CaV2.2_HA expression and increased association with the post-synaptic marker Homer over time in vitro. Brief application of the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin, resulted in a significant down-regulation of cell surface CaV2.2_HA expression in DRG neuron somata. At their presynaptic terminals, capsaicin caused a reduction in CaV2.2_HA proximity to and co-localization with the active zone marker RIM 1/2, as well as a lower contribution of N-type channels to single action potential-mediated Ca2+ influx. The mechanism of this down-regulation of CaV2.2_HA involves a Rab 11a-dependent trafficking process, since dominant-negative Rab11a(S25N) occludes the effect of capsaicin on presynaptic CaV2.2_HA expression, and also prevents the effect of capsaicin on action potential induced Ca2+ influx. Taken together, these data suggest that capsaicin causes a decrease in cell surface CaV2.2_HA expression in DRG terminals via a Rab11a-dependent endosomal trafficking pathway.

                In mammals, inflammatory responses to infections trigger adaptive behavioral changes collectively known as sickness behavior. Among these, lethargy protects the sick individual by conserving energy, and increased anxiety is believed to prevent exposure to threats. However, the characterization of these conflicting behavioral states in sickness could be an artifact of behavioral assessment, particularly in rodents. We adjusted existing behavioral testing and designed a new paradigm to disambiguate between increased lethargy versus increased anxiety. Our data indicate that in mice sickness induces a significant increase in lethargy but not in anxiety. Further supporting our behavioral results, at the neuronal level we found evidence that sickness activates anxiolytic rather than anxiogenic regions of the amygdala, including oxytocin receptor expressing neurons. Putative mechanisms by which sickness could activate CeA-OTR+ neurons were investigated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Equivalent excitability through different sodium channel subtypes and implications for analgesia by subtype-selective drugs</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptive sensory neurons convey pain signals to the CNS. Nociceptor hyperexcitability amplifies those signals, causing pain hypersensitivity. Reducing nociceptor excitability should mitigate that hypersensitivity, consistent with the effects of loss-of-function mutations in voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels like NaV1.7. Yet efforts to phenocopy such mutations pharmacologically have failed in clinical trials. This failure may stem from the degenerate nature of nociceptor excitability. Here, we show that nociceptors can achieve equivalent excitability using different combinations of NaV1.3, NaV1.7, and NaV1.8. If NaV1.3 and/or NaV1.8 levels are high enough to maintain nociceptor excitability, selectively blocking NaV1.7 (e.g. with PF-05089771) becomes inconsequential. We demonstrate shifts in drug efficacy by comparing neurons tested after different numbers of days in vitro (DIV): Nociceptor excitability relies on NaV1.8 at DIV0 but that responsibility shifts to NaV1.7 and NaV1.3 on DIV4-7. A similar shift in NaV-dependence occurs in vivo, following inflammation, and impacts the ability of PF-05089771 to modulate pain sensitivity. These results demonstrate that nociceptors are surprisingly flexible in using different NaV isoforms to regulate excitability. This flexibility poses a serious problem for subtype-selective drugs whose efficacy hinges on such vagaries. Degeneracy at the cellular level must be considered when choosing drug targets at the molecular level.

                Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition causing significant decline in the quality of life of sufferers and the limited knowledge on the pathophysiology hinders successful treatment. The aim of the current study was to examine electroencephalographic (EEG) findings of OCD to broaden our understanding of the disease. Methods: Resting-state eyes-closed EEG data was recorded from 25 individuals with OCD and 27 healthy controls (HC). The 1/f arrhythmic activity was removed prior to computing oscillatory powers of all frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma). Cluster-based permutation was used for between-group statistical analyses, and comparisons were performed for the 1/f slope and intercept parameters. Functional connectivity (FC) was measured using coherence and debiased weighted phase lag index (d-wPLI), and statistically analysed using the Network Based Statistic method. Results: Compared to HC, the OCD group showed increased oscillatory power in the delta and theta bands in the fronto-temporal and parietal brain regions. However, there were no significant between-group findings in other bands or 1/f parameters. The coherence measure showed significantly reduced FC in the delta band in OCD compared to HC but the d-wPLI analysis showed no significant differences. Conclusions: OCD is associated with raised oscillatory power in slow frequency bands in the fronto-temporal brain regions, which agrees with the previous literature and therefore is a potential biomarker. Although delta coherence was found to be lower in OCD, due to inconsistencies found between measures and the previous literature, further research is required to ascertain definitive conclusions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crosstalk between AQP4-dependent ATP/Adenosine release and dopamine neurotransmission in depressive behavior during cocaine withdrawal</a></h4>

              
                The brain abundantly expresses adenosine receptors, which are involved in the regulation of neural activity, blood flow, and inflammation. In a previous study using our originally developed adenosine biosensor, we reported that hippocampal astrocytes release ATP upon water influx from the water channel AQP4, which is degraded extracellularly to increase adenosine (Yamashiro et al., 2017). On the other hand, the interaction between adenosine and dopamine is widely known, and when adenosine release from astrocytes is altered by inflammation or other factors, abnormal dopamine neurotransmission and related ataxia and psychiatric disorders may develop. In the present study, we examined pathological changes in adenosine or dopamine release in depressive-like behavior that develops as a symptom of cocaine withdrawal. The results showed that A1 receptor inhibitors and AQP4 gene disruption suppressed depressive-like behavior. In the striatum, AQP4-dependent adenosine release inhibited dopamine release via A1 receptors, and cocaine inhibited dopamine release by increasing this adenosine release. In contrast, in the medial frontal cortex, AQP4-dependently released adenosine enhanced dopamine release via A1 receptors, and cocaine abolished this adenosine effect. Furthermore, adenosine action was restored in AQP4 knockout mice, suggesting that cocaine reduced A1 receptor function via AQP4-dependent adenosine. In conclusion, astrocytes modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission through AQP4-mediated adenosine release, and this disruption leads to depression-like behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Baseline and morphine-induced rat microglial phagocytic activity is regulated by sex, brain region, and density interactions ex vivo</a></h4>

              
                Opioids have long been used for clinical pain management, but also have addictive properties that have contributed to the ongoing opioid epidemic. While opioid activation of opioid receptors is well known to contribute to reward and reinforcement, data now also suggest that opioid activation of immune signaling via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may also play a role in addiction-like processes. TLR4 expression is enriched in immune cells in peripheral organs and blood and in the nervous system is primarily expressed in microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. In peripheral immune cells, morphine is repeatedly shown to decreases immune activation and phagocytosis in vivo and in vitro. Phagocytosis is an important immune effector that serves to clear damage, debris, and infection. Unlike peripheral immune cells, the effect of morphine on microglia is less well studied. Morphine is reported to both increase and decrease microglial phagocytosis. Several different factors contribute to microglial phagocytic activity, including sex, region, and local microglial density. We hypothesized that morphine increases phagocytic activity in microglia, but in a density-, dose-, region-, and sex-dependent manner ex vivo. To test this, we isolated microglia from adult male and female rat cortex and striatum and plated them ex vivo at a relatively low or high density. Microglia were incubated with neutral fluorescent microbeads to stimulate phagocytosis in the presence of one of four morphine doses. We found that brain region of origination and plating density, but not sex, impacted microglial phagocytosis at baseline. These heterogenous properties further diverge when morphine is applied causing emergence of effects not observed at baseline, maintenance of some baseline effects, and disappearance of effects observed at baseline. Further work is necessary to identify the precise interactions and signaling that is dominant in different sex, region, and density contexts to better understand the complex effects of opioids on microglial immunoregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Broad Brain Networks Support Curiosity-Motivated Incidental Learning Of Naturalistic Dynamic Stimuli With And Without Monetary Incentives</a></h4>

              
                Curiosity - the intrinsic desire to know - is a concept central to the human mind and knowledge acquisition. Experimental studies on information-seeking have found that curiosity facilitates memory encoding and exhibits similar reward,ng properties as extrinsic rewards/incentives by eliciting a dopaminergic response. However, it is not clear whether these findings hold with more naturalistic dynamic stimuli and how the joint effect of curiosity and extrinsic incentive manifests in learning and neural activation patterns. Herein, we presented participants with videos of magic tricks across two behavioural (N1 = 77, N2 = 78) and one fMRI study (N = 50) and asked them to rate subjective feelings of curiosity, while also performing a judgement task that was incentivised for the half of participants. Incidental memory for the magic trick was tested a week later. The integrated results showed that both curiosity and availability of extrinsic incentives enhanced encoding but did not interact with each other. However, exploratory analyses showed that curiosity and monetary incentives were associated with recollection and familiarity differently, suggesting the involvement of different encoding mechanisms. Analysis of the fMRI data using the intersubject synchronisation framework showed that, while the effects of curiosity on memory were located in the hippocampus and dopaminergic brain areas, neither the effects of curiosity nor incentives themselves were found in the often-implicated reward network, but instead were associated with cortical areas involved in processing uncertainly and attention. These results suggest that curiosity recruits broader brain networks than what was implicated in the previous literature when investigated with dynamic stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual Perceptual Learning of Feature Conjunctions Leverages Non-linear Mixed Selectivity</a></h4>

              
                Visual objects are often defined by multiple features. Therefore, learning novel objects entails learning conjunctions. Visual cortex is organized into separate compartments, each of which is devoted to processing a single feature. A prime example of this is are neurons purely selective to color and orientation, respectively. However, neurons that jointly encode multiple features (mixed selectivity) also exist across the brain and play critical roles in a multitude of tasks. Here, we sought to uncover the optimal policy that our brain adapts to achieve conjunction learning using these available resources. 59 human subjects practiced orientation-color conjunction learning in four psychophysical experiments designed to nudge the visual system towards using one or the other resource. We find that conjunction learning is possible by linear mixing of pure color and orientation information, but that more and faster learning takes place when pure and mixed selectivity neurons are involved. We also find that learning with mixed selectivity confers advantages in performing an untrained 'exclusive or' (XOR) task several months after learning the original conjunction task. This study sheds light on possible mechanisms underlying conjunction learning and highlights the importance of learning by mixed selectivity in such accounts.

                The neural correlates of sentence production have been mostly studied with constraining task paradigms that introduce artificial task effects. In this study, we aimed to gain a better understanding of syntactic processing in spontaneous production vs. naturalistic comprehension. We extracted word-by-word metrics of phrase-structure building with top-down and bottom-up parsers that make different hypotheses about the timing of structure building. In comprehension, structure building proceeded in an integratory fashion and led to an increase in activity in posterior temporal and inferior frontal areas. In production, structure building was anticipatory and predicted an increase in activity in the inferior frontal gyrus. Newly developed production-specific parsers highlighted the anticipatory and incremental nature of structure building in production, which was confirmed by a converging analysis of the pausing patterns in speech. Overall, the results showed that the unfolding of syntactic processing diverges between speaking and listening.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systems-level investigation of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA identifies deficient synaptic activity as a key driver of disease progression</a></h4>

              
                Mucopolysaccharidoses are lysosomal storage diseases that collectively represent a major cause of lethal, treatment-refractory childhood dementias 1-7. Clinically-useful interventions are hampered due to an incomplete understanding of their neuropathological origins. Using the zebrafish sgsh model of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA 8 (MPS IIIA, Sanfilippo syndrome A), we conducted several 'omics-based analyses, and developed and benchmarked a novel bioinformatic feature classification and ranking model for high-throughput datasets - ExIR - to prioritise important features in the progression of neurological manifestations of the disease. We find that the massive endolysosomal burden resulting from increased lysosomal storage of heparan sulfate and other secondarily accumulating substrates, such as sphingolipids, induces abnormal microtubule organisation and vesicle trafficking in neurons. This results in a gradual impairment of synaptic vesicle localisation at the presynaptic terminal and consequently impaired neuronal activity. Importantly, the endolysosomal phenotype in MPS IIIA zebrafish well-precedes the onset of neural pathology, though the larval MPS IIIA brain was found to be more susceptible to perturbation than wild type siblings. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate the presence of a progressive 'functional neurodegenerative' phenotype underpinning neurological disease in MPS IIIA. Our findings provide direct mechanistic evidence linking the well-described lysosomal storage basis for MPS IIIA to its disproportionately severe neural clinical involvement, enabling development and refinement of future therapeutic interventions for this currently untreatable disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor imagery training is beneficial for motor memory of upper and lower limb tasks in very old adults</a></h4>

              
                Human aging is associated with a decline in the capacity to memorize recently acquired motor skills. Motor imagery training is a beneficial method to compensate for this deterioration in old adults. It is not yet known whether these beneficial effects are maintained in very old adults (>80 years), more affected by the degeneration processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mental training session of motor imagery on the memorization of new motor skills acquired through physical practice in very old adults. Thirty very old adults performed 3 actual trials of a manual dexterity task (session 1) or a sequential footstep task (session 2) as fast as they could before and after a 20-min motor imagery training (mental-training group) or watching a documentary for 20 min (control group). Performance was improved after 3 actual trials for both tasks and both groups. For the control group, performance decreased in the manual dexterity task after the 20-min break and remained stable in the sequential stepping task. For the mental-training group, performance was maintained in the manual dexterity task after the 20-min motor imagery training and increased in the sequential stepping task. These results extended the benefits of motor imagery training to the very old population, showing that even a short motor imagery training improved their performance and favor the motor memory process. These results confirmed that motor imagery training is an effective method to complement traditional rehabilitation protocols.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms of adjustments to different types of uncertainty in the reward environment across mice and monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Despite being unpredictable and uncertain, reward environments often exhibit certain regularities, and animals navigating these environments try to detect and utilize such regularities to adapt their behavior. However, successful learning requires that animals also adjust to uncertainty associated with those regularities. Here, we analyzed choice data from two comparable dynamic foraging tasks in mice and monkeys to investigate mechanisms underlying adjustments to different types of uncertainty. In these tasks, animals selected between two choice options that delivered reward probabilistically, while baseline reward probabilities changed after a variable number (block) of trials without any cues to the animals. To measure adjustments in behavior, we applied a set of metrics based on information theory that quantify consistency in behavior, and fit choice data using reinforcement learning models. We found that in both species, learning and choice were affected by uncertainty about reward outcomes (in terms of determining the better option) and by expectation about when the environment may change. However, these effects were mediated through different mechanisms. First, more uncertainty about the better option resulted in slower learning and forgetting in mice, whereas it had no significant effect in monkeys. Second, expectation of block switches accompanied slower learning, faster forgetting, and increased stochasticity in choice in mice, whereas it only reduced learning rates in monkeys. Overall, while demonstrating the usefulness of entropy-based metrics in studying adaptive behavior, our study provides evidence for multiple types of adjustments in learning and choice behavior according to uncertainty in the reward environment.

                Tauopathies such as Alzheimer Disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are characterized by formation of neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Early pathophysiological and functional changes related to neurofibrillary tangles formation are considered to occur prior to extensive neurodegeneration. Hyperphosphorylated tau has been detected in postmortem retinas of AD and FTD patients, and the visual pathway is an easily accessible system in a clinical setting. Hence, assessment of the visual function may offer the potential to detect consequences of early tau pathology in patients. In this study we explored the association between the visual system and functional consequences of tau pathology progression using a tauopathy rTg4510 mouse model. To this end, we recorded full-field electroretinography and visual evoked potentials in anesthetized and awake states at different ages. While retinal function remained mostly intact within all the age groups investigated, we detected significant changes in amplitudes of visual evoked potential responses in young rTg4510 mice exhibiting early tau pathology prior to neurodegeneration. These functional alterations in the visual cortex were positively correlated with pathological tau levels. Our findings suggest that visual processing could be useful as a novel electrophysiological biomarker for early stages of tauopathy.

                Background: Characterization of inter-regional interactions in brain is essential for understanding the mechanism relevant to normal brain function and neurological disease. The recently developed flexible micro ()-electrocorticography (ECoG) device is one prominent method used to examine large-scale cortical activity across multiple regions. The sheet-shaped ECoG electrodes arrays can be placed on a relatively wide area of cortical surface beneath the skull by inserting the device into the space between skull and brain. Although rats and mice are useful tools for neuroscience, current ECoG recording methods in these animals are limited to the parietal region of cerebral cortex. Recording cortical activity from the temporal region of cortex in mice has proven difficult because of surgical barriers created by the skull and surrounding temporalis muscle anatomy. New method: Hear, we developed a sheet-shaped 64-channel ECoG device that allows access to the mouse temporal cortex, and we determined the factor determining the appropriate bending stiffness for the ECoG electrode array. We also established a surgical technique to implant the electrode arrays into the epidural space over a wide area of cerebral cortex covering from the barrel field to olfactory (piriform) cortex, which is the deepest region of the cerebral cortex. Results: Using histology and computed tomography (CT) images, we confirmed that the tip of the ECoG device reached to the most ventral part of cerebral cortex without causing noticeable damage to the brain surface. The device simultaneously recorded somatosensory and odor stimulus-evoked neural activity from dorsal and ventral parts of cerebral cortex in awake and anesthetized mice. Conclusions: These data indicates that our ECoG device and surgical techniques enable to record large-scale cortical activity from the parietal to temporal cortex in mice, including somatosensory and olfactory cortices. This system will provide opportunities to investigate physiological functions from wider areas of the mouse cerebral cortex than those of existing ECoG techniques.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolutionary and biomedical implications of sex differences in the primate brain transcriptome</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit sex differences in the prevalence of many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. To better understand the translatability of a critical nonhuman primate model, the rhesus macaque, we generated one of the largest multi-brain region bulk transcriptional datasets for this species and characterized sex-biased gene expression patterns. We demonstrate that these patterns are similar to those in humans and are associated with overlapping regulatory mechanisms, biological processes, and genes implicated in sex-biased human disorders, including autism. We also show that sex-biased genes exhibit greater genetic variance for expression and more tissue-specific expression patterns, which may facilitate the rapid evolution of sex-biased genes. Our findings provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying sex-biased disease and validate the rhesus macaque model for the study of these conditions.

	<p>Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) frequently results in sleep-wake disturbances. However, limited studies have investigated the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying these sleep disturbances, and potentially efficacious therapies are lacking. We investigated the levels of melatonin and genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway in the pineal glands of Sprague Dawley rats exposed to single and tightly coupled repeated blasts during the night and daytime. Rats were exposed to single and tightly coupled repeated blasts using an advanced blast simulator. The plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and pineal gland were collected at 6 h, 24 h, or 1 month postblast at two different time points: one during the day (1000 h) and one at night (2200 h). Differential expressions of genes involved in pineal melatonin synthesis were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Plasma and CSF melatonin levels were assessed using a commercial melatonin ELISA kit. The plasma and CSF melatonin levels showed statistically significant decreases at 6 h and 24 h in the blast-exposed rats euthanized in the night (in dim light), with no significant alterations noted in rats euthanized in the morning (daylight) at all three-time points. Blast-exposed rats showed statistically significant decreases in Tph1, Aanat, Asmt, and Mtnr1b mRNA levels, along with increased Tph2 mRNA, in the pineal gland samples collected at night at 6 h and 24 h. No significant changes in the mRNA levels of these genes were noted at 1 month. These findings imply that the melatonin circadian rhythm is disrupted following blast exposure, which may be a factor in the sleep disturbances that blast victims frequently experience.</p>

	<p>In recent years, technological advances and the introduction of social streaming platforms (e.g., Twitch) have contributed to an increase in the popularity of esports, a highly profitable industry with millions of active users. In this context, there is little evidence, if any, on how users perceive in-game advertising (IGA) and other key elements of the game viewing experience (e.g., facecam and chat) in terms of visual attention. The present eye-tracking study aimed at investigating those aspects, and introducing an eye-tracking research protocol specifically designed to accurately measure the visual attention associated with key elements of the game viewing experience. Results showed that (1) the ads available in the game view (IGAs) are capable altogether to attract 3.49% of the users&amp;amp;rsquo; visual attention; (2) the chat section draws 10.68% of the users&amp;amp;rsquo; visual attention and more than the streamer&amp;amp;rsquo;s face, known as a powerful attentional driver; (3) the animated ad format elicits higher visual attention (1.46%) than the static format (1.12%); and (4) in some circumstances, the visual attention elicited by the ads is higher in the &amp;amp;ldquo;Goal&amp;amp;rdquo; scenes (0.69%) in comparison to &amp;amp;ldquo;No-Goal&amp;amp;rdquo; scenes (0.51%). Relevant managerial implications and future directions for the esports industry are reported and discussed.</p>

	<p>Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a challenging entity with complicated symptoms for treatment in the male crowd. Accumulating evidence revealed the dysfunction in the central system should be a critical factor for the pathogenesis and development in the CP/CPPS. Therefore, we recruited 20 patients of CP/CPPS and 20 healthy male volunteers, aged 20 to 50 years. Through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF) and the mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mfALFF) to reflect the spontaneous abnormal activated regions in the brains of CP/CPPS patients. Compared to the healthy controls, the group with CP/CPPS had significantly increased mALFF values in the thalamus and augmented fALFF values in the inferior parietal lobule and cingulate gyrus. Significant positive correlations were observed in the extracted mALFF values in the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and the pain intensity (r = 0.2712, p = 0.0019), mALFF values in the thalamus and the scores of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety subscale (r = 0.08477, p = 0.0461), and mfALFF values in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and the scores of the HADS anxiety subscale (r = 0.07102, p = 0.0282). Therefore, we delineated the clinical alterations in patients of CP/CPPS that might be attributed to the functional abnormality of the thalamus, inferior parietal lobule, and cingulate gyrus. Among these regions, the PAG, thalamus, and SFG may further play an important role in the pathogenesis, with their regulating effect on pain or emotion.</p>

	<p>Background: Apathy is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). The influencing factors of apathy are currently controversial. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of PD-associated apathy and to analyze the associated risk factors. Methods: Two hundred patients diagnosed with PD were selected. Included patients were divided into an apathetic group and a non-apathetic group. Demographic and clinical data, motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms and medication use of the two groups were assessed. Results: The incidence of apathy was 69%. Demographic and clinical data, motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms and medications use were statistically significant. Conclusions: PD patients with more severe motor symptoms, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, RBD, excessive daytime sleep, fatigue, low education level, long disease course, poor quality of life and lower DA dosage are more prone to apathy. Cognitive function, quality of life, educational level, DA and LEDD are independent risk factors for apathy.</p>

	<p>Background: It has been hypothesized that, whenever estrogen levels decline, psychosis symptoms in women increase. At menopause, this can happen in two main ways: (a) the loss of estrogen (mainly estradiol) can directly affect central neurotransmission, leading to increase in schizophrenia-related symptoms, and (b) the loss of estrogen can decrease the synthesis of enzymes that metabolize antipsychotic drugs, thus weakening their efficacy. Aims&amp;amp;nbsp;and Methods: The aim of this narrative review was to investigate the second possibility by searching PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies over the last two decades that investigated the metabolism of antipsychotics and their efficacy before and after menopause in women or that studied systemic and local estrogen level effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of individual antipsychotic drugs. Results: The evidence suggests that symptom level in women with schizophrenia rises after menopause for many reasons beyond hormones but, importantly, there is an estrogen-dependent loss of efficacy related to antipsychotic treatment. Conclusion: Effective clinical intervention is challenging; nevertheless, several promising routes forward are suggested.</p>

	<p>Background: This study aims to explore the mediating role of loneliness between depressive symptoms and cognitive frailty among older adults in the community. Methods: A total of 527 community-dwelling older adults aged &amp;amp;ge;60 years were included in this cross-sectional study. A five-item geriatric depression scale was used to assess depression symptoms. Then, an eight-item University of California at Los Angeles Loneliness Scale was used to assess loneliness. Moreover, the FRAIL scale and Mini-Mental State Examination were used to assess cognitive frailty. Furthermore, regression and bootstrap analyses were used to explore the mediating role of loneliness in depression symptoms and cognitive frailty. Results: Loneliness mediates the association between depression symptoms and cognitive frailty (95% CI = 0.164~0.615), and after adjusting for loneliness, the direct effect is no longer significant (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;0.113~1.318, p = 0.099). Conclusions: Results show that the effect of cognitive frailty is not depression symptoms but loneliness. All levels of society (the government, medical institutions, and communities) need to pay more attention to the mental health of the older adults, screen for loneliness, and take timely intervention and treatment measures. They should also build an age-friendly society and promote active aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Active Vision in Sight Recovery Individuals with a History of Long-Lasting Congenital Blindness</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>What we see is intimately linked to how we actively and systematically explore the world through eye movements. However, it is unknown to what degree visual experience during early development is necessary for such systematic visual exploration to emerge. The present study investigated visual exploration behavior in 10 human participants whose sight had been restored only in childhood or adulthood, after a period of congenital blindness because of dense bilateral congenital cataracts. Participants freely explored real-world images while their eye movements were recorded. Despite severe residual visual impairments and gaze instability (nystagmus), visual exploration patterns were preserved in individuals with reversed congenital cataract. Modeling analyses indicated that, similar to healthy control subjects, visual exploration in individuals with reversed congenital cataract was based on the low-level (luminance contrast) and high-level (object components) visual content of the images. Moreover, participants used visual short-term memory representations for narrowing down the exploration space. More systematic visual exploration in individuals with reversed congenital cataract was associated with better object recognition, suggesting that active vision might be a driving force for visual system development and recovery. The present results argue against a sensitive period for the development of neural mechanisms associated with visual exploration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">How Do Spike Collisions Affect Spike Sorting Performance?</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recently, a new generation of devices have been developed to record neural activity simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes with a very high spatial density, both for <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> applications. While these advances enable to record from many more cells, they also challenge the already complicated process of spike sorting (i.e., extracting isolated single-neuron activity from extracellular signals). In this work, we used synthetic ground-truth recordings with controlled levels of correlations among neurons to quantitatively benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art spike sorters focusing specifically on spike collisions. Our results show that while modern template-matching-based algorithms are more accurate than density-based approaches, all methods, to some extent, failed to detect synchronous spike events of neurons with similar extracellular signals. Interestingly, the performance of the sorters is not largely affected by the spiking activity in the recordings, with respect to average firing rates and spike-train correlation levels. Since the performances of all modern spike sorting algorithms can be affected as function of the activity of the recorded neurons, scientific claims on correlations and synchrony should be carefully assessed based on the analysis provided in this paper.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sound-Evoked Responses of Distinct Neuron Classes from the Tail of the Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Given its inputs from auditory structures and neuromodulatory systems, the posterior tail of the striatum is ideally positioned to influence behavioral responses to acoustic stimuli according to context and previous rewards. Results from previous studies indicate that neurons in this striatal region display selective responses to sounds. However, it is not clear whether different striatal cell classes code for distinct features of sounds or how different striatal output pathways may use acoustic information to guide behavior. Here we compared the sound-evoked responses of posterior striatal neurons that form the striatal direct pathway (and express the dopamine receptor D<SUB>1</SUB>) to the responses of neighboring neurons in naive mice. We achieved this via optogenetic photo-identification of D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons during extracellular electrophysiological recordings in awake head-fixed mice of both sexes. We found that the frequency tuning of sound-responsive direct-pathway striatal neurons is comparable with that of their sound-responsive neighbors. Moreover, we found that both populations encode amplitude-modulated sounds in a similar fashion. These results suggest that different classes of neurons in the posterior striatum of naive animals have similar access to acoustic features conveyed by the auditory system even outside the context of an auditory task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Case report: Non-invasive mechanical ventilation in combination with bronchoscopy in the treatment of respiratory failure of lung cancer patient. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Respiratory failure (RF) is a common medical problem among cancer patients. Particularly active or ex-smokers diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer may develop severe hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Moreover, pneumonitis as a complication of the currently widely used immunotherapy of various cancers, may cause respiratory disorders requiring ventilation support. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is recommended as the first-line treatment for this type of respiratory failure and reduces the need for endotracheal intubation. Case presentation: We present a case report of lung cancer patient, who received NIV in the treatment of RF due to an infectious exacerbation of COPD. In addition, NIV enabled assisted flexible bronchoscopy (NIV-FB) to be performed. During the procedure tumor samples were collected for further molecular diagnosis of lung cancer. Improvement of the patient general condition and quality of life was also achieved. Conclusions: NIV can be used at any stage of oncological management in patients with lung cancer. It can also be implemented during endoscopic procedures of the respiratory system, as well as support in palliative care of patients with lung cancer at the end of life. Further studies should evaluate the use of NIV in conjunction with various oncological treatments and identify the exact contradictions for BF with NIV support in advanced cancer patients with RF.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Addressing the construct validity of the “individual problems and strengths” scale [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) systems have been used to monitor how a client’s life changes over the course of therapy. However, if a ROM system is to be used, the system should have sufficient construct validity to warrant its usage. In the current study we sought to test the construct of the “individual problems and strengths” (IPS) measurement scale, a sub-section of the “Systemic Therapy Inventory of Change” (STIC). Methods: We used a factorial construct validation procedure utilizing a stepwise confirmatory factor analysis approach on a sample of 841 clients of couple and family therapy. Results: We found support for the original “8-factor” version of the IPS but failed to find support for the “1-factor” version and the “higher order factor structure”. Conclusions: The investigation uncovered that the measurement tool is still under development and since the factorial construct (and the scale-reliability) was only supported for the original "8-factor" model, we encourage a pause in administering the IPS in clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Long-term health after Severe Acute Malnutrition in children and adults- the role of the Pancreas (SAMPA): Protocol [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal growth retardation may increase the risk of later chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes; however, long-term effects of wasting malnutrition in childhood or adulthood are less studied. Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions, both critical for nutrition and NCD aetiology, may not fully recover following malnutrition. However, the evidence and mechanistic information is piecemeal. We hypothesise that wasting malnutrition at any age has long-term detrimental effects on endocrine and exocrine pancreatic structure and function. Methods: The SAMPA international research programme will assess pancreatic structure and function in 3700 participants from ongoing observational nutrition cohorts, two adolescent and four adult, in Zambia, Tanzania, Philippines, and India. Pancreas size, structure, and calcification will be assessed by ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan; exocrine function by faecal elastase and serum lipase; and endocrine function by haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In-depth hormonal analyses of incretins, glucagon, proinsulin and trypsinogen during OGTT and intravenous glucose tolerance tests will be done in subsets of adult participants. Pancreatic size and function outcomes will be compared between people with and without prior wasting malnutrition. Analyses will investigate effect modification by sex, current age, time since malnutrition, current body mass index and dietary patterns. Mathematical modelling of OGTT data will be used to estimate the relative contribution to glucose dysregulation of decreased insulin production, changes in insulin clearance and increased insulin resistance. Proinsulin/insulin ratio will be analysed in archived samples from the Tanzanian cohort using a nested case-control design to investigate whether abnormal values precede diabetes. Conclusions: SAMPA, a large-scale multi-centre research programme using data from people with or without prior wasting malnutrition to assess several aspects of pancreatic phenotype, will provide coherent evidence for future policies and programmes for malnutrition and diabetes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The value of confidence: Confidence prediction errors drive value-based learning in the absence of external feedback</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lena Esther Ptasczynski, Isa Steinecker, Philipp Sterzer, Matthias Guggenmos</p>

Reinforcement learning algorithms have a long-standing success story in explaining the dynamics of instrumental conditioning in humans and other species. While normative reinforcement learning models are critically dependent on external feedback, recent findings in the field of perceptual learning point to a crucial role of internally-generated reinforcement signals based on subjective confidence, when external feedback is not available. Here, we investigated the existence of such confidence-based learning signals in a key domain of reinforcement-based learning: instrumental conditioning. We conducted a value-based decision making experiment which included phases with and without external feedback and in which participants reported their confidence in addition to choices. Behaviorally, we found signatures of self-reinforcement in phases without feedback, reflected in an increase of subjective confidence and choice consistency. To clarify the mechanistic role of confidence in value-based learning, we compared a family of confidence-based learning models with more standard models predicting either no change in value estimates or a devaluation over time when no external reward is provided. We found that confidence-based models indeed outperformed these reference models, whereby the learning signal of the winning model was based on the prediction error between current confidence and a stimulus-unspecific average of previous confidence levels. Interestingly, individuals with more volatile reward-based value updates in the presence of feedback also showed more volatile confidence-based value updates when feedback was not available. Together, our results provide evidence that confidence-based learning signals affect instrumentally learned subjective values in the absence of external feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">mPPases create a conserved anionic membrane fingerprint as identified via multi-scale simulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexandra O. M. Holmes, Adrian Goldman, Antreas C. Kalli</p>

Membrane-integral pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are membrane-bound enzymes responsible for hydrolysing inorganic pyrophosphate and translocating a cation across the membrane. Their function is essential for the infectivity of clinically relevant protozoan parasites and plant maturation. Recent developments have indicated that their mechanism is more complicated than previously thought and that the membrane environment may be important for their function. In this work, we use multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate for the first time that mPPases form specific anionic lipid interactions at 4 sites at the distal and interfacial regions of the protein. These interactions are conserved in simulations of the mPPases from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i>, <i>Vigna radiata</i> and <i>Clostridium leptum</i> and characterised by interactions with positive residues on helices 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the distal site, or 9, 10, 13 and 14 for the interfacial site. Due to the importance of these helices in protein stability and function, these lipid interactions may play a crucial role in the mPPase mechanism and enable future structural and functional studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast and interpretable consensus clustering via minipatch learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luqin Gan, Genevera I. Allen</p>

Consensus clustering has been widely used in bioinformatics and other applications to improve the accuracy, stability and reliability of clustering results. This approach ensembles cluster co-occurrences from multiple clustering runs on subsampled observations. For application to large-scale bioinformatics data, such as to discover cell types from single-cell sequencing data, for example, consensus clustering has two significant drawbacks: (i) computational inefficiency due to repeatedly applying clustering algorithms, and (ii) lack of interpretability into the important features for differentiating clusters. In this paper, we address these two challenges by developing IMPACC: Interpretable MiniPatch Adaptive Consensus Clustering. Our approach adopts three major innovations. We ensemble cluster co-occurrences from tiny subsets of both observations and features, termed minipatches, thus dramatically reducing computation time. Additionally, we develop adaptive sampling schemes for observations, which result in both improved reliability and computational savings, as well as adaptive sampling schemes of features, which lead to interpretable solutions by quickly learning the most relevant features that differentiate clusters. We study our approach on synthetic data and a variety of real large-scale bioinformatics data sets; results show that our approach not only yields more accurate and interpretable cluster solutions, but it also substantially improves computational efficiency compared to standard consensus clustering approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Variant calling enhances the identification of cancer cells in single-cell RNA sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William Gasper, Francesca Rossi, Matteo Ligorio, Dario Ghersi</p>

Single-cell RNA-sequencing is an invaluable research tool that allows for the investigation of gene expression in heterogeneous cancer cell populations in ways that bulk RNA-seq cannot. However, normal (i.e., non tumor) cells in cancer samples have the potential to confound the downstream analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Existing methods for identifying cancer and normal cells include copy number variation inference, marker-gene expression analysis, and expression-based clustering. This work aims to extend the existing approaches for identifying cancer cells in single-cell RNA-seq samples by incorporating variant calling and the identification of putative driver alterations. We found that putative driver alterations can be detected in single-cell RNA-seq data obtained with full-length transcript technologies and noticed that a subset of cells in tumor samples are enriched for putative driver alterations as compared to normal cells. Furthermore, we show that the number of putative driver alterations and inferred copy number variation are not correlated in all samples. Taken together, our findings suggest that augmenting existing cancer-cell filtering methods with variant calling and analysis can increase the number of tumor cells that can be confidently included in downstream analyses of single-cell full-length transcript RNA-seq datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-scale excitability in networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniele Avitabile, Mathieu Desroches, G. Bard Ermentrout</p>

From the action potentials of neurons and cardiac cells to the amplification of calcium signals in oocytes, excitability is a hallmark of many biological signalling processes. In recent years, excitability in single cells has been related to multiple-timescale dynamics through <i>canards</i>, special solutions which determine the effective thresholds of the all-or-none responses. However, the emergence of excitability in large populations remains an open problem. Here, we show that the mechanism of excitability in large networks and mean-field descriptions of coupled quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) cells mirrors that of the individual components. We initially exploit the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to derive low-dimensional dynamics for the coupled network and use it to describe the structure of canards via slow periodic forcing. We demonstrate that the thresholds for onset and offset of population firing can be found in the same way as those of the single cell. We combine theoretical analysis and numerical computations to develop a novel and comprehensive framework for excitability in large populations, applicable not only to models amenable to Ott-Antonsen reduction, but also to networks without a closed-form mean-field limit, in particular sparse networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Density-dependent effects are the main determinants of variation in growth dynamics between closely related bacterial strains</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sabrin Hilau, Sophia Katz, Tanya Wasserman, Ruth Hershberg, Yonatan Savir</p>

Although closely related, bacterial strains from the same species show significant diversity in their growth and death dynamics. Yet, our understanding of the relationship between the kinetic parameters that dictate these dynamics is still lacking. Here, we measured the growth and death dynamics of 11 strains of <i>Escherichia coli</i> originating from different hosts and show that the growth patterns are clustered into three major classes with typical growth rates, maximal fold change, and death rates. To infer the underlying phenotypic parameters that govern the dynamics, we developed a phenomenological mathematical model that accounts not only for growth rate and its dependence on resource availability, but also for death rates and density-dependent growth inhibition. We show that density-dependent growth is essential for capturing the variability in growth dynamics between the strains. Indeed, the main parameter determining the dynamics is the typical density at which they slow down their growth, rather than the maximal growth rate or death rate. Moreover, we show that the phenotypic landscape resides within a two-dimensional plane spanned by resource utilization efficiency, death rate, and density-dependent growth inhibition. In this phenotypic plane, we identify three clusters that correspond to the growth pattern classes. Overall, our results reveal the tradeoffs between growth parameters that constrain bacterial adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modulation of working memory duration by synaptic and astrocytic mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sophia Becker, Andreas Nold, Tatjana Tchumatchenko</p>

Short-term synaptic plasticity and modulations of the presynaptic vesicle release rate are key components of many working memory models. At the same time, an increasing number of studies suggests a potential role of astrocytes in modulating higher cognitive function such as WM through their influence on synaptic transmission. Which influence astrocytic signaling could have on the stability and duration of WM representations, however, is still unclear. Here, we introduce a slow, activity-dependent astrocytic regulation of the presynaptic release probability in a synaptic attractor model of WM. We compare and analyze simulations of a simple WM protocol in firing rate and spiking networks with and without astrocytic regulation, and underpin our observations with analyses of the phase space dynamics in the rate network. We find that the duration and stability of working memory representations are altered by astrocytic signaling and by noise. We show that astrocytic signaling modulates the mean duration of WM representations. Moreover, if the astrocytic regulation is strong, a slow presynaptic timescale introduces a ‘window of vulnerability’, during which WM representations are easily disruptable by noise before being stabilized. We identify two mechanisms through which noise from different sources in the network can either stabilize or destabilize WM representations. Our findings suggest that (i) astrocytic regulation can act as a crucial determinant for the duration of WM representations in synaptic attractor models of WM, and (ii) that astrocytic signaling could facilitate different mechanisms for volitional top-down control of WM representations and their duration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Magnitude-sensitive reaction times reveal non-linear time costs in multi-alternative decision-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James A. R. Marshall, Andreagiovanni Reina, Célia Hay, Audrey Dussutour, Angelo Pirrone</p>

Optimality analysis of value-based decisions in binary and multi-alternative choice settings predicts that reaction times should be sensitive only to differences in stimulus magnitudes, but not to overall absolute stimulus magnitude. Yet experimental work in the binary case has shown magnitude sensitive reaction times, and theory shows that this can be explained by switching from linear to multiplicative time costs, but also by nonlinear subjective utility. Thus disentangling explanations for observed magnitude sensitive reaction times is difficult. Here for the first time we extend the theoretical analysis of geometric time-discounting to ternary choices, and present novel experimental evidence for magnitude-sensitivity in such decisions, in both humans and slime moulds. We consider the optimal policies for all possible combinations of linear and geometric time costs, and linear and nonlinear utility; interestingly, geometric discounting emerges as the predominant explanation for magnitude sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">HAL-X: Scalable hierarchical clustering for rapid and tunable single-cell analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James Anibal, Alexandre G. Day, Erol Bahadiroglu, Liam O’Neil, Long Phan, Alec Peltekian, Amir Erez, Mariana Kaplan, Grégoire Altan-Bonnet, Pankaj Mehta</p>

Data clustering plays a significant role in biomedical sciences, particularly in single-cell data analysis. Researchers use clustering algorithms to group individual cells into populations that can be evaluated across different levels of disease progression, drug response, and other clinical statuses. In many cases, multiple sets of clusters must be generated to assess varying levels of cluster specificity. For example, there are many subtypes of leukocytes (e.g. T cells), whose individual preponderance and phenotype must be assessed for statistical/functional significance. In this report, we introduce a novel hierarchical density clustering algorithm (HAL-x) that uses supervised linkage methods to build a cluster hierarchy on raw single-cell data. With this new approach, HAL-x can quickly predict multiple sets of labels for immense datasets, achieving a considerable improvement in computational efficiency on large datasets compared to existing methods. We also show that cell clusters generated by HAL-x yield near-perfect F1-scores when classifying different clinical statuses based on single-cell profiles. Our hierarchical density clustering algorithm achieves high accuracy in single cell classification in a scalable, tunable and rapid manner.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A fibrin enhanced thrombosis model for medical devices operating at low shear regimes or large surface areas</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rodrigo Méndez Rojano, Angela Lai, Mansur Zhussupbekov, Greg W. Burgreen, Keith Cook, James F. Antaki</p>

Over the past decade, much of the development of computational models of device-related thrombosis has focused on platelet activity. While those models have been successful in predicting thrombus formation in medical devices operating at high shear rates (> 5000 s<sup>−1</sup>), they cannot be directly applied to low-shear devices, such as blood oxygenators and catheters, where emerging information suggest that fibrin formation is the predominant mechanism of clotting and platelet activity plays a secondary role. In the current work, we augment an existing platelet-based model of thrombosis with a partial model of the coagulation cascade that includes contact activation of factor XII and fibrin production. To calibrate the model, we simulate a backward-facing-step flow channel that has been extensively characterized in-vitro. Next, we perform blood perfusion experiments through a microfluidic chamber mimicking a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator and validate the model against these observations. The simulation results closely match the time evolution of the thrombus height and length in the backward-facing-step experiment. Application of the model to the microfluidic hollow fiber bundle chamber capture both gross features such as the increasing clotting trend towards the outlet of the chamber, as well as finer local features such as the structure of fibrin around individual hollow fibers. Our results are in line with recent findings that suggest fibrin production, through contact activation of factor XII, drives the thrombus formation in medical devices operating at low shear rates with large surface area to volume ratios.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatial models of pattern formation during phagocytosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John Cody Herron, Shiqiong Hu, Bei Liu, Takashi Watanabe, Klaus M. Hahn, Timothy C. Elston</p>

Phagocytosis, the biological process in which cells ingest large particles such as bacteria, is a key component of the innate immune response. Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-mediated phagocytosis is initiated when these receptors are activated after binding immunoglobulin G (IgG). Receptor activation initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the formation of the phagocytic cup and culminates with ingestion of the foreign particle. In the experimental system termed “frustrated phagocytosis”, cells attempt to internalize micropatterned disks of IgG. Cells that engage in frustrated phagocytosis form “rosettes” of actin-enriched structures called podosomes around the IgG disk. The mechanism that generates the rosette pattern is unknown. We present data that supports the involvement of Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, in pattern formation. Cdc42 acts downstream of receptor activation, upstream of actin polymerization, and is known to play a role in polarity establishment. Reaction-diffusion models for GTPase spatiotemporal dynamics exist. We demonstrate how the addition of negative feedback and minor changes to these models can generate the experimentally observed rosette pattern of podosomes. We show that this pattern formation can occur through two general mechanisms. In the first mechanism, an intermediate species forms a ring of high activity around the IgG disk, which then promotes rosette organization. The second mechanism does not require initial ring formation but relies on spatial gradients of intermediate chemical species that are selectively activated over the IgG patch. Finally, we analyze the models to suggest experiments to test their validity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Heliorhodopsin binds and regulates glutamine synthetase activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shin-Gyu Cho, Myungchul Song, Kimleng Chuon, Jin-gon Shim, Seanghun Meas, Kwang-Hwan Jung</p>

Photoreceptors are light-sensitive proteins found in various organisms that respond to light and relay signals into the cells. Heliorhodopsin, a retinal-binding membrane protein, has been recently discovered, however its function remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the relationship between <i>Actinobacteria bacterium</i> IMCC26103 heliorhodopsin (AbHeR) and an adjacent glutamine synthetase (AbGS) in the same operon. We demonstrate that AbHeR binds to AbGS and regulates AbGS activity. More specifically, the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) value of the binding between AbHeR and AbGS is 6.06 μM. Moreover, the absence of positively charged residues within the intracellular loop of AbHeR impacted K<sub>d</sub> value as they serve as critical binding sites for AbGS. We also confirm that AbHeR up-regulates the biosynthetic enzyme activity of AbGS both in vitro and in vivo in the presence of light. GS is a key enzyme involved in nitrogen assimilation that catalyzes the conversion of glutamate and ammonia to glutamine. Hence, the interaction between AbHeR and AbGS may be critical for nitrogen assimilation in <i>Actinobacteria bacterium</i> IMCC26103 as it survives in low-nutrient environments. Overall, the findings of our study describe, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a novel function of heliorhodopsin as a regulatory rhodopsin with the capacity to bind and regulate enzyme activity required for nitrogen assimilation.

                Direkli Cave, located in the Taurus Mountains of southern Turkey, was occupied by Late Epipaleolithic hunters-gatherers for the seasonal hunting and processing of game including large numbers of wild goats. We report genomic data from new and published <i>Capra</i> specimens from Direkli Cave and, supplemented with historic genomes from multiple <i>Capra</i> species, find a novel lineage best represented by a ~14,000 year old 2.59 X genome sequenced from specimen Direkli4. This newly discovered <i>Capra</i> lineage is a sister clade to the Caucasian tur species (<i>Capra cylindricornis</i> and <i>Capra caucasica</i>), both now limited to the Caucasus region. We identify genomic regions introgressed in domestic goats with high affinity to Direkli4, and find that West Eurasian domestic goats in the past, but not those today, appear enriched for Direkli4-specific alleles at a genome-wide level. This forgotten ‘Taurasian tur’ likely survived Late Pleistocene climatic change in a Taurus Mountain refuge and its genomic fate is unknown.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular mechanism of active Cas7-11 in processing CRISPR RNA and interfering target RNA</a></h4>

              
                Cas7-11 is a Type III-E CRISPR Cas effector that confers programmable RNA cleavage and has potential applications in RNA interference. Cas7-11 encodes a single polypeptide containing four Cas7- and one Cas11-like segments that obscures the distinction between the multi-subunit Class 1 and the single-subunit Class-2 CRISPR-Cas systems. We report a cryo-EM structure of the active Cas7-11 from <i>Desulfonema ishimotonii</i> (DiCas7-11) that reveals the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form that resembles the backbone made up by four Cas7 and one Cas11 subunits in the multi-subunit enzymes. Unlike the multi-subunit enzymes, however, the backbone of DiCas7-11 contains evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains, giving rise to their unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides in processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA, and its free-standing fragment retains most of the activity. Both the second and the third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The structure and mutational data indicate that the long variable insertion to the fourth Cas7 domain has little impact to RNA processing or targeting, suggesting the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RNA-binding protein Elavl1/HuR is required for maintenance of cranial neural crest specification</a></h4>

              
                While neural crest development is known to be transcriptionally controlled via sequential activation of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), recent evidence increasingly implicates a role for post-transcriptional regulation in modulating the output of these regulatory circuits. Using available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from avian embryos to identify potential post-transcriptional regulators, we found that <i>Elavl1</i>, which encodes for an RNA-binding protein with roles in transcript stability, was enriched in the premigratory cranial neural crest. Perturbation of Elavl1 resulted in premature neural crest delamination from the neural tube as well as significant reduction in transcripts associated with the neural crest specification GRN, phenotypes that are also observed with downregulation of the canonical Wnt inhibitor <i>Draxin</i>. That <i>Draxin</i> is the primary target for stabilization by Elavl1 during cranial neural crest specification was shown by RNA-sequencing, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA decay measurement, and proximity ligation assays, further supporting the idea that the downregulation of neural crest specifier expression upon Elavl1 knockdown was largely due to loss of <i>Draxin</i>. Importantly, exogenous <i>Draxin</i> rescued cranial neural crest specification defects observed with Elavl1 knockdown. Thus, Elavl1 plays a critical a role in the maintenance of cranial neural crest specification via <i>Draxin</i> mRNA stabilization. Together, these data highlight an important intersection of post-transcriptional regulation with modulation of the neural crest specification GRN.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The transcription factor Bach2 negatively regulates murine natural killer cell maturation and function</a></h4>

              
                BTB domain And CNC Homolog 2 (Bach2) is a transcription repressor that actively participates in T and B lymphocyte development, but it is unknown if Bach2 is also involved in the development of innate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we followed the expression of Bach2 during murine NK cell development, finding that it peaked in immature CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and decreased upon further maturation. Bach2 showed an organ and tissue-specific expression pattern in NK cells. Bach2 expression positively correlated with the expression of transcription factor TCF1 and negatively correlated with genes encoding NK effector molecules and those involved in the cell cycle. Lack of Bach2 expression caused changes in chromatin accessibility of corresponding genes. In the end, Bach2-deficiency resulted in increased proportions of terminally differentiated NK cells with increased production of granzymes and cytokines. NK cell-mediated control of tumor metastasis was also augmented in the absence of Bach2. Therefore, Bach2 is a key checkpoint protein regulating NK terminal maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">S6K1 phosphorylates Cdk1 and MSH6 to regulate DNA repair</a></h4>

              
                The mTORC1 substrate, S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1), is involved in the regulation of cell growth, ribosome biogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and adipogenesis. Accumulating evidence has suggested a role for mTORC1 signaling in the DNA damage response. This is mostly based on the findings that mTORC1 inhibitors sensitized cells to DNA damage. However, a direct role of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in DNA repair and the mechanism by which this signaling pathway regulates DNA repair is unknown. In this study, we discovered a novel role for S6K1 in regulating DNA repair through the coordinated regulation of the cell cycle, homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair (HRR) and mismatch DNA repair (MMR) mechanisms. Here, we show that S6K1 orchestrates DNA repair by phosphorylation of Cdk1 at serine 39, causing G2/M cell cycle arrest enabling homologous recombination and by phosphorylation of MSH6 at serine 309, enhancing MMR. Moreover, breast cancer cells harboring <i>RPS6KB1</i> gene amplification show increased resistance to several DNA damaging agents and S6K1 expression is associated with poor survival of breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Our findings reveal an unexpected function of S6K1 in the DNA repair pathway, serving as a tumorigenic barrier by safeguarding genomic stability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The structure-selective endonucleases GEN1 and MUS81 mediate complementary functions in safeguarding the genome of proliferating B lymphocytes</a></h4>

              
                During the development of humoral immunity, activated B lymphocytes undergo vigorous proliferative, transcriptional, metabolic, and DNA remodeling activities; hence, their genomes are constantly exposed to an onslaught of genotoxic agents and processes. Branched DNA intermediates generated during replication and recombinational repair must be eliminated to preserve the integrity of these DNA transactions for the faithful duplication and propagation of genomic material. To investigate the role of two structure-selective endonucleases, GEN1 and MUS81, in B cell biology, we established B-cell conditional knockout mouse models and found that targeted deletion of GEN1 and MUS81 in early B-cell precursors abrogates the development and maturation of B-lineage cells while selective loss of the enzymes in mature B cells inhibits the generation of robust germinal centers. Upon activation, these double-null mature B lymphocytes fail to proliferate and survive while exhibiting transcriptional signatures of p53 signaling, apoptosis, and type I interferon response. Metaphase spreads of these endonuclease-deficient cells showed severe and diverse chromosomal abnormalities, including a preponderance of chromosome breaks, consistent with a defect in resolving DNA recombination intermediates. These observations underscore the pivotal roles of GEN1 and MUS81 in safeguarding the genome to ensure the proper development and maintenance of B lymphocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A visual sense of number emerges from divisive normalization in a simple center-surround convolutional network</a></h4>

              
                Many species of animals exhibit an intuitive sense of number, suggesting a fundamental neural mechanism for representing numerosity in a visual scene. Recent empirical studies demonstrate that early feedforward visual responses are sensitive to numerosity of a dot array but substantially less so to continuous dimensions orthogonal to numerosity, such as size and spacing of the dots. However, the mechanisms that extract numerosity are unknown. Here we identified the core neurocomputational principles underlying these effects: (1) center-surround contrast filters; (2) at different spatial scales; with (3) divisive normalization across network units. In an untrained computational model, these principles eliminated sensitivity to size and spacing, making numerosity the main determinant of the neuronal response magnitude. Moreover, a model implementation of these principles explained both well-known and relatively novel illusions of numerosity perception across space and time. This supports the conclusion that the neural structures and feedforward processes that encode numerosity naturally produce visual illusions of numerosity. Together, these results identify a set of neurocomputational properties that gives rise to the ubiquity of the number sense in the animal kingdom.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Real time, in vivo measurement of neuronal and peripheral clocks in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks are highly conserved transcriptional regulators that control ~24-hour oscillations in gene expression, physiological function, and behavior. Circadian clocks exist in almost every tissue and are thought to control tissue-specific gene expression and function, synchronized by the brain clock. Many disease states are associated with loss of circadian regulation. How and when circadian clocks fail during pathogenesis remains largely unknown because it is currently difficult to monitor tissue-specific clock function in intact organisms. Here, we developed a method to directly measure the transcriptional oscillation of distinct neuronal and peripheral clocks in live, intact <i>Drosophila</i>, which we term Locally Activatable BioLuminescence, or LABL. Using this method, we observed that specific neuronal and peripheral clocks exhibit distinct transcriptional properties. Loss of the receptor for PDF, a circadian neurotransmitter critical for the function of the brain clock, disrupts circadian locomotor activity but not all tissue-specific circadian clocks. We found that, while peripheral clocks in non-neuronal tissues were less stable after the loss of PDF signaling, they continued to oscillate. We also demonstrate that distinct clocks exhibit differences in their loss of oscillatory amplitude or their change in period, depending on their anatomical location, mutation, or fly age. Our results demonstrate that LABL is an effective tool that allows rapid, affordable, and direct real-time monitoring of individual clocks <i>in vivo</i>.

                Norepinephrine (NE) neuromodulation plays a role in diverse non-specific physiological and cognitive functions including wakefulness, arousal, and cognitive performance. NE modulation of neuronal responses in the cerebral cortex has been proposed to mediate improved task-specific behavior by enhancing sensory processing. However, the sensory-specific NE contribution on performance remains unknown. We directly tested the role of NE-mediated neuromodulation of sensory signals on perceptual performance in non-human primates doing visual spatial attention tasks. We found that NE neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) respond selectively to an attended stimulus. Optogenetically enhancing the sensory-specific responses of LC-NE neurons improved the monkeys' sensory discrimination in a spatially selectively way, without affecting motor processing. These findings identify a specific contribution of NE neuromodulation of sensory representations to selective attention and performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comprehensive volumetric phenotyping of the neonatal brain in Down syndrome.</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to investigate differences in whole and/or regional brain volumes in DS from infancy to adulthood. However, to date, there have been relatively few in vivo neonatal brain imaging studies in DS, despite the presence of clearly identifiable characteristics at birth. Improved understanding of early brain development in DS is needed to assess phenotypic severity and identify appropriate time windows for early intervention. In this study, we used in vivo brain MRI to conduct a comprehensive volumetric phenotyping of the neonatal brain in DS. Using a robust cross-sectional reference sample of close to 500 preterm- to term-born control neonates, we have performed normative modelling and quantified volumetric deviation from the normative mean in 25 individual infants with DS [postmenstrual age at scan, median (range) = 40.57 (32.43 - 45.57) weeks], corrected for sex, age at scan and age from birth. We found that absolute whole brain volume was significantly reduced in neonates with DS (pFDR <0.0001), as were most underlying absolute tissue volumes, except for the lentiform nuclei and the extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid (eCSF), which were not significantly different, and the lateral ventricles, which were significantly enlarged (pFDR <0.0001). Relative volumes, adjusting for underlying differences in whole brain volume, revealed a dynamic shift in brain proportions in neonates with DS. In particular, the cerebellum, as well as the cingulate, frontal, insular and occipital white matter (WM) segments were significantly reduced in proportion (pFDR <0.0001). Conversely, deep grey matter (GM) structures, such as the thalami and lentiform nuclei, as well as CSF-filled compartments, such as the eCSF and the lateral ventricles were significantly enlarged in proportion (pFDR <0.0001). We also observed proportionally reduced frontal and occipital lobar volumes, in contrast with proportionally enlarged temporal and parietal lobar volumes. Lastly, we noted age-related volumetric differences between neonates with and without a congenital heart defect (CHD), indicating that there may be a baseline brain phenotype in neonates with DS, which is further altered in the presence of CHD. In summary, we provide a comprehensive volumetric phenotyping of the neonatal brain in DS and observe many features that appear to follow a developmental continuum, as noted in older age cohorts. There are currently no paediatric longitudinal neuroimaging investigations in DS, starting from the earliest time points, which greatly impedes our understanding of the developmental continuum of neuroanatomical parameters in DS. Whilst life expectancy of individuals with DS has greatly improved over the last few decades, early interventions may be essential to help improve outcomes and quality of life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A method to estimate contact regions between hands and objects during human multi-digit grasping</a></h4>

              
                In order to grasp an object successfully, we must select appropriate contact regions for our hands on the surface of the object. However, identifying such regions is challenging. Here, we describe a workflow to estimate contact regions from marker-based tracking data. Participants grasp real objects, while we track the 3D position of both the objects and the hand including the fingers' joints. We first determine joint Euler angles from a selection of tracked markers positioned on the back of the hand. Then, we use state-of-the-art hand mesh reconstruction algorithms to generate a mesh model of the participant's hand in the current pose and 3D position. Using objects that were either 3D printed, or 3D scanned--and are thus available as both real objects and mesh data--allows us to co-register the hand and object meshes. In turn, this allows us to estimate approximate contact regions by calculating intersections between the hand mesh and the co-registered 3D object mesh. The method may be used to estimate where and how humans grasp objects under a variety of conditions. Therefore, the method could be of interest to researchers studying visual and haptic perception, motor control, human-computer interaction in virtual and augmented reality, and robotics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Defective neuritogenesis in Abcd1/2 deficient rat neurons due to intrinsic and astrocyte-dependent mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare neurometabolic and demyelinating disorder caused by loss of function mutations of the ABCD1 transporter that imports very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) into the peroxisome for beta-oxidation. Impaired ABCD1 function results in VLCFA accumulation, which ultimately causes lethal forms of X-ALD in children (CCALD) and adults (CAMN). Because X-ALD is a genetic disorder, we looked for signs of altered neurodevelopmental pathways in the transcriptomes of brain cortical tissues free of pathology from patients that died of CALD or CAMN. Several categories related to brain development, axonal growth, synaptic signaling and synaptic compartments were significantly dysregulated in both CALD and CAMN, suggesting that congenital circuit abnormalities might be structural in brains of mutated ABCD1 carriers. We partially dissected the cellular origin of dysregulated pathways using rat neuronal and astrocytic cultures in which X-ALD was modeled by silencing of Abcd1 and Abcd2 by RNA interference. Abcd2 was silenced lest it compensated for Abcd1 loss. Abcd1/2 deficient neurons presented higher rates of death, reduced sizes and defective formation of spines, dendrites and axons. The aberrant neuron development was caused by cell-autonomous and astrocyte-dependent mechanisms, and involved Wnt signaling, as suggested by the rescue of the expression of a synaptic gene upon pharmacological activation of the Wnt pathway. As recently proposed for neurogenetic disorders such as Huntington's disease, our data suggest that X-ALD has a neurodevelopmental component that may cause psychiatric alterations and prime neural circuits for neurodegeneration. If this is the case, therapies aimed at restoring neural-circuit function in neurodevelopmental disorders may be reprofiled for X-ALD therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-State Electroencephalography for Continuous, Passive Prediction of Coma Recovery After Acute Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Accurately predicting emergence from disorders of consciousness (DoC) after acute brain injury can profoundly influence mortality, acute management, and rehabilitation planning. While recent advances in functional neuroimaging and stimulus-based EEG offer the potential to enrich shared decision-making, their procedural sophistication and expense limit widespread availability or repeated performance. We investigated continuous EEG (cEEG) within a passive, resting-state framework to provide continuously updated predictions of DoC recovery at 24-, 48-, and 72-hour prediction horizons. To develop robust, continuous prediction models from a large population of patients with acute brain injury (ABI), we leveraged a recently described pragmatic approach transforming Glasgow Coma Scale assessment sub-score combinations into frequently assessed DoC diagnoses: coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state with or without language, and post-injury confusional or recovered states. We retrospectively identified consecutive patients undergoing cEEG following acute traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Models continuously predicting DoC diagnosis for multiple prediction horizons were evaluated utilizing recent clinical assessments with or without cEEG information, which comprised a comprehensive EEG feature set of 288 time, frequency, and time-frequency characteristics computed from consecutive 5-minute EEG epochs, with 6 additional features capturing each EEG feature's temporal dynamics. Features were fed into a predictive model developed with cross-validation; the ordinal DoC diagnosis was discriminated using an ensemble of XGBoost binary classifiers. For 201 ABI patients (46 TBI, 140 SAH, 15 ICH patients comprising 27,280 cEEG-hours with concomitant clinical assessments), cEEG-augmented models accurately predicted the future DoC diagnosis at 24 hours (one-vs-rest AU-ROC, 92.4%; weighted-F1 84.1%), 48 hours (one-vs-rest AU-ROC=88%, weighted-F1=80%) and 72 hours (one-vs-rest AU-ROC=86.3%, weighted-F1=76.6%). Models were robust to utilizing different ordinal cut-points for the DoC prediction target and evaluating additional models derived from specific sub-populations using a confound-isolating cross-validation framework. The most robust features across evaluation configurations included Petrosian fractal dimension, relative power of high to low (gamma-beta to delta-alpha) EEG frequency spectra, energy within the 12-35 Hz frequency band in the short-time Fourier transform domain, and wavelet entropy. The cEEG-augmented model exceeded the performance of models using preceding clinical assessments, continuously predicting future DoC diagnosis with one-vs-rest AU-ROC in the range of 84.3-92.4% while utilizing approaches to limit overfitting. The proposed continuous, resting-state cEEG prediction method represents a promising tool to predict DoC emergence in ABI patients. Enabling these methods prospectively would represent a new paradigm of continuous prognostic monitoring for predicting coma recovery and assessing treatment response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A minimally-invasive method for serial cerebrospinal fluid collection and injection in rodents with high survival rates</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear fluid surrounding and nourishing the brain and spinal cord. Molecular profiling of the CSF is a common diagnostic approach for central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, brain hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, CNS tumors, and Alzheimer's disease. Rodent models are critical for investigating CNS disease mechanisms and therapeutics, however, both collecting CSF and injecting materials into CSF in small animals are technically challenging and often result in high rates of postoperative mortality. Here, we present an easy-to-practice and cost-effective protocol with minimum instrument requirements to access the CSF in live rodents for collection and infusion purposes. By introducing a metal needle tool bent at a unique angle and length, we could steadily reach the CSF via the foramen magnum. Compared with prior methods, this protocol requires neither the operator to discern the changes in resistance from solid tissues while puncturing the needle, nor surgical opening of the skin and muscle covering the rodent neck. Using this method, we frequently obtain 5-15 L of CSF from mice and 70-120 L from rats to enable diverse downstream analyses including mass spectrometry. Due to the minimal invasiveness, this procedure allows iterative CSF collection from the same animal every few days - a major improvement over prior protocols that require extensive surgical operations. Moreover, we demonstrate that this method could be used for injecting desired solutions including dyes into mouse CSF with high success rates. Our method shortens the time required for CSF collection or injection to 3-5 minutes. Notably, we could reach near 100% postoperative recovery rates in both mice and rats even with repetitive collections. Together, we establish an efficient and minimally-invasive protocol for collecting CSF and inoculating reagents into the CSF in live rodents to enable various longitudinal studies at the forefronts of CNS investigation.

                Background: Cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI), a neural connection between the cerebellum and primary motor cortex (M1), has been researched as a target pathway for neuromodulation to improve clinical outcomes in various neurological diseases. However, conflicting results of anodal cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (acb-tDCS) on M1 excitability indicate that additional investigation is required to examine its precise effect. Objective/Hypothesis: This study aimed to gather evidence of the neuromodulatory effect of acb-tDCS on the M1 using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Methods: Sixteen healthy participants were included in this cross-over study. Participants received real and sham acb-tDCS in a random order, with a minimum one-week washout period between them. The anode and cathode were placed on the right cerebellum and the right buccinator muscle, respectively. Stimulation lasted 20 min at an intensity of 2 mA, and fNIRS data were recorded for 42 min (including a 4 min baseline before stimulation and an 18 min post-stimulation duration) using eight channels attached bilaterally on the M1. Results: acb-tDCS induced a significant decrease in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentration (inhibitory effect) in the left (contralateral) M1, whereas it induced a significant increase in HbO concentration (excitatory effect) in the right (ipsilateral) M1 compared to sham tDCS during (p < 0.05) and after stimulation (p < 0.01) in a group level analysis. At the individual level, variations in the response to acb-tDCS were observed. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the neuromodulatory effects of acb-tDCS on the bilateral M1 in terms of neuronal hemodynamics.

                Prevailing preclinical models of cocaine use have not resulted in an FDA-approved treatment for cocaine use disorder, potentially due to a focus on cocaine use in isolation, which may not translate well to polysubstance use in clinical populations. Clinically, nicotine has been shown to increase cocaine potency and reinforcing efficacy, but some preclinical studies suggest that non-contingent nicotine exposure is not sufficient to alter cocaine self-administration in rats; therefore, this experiment examined if the addition of nicotine to the cocaine solution would alter self-administration behavior. Male Sprague Dawley rats (N=7) were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.75mg/kg/inf), and tested on a long access, fixed ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement (6 hour sessions, unlimited inf, 5 days), for cocaine alone (0.75mg/kg/inf), followed by cocaine and nicotine (0.75mg/kg/inf cocaine +0.03mg/kg/inf nicotine). Finally, rats responded on a progressive ratio schedule for varied doses of cocaine with and without concurrent nicotine at a consistent dose (1.5, 0.75, 0.375, 0.19mg/kg/inf cocaine {+/-} 0.03mg/kg/inf nicotine). Unexpectedly, under long access conditions, rats self-administering cocaine and nicotine responded less than for cocaine alone, and did not escalate responding. However, under progressive ratio conditions, responding for cocaine and nicotine was greater than responding for cocaine alone across low and moderate cocaine doses, and decreased at high cocaine doses, indicating a leftward shift in the dose response curve. Together, these data highlight the importance of evaluating multiple outcome measures in nicotine + cocaine paradigms, and suggest that concurrent self-administration of cocaine and nicotine results in greater motivated responding than for cocaine alone.

                Purpose This study aims to describe variations in acoustic and electroencephalography measures when speaking in the presence of background noise (Lombard effect) in participants with typical voice and normal hearing. Method Twenty-one participants with typical voices and normal hearing uttered simple vocal tasks in three sequential background conditions: Baseline (in quiet), Lombard (in noise), and Recovery (five minutes after removing the noise). Acoustic and electroencephalography signals were recorded in all conditions. The noise used in the Lombard condition consisted of speech-shaped noise at 80 dB SPL sent by headphones. Acoustic measure, and ERP responses were analyzed. Results During the Lombard condition, the participants increased the intensity of their voice, accompanied by an increase in CPP, and a decrease in H1-H2. The cortical response was characterized by the increased N1-P2 complex amplitude of the ERP elicited by the subject's own vocalizations in noise, The source localization showed neural activities in frontal and temporal cortical regions. Conclusions The variation in acoustic measures due to the Lombard Effect could be modulated by temporal, and cortical regions.

                The mammalian cerebral cortex is anatomically organized into a six-layer motif. It is currently unknown whether a corresponding laminar motif of neuronal activity exists across the cortex. Here, we report the discovery of such a motif in the power of local field potentials (LFP). We implanted multicontact laminar probes in five macaque monkeys and recorded activity across layers in 12 cortical areas at various hierarchical processing stages in all cortical lobes. The anatomical laminar locations of recordings were histologically identified via electrolytic lesions. In all areas, we found a common spectrolaminar pattern characterized by an increasing deep-to-superficial layer gradient of gamma frequency LFP power peaking in layers 2/3, and an increasing superficial-to-deep gradient of alpha-beta power peaking in layers 5/6. Our results show a functional dissociation between superficial and deep layers that is preserved across the cortex, suggesting a ubiquitous layer and frequency-based mechanism for cortical computation.

                Grand efforts in neuroscience are working toward mapping the connectomes of many new species, including the near completion of the Drosophila melanogaster. It is important to ask whether these models could benefit artificial intelligence. In this work we ask two fundamental questions: (1) where and when biological connectomes can provide use in machine learning, (2) which design principles are necessary for extracting a good representation of the connectome. Toward this end, we translate the motor circuit of the C. Elegans nematode into artificial neural networks at varying levels of biophysical realism and evaluate the outcome of training these networks on motor and non-motor behavioral tasks. We demonstrate that biophysical realism need not be upheld to attain the advantages of using biological circuits. We also establish that, even if the exact wiring diagram is not retained, the architectural statistics provide a valuable prior. Finally, we show that while the C. Elegans locomotion circuit provides a powerful inductive bias on locomotion problems, its structure may hinder performance on tasks unrelated to locomotion such as visual classification problems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior unsupervised experience leads to long lasting effects in sensory gating during discrimination learning</a></h4>

              
                As the animal moves in its environment, the brain detects and learns the structure of the surrounding stimuli, independently of the immediate relevance this has for the animal. This experience influences subsequent learning in a manner quantified using paradigms such as latent inhibition or stimulus preconditioning, which measure the effect that unsupervised (not-reinforced) learning has on subsequent reinforced learning. Despite our understanding of the behavioural consequences of prior neutral experience, there is little understanding about the influence of this previous experience on neuronal plasticity. Using latent inhibition, we have shown in mice that learning a two tone discrimination is slower in mice that have had previous neutral exposure to the same or similar tones (<2/3 octave away). Neutral exposure thus elicits profound changes in the brain that influence subsequent learning. To study how previous experience influences experience-dependent plasticity, and better understand the interactions between experience, learning, and plasticity, we recorded sound evoked responses in the auditory cortex of exposed and trained mice. We studied both changes in response magnitude and changes in sensory dynamics, and related both to the differential behavioral effects of different pre-exposure conditions. Here we describe the neuronal changes that paralleled the behavioral findings. We found that discrimination learning led to stronger initial sound-evoked responses and a long-lasting increase in response adaptation and an increase. The first effect was delayed in animals that showed latent inhibition, paralleling behavioural learning. Overall our data reveal that slow changes in behaviour that accompanied learning, paralleled the slow dynamics of experience-dependent plasticity in auditory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improved whole-brain multivariate hemodynamic deconvolution for multi-echo fMRI with stability selection</a></h4>

              
                Blind estimation of neuronal-related activity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of resting-state, naturalistic paradigms or clinical conditions can be performed with paradigm free analysis methods such as hemodynamic deconvolution. These methods usually employ a linear hemodynamic convolution model and sparsity-pursuing regularized estimation techniques to detect single-trial blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the brain. Recently, a deconvolution algorithm tailored for multi-echo fMRI data, named multi-echo sparse paradigm free mapping (ME-SPFM), exploited the linear dependence of the BOLD percent signal change on the echo time (TE) to compute voxel-wise estimates of the changes in the apparent transverse relaxation ({Delta}R*2) associated with brain activity, achieving superior performance than its single-echo counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel multivariate formulation that operates at the whole brain level, considering all the voxels as a group in a mixed-norm regularization term to add spatial information in the deconvolution. In addition, we introduce a stability selection procedure that operates voxelwise and avoids the critical selection of the regularization parameter for the deconvolution. This procedure allow us to define a novel metric based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability path of the estimation, which provides valuable and complementary information about the probability of having a neuronal-related event at each voxel and time-point. We demonstrate that these novel features yield more robust results compared with the original ME-SPFM algorithm, and show high spatial and temporal agreement with the activation maps and BOLD signals obtained with a standard model-based linear regression approach. In summary, the proposed multivariate multi-echo sparse paradigm free mapping (MvME-SPFM) approach with stability selection provides more reliable estimates of {Delta}R*2 for the study of the dynamics of brain activity when no information about the timings of the BOLD events is available.

                The septal complex regulates both motivated and innate behaviors, chiefly by the action of its diverse population of long-range projection neurons. Among those cells are lateral septum somatostatin neurons which collateral axons profusely innervate cortically-projecting neurons located in the medial septum. Thus, somatostatin cells are ideally positioned at the crossroads of ascending and descending modulatory pathways, likely supporting functional roles in both anatomical directions. Here, we used optogenetic stimulation and extracellular recordings in acutely anesthetized transgenic mice to show that septal somatostatin neurons can disinhibit the cholinergic septo-hippocampal pathway, thus enhancing the amplitude and synchrony of theta oscillations, while depressing sharp wave ripple episodes in the dorsal hippocampus. Nonetheless, photosuppressing septal somatostatin cells hindered goal-directed behavior in a spatial memory task by disrupting task engagement, evidenced in increased immobility, followed by repetitive self-grooming, a hallmark innate behavior. These results suggest that septal somatostatin cells can recruit ascending cholinergic pathways to promote hippocampal theta oscillations, while gating repetitive displacement behaviors mediated by descending subcortical pathways.

                Pollution is a driving force in climate change and an important modifier of human health. Humans are chronically exposed to complex chemical mixtures and, correspondingly, researchers are disentangling the contribution of different contaminants to human neuropathologies. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are biopersistent pollutants and, due to their diverse applications, have become global contaminants. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a prevalent PFAS congener, impairs humoral immunity; however, its impact on innate immunity is unclear. Given the critical roles of innate immune cells, namely microglia, in brain development and homeostasis, we asked whether exposure adversely affects microglial function. Herein, we demonstrate developmental PFOS exposure produces microglial activation and upregulation of the microglia activation gene p2ry12. PFOS-induced microglial activation heightened microglial responses to brain injury, in the absence of increased cell death or inflammation. Use of the photoconvertible calcium indicator CaMPARI revealed PFOS exposure heightened neural activity, while optogenetic silencing of neurons was sufficient to normalize microglial responses to injury. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid, an immunotoxic PFAS, did not alter neuronal activity or microglial behavior, further supporting a role for neural activity as a critical modifier of microglial function. Together, this study reveals how contaminant-induced changes in brain activity can shape brain health.

                Functional connectivity (FC) refers to the statistical dependencies between activity of distinct brain areas. To study temporal fluctuations in FC within the duration of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning session, researchers have proposed the computation of an edge time series (ETS) and their derivatives. Evidence suggests that FC is driven by a few time points of high-amplitude co-fluctuation (HACF) in the ETS, which may also contribute disproportionately to interindividual differences. However, it remains unclear to what degree different time points actually contribute to brain-behaviour associations. Here, we systematically evaluate this question by assessing the predictive utility of FC estimates at different levels of co-fluctuation using machine learning (ML) approaches. We demonstrate that time points of lower and intermediate co-fluctuation levels provide overall highest subject specificity as well as highest predictive capacity of individual-level phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A primary rodent triculture model to investigate the role of glia-neuron crosstalk in regulation of neuronal activity.</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation and hyperexcitability have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease, and new models are required to investigate the cellular crosstalk involved in these processes. We developed an approach to generate a quantitative and reproducible triculture system that is suitable for pharmacological studies. While primary rodent cells were previously grown in a coculture medium formulated to support only neurons and astrocytes, we now optimised a protocol to generate tricultures containing neurons, astrocytes and microglia by culturing in a medium designed to support all three cell types and adding exogenous microglia to cocultures. Immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the intended cell types were present. The percentage of ramified microglia in the tricultures decreases as the number of microglia present increases. Multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings indicate that microglia in the triculture model suppress neuronal activity in a dose-dependent manner. Neurons in both cocultures and tricultures were responsive to the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) suggesting that neurons remained viable and functional in the triculture model. Furthermore, suppressed neuronal activity in tricultures correlated with decreased densities of dendritic spines and of the postsynaptic protein Homer1 along dendrites, indicative of a direct or indirect effect of microglia on synapse function. We thus present a functional triculture model, which, due to its more complete cellular composition, is a more relevant model than standard cocultures. The model can be used to probe glia-neuron interactions and subsequently aid the development of assays for drug discovery, using neuronal excitability as a functional endpoint.

                Homing based on path integration (H-PI) is a form of navigation in which an animal uses self-motion cues to keep track of its position and return to a starting point. Despite evidence for a role of the hippocampus in H-PI, the firing patterns of hippocampal neurons associated with homing performance are unknown. Here we developed a behavioral task for mice to characterize spatially selective cells during H-PI. The task required a mouse to find a variably placed lever on an arena before returning to its home base. H-PI was assessed in complete darkness. Recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in mice showed that several firing fields were anchored to the lever position. The spatial stability of lever-anchored fields was reduced during trials with lower homing accuracy, and the activity of a subset of lever-anchored firing fields predicted homing direction. These results demonstrate how neurons with object-anchored firing fields contribute to navigation.

                Maternal one-carbon (1C) metabolism plays an important role in early life programming. There is a well-established connection between the fetal environment and the health status of the offspring. However, there is a knowledge gap on how maternal nutrition impacts stroke outcome in offspring. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of maternal dietary deficiencies in folic acid or choline on stroke outcome in 3-month-old offspring. Adult female mice were fed a folic acid deficient diet (FADD), choline deficient diet (ChDD), or control diet (CD) prior to pregnancy. They were continued on diets during pregnancy and lactation. Male and female offspring were weaned onto a CD and at 2 months of age were subject to ischemic stroke within the sensorimotor cortex via photothrombosis damage. At 3-months-of-age, motor function was measured in offspring and tissue was collected for analysis. Mothers maintained on either a FADD or ChDD had reduced levels of S-adenosylmethionine in liver and S-adenosylhomocysteine in plasma. After ischemic stroke, motor function was impaired in 3-month-old offspring from deficient mothers compared to CD animals. In brain tissue, there was no difference in ischemic damage volume. When protein levels were assessed in brain tissue, there were lower levels of neurodegeneration in males compared to females and betaine levels were reduced in offspring from ChDD mothers. Our results demonstrate that a deficient maternal diet during critical timepoints in neurodevelopment results in worse stroke outcomes. This study emphasizes the importance of maternal diet and the impact it can have on offspring health.

                Entorhinal cortex (EC) is a potential target of deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and fMRI can enable whole-brain dynamic mapping noninvasively. However, it remains challenging to study EC-based fMRI connectivity in rodents due to image signal loss and the lower sensitivity of the surface coil ring or array coil for deep brain areas. To reduce the magnetic susceptibility artifacts driven signal loss issue, we introduced baby cream into the middle ear. To improve detection sensitivity, we implemented novel inductively-coupled ear-bars (ICEs) in the 7 T Bruker scanner, which resulted in an approximately 2-fold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increase in EC over the conventional surface array. The ICE can be conveniently utilized as an add-on device, with no modulation to the scanner interface. To demonstrate the applicability of ICEs for both task and resting-state (rs) fMRI, whole-brain echo-planar imaging (EPI) was performed in anesthetized rats modeling AD mixed dementia. Seed-based rs-fMRI connectivity maps emanating from the left entorhinal cortex demonstrated its connectivity to the hippocampus, piriform cortex, septal nuclei, and prefrontal cortex. Hence, this work demonstrates an optimized procedure for ICE by acquiring large-scale networks emanating from a seed region that was not easily accessible by conventional MRI detectors, enabling better observation of EC-based brain fMRI connectivity studies with a higher signal-to-noise ratio in rodent models of dementia.

                The parabrachial complex (PB) is critically involved in aversive processes, including pain. We have reported that chronic pain is associated with amplified activity of PB neurons in rodent models of neuropathic pain. Here we demonstrate that catecholaminergic input from the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTScat)--a stress responsive region that integrates intero- and exteroceptive signals- causes amplification of PB activity and their sensory afferents. Using a virally mediated expression of a norepinephrine (NE) sensor, NE2h, and fiber photometry in anesthetized mice, noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli caused prolonged NE transients in PB that far outlast the noxious stimulus. Similar NE transients in PB were evoked by focal stimulation of the superficial cNTS, a region that contains the noradrenergic A2 cell group that projects densely upon PB. In vitro, optical stimulation of cNTScat terminals depolarized PB neurons and increased their frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs. A dual opsin approach showed that sensory afferents from the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpVc) are potentiated by cNTScat terminal activation. This potentiation was coupled with a decrease in the paired pulse ratio, consistent with an cNTScat mediated increase in the probability of release at SpVc synapses. Together, these data suggest that A2 neurons of the cNTS generate long lasting NE transients in PB which increase excitability and potentiate responses of PB neurons to sensory inputs. These reveal a mechanism through which stressors from multiple modalities may potentiate the aversiveness of nociceptive stimuli.

                We looked at the overlap between brain areas related to perception of physiologically and socially needed stimuli and how they might regulate serotonin levels. First, we conducted separate ALE meta-analyses on published results pertaining to brain activation patterns when participants perceived food while hungry or water while thirsty, and social interactions while being excluded. This allowed us to identify common consistent brain activation patterns for physiological and social needed stimuli. We also looked at significant spatial association between the common network and serotonin receptor distribution. We found that regions within the mid-posterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex and the caudate are at the intersection of physiological (hunger and thirst) and social (exclusion) aspects of needing. Furthermore, we found a significant positive spatial correlation between that common network and 5HT4 serotonin receptor. Our study suggests there is a common brain pattern during the processing of physiologically and socially needed stimuli, which modulates serotonin neurons possibly through a feedback loop from the PFC to the serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei.

                Myelinated axons (nerve fibers) efficiently transmit signals throughout the brain via action potentials. Multiple methods that are sensitive to axon orientations, from microscopy to magnetic resonance imaging, aim to reconstruct the brain's structural connectome. As billions of nerve fibers traverse the brain with various possible geometries at each point, resolving fiber crossings is necessary to generate accurate structural connectivity maps. However, doing so with specificity is a challenging task because signals stemming from oriented fibers can be influenced by brain (micro)structures unrelated to myelinated axons. X-ray scattering can specifically probe myelinated axons due to the periodicity of the myelin sheath, which yields distinct peaks in the scattering pattern. Here, we show that scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can be used to detect myelinated, axon-specific fiber crossings. We first demonstrate the capability using strips of human corpus callosum to create artificial double and triple crossing fiber geometries, and then apply the method in mouse, pig, vervet monkey, and human brains. Given its specificity, capability of 3-dimensional sampling and high resolution, scanning SAXS can serve as a ground truth for validating MRI as well as microscopy-based methods.

                Amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are surrounded by large numbers of plaque-associated axonal spheroids (PAAS). PAAS disrupt axonal electrical conduction and neuronal network function, and correlate with AD severity. However, the mechanisms that govern their formation remain unknown. To uncover the molecular architecture of PAAS, we applied proximity labeling proteomics of spheroids in human AD postmortem brains and mice. We then implemented a human iPSC-derived AD model recapitulating PAAS pathology for mechanistic studies. Using this strategy, we uncovered hundreds of previously unknown PAAS-enriched proteins and signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Phosphorylated mTOR was highly enriched in PAAS and strongly correlated with disease severity in humans. Importantly, pharmacological mTOR inhibition in iPSC-derived human neurons or AAV-mediated knockdown in mice, led to a marked reduction of PAAS pathology. Altogether, our study provides a novel platform to examine mechanisms of axonal pathology in neurodegeneration and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of novel targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurodegenerative disease associated pathways in brain of the triple transgenic Alzheimer's model are reversed in vivo following two weeks peripheral administration of fasudil</a></h4>

              
                The pan ROCK inhibitor fasudil acts as a vasodilator and has been used as a medication post cerebral stroke for the past 27 years in Japan and China. More recently, on the basis of the involvement of ROCK inhibition on synaptic function, neuronal survival and processes associated with neuroinflammation, it has been suggested that the drug may be repurposed for neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, fasudil has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in many neurodegenerative disease models. To facilitate an understanding of the wider biological processes at play due to ROCK inhibition in the context of neurodegeneration we performed a global gene expression analysis on the brains of Alzheimer's disease model mice treated with fasudil via peripheral i.p injection. Our results show that fasudil tends to drive gene expression in a reverse sense to that seen in postmortem neurodegenerative disease brains. The results are most striking in terms of pathway enrichment analysis where pathways regulated in Alzheimer's disease and by fasudil treatment are overwhelmingly regulated in opposite directions. Thus, our results bolster the repurposing potential of fasudil by demonstrating an anti-neurodegenerative phenotype in a disease context and highlight the potential of in vivo transcriptional profiling of drug activity.

                Cataloging the diverse cellular architecture of the primate brain is crucial for understanding cognition, behavior and disease in humans. Here, we generated a brain-wide single-cell multimodal molecular atlas of the rhesus macaque brain. Altogether, we profiled 2.58M transcriptomes and 1.59M epigenomes from single nuclei sampled from 30 regions across the adult brain. Cell composition differed extensively across the brain, revealing cellular signatures of region-specific functions. We also identified 1.19M candidate regulatory elements, many novel, allowing us to explore the landscape of cis-regulatory grammar and neurological disease risk in a cell-type- specific manner. Together, this multi-omic atlas provides an open resource for investigating the evolution of the human brain and identifying novel targets for disease interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">KapBeta2 is a modifier of the C9orf72-linked glycine-arginine dipeptide neurotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                A common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia is the presence of a G4C2 intronic expansion in the C9orf72 gene. This expansion is translated by a non-AUG-dependent mechanism into five different dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), including the aggregation-prone poly glycine-arginine (GR), which is neurotoxic. Poly(GR) was found to interact with the nuclear importin Kap{beta}2 in non-neuronal cell lines. However, whether this interaction also occurs in neurons impacting their survival has not been studied. Here, we demonstrated that Kap{beta}2 and poly(GR) co-aggregate in neurons in-vitro and in-vivo in CNS tissue. Moreover, we showed that Kap{beta}2 mitigates poly(GR) neurotoxicity. Indeed, overexpression of Kap{beta}2 relieved poly(GR)-mediated neurotoxicity and restored nuclear TDP-43 levels, whereas silencing Kap{beta}2 increased the risk of death of neurons expressing poly(GR), suggesting that Kap{beta}2 plays a critical role in neurodegeneration. These findings open a new therapeutic avenue in C9-linked ALS/FTD focused on modulating Kap{beta}2 levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task-based attentional and default mode connectivity associated with STEM anxiety profiles among university physics students</a></h4>

              
                Attentional control theory (ACT) posits that elevated anxiety increases the probability of re-allocating cognitive resources needed to complete a task to processing anxiety-related stimuli. This process impairs processing efficiency and can lead to reduced performance effectiveness. Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students frequently experience STEM-related anxiety, which can interfere with learning and performance and negatively impact student retention and graduation rates. The objective of this study was to extend the ACT framework to investigate the neurobiological associations between STEM-related anxiety and cognitive performance among 123 physics undergraduate students. Latent profile analysis (LPA) identified four profiles of student STEM-related anxiety, including two profiles that represented the majority of the sample (Low STEM Anxiety; 59.3% and High Math Anxiety; 21.9%) and two additional profiles that were not well represented (High STEM Anxiety; 6.5% and High Science Anxiety; 4.1%). Students underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session in which they performed two tasks involving physics cognition: the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) task and the Physics Knowledge (PK) task. No significant differences were observed in FCI or PK task performance between High Math Anxiety and Low STEM Anxiety students. During the three phases of the FCI task, we found no significant brain connectivity differences during scenario and question presentation, yet we observed significant differences during answer selection within and between the dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), and default mode network (DMN). Further, we found significant group differences during the PK task were limited to the DAN, including DAN-VAN and within-DAN connectivity. These results highlight the different cognitive processes required for physics conceptual reasoning compared to physics knowledge retrieval, provide new insight into the underlying brain dynamics associated with anxiety and physics cognition, and confirm the relevance of ACT theory for STEM-related anxiety.

                Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbes disease is a fatal genetic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by loss-of-function mutations in the galactosylceramidase (galc) gene. While the metabolic basis for disease is known, the understanding of how this results in neuropathology is not well understood. Herein we report that the rapid and protracted elevation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes occurs coincident with clinical disease in a mouse model of GLD. Administration of a function blocking antibody against CD8a effectively prevented disease onset, reduced morbidity and mortality and prevented CNS demyelination in mice. These data indicate that subsequent to the genetic cause of disease, neuropathology is driven by pathogenic CD8+ T cells, thus offering novel therapeutic potential for treatment of GLD.

	<p>Skull base surgery has undergone significant progress following key technological developments. From early candle-lit devices to the modern endoscope, refinements in visualization techniques have made endoscopic skull base surgery (ESBS) a standard practice for treating a variety of conditions. The endoscope has also been integrated with other technologies to enhance visualization, including fluorescence agents, intraoperative neuronavigation with augmented reality, and the exoscope. Endoscopic approaches have allowed neurosurgeons to reevaluate skull base neuroanatomy from new perspectives. These advances now serve as the foundation for future developments in ESBS. In this narrative review, we discuss the history and development of ESBS, current visualization techniques, and future innovations.</p>

	<p>Numerous studies have established the link between ADHD and antisocial behavior, one of the most serious functional impairments caused by the disorder. However, research on protective factors that mitigate this link is still lacking. The Salutogenic Model of Health offers the &amp;amp;ldquo;Sense of Coherence&amp;amp;rdquo; (SOC), establishing that individuals who see their lives as logical, meaningful, and manageable are more resistant to various risk factors and diseases. The present study examines for the first time whether SOC is also a protective factor against different ADHD-related types of antisocial behaviors (severe/mild violent behavior, verbal violence, property crimes, public disorder, and drug abuse). A total of 3180 participants aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;50 completed online questionnaires assessing the level of ADHD symptoms, antisocial behaviors, and SOC. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the research hypothesis. An interaction between ADHD symptoms and SOC was found in predicting each type of antisocial behavior (beta = &amp;amp;minus;0.06&amp;amp;ndash;&amp;amp;minus;0.17, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The link between ADHD symptoms and antisocial behavior was significantly weaker for high than low SOC participants, regardless of age group. The current study found that people with high SOC are protected against the effect of ADHD symptoms on one of the most serious functional impairments, antisocial behavior. These findings suggest that SOC is a protective factor from the adverse effects of ADHD symptoms, justifying further prospective and intervention studies.</p>

	<p>Despite the increasing popularity of flow diverters (FDs) as an endovascular option for intracranial aneurysms, the treatment of complex aneurysms still represents a challenge. Combined strategies using a flow-preservation bypass could be considered in selected cases. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our series of patients with complex intracranial aneurysms submitted to bypass. From January 2015 to May 2022, 23 patients were selected. We identified 11 cases (47.8%) of MCA, 6 cases (26.1%) of ACA and 6 cases (26.1%) of ICA aneurysms. The mean maximal diameter was 22.73 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.16 mm, 8 were considered as giant, 9 were fusiform, 8 presented intraluminal thrombosis, 10 presented wall calcification, and 18 involved major branches or perforating arteries. Twenty-five bypass procedures were performed in 23 patients (two EC&amp;amp;ndash;IC bypasses with radial artery graft, seventeen single- or double-barrel STA&amp;amp;ndash;MCA bypasses and six IC&amp;amp;ndash;IC bypasses in anterior cerebral arteries). The long-term bypass patency rate was 94.5%, and the total aneurysm exclusion was 95.6%, with a mean follow-up of 28 months. Median KPS values at last follow-up was 90, and a favorable outcome (KPS &amp;amp;ge; 70 and mRS &amp;amp;le; 2) was obtained in 87% of the cases. The use of bypass techniques represents, in selected cases, a valid therapeutic option in the management of complex anterior circulation aneurysms when a simpler direct approach, including the use of FD, is considered not feasible.</p>

	<p>Psychotic disorders as well as psychosis proneness in the general population have been associated with perceptual instability, suggesting weakened predictive processing. Sleep disturbances play a prominent role in psychosis and schizophrenia, but it is unclear whether perceptual stability diminishes with sleep deprivation, and whether the effects of sleep deprivation differ as a function of psychosis proneness. In the current study, we aimed to clarify this matter. In this preregistered study, 146 participants successfully completed an intermittent version of the random dot kinematogram (RDK) task and the 21-item Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI-21) to assess perceptual stability and psychosis proneness, respectively. Participants were randomized to sleep either as normal (8 to 9 hours in bed) (n = 72; Mage = 24.7, SD = 6.2, 41 women) or to stay awake through the night (n = 74; Mage = 24.8, SD = 5.1, 44 women). Sleep deprivation resulted in diminished perceptual stability, as well as in decreases in perceptual stability over the course of the task. However, we did not observe any association between perceptual stability and PDI-21 scores, nor a tendency for individuals with higher PDI-21 scores to be more vulnerable to sleep-deprivation-induced decreases in perceptual stability. The present study suggests a compromised predictive processing system in the brain after sleep deprivation, but variation in psychosis trait is not related to greater vulnerability to sleep deprivation in our dataset. Further studies in risk groups and patients with psychosis are needed to evaluate whether sleep loss plays a role in the occurrence of objectively measured perceptual-related clinical symptoms.</p>

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 02 October 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33192-1">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-33192-1</a></p>Patient-level external control data from prior clinical studies or electronic health records can be used in the design and analysis of clinical trials. Here the authors report a hybrid trial design combining the use of external control data and randomization to test experimental treatments, using small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma datasets as examples.
