              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Predictive Coding: A New Model of Hierarchical Sequence Learning and Prediction in the Cortex</a></h4>

              
                We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a new hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the cortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using precision-weighted prediction errors. We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation is implemented as a low-dimensional mixture of possible temporal dynamics. When trained on natural videos, the first-level neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those found in simple cells of the primary visual cortex. The second-level responses spanned longer timescales and showed more stability than those at the first level, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. After adapting to a repeated visual sequence, the model displayed full recall of the sequence given only the beginning of the sequence, similar to sequence recall in the visual cortex. Our results suggest that sequence learning and temporal prediction in the cortex can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical generative model of input sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CaMKII binding to GluN2B flips a β-adrenergic switch from synaptic depression to potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Learning, memory and cognition are thought to require forms of synaptic plasticity such as hippocampal long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), and such plasticity can be modulated by {beta}-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol or norepinephrine. For instance, LTP versus LTD is induced by high- versus low-frequency stimulation (HFS versus LFS) but, stimulating {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs) enables LTP induction also by LFS. In contrast to HFS-LTP, such {beta}AR-LTP requires signaling by L-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels, not NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Surprisingly, we found that {beta}AR-LTP still required a non-ionotropic NMDAR function: the stimulus-induced binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) that mediates CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. In hippocampal neurons, {beta}-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol transformed LTD-type CaMKII movement to LTP-type movement, resulting in CaMKII movement to excitatory instead of inhibitory synapses. Additionally, isoproterenol enabled induction of a major cell-biological feature of LTP in response to LTD stimuli: increased SEP-GluA1 surface expression. Like for the {beta}AR-LTP in hippocampal slices, the effects of isoproterenol on CaMKII movement and SEP-GluA1 surface expression involved L-type Ca2+-channels. Taken together, these results indicate that isoproterenol transforms LTD stimuli to LTP signals by switching CaMKII movement and GluN2B binding to LTP mode.

	<p>Background: With the guidance of multi-mode imaging, the time window for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has been expanded to 24 h. However, poor clinical outcomes are still not uncommon. We aimed to develop a multi-mode imaging scale for endovascular therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke (META) to predict the neurological outcome in patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Methods: We included consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with occlusion of middle cerebral artery and/or internal carotid artery who underwent EVT. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3&amp;amp;ndash;6 at 3 months. A five-point META score was constructed based on clot burden score, multi-segment clot, the Alberta Stroke Program early computed tomography score of cerebral blood volume (CBV-ASPECTS), and collateral status. We evaluated the META score performance using area under the curve (AUC) calculations. Results: A total of 259 patients were included. A higher META score was independently correlated with poor outcomes at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.690, 95% CI, 1.340 to 2.132, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) after adjusting for age, hypertension, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and baseline blood glucose. Patients with a META score &amp;amp;ge; 2 were less likely to benefit from EVT (mRS 3&amp;amp;ndash;6: 60.8% vs. 29.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The META score predicted poor outcomes with an AUC of 0.714, higher than the Pittsburgh Response to Endovascular therapy (PRE) score, the totaled health risks in vascular events (THRIVE) score (AUC: 0.566, 0.706), and the single imaging marker in the scale. Conclusions: The novel META score could refine the predictive accuracy of prognosis after EVT, which might provide a promising avenue for future automatic imaging analysis to help decision making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Compartmentalization of Learning-Related Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons receive synaptic inputs from different pathways that are organized according to their laminar target. This architectural scheme provides cortical neurons with a spatial mechanism to separate information, which may support neural flexibility required during learning. Here, we investigated layer-specific plasticity of sensory encoding following learning by recording from two different dendritic compartments, tuft and basal dendrites, of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in the auditory cortex of mice. Following auditory fear conditioning, auditory-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were enhanced in tuft, but not basal, dendrites leading to increased somatic action potential output. This is in direct contrast to the long held (and debated) hypothesis that, despite extensive dendritic arbors, neurons function as a simple one-compartment model. Two computational models of varying complexity based on the experimental data illustrated that this learning-related increase of auditory responses in tuft dendrites can account for the changes in somatic output. Taken together, we illustrate that neurons do not function as a single compartment, and dendritic compartmentalization of learning-related plasticity may act to increase the computational power of pyramidal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Fortuitous discovery of primary peritoneal psammocarcinoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Psammocarcinoma is an uncommon subtype of low-grade serous carcinoma. It is characterized by the presence of extensive psammoma bodies and can have either an ovarian or peritoneal origin. To our knowledge fewer than 30 cases of primary peritoneal psammocarcinoma (PPP) have been reported in the English literature. We report a rare case of  PPP in a 74-year-old female, discovered fortuitously within a laparotomy for gallbladder lithiasis. At laparotomy, multiple nodular implants involving the omentum, the peritoneum and a magma of intestinal loops in the right iliac fossa were noted. A biopsy from nodules was performed. Gross examination showed multiple nodules of different sizes in the fat tissue. Pathologic examination showed massive psammoma bodies representing more than 75% of the tumor. The final diagnosis was psammocarcinoma. Our patient was referred to the gynecologic department for further investigation and to ascertain whether the tumor arose from the ovaries or peritoneum. Hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy and omentectomy were performed. Macroscopic examination showed that both ovaries were intact having a normal size. No invasion of ovarian stroma was shown in microscopic examination. The patient died of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) six days after the surgery. PPP is a rare type of  low-grade serous carcinoma. The behavior of this tumor is unclear, and the treatment is not standardized because of its rarity and lack of long-term follow-up. More cases need to be studied for better understanding and improvement of the management protocols.

                Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a benign but rare central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm of the choroid plexus. The onset of symptoms is usually in the first decade and may occur at birth (i.e., congenital). It accounts for 0.4–0.6% of all brain tumors. Usually seen in patients who are young children. The object of this clinical case to highlight early surgical intervention, intensive and multidisciplinary care, and pharmaceutical prescriptions can enhance the patient's condition and quality of life. We herein report a rare presentation of CPP in a 6-year-old Sudanese female child with seizures. Who suffered from obstructive hydrocephalus with lateral ventricular choroid plexus papilloma. The patient underwent resection at the age of 6 months in our center's neurosurgery department. Intensive and multidisciplinary follow-up managed to maintain positive outcome and better quality of life in a relatively benign neoplasm. In spite of a wide range of therapeutic options for the management of CPP described in the literature, studies demonstrated that patients with CPP alone and underwent a surgical procedure can live independently as adults and work full-time with uncommon recurrences.

                Genome biology shows substantial progress in its analytical and computational part in the last decades. Differential gene expression is one of many computationally intense areas; it is largely developed under R programming language. Here we explain possible reasons for such dominance of R in gene expression data. Next, we discuss the prospects for Python to become competitive in this area of research in coming years. We indicate that Python can be used already in a field of a single cell differential gene expression. We pinpoint still missing parts in Python and possibilities for improvement.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying control ensembles for information processing within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Catalina Vich, Matthew Clapp, Jonathan E. Rubin, Timothy Verstynen</p>

In situations featuring uncertainty about action-reward contingencies, mammals can flexibly adopt strategies for decision-making that are tuned in response to environmental changes. Although the cortico-basal ganglia thalamic (CBGT) network has been identified as contributing to the decision-making process, it features a complex synaptic architecture, comprised of multiple feed-forward, reciprocal, and feedback pathways, that complicate efforts to elucidate the roles of specific CBGT populations in the process by which evidence is accumulated and influences behavior. In this paper we apply a strategic sampling approach, based on Latin hypercube sampling, to explore how variations in CBGT network properties, including subpopulation firing rates and synaptic weights, map to variability of parameters in a normative drift diffusion model (DDM), representing algorithmic aspects of information processing during decision-making. Through the application of canonical correlation analysis, we find that this relationship can be characterized in terms of three low-dimensional control ensembles within the CBGT network that impact specific qualities of the emergent decision policy: responsiveness (a measure of how quickly evidence evaluation gets underway, associated with overall activity in corticothalamic and direct pathways), pliancy (a measure of the standard of evidence needed to commit to a decision, associated largely with overall activity in components of the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia), and choice (a measure of commitment toward one available option, associated with differences in direct and indirect pathways across action channels). These analyses provide mechanistic predictions about the roles of specific CBGT network elements in tuning the way that information is accumulated and translated into decision-related behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpretable pairwise distillations for generative protein sequence models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoph Feinauer, Barthelemy Meynard-Piganeau, Carlo Lucibello</p>

Many different types of generative models for protein sequences have been proposed in literature. Their uses include the prediction of mutational effects, protein design and the prediction of structural properties. Neural network (NN) architectures have shown great performances, commonly attributed to the capacity to extract non-trivial higher-order interactions from the data. In this work, we analyze two different NN models and assess how close they are to simple pairwise distributions, which have been used in the past for similar problems. We present an approach for extracting pairwise models from more complex ones using an energy-based modeling framework. We show that for the tested models the extracted pairwise models can replicate the energies of the original models and are also close in performance in tasks like mutational effect prediction. In addition, we show that even simpler, factorized models often come close in performance to the original models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Image-based parameter inference for epithelial mechanics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Goshi Ogita, Takefumi Kondo, Keisuke Ikawa, Tadashi Uemura, Shuji Ishihara, Kaoru Sugimura</p>

Measuring mechanical parameters in tissues, such as the elastic modulus of cell-cell junctions, is essential to decipher the mechanical control of morphogenesis. However, their <i>in vivo</i> measurement is technically challenging. Here, we formulated an image-based statistical approach to estimate the mechanical parameters of epithelial cells. Candidate mechanical models are constructed based on force-cell shape correlations obtained from image data. Substitution of the model functions into force-balance equations at the cell vertex leads to an equation with respect to the parameters of the model, by which one can estimate the parameter values using a least-squares method. A test using synthetic data confirmed the accuracy of parameter estimation and model selection. By applying this method to <i>Drosophila</i> epithelial tissues, we found that the magnitude and orientation of feedback between the junction tension and shrinkage, which are determined by the spring constant of the junction, were correlated with the elevation of tension and myosin-II on shrinking junctions during cell rearrangement. Further, this method clarified how alterations in tissue polarity and stretching affect the anisotropy in tension parameters. Thus, our method provides a novel approach to uncovering the mechanisms governing epithelial morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epidemic management and control through risk-dependent individual contact interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tapio Schneider, Oliver R. A. Dunbar, Jinlong Wu, Lucas Böttcher, Dmitry Burov, Alfredo Garbuno-Inigo, Gregory L. Wagner, Sen Pei, Chiara Daraio, Raffaele Ferrari, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Testing, contact tracing, and isolation (TTI) is an epidemic management and control approach that is difficult to implement at scale because it relies on manual tracing of contacts. Exposure notification apps have been developed to digitally scale up TTI by harnessing contact data obtained from mobile devices; however, exposure notification apps provide users only with limited binary information when they have been directly exposed to a known infection source. Here we demonstrate a scalable improvement to TTI and exposure notification apps that uses data assimilation (DA) on a contact network. Network DA exploits diverse sources of health data together with the proximity data from mobile devices that exposure notification apps rely upon. It provides users with continuously assessed individual risks of exposure and infection, which can form the basis for targeting individual contact interventions. Simulations of the early COVID-19 epidemic in New York City are used to establish proof-of-concept. In the simulations, network DA identifies up to a factor 2 more infections than contact tracing when both harness the same contact data and diagnostic test data. This remains true even when only a relatively small fraction of the population uses network DA. When a sufficiently large fraction of the population (≳ 75%) uses network DA and complies with individual contact interventions, targeting contact interventions with network DA reduces deaths by up to a factor 4 relative to TTI. Network DA can be implemented by expanding the computational backend of existing exposure notification apps, thus greatly enhancing their capabilities. Implemented at scale, it has the potential to precisely and effectively control future epidemics while minimizing economic disruption.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">LaDIVA: A neurocomputational model providing laryngeal motor control for speech acquisition and production</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hasini R. Weerathunge, Gabriel A. Alzamendi, Gabriel J. Cler, Frank H. Guenther, Cara E. Stepp, Matías Zañartu</p>

Many voice disorders are the result of intricate neural and/or biomechanical impairments that are poorly understood. The limited knowledge of their etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms hampers effective clinical management. Behavioral studies have been used concurrently with computational models to better understand typical and pathological laryngeal motor control. Thus far, however, a unified computational framework that quantitatively integrates physiologically relevant models of phonation with the neural control of speech has not been developed. Here, we introduce <i>LaDIVA</i>, a novel neurocomputational model with physiologically based laryngeal motor control. We combined the DIVA model (an established neural network model of speech motor control) with the extended body-cover model (a physics-based vocal fold model). The resulting integrated model, LaDIVA, was validated by comparing its model simulations with behavioral responses to perturbations of auditory vocal fundamental frequency (<i>f</i><sub>o</sub>) feedback in adults with typical speech. LaDIVA demonstrated capability to simulate different modes of laryngeal motor control, ranging from short-term (i.e., <i>reflexive</i>) and long-term (i.e., <i>adaptive</i>) auditory feedback paradigms, to generating prosodic contours in speech. Simulations showed that LaDIVA’s laryngeal motor control displays properties of motor equivalence, i.e., LaDIVA could robustly generate compensatory responses to reflexive vocal <i>f</i><sub>o</sub> perturbations with varying initial laryngeal muscle activation levels leading to the same output. The model can also generate prosodic contours for studying laryngeal motor control in running speech. LaDIVA can expand the understanding of the physiology of human phonation to enable, for the first time, the investigation of causal effects of neural motor control in the fine structure of the vocal signal.

Communication is a fundamental part of scientific development and methodology. With the advancement of the internet and social networks, communication has become rapid and sometimes overwhelming, especially in science. It is important to provide scientists with useful, effective, and dynamic tools to establish and build a fluid communication framework that allows for scientific advancement. Therefore, in this article, we present advice and recommendations that can help promote and improve science communication while respecting an adequate balance in the degree of commitment toward collaborative work. We have developed 10 rules shown in increasing order of commitment that are grouped into 3 key categories: (1) speak (based on active participation); (2) join (based on joining scientific groups); and (3) assess (based on the analysis and retrospective consideration of the weaknesses and strengths). We include examples and resources that provide actionable strategies for involvement and engagement with science communication, from basic steps to more advanced, introspective, and long-term commitments. Overall, we aim to help spread science from within and encourage and engage scientists to become involved in science communication effectively and dynamically.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling cortical synaptic effects of anesthesia and their cholinergic reversal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bolaji P. Eniwaye, Victoria Booth, Anthony G. Hudetz, Michal Zochowski</p>

General anesthetics work through a variety of molecular mechanisms while resulting in the common end point of sedation and loss of consciousness. Generally, the administration of common anesthetics induces reduction in synaptic excitation while promoting synaptic inhibition. Exogenous modulation of the anesthetics’ synaptic effects can help determine the neuronal pathways involved in anesthesia. For example, both animal and human studies have shown that exogenously induced increases in acetylcholine in the brain can elicit wakeful-like behavior despite the continued presence of the anesthetic. However, the underlying mechanisms of anesthesia reversal at the cellular level have not been investigated. Here we apply a computational model of a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to simulate the network-wide effects of anesthesia, due to changes in synaptic inhibition and excitation, and their reversal by cholinergic activation through muscarinic receptors. We use a differential evolution algorithm to fit model parameters to match measures of spiking activity, neuronal connectivity, and network dynamics recorded in the visual cortex of rodents during anesthesia with desflurane <i>in vivo</i>. We find that facilitating muscarinic receptor effects of acetylcholine on top of anesthetic-induced synaptic changes predicts the reversal of anesthetic suppression of neurons’ spiking activity, functional connectivity, as well as pairwise and population interactions. Thus, our model predicts a specific neuronal mechanism for the cholinergic reversal of anesthesia consistent with experimental behavioral observations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The population genetics of the causative agent of snake fungal disease indicate recent introductions to the USA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason T. Ladner, Jonathan M. Palmer, Cassandra L. Ettinger, Jason E. Stajich, Terence M. Farrell, Brad M. Glorioso, Becki Lawson, Steven J. Price, Anne G. Stengle, Daniel A. Grear, Jeffrey M. Lorch</p>

Snake fungal disease (SFD; ophidiomycosis), caused by the pathogen <i>Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola</i> (<i>Oo</i>), has been documented in wild snakes in North America and Eurasia, and is considered an emerging disease in the eastern United States of America. However, a lack of historical disease data has made it challenging to determine whether <i>Oo</i> is a recent arrival to the USA or whether SFD emergence is due to other factors. Here, we examined the genomes of 82 <i>Oo</i> strains to determine the pathogen’s history in the eastern USA. <i>Oo</i> strains from the USA formed a clade (Clade II) distinct from European strains (Clade I), and molecular dating indicated that these clades diverged too recently (approximately 2,000 years ago) for transcontinental dispersal of <i>Oo</i> to have occurred via natural snake movements across Beringia. A lack of nonrecombinant intermediates between clonal lineages in Clade II indicates that <i>Oo</i> has actually been introduced multiple times to North America from an unsampled source population, and molecular dating indicates that several of these introductions occurred within the last few hundred years. Molecular dating also indicated that the most common Clade II clonal lineages have expanded recently in the USA, with time of most recent common ancestor mean estimates ranging from 1985 to 2007 CE. The presence of Clade II in captive snakes worldwide demonstrates a potential mechanism of introduction and highlights that additional incursions are likely unless action is taken to reduce the risk of pathogen translocation and spillover into wild snake populations.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Debate continues regarding the possible role of the hippocampus across short-term and working memory tasks. The current study examined the possibility of a hippocampal contribution to precise, high-resolution cognition and conjunctive memory. We administered visual working memory tasks featuring a continuous response component to a well-established developmental amnesic patient with relatively selective bilateral hippocampal damage (Jon) and healthy controls. The patient was able to produce highly accurate response judgments regarding conjunctions of color and orientation or color and location, using simultaneous or sequential presentation of stimuli, with no evidence of any impairment in working memory binding, categorical accuracy, or continuous precision. These findings indicate that hippocampal damage does not necessarily lead to deficits in high-resolution cognitive performance, even when the damage is severe and bilateral.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current views of community and hospital pharmacists on pharmaceutical care services in the United Arab Emirates: A mixed methodological study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The profession of pharmacy has evolved significantly in recent years in terms of professional service delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the current views of pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on pharmaceutical care services and the nature of barriers encountered in practice using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among hospital and community pharmacists (n = 305) between March and May 2021, using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. In the qualitative phase, 15 interviews were conducted to explore five main criteria: patient information, inadequate patient counseling, prescribing errors prevention and identifying drug-related problems, lack of participation in health awareness programs, and barriers to pharmaceutical care implementation. In the quantitative phase, 305 consenting pharmacists completed a questionnaire on seven criteria: demographic profile, pharmacist-physician interaction, patient counseling assessment, patient reports of adverse drug events, pharmacist participation in health awareness programs, perceptions of reducing prescribing errors and identifying drug-related problems, and barriers to appropriate pharmaceutical care implementation. Results: The results of both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study revealed that pharmacists' influence on practice in the UAE is limited due to many factors, mainly lack of time and patients' ignorance of the pharmacist's role in the medical field. The mean responses regarding pharmacists' approach to patient counseling and patients' knowledge of pharmacists' role in managing adverse drug reactions were 77.1% and 59.7%, respectively. Active participation in health awareness programs was 64.8%. The mean positive response of participants in reducing prescribing errors and recognizing drug-related problems was 9.2%. Pharmacists' age and number of years in practice were the most important factors influencing the pharmaceutical care services implementation. Conclusion: The study has shown the need to shed light on the proper implementation of pharmaceutical care while maintaining a trusting relationship with physicians.

                The position weight matrix, also called the position-specific scoring matrix, is the commonly accepted model to quantify the specificity of transcription factor binding to DNA. Position weight matrices are used in thousands of projects and software tools in regulatory genomics, including computational prediction of the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide variants. Yet, recently Yan et al. reported that "the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power" if applied to the analysis of regulatory variants studied with a newly developed experimental method, SNP-SELEX. Here, we re-analyze the rich experimental dataset obtained by Yan et al. and show that appropriately selected position weight matrices in fact can adequately quantify transcription factor binding to alternative alleles.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Associations of vascular risk and amyloid burden with subsequent dementia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Midlife vascular risk factors (MVRF) are associated with incident dementia, as are amyloid β(Aβ) deposition and neurodegeneration. Whether vascular and Alzheimer Disease (AD)-associated factors contribute to dementia independently or interact synergistically to reduce cognition is poorly understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET study were followed from 1987-89(45-64 yo) through 2016-17(74-94 yo), with repeat cognitive assessment and dementia adjudication. In 2011-13, dementia-free participants underwent brain MRI (with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and brain volume measurement) and florbetapir (Aβ) PET. The relative contributions of vascular risk and injury (MVRF, WMH volume), elevated Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and neurodegeneration (smaller temporo-parietal brain regions) to incident dementia were evaluated with adjusted Cox models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 298 individuals, 36 developed dementia (median follow-up 4.9 years). Midlife hypertension and Aβ each independently predicted dementia risk (hypertension:HR 2.57 (95% CI 1.16-5.67); Aβ SUVR(per SD):HR 2.57 (1.72-3.84)), but didn’t interact significantly, whereas <i>late-life</i> diabetes (HR 2.50 (1.18 to 5.28)) and Aβ independently predicted dementia risk. WMH(per SD):HR 1.51 (1.03-2.20) and Aβ SUVR (HR 2.52 (1.83-3.47)) independently contributed to incident dementia but WMH lost significance when MVRF were included. Smaller temporo-parietal brain regions were associated with incident dementia, independent of Aβ and MVRF (HR 2.18 (1.18-4.01)).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Midlife hypertension and late-life Aβ are independently associated with dementia risk, without evidence for synergy on a multiplicative scale. Given the independent contributions of vascular and amyloid mechanisms, multiple pathways should be considered when evaluating interventions to reduce the burden of dementia.</p>

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 23 June 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01096-4">doi:10.1038/s41593-022-01096-4</a></p>We report light-gated channels in a fungus-like protist that are highly selective for K+ over Na+. These microbial rhodopsin channels, named kalium channelrhodopsins, enable robust inhibition of mouse cortical neurons with millisecond precision. In addition, kalium channelrhodopsins reveal a previously unknown potassium selectivity mechanism.

                Homeostatic and circadian processes collaborate to appropriately time and consolidate sleep and wake. To understand how these processes are integrated, we scheduled brief sleep deprivation at different times of day in <i>Drosophila</i> and find elevated morning rebound compared to evening. These effects depend on discrete morning and evening clock neurons, independent of their roles in circadian locomotor activity. In the R5 ellipsoid body sleep homeostat, we identified elevated morning expression of activity dependent and presynaptic gene expression as well as the presynaptic protein BRUCHPILOT consistent with regulation by clock circuits. These neurons also display elevated calcium levels in response to sleep loss in the morning, but not the evening consistent with the observed time-dependent sleep rebound. These studies reveal the circuit and molecular mechanisms by which discrete circadian clock neurons program a homeostatic sleep center.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrating multi-omics data reveals function and therapeutic potential of deubiquitinating enzymes</a></h4>

              
                Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), ~100 of which are found in human cells, are proteases that remove ubiquitin conjugates from proteins, thereby regulating protein turnover. They are involved in a wide range of cellular activities and are emerging therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. Drugs targeting USP1 and USP30 are in clinical development for cancer and kidney disease respectively. However, the majority of substrates and pathways regulated by DUBs remain unknown, impeding efforts to prioritize specific enzymes for research and drug development. To assemble a knowledgebase of DUB activities, co-dependent genes, and substrates, we combined targeted experiments using CRISPR libraries and inhibitors with systematic mining of functional genomic databases. Analysis of the Dependency Map, Connectivity Map, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and multiple protein-protein interaction databases yielded specific hypotheses about DUB function, a subset of which were confirmed in follow-on experiments. The data in this paper are browsable online in a newly developed <a href="https://labsyspharm.github.io/dubportal/">DUB Portal</a> and promise to improve understanding of DUBs as a family as well as the activities of incompletely characterized DUBs (e.g. USPL1 and USP32) and those already targeted with investigational cancer therapeutics (e.g. USP14, UCHL5, and USP7).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recurrent neural networks enable design of multifunctional synthetic human gut microbiome dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Predicting the dynamics and functions of microbiomes constructed from the bottom-up is a key challenge in exploiting them to our benefit. Current models based on ecological theory fail to capture complex community behaviors due to higher order interactions, do not scale well with increasing complexity and in considering multiple functions. We develop and apply a long short-term memory (LSTM) framework to advance our understanding of community assembly and health-relevant metabolite production using a synthetic human gut community. A mainstay of recurrent neural networks, the LSTM learns a high dimensional data-driven non-linear dynamical system model. We show that the LSTM model can outperform the widely used generalized Lotka-Volterra model based on ecological theory. We build methods to decipher microbe-microbe and microbe-metabolite interactions from an otherwise black-box model. These methods highlight that Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are significant drivers of metabolite production whereas <i>Bacteroides</i> shape community dynamics. We use the LSTM model to navigate a large multidimensional functional landscape to design communities with unique health-relevant metabolite profiles and temporal behaviors. In sum, the accuracy of the LSTM model can be exploited for experimental planning and to guide the design of synthetic microbiomes with target dynamic functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Filamentation modulates allosteric regulation of PRPS</a></h4>

              
                Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, histidine, tryptophan, and cofactors NAD and NADP. Abnormal regulation of PRPP synthase (PRPS) is associated with human disorders, including Arts syndrome, retinal dystrophy and gouty arthritis. Recent studies have demonstrated that PRPS can form filamentous cytoophidia in eukaryotes. Here we show that PRPS forms cytoophidia in prokaryotes both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we solve two distinct filament structures of <i>E. coli</i> PRPS at near-atomic resolution under Cryo-EM. The formation of the two types of filaments is controlled by the binding of different ligands. One filament type is resistant to allosteric inhibition. The structural comparison reveals conformational changes of a regulatory flexible loop, which may regulate the binding of the allosteric inhibitor and the substrate ATP. A noncanonical allosteric AMP/ADP binding site is identified to stabilize the conformation of the regulatory flexible loop. Our findings not only explore a new mechanism of PRPS regulation with structural basis, but also propose an additional layer of cell metabolism through PRPS filamentation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Host Chitinase 3-like-1 is a universal therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 viral variants in COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 is the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2; SC2) which has caused a world-wide pandemic with striking morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of SC2 strains demonstrated impressive genetic variability and many of these viral variants are now defined as variants of concern (VOC) that cause enhanced transmissibility, decreased susceptibility to antibody neutralization or therapeutics and or the ability to induce severe disease. Currently, the delta (d) and omicron (o) variants are particularly problematic based on their impressive and unprecedented transmissibility and ability to cause break through infections. The delta variant also accumulates at high concentrations in host tissues and has caused waves of lethal disease. Because studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) stimulates ACE2 and Spike (S) priming proteases that mediate SC2 infection, studies were undertaken to determine if interventions that target CHI3L1 are effective inhibitors of SC2 viral variant infection. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 augments epithelial cell infection by pseudoviruses that express the alpha, beta, gamma, delta or omicron S proteins and that the CHI3L1 inhibitors anti-CHI3L1 and kasugamycin inhibit epithelial cell infection by these VOC pseudovirus moieties. Thus, CHI3L1 is a universal, VOC-independent therapeutic target in COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The orphan ligand, activin C, signals through activin receptor-like kinase 7</a></h4>

              
                Activin ligands are formed from two disulfide-linked inhibin β (Inhβ) subunit chains. They exist as homodimeric proteins, as in the case of activin A (ActA; InhβA/InhβA) or activin C (ActC; InhβC/InhβC), or as heterodimers, as with activin AC (ActAC; InhβA:InhβC). While the biological functions of ActA and activin B (ActB) have been well characterized, little is known about the biological functions of ActC or ActAC. One thought is that the InhβC chain functions to interfere with ActA production by forming less active ActAC heterodimers. Here, we assessed and characterized the signaling capacity of ligands containing the InhβC chain. ActC and ActAC activated SMAD2/3-dependent signaling via the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7). Relative to ActA and ActB, ActC exhibited lower affinity for the cognate activin type II receptors and was resistant to neutralization by the extracellular antagonist, follistatin. In mature murine adipocytes, which exhibit high ALK7 expression, ActC elicited a SMAD2/3 response similar to ActB, which can also signal via ALK7. Collectively, these results establish that ActC and ActAC are active ligands that exhibit a distinct signaling receptor and antagonist profile compared to other activins.

                Auxin-inducible degrons are a chemical genetic tool for targeted protein degradation and are widely used to study protein function in cultured mammalian cells. Here we develop CRISPR-engineered mouse lines that enable rapid and highly specific degradation of tagged endogenous proteins <i>in vivo</i>. Most but not all cell types are competent for degradation. By combining ligand titrations with genetic crosses to generate animals with different allelic combinations, we show that degradation kinetics depend upon the dose of the tagged protein, ligand, and the E3 ligase substrate receptor TIR1. Rapid degradation of condensin I and condensin II - two essential regulators of mitotic chromosome structure - revealed that both complexes are individually required for cell division in precursor lymphocytes, but not in their differentiated peripheral lymphocyte derivatives. This generalisable approach provides unprecedented temporal control over the dose of endogenous proteins in mouse models, with implications for studying essential biological pathways and modelling drug activity in mammalian tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cognitive experience alters cortical involvement in goal-directed navigation</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the mammalian cortex has been studied extensively during decision tasks, and recent work aims to identify under what conditions cortex is actually necessary for these tasks. We discovered that mice with distinct cognitive experiences, beyond sensory and motor learning, use different cortical areas and neural activity patterns to solve the same navigation decision task, revealing past learning as a critical determinant of whether cortex is necessary for goal-directed navigation. We used optogenetics and calcium imaging to study the necessity and neural activity of multiple cortical areas in mice with different training histories. Posterior parietal cortex and retrosplenial cortex were mostly dispensable for accurate performance of a simple navigation task. In contrast, these areas were essential for the same simple task when mice were previously trained on complex tasks with delay periods or association switches. Multi-area calcium imaging showed that, in mice with complex-task experience, single-neuron activity had higher selectivity and neuron-neuron correlations were weaker, leading to codes with higher task information. Therefore, past experience is a key factor in determining whether cortical areas have a causal role in goal-directed navigation.

                The distribution of brain aerobic glycolysis (AG) in normal young adults correlates spatially with amyloid-beta deposition in individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and asymptomatic individuals with brain amyloid deposition. Brain AG decreases with age but the functional significance of this decrease with regard to the development of DAT symptomatology is poorly understood. Using PET measurements of regional blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose utilization, from which we derive AG, we find that cognitive impairment is strongly associated with loss of the typical youthful pattern of AG. In contrast, amyloid positivity without cognitive impairment was associated with preservation of youthful brain AG, which was even higher than that seen in typical, cognitively unimpaired, amyloid negative adults. Similar findings were not seen for blood flow nor oxygen consumption. Finally, in cognitively unimpaired adults, white matter hyperintensity burden was found to be specifically associated with decreased youthful brain AG. Our results implicate preserved AG as a factor in brain resilience to amyloid pathology and suggest that white matter disease may be a cause and/or consequence of this impaired resilience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of conscious movement processing on the neuromuscular control of posture</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining balance typically occurs sub-consciously. Occasionally, however, individuals will direct conscious attention towards balance, e.g., in response to a postural threat. Such conscious movement processing (CMP) increases the reliance on attentional resources and may disrupt control of balance, but the underlying changes in neuromuscular control remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of CMP (manipulated using verbal instructions) on neural control of posture in twenty-five adults (11 females, mean age = 23.9, range = 18-33). Participants performed 90-second, narrow-stance balance trials in high- and low-CMP conditions, and in stable (solid surface) and unstable (foam) task conditions. Postural sway amplitude, frequency and complexity were used to assess postural control. Surface EMG was recorded bilaterally from lower leg muscles (Soleus, Tibialis Anterior, Gastrocnemius Medialis, Peroneus Longus) and intermuscular coherence (IMC) was assessed for 12 muscle pairs across four frequency bands. We found significantly increased sway amplitude, and decreased sway frequency and complexity in the high- compared to the low-CMP condition. All sway variables (frequency, amplitude and complexity) increased in the unstable compared to the stable condition. Results suggested reduced beta band IMC between several muscles pairs during high- compared to low-CMP, but these findings did not remain significant after controlling for multiple comparisons. Finally, IMC significantly increased in the unstable conditions for most muscle combinations and frequency bands. In all, results tentatively suggest that CMP-induced changes in sway outcomes may be underpinned by reduced beta-band IMC, but these findings need to be replicated before they can be interpreted more conclusively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Why is human vision so poor in early development? The impact of initial sensitivity to low spatial frequencies on visual category learning</a></h4>

              
                Humans are born with very low contrast sensitivity, meaning that developing infants experience the world "in a blur". Is this solely a byproduct of maturational processes or is there some functional advantage for beginning life with poor vision? We explore whether reduced visual acuity as a consequence of low contrast sensitivity facilitates the acquisition of basic-level visual categories and, if so, whether this advantage also enhances subordinate-level category learning as visual acuity improves. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the ecoset dataset to simulate basic-level category learning, we manipulated model training curricula along three dimensions: presence of blurred inputs early in training, rate of blur removal over time, and grayscale versus color inputs. We found that a training regimen where blur starts high and is gradually reduced over time - as in human development - improves basic-level categorization performance relative to a regimen in which non-blurred inputs are used throughout. However, this pattern was observed only when grayscale images were used (analogous to the low sensitivity to color infants experience during early development). Importantly, the observed improvements in basic-level performance generalized to subordinate-level categorization as well: when models were fine-tuned on a dataset including subordinate-level categories (ImageNet), we found that models initially trained with blurred inputs showed a greater performance benefit than models trained solely on non-blurred inputs. Consistent with several other recent studies, we conclude that poor visual acuity in human newborns confers multiple advantages, including, as demonstrated here, more rapid and accurate acquisition of visual object categories at multiple hierarchical levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Navigation task and action space drive the emergence of egocentric and allocentric spatial representations</a></h4>

              
                In general, strategies for spatial navigation could employ one of two spatial reference frames: egocentric or allocentric. Notwithstanding intuitive explanations, it remains unclear however under what circumstances one strategy is chosen over another, and how neural representations should be related to the chosen strategy. Here, we first use a deep reinforcement learning model to investigate whether a particular type of navigation strategy arises spontaneously during spatial learning without imposing a bias onto the model. We then examine the spatial representations that emerge in the network to support navigation. To this end, we study two tasks that are ethologically valid for mammals - guidance, where the agent has to navigate to a goal location fixed in allocentric space, and aiming, where the agent navigates to a visible cue. We find that when both navigation strategies are available to the agent, the solutions it develops for guidance and aiming are heavily biased towards the allocentric or the egocentric strategy, respectively, as one might expect. Nevertheless, the agent can learn both tasks using either type of strategy. Furthermore, we find that place-cell-like allocentric representations emerge preferentially in guidance when using an allocentric strategy, whereas egocentric vector representations emerge when using an egocentric strategy in aiming. We thus find that alongside the type of navigational strategy, the nature of the task plays a pivotal role in the type of spatial representations that emerge.

	<p>&amp;amp;Delta;9-Tetrahydrocannabinol is the main psychoactive component of cannabis and cannabidiol is purportedly responsible for many of the medicinal benefits. The effects of &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol in younger populations have been well studied; however, motor function, cognitive function, and cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults have not been extensively researched. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in cognitive function, motor function, and cerebral glucose metabolism (assessed via [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) in older adults chronically using &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and non-using controls. Eight &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users (59.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.7 years), five cannabidiol users (54.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.1 years), and 16 non-users (58.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.9 years) participated. Subjects underwent resting scans and performed cognitive testing (reaction time, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test), motor testing (hand/arm function, gait), and balance testing. &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users performed worse than both cannabidiol users and non-users on the Flanker Test but were similar on all other cognitive and motor tasks. &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users also had lower global metabolism and relative hypermetabolism in the bilateral amygdala, cerebellum, and brainstem. Chronic use of &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol in older adults might negatively influence inhibitory control and alter brain activity. Future longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes investigating multiple &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol ratios on functional outcomes and cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults are necessary.</p>

	<p>Silent speech decoding (SSD), based on articulatory neuromuscular activities, has become a prevalent task of brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) in recent years. Many works have been devoted to decoding surface electromyography (sEMG) from articulatory neuromuscular activities. However, restoring silent speech in tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese is still difficult. This paper proposes an optimized sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) approach to synthesize voice from the sEMG-based silent speech. We extract duration information to regulate the sEMG-based silent speech using the audio length. Then, we provide a deep-learning model with an encoder&amp;amp;ndash;decoder structure and a state-of-the-art vocoder to generate the audio waveform. Experiments based on six Mandarin Chinese speakers demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully decode silent speech in Mandarin Chinese and achieve a character error rate (CER) of 6.41% on average with human evaluation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>As Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD) progresses, there is a significant loss of neurons in the striatum in addition to a distinct thinning of the cerebral cortex. Despite an early presence of sensorimotor deficits in patients with HD, electrophysiological studies designed to assess the integrity of thalamocortical circuits are sparse. Using the R6/2 mouse model of HD, we provide evidence of reduced connectivity between thalamic cells and their targeted cortical regions. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from ventral anterolateral nucleus (VAL; motor) and ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM; somatosensory) thalamic neurons in <I>ex vivo</I> brain slices of R6/2 and wild-type (WT) mice revealed that cells in both thalamic nuclei of R6/2 mice exhibited significant differences in passive and active cell membrane properties (smaller cell membrane capacitances, faster decay time constants and increased input resistances) compared with WT cells. Although only cells in the VPM of symptomatic R6/2 mice had more depolarized resting membrane potentials compared with WTs, cells in both nuclei displayed increased excitability in symptomatic, but not presymptomatic, R6/2 mice. Optical activation of VAL and VPM terminals elicited smaller magnitude current responses in cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) in both motor cortex (M1CTX) and somatosensory barrel cortex (BCTX) of symptomatic R6/2 mice compared with CPNs in WT mice. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the frequency of thalamocortical excitatory quantal events in R6/2 BCTX CPNs, with no genotype-dependent differences in AMPA:NMDA response amplitude ratios. These data suggest there is a decrease in the transmission of thalamocortical information that is likely because of impaired neurotransmitter release.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Attention Cueing in Rivalry: Insights from Pupillometry</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>We used pupillometry to evaluate the effects of attention cueing on perceptual bi-stability, as reported by adult human observers. Perceptual alternations and pupil diameter were measured during two forms of rivalry, generated by presenting a white and a black disk to the two eyes (binocular rivalry) or splitting the disks between eyes (interocular grouping rivalry). In line with previous studies, we found that subtle pupil size modulations (~0.05 mm) tracked alternations between exclusive dominance phases of the black or white disk. These pupil responses were larger for perceptually stronger stimuli: presented to the dominant eye or with physically higher luminance contrast. However, cueing of endogenous attention to one of the rivaling percepts did not affect pupil modulations during exclusive dominance phases. This was observed despite the reliable effects of endogenous attention on perceptual dominance, which shifted in favor of the cued percept by ~10%. The results were comparable for binocular and interocular grouping rivalry. Cueing only had a marginal modulatory effect on pupil size during mixed percepts in binocular rivalry. This may suggest that, rather than acting by modulating perceptual strength, endogenous attention primarily acts during periods of unresolved competition, which is compatible with attention being automatically directed to the rivaling stimuli during periods of exclusive dominance and thereby sustaining perceptual alternations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglial Tmem59 Deficiency Impairs Phagocytosis of Synapse and Leads to Autism-Like Behaviors in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptic abnormality is an important pathologic feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and responsible for various behavioral defects in these neurodevelopmental disorders. Microglia are the major immune cells in the brain and also play an important role in synapse refinement. Although dysregulated synaptic pruning by microglia during the brain development has been associated with ASDs, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we observed that expression of Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59), a protein recently shown to regulate microglial function, was decreased in autistic patients. Furthermore, we found that both male and female mice with either complete or microglia-specific loss of <I>Tmem59</I> developed ASD-like behaviors. Microglial TMEM59-deficient mice also exhibited enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission, increased dendritic spine density, and elevated levels of excitatory synaptic proteins in synaptosomes. TMEM59-deficient microglia had impaired capacity for synapse engulfment both <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro.</I> Moreover, we demonstrated that TMEM59 interacted with the C1q receptor CD93 and TMEM59 deficiency promoted CD93 protein degradation in microglia. Downregulation of CD93 in microglia also impaired synapse engulfment. These findings identify a crucial role of TMEM59 in modulating microglial function on synapse refinement during brain development and suggest that TMEM59 deficiency may contribute to ASDs through disrupting phagocytosis of excitatory synapse and thus distorting the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) neuronal activity balance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia play an important role in synapse refinement. Dysregulated synaptic pruning by microglia during brain development has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we observe that the expression of Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59), an autophagy-related protein, is decreased in autistic patients. Moreover, we find ASD-like behaviors in mice with complete loss and with microglia-specific loss of <I>Tmem59</I>. Mechanistic studies reveal that TMEM59 deficiency in microglia impairs their synapse engulfment ability likely through destabilizing the C1q receptor CD93, thereby leading to enhanced excitatory neurotransmission and increased dendritic spine density. Our findings demonstrate a crucial role of microglial TMEM59 in early neuronal development and provide new insight into the etiology of ASDs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Role of Voltage-Gated K+ Channels and K2P Channels in Intrinsic Electrophysiological Properties and Saltatory Conduction at Nodes of Ranvier of Rat Lumbar Spinal Ventral Nerves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ion channels at the nodes of Ranvier (NRs) are believed to play essential roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction of action potentials (AP) at the NRs of myelinated nerves. While we have recently shown that two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels play a key role at the NRs of A&beta;-afferent nerves, K<sup>+</sup> channels and their functions at the NRs of mammalian motor nerves remain elusive. Here we addressed this issue by using <I>ex vivo</I> preparations of lumbar spinal ventral nerves from both male and female rats and the pressure-patch-clamp recordings at their NRs. We found that depolarizing voltages evoked large noninactivating outward currents at NRs. The outward currents could be partially inhibited by voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, largely inhibited by K2P blockers and cooling temperatures. Inhibition of the outward currents by voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, K2P blockers, or cooling temperatures significantly altered electrophysiological properties measured at the NRs, including resting membrane potential, input resistance, AP width, AP amplitude, AP threshold, and AP rheobase. Furthermore, K2P blockers and cooling temperatures significantly reduced saltatory conduction velocity and success rates of APs in response to high-frequency stimulation. Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers reduced AP success rates at high-frequency stimulation without significantly affecting saltatory conduction velocity. Collectively, both K2P and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels play significant roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of motor nerve fibers of rats. The effects of cooling temperatures on saltatory conduction are at least partially mediated by K2P channels at the NRs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ion channels localized at the NRs are believed to be key determinants of saltatory conduction on myelinated nerves. However, ion channels and their functions at the NRs have not been fully studied in different types of mammalian myelinated nerves. Here we use the pressure-patch-clamp recordings to show that both K2P and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels play significant roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of lumbar spinal ventral nerves of rats. Furthermore, cooling temperatures exert effects on saltatory conduction via inhibition of ion channels at the NRs. Our results provide new insights into saltatory conduction on myelinated nerves and may have physiological as well as pathologic implications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Understanding the Influence of Target Acquisition on Survival, Integration, and Phenotypic Maturation of Dopamine Neurons within Stem Cell-Derived Neural Grafts in a Parkinson's Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons include many subtypes characterized by their location, connectivity and function. Surprisingly, mechanisms underpinning the specification of A9 neurons [responsible for motor function, including within ventral midbrain (VM) grafts for treating Parkinson's disease (PD)] over adjacent A10, remains largely speculated. We assessed the impact of synaptic targeting on survival, integration, and phenotype acquisition of dopaminergic neurons within VM grafts generated from fetal tissue or human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). VM progenitors were grafted into female mice with 6OHDA-lesions of host midbrain dopamine neurons, with some animals also receiving intrastriatal quinolinic acid (QA) injections to ablate medium spiny neurons (MSN), the A9 neuron primary target. While loss of MSNs variably affected graft survival, it significantly reduced striatal yet increased cortical innervation. Consequently, grafts showed reduced A9 and increased A10 specification, with more DA neurons failing to mature into either subtype. These findings highlight the importance of target acquisition on DA subtype specification during development and repair.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parish and colleagues highlight, in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease (PD), the importance of synaptic target acquisition in the survival, integration and phenotypic specification of grafted dopamine neurons derived from fetal tissue and human stem cells. Ablation of host striatal neurons resulted in reduced dopamine neuron survival within grafts, re-routing of dopamine fibers from striatal to alternate cortical targets and a consequential reduced specification of A9 dopamine neurons (the subpopulation critical for restoration of motor function) and increase in A10 DA neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Learned Motor Patterns Are Replayed in Human Motor Cortex during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Consolidation of memory is believed to involve offline replay of neural activity. While amply demonstrated in rodents, evidence for replay in humans, particularly regarding motor memory, is less compelling. To determine whether replay occurs after motor learning, we sought to record from motor cortex during a novel motor task and subsequent overnight sleep. A 36-year-old man with tetraplegia secondary to cervical spinal cord injury enrolled in the ongoing BrainGate brain&ndash;computer interface pilot clinical trial had two 96-channel intracortical microelectrode arrays placed chronically into left precentral gyrus. Single- and multi-unit activity was recorded while he played a color/sound sequence matching memory game. Intended movements were decoded from motor cortical neuronal activity by a real-time steady-state Kalman filter that allowed the participant to control a neurally driven cursor on the screen. Intracortical neural activity from precentral gyrus and 2-lead scalp EEG were recorded overnight as he slept. When decoded using the same steady-state Kalman filter parameters, intracortical neural signals recorded overnight replayed the target sequence from the memory game at intervals throughout at a frequency significantly greater than expected by chance. Replay events occurred at speeds ranging from 1 to 4 times as fast as initial task execution and were most frequently observed during slow-wave sleep. These results demonstrate that recent visuomotor skill acquisition in humans may be accompanied by replay of the corresponding motor cortex neural activity during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Within cortex, the acquisition of information is often followed by the offline recapitulation of specific sequences of neural firing. Replay of recent activity is enriched during sleep and may support the consolidation of learning and memory. Using an intracortical brain&ndash;computer interface, we recorded and decoded activity from motor cortex as a human research participant performed a novel motor task. By decoding neural activity throughout subsequent sleep, we find that neural sequences underlying the recently practiced motor task are repeated throughout the night, providing direct evidence of replay in human motor cortex during sleep. This approach, using an optimized brain&ndash;computer interface decoder to characterize neural activity during sleep, provides a framework for future studies exploring replay, learning, and memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Whole-Brain Wiring Diagram of Oxytocin System in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin (Oxt) neurons regulate diverse physiological responses via direct connections with different neural circuits. However, the lack of comprehensive input-output wiring diagrams of Oxt neurons and their quantitative relationship with Oxt receptor (Oxtr) expression presents challenges to understanding circuit-specific Oxt functions. Here, we establish a whole-brain distribution and anatomic connectivity map of Oxt neurons, and their relationship with Oxtr expression using high-resolution 3D mapping methods in adult male and female mice. We use a flatmap to describe Oxt neuronal expression in four hypothalamic domains including under-characterized Oxt neurons in the tuberal nucleus (TU). Oxt neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) broadly project to nine functional circuits that control cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. In contrast, Oxt neurons in the supraoptic (SO) and accessory (AN) nuclei have limited central projection to a small subset of the nine circuits. Surprisingly, quantitative comparison between Oxt output and Oxtr expression showed no significant correlation across the whole brain, suggesting abundant indirect Oxt signaling in Oxtr-expressing areas. Unlike output, Oxt neurons in both the PVH and SO receive similar monosynaptic inputs from a subset of the nine circuits mainly in the thalamic, hypothalamic, and cerebral nuclei areas. Our results suggest that PVH-Oxt neurons serve as a central modulator to integrate external and internal information via largely reciprocal connection with the nine circuits while the SO-Oxt neurons act mainly as unidirectional Oxt hormonal output. In summary, our Oxt wiring diagram provides anatomic insights about distinct behavioral functions of Oxt signaling in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin (Oxt) neurons regulate diverse physiological functions from prosocial behavior to pain sensation via central projection in the brain. Thus, understanding detailed anatomic connectivity of Oxt neurons can provide insight on circuit-specific roles of Oxt signaling in regulating different physiological functions. Here, we use high-resolution mapping methods to describe the 3D distribution, monosynaptic input and long-range output of Oxt neurons, and their relationship with Oxt receptor (Oxtr) expression across the entire mouse brain. We found Oxt connections with nine functional circuits controlling cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. Furthermore, we identified a quantitatively unmatched Oxt-Oxtr relationship, suggesting broad indirect Oxt signaling. Together, our comprehensive Oxt wiring diagram advances our understanding of circuit-specific roles of Oxt neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gamma Activation and Alpha Suppression within Human Auditory Cortex during a Speech Classification Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dynamics of information flow within the auditory cortical hierarchy associated with speech processing and the emergence of hemispheric specialization remain incompletely understood. To study these questions with high spatiotemporal resolution, intracranial recordings in 29 human neurosurgical patients of both sexes were obtained while subjects performed a semantic classification task. Neural activity was recorded from posteromedial portion of Heschl's gyrus (HGPM) and anterolateral portion of Heschl's gyrus (HGAL), planum temporale (PT), planum polare, insula, and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Responses to monosyllabic words exhibited early gamma power increases and a later suppression of alpha power, envisioned to represent feedforward activity and decreased feedback signaling, respectively. Gamma activation and alpha suppression had distinct magnitude and latency profiles. HGPM and PT had the strongest gamma responses with shortest onset latencies, indicating that they are the earliest auditory cortical processing stages. The origin of attenuated top-down influences in auditory cortex, as indexed by alpha suppression, was in STG and HGAL. Gamma responses and alpha suppression were typically larger to nontarget words than tones. Alpha suppression was uniformly greater to target versus nontarget stimuli. Hemispheric bias for words versus tones and for target versus nontarget words, when present, was left lateralized. Better task performance was associated with increased gamma activity in the left PT and greater alpha suppression in HGPM and HGAL bilaterally. The prominence of alpha suppression during semantic classification and its accessibility for noninvasive electrophysiologic studies suggests that this measure is a promising index of auditory cortical speech processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the dynamics of cortical speech processing requires the use of active tasks. This is the first comprehensive intracranial electroencephalography study to examine cortical activity within the superior temporal plane, lateral superior temporal gyrus, and the insula during a semantic classification task. Distinct gamma activation and alpha suppression profiles clarify the functional organization of feedforward and feedback processing within the auditory cortical hierarchy. Asymmetries in cortical speech processing emerge at early processing stages. Relationships between cortical activity and task performance are interpreted in the context of current models of speech processing. Results lay the groundwork for iEEG studies using connectivity measures of the bidirectional information flow within the auditory processing hierarchy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortico-Striatal Activity Characterizes Human Safety Learning via Pavlovian Conditioned Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Safety learning generates associative links between neutral stimuli and the absence of threat, promoting the inhibition of fear and security-seeking behaviors. Precisely how safety learning is mediated at the level of underlying brain systems, particularly in humans, remains unclear. Here, we integrated a novel Pavlovian conditioned inhibition task with ultra-high field (7 Tesla) fMRI to examine the neural basis of safety learning in 49 healthy participants. In our task, participants were conditioned to two safety signals: a conditioned inhibitor that predicted threat omission when paired with a known threat signal (A+/AX-), and a standard safety signal that generally predicted threat omission (BC-). Both safety signals evoked equivalent autonomic and subjective learning responses but diverged strongly in terms of underlying brain activation (<I>P</I><SUB>FDR</SUB> whole-brain corrected). The conditioned inhibitor was characterized by more prominent activation of the dorsal striatum, anterior insular, and dorsolateral PFC compared with the standard safety signal, whereas the latter evoked greater activation of the ventromedial PFC, posterior cingulate, and hippocampus, among other regions. Further analyses of the conditioned inhibitor indicated that its initial learning was characterized by consistent engagement of dorsal striatal, midbrain, thalamic, premotor, and prefrontal subregions. These findings suggest that safety learning via conditioned inhibition involves a distributed cortico-striatal circuitry, separable from broader cortical regions involved with processing standard safety signals (e.g., CS<sup>&ndash;</sup>). This cortico-striatal system could represent a novel neural substrate of safety learning, underlying the initial generation of "stimulus&ndash;safety" associations, distinct from wider cortical correlates of safety processing, which facilitate the behavioral outcomes of learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identifying safety is critical for maintaining adaptive levels of anxiety, but the neural mechanisms of human safety learning remain unclear. Using 7 Tesla fMRI, we compared learning-related brain activity for a conditioned inhibitor, which actively predicted threat omission, and a standard safety signal (CS<sup>&ndash;</sup>), which was passively unpaired with threat. The inhibitor engaged an extended circuitry primarily featuring the dorsal striatum, along with thalamic, midbrain, and premotor/PFC regions. The CS<sup>&ndash;</sup> exclusively involved cortical safety-related regions observed in basic safety conditioning, such as the vmPFC. These findings extend current models to include learning-specific mechanisms for encoding stimulus&ndash;safety associations, which might be distinguished from expression-related cortical mechanisms. These insights may suggest novel avenues for targeting dysfunctional safety learning in psychopathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneous Alpha-Band Oscillations Bias Subjective Contrast Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perceptual decisions depend both on the features of the incoming stimulus and on the ongoing brain activity at the moment the stimulus is received. Specifically, trial-to-trial fluctuations in cortical excitability have been linked to fluctuations in the amplitude of prestimulus &alpha; oscillations (~8-13 Hz), which are in turn are associated with fluctuations in subjects' tendency to report the detection of a stimulus. It is currently unknown whether &alpha; oscillations bias postperceptual decision-making, or even bias subjective perception itself. To answer this question, we used a contrast discrimination task in which both male and female human subjects reported which of two gratings (one in each hemifield) was perceived as having a stronger contrast. Our EEG analysis showed that subjective contrast was reduced for the stimulus in the hemifield represented in the hemisphere with relatively stronger prestimulus &alpha; amplitude, reflecting reduced cortical excitability. Furthermore, the strength of this spontaneous hemispheric lateralization was strongly correlated with the magnitude of individual subjects' biases, suggesting that the spontaneous patterns of &alpha; lateralization play a role in explaining the intersubject variability in contrast perception. These results indicate that spontaneous fluctuations in cortical excitability, indicated by patterns of prestimulus &alpha; amplitude, affect perceptual decisions by altering the phenomenological perception of the visual world.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our moment-to-moment perception of the world is shaped by the features of the environment surrounding us, as much as by the constantly evolving states that characterize our brain activity. Previous research showed how the ongoing electrical activity of the brain can influence whether a stimulus has accessed conscious perception. However, evidence is currently missing on whether these electrical brain states can be associated to the subjective experience of a sensory input. Here we show that local changes in patterns of electrical brain activity preceding visual stimulation can bias our phenomenological perception. Importantly, we show that the strength of these variations can help explain the great interindividual variability in how we perceive the visual environment surrounding us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Visual Experience in Individual Differences of Brain Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual cortex organization is highly consistent across individuals. But to what degree does this consistency depend on life experience, in particular sensory experience? In this study, we asked whether visual cortex reorganization in congenital blindness results in connectivity patterns that are particularly variable across individuals, focusing on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns from the primary visual cortex. We show that the absence of shared visual experience results in more variable RSFC patterns across blind individuals than sighted controls. Increased variability is specifically found in areas that show a group difference between the blind and sighted in their RSFC. These findings reveal a relationship between brain plasticity and individual variability; reorganization manifests variably across individuals. We further investigated the different patterns of reorganization in the blind, showing that the connectivity to frontal regions, proposed to have a role in the reorganization of the visual cortex of the blind toward higher cognitive roles, is highly variable. Further, we link some of the variability in visual-to-frontal connectivity to another environmental factor&mdash;duration of formal education. Together, these findings show a role of postnatal sensory and socioeconomic experience in imposing consistency on brain organization. By revealing the idiosyncratic nature of neural reorganization, these findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in fitting sensory aids and restoration approaches for vision loss.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The typical visual system is highly consistent across individuals. What are the origins of this consistency? Comparing the consistency of visual cortex connectivity between people born blind and sighted people, we showed that blindness results in higher variability, suggesting a key impact of postnatal individual experience on brain organization. Further, connectivity patterns that changed following blindness were particularly variable, resulting in diverse patterns of brain reorganization. Individual differences in reorganization were also directly affected by nonvisual experiences in the blind (years of formal education). Together, these findings show a role of sensory and socioeconomic experiences in creating individual differences in brain organization and endorse the use of individual profiles for rehabilitation and restoration of vision loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disruption of Endosomal Sorting in Schwann Cells Leads to Defective Myelination and Endosomal Abnormalities Observed in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Endosomal sorting plays a fundamental role in directing neural development. By altering the temporal and spatial distribution of membrane receptors, endosomes regulate signaling pathways that control the differentiation and function of neural cells. Several genes linked to inherited demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, encode proteins that directly interact with components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Our previous studies demonstrated that a point mutation in the ESCRT component hepatocyte growth-factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS), an endosomal scaffolding protein that identifies internalized cargo to be sorted by the endosome, causes a peripheral neuropathy in the neurodevelopmentally impaired <I>teetering</I> mice. Here, we constructed a Schwann cell-specific deletion of <I>Hgs</I> to determine the role of endosomal sorting during myelination. Inactivation of HGS in Schwann cells resulted in motor and sensory deficits, slowed nerve conduction velocities, delayed myelination and hypomyelinated axons, all of which occur in demyelinating forms of CMT. Consistent with a delay in Schwann cell maturation, HGS-deficient sciatic nerves displayed increased mRNA levels for several promyelinating genes and decreased mRNA levels for genes that serve as markers of myelinating Schwann cells. Loss of HGS also altered the abundance and activation of the ERBB2/3 receptors, which are essential for Schwann cell development. We therefore hypothesize that HGS plays a critical role in endosomal sorting of the ERBB2/3 receptors during Schwann cell maturation, which further implicates endosomal dysfunction in inherited peripheral neuropathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Schwann cells myelinate peripheral axons, and defects in Schwann cell function cause inherited demyelinating peripheral neuropathies known as CMT. Although many CMT-linked mutations are in genes that encode putative endosomal proteins, little is known about the requirements of endosomal sorting during myelination. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of HGS disrupts the endosomal sorting pathway in Schwann cells, resulting in hypomyelination, aberrant myelin sheaths, and impairment of the ERBB2/3 receptor pathway. These findings suggest that defective endosomal trafficking of internalized cell surface receptors may be a common mechanism contributing to demyelinating CMT.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Calpain-2 Mediates MBNL2 Degradation and a Developmental RNA Processing Program in Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Increasing loss of structure and function of neurons and decline in cognitive function is commonly seen during the progression of neurologic diseases, although the causes and initial symptoms of individual diseases are distinct. This observation suggests a convergence of common degenerative features. In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the expression of expanded CUG RNA induces neurotransmission dysfunction before axon and dendrite degeneration and reduced MBNL2 expression associated with aberrant alternative splicing. The role of loss of function of MBNL2 in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and the causal mechanism of neurodegeneration-reduced expression of MBNL2 remain elusive. Here, we show that increased MBNL2 expression is associated with neuronal maturation and required for neuronal morphogenesis and the fetal to adult developmental transition of RNA processing. Neurodegenerative conditions including NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity and dysregulated calcium homeostasis triggered nuclear translocation of calpain-2, thus resulting in MBNL2 degradation and reversal of MBNL2-regulated RNA processing to developmental patterns. Nuclear expression of calpain-2 resembled its developmental pattern and was associated with MBNL2 degradation. Knock-down of calpain-2 expression or inhibition of calpain-2 nuclear translocation prevented neurodegeneration-reduced MBNL2 expression and dysregulated RNA processing. Increased calpain-2 nuclear translocation associated with reduced MBNL2 expression and aberrant RNA processing occurred in models for DM1 and Alzheimer's disease (AD) including EpA960/CaMKII-Cre mice of either sex and female APP/PS1 and THY-Tau22 mice. Our results identify a regulatory mechanism for MBNL2 downregulation and suggest that calpain-2-mediated MBNL2 degradation accompanied by re-induction of a developmental RNA processing program may be a converging pathway to neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurologic diseases share many features during disease progression, such as cognitive decline and brain atrophy, which suggests a common pathway for developing degenerative features. Here, we show that the neurodegenerative conditions glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and dysregulated calcium homeostasis induced translocation of the cysteine protease calpain-2 into the nucleus, resulting in MBNL2 degradation and reversal of MBNL2-regulated RNA processing to an embryonic pattern. Knock-down or inhibition of nuclear translocation of calpain-2 prevented MBNL2 degradation and maintained MBNL2-regulated RNA processing in the adult pattern. Models of myotonic dystrophy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) also showed calpain-2-mediated MBNL2 degradation and a developmental RNA processing program. Our studies suggest MBNL2 function disrupted by calpain-2 as a common pathway, thus providing an alternative therapeutic strategy for neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Computational Probe into the Behavioral and Neural Markers of Atypical Facial Emotion Processing in Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite ample behavioral evidence of atypical facial emotion processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the neural underpinnings of such behavioral heterogeneities remain unclear. Here, I have used brain-tissue mapped artificial neural network (ANN) models of primate vision to probe candidate neural and behavior markers of atypical facial emotion recognition in ASD at an image-by-image level. Interestingly, the image-level behavioral patterns of the ANNs better matched the neurotypical subjects 'behavior than those measured in ASD. This behavioral mismatch was most remarkable when the ANN behavior was decoded from units that correspond to the primate inferior temporal (IT) cortex. ANN-IT responses also explained a significant fraction of the image-level behavioral predictivity associated with neural activity in the human amygdala (from epileptic patients without ASD), strongly suggesting that the previously reported facial emotion intensity encodes in the human amygdala could be primarily driven by projections from the IT cortex. In sum, these results identify primate IT activity as a candidate neural marker and demonstrate how ANN models of vision can be used to generate neural circuit-level hypotheses and guide future human and nonhuman primate studies in autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Moving beyond standard parametric approaches that predict behavior with high-level categorical descriptors of a stimulus (e.g., level of happiness/fear in a face image), in this study, I demonstrate how an image-level probe, using current deep-learning-based ANN models, allows identification of more diagnostic stimuli for autism spectrum disorder enabling the design of more powerful experiments. This study predicts that IT cortex activity is a key candidate neural marker of atypical facial emotion processing in people with ASD. Importantly, the results strongly suggest that ASD-related atypical facial emotion intensity encodes in the human amygdala could be primarily driven by projections from the IT cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The acceptability and side effects of COVID-19 vaccine among health care workers in Nigeria: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is global public health crisis. Mass vaccination, until herd immunity is achieved, is one of the most effective ways of combating the deadly infectious virus. The disposition of health workers towards the AstraZeneca vaccine will most likely determine if other members of the community will be willing to get vaccinated or not. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes of healthcare workers to the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as determine the various side effects experienced by those who have already been vaccinated. Method: Frequency tables were created, and Chi-square was used to determine the relationship between respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, as well as their acceptance or rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine and attitude towards it. Using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0, multinominal logistic regression was used to determine the key factors which influenced respondents’ decision to have the vaccine. Result: There was a statistically significant relationship between the cadre of health care workers, their tribe, and their involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients and their attitude towards the vaccine. Conclusion: Previous involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients is one of the most important determinants of health care workers' acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Most respondents were positive about the vaccine; however, the fear of side effects was the primary reason why those who were yet to be vaccinated, do not plan to do so. The most common side effect reported by those who had already been vaccinated, was pain at the injection site. Public awareness of the vaccine and its benefits should be increased, and the vaccine should be made available in all health care facilities.

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the revealing manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainable business model for local council’s smart city initiatives: a systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaysia is embarking on sustainable, resilient, and prosperous living conditions initiatives. Malaysian cities are embracing the smart city aspiration through their respective local authorities. However, they face challenges regarding  funding allocation for smart city implementation. Local authorities primarily operate on a conventional business model. Based on their current business model, they are unlikely to sustain their smart city initiatives. A more financially sustainable business model is required by these local authorities to embark on smart city initiatives. This study presents a systematic review concerning the business models adopted by local authorities to implement smart cities. This paper also explores the applicability of frugal innovation towards developing a smart city business model. Methods: This article undertakes a systematic review based on combination sets of eight main keywords: smart city, business model, frugal innovation, local authorities, performance, inclusivity, technology and success factor. The search strategy includes journal articles and conference proceedings from five major online databases: Emerald, ProQuest, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Springer Link between 2001-2021. The data is tabulated for clear expression of knowledge gaps. Results: A total of 17 articles from 300 articles on smart city business models matched the search on smart city business models for local authorities . The study revealed that hardly any in-depth research providing the crucial elements for a successful smart city business model for local authorities has been conducted. No research has linked frugal innovation to smart city business models. Conclusions: The study calls upon the research community to explore further, the possible linkage between frugal innovation and smart cities for local authorities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of Leptin and Leptin receptor Gene polymorphisms with Insulin resistance in pregnant women: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Leptin, along with its receptor, are linked with mechanisms affecting a diverse array of pregnancy-specific pathologies that include gestational diabetes and intrauterine growth restriction. The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance.. Methods: 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results: Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62±29.23 and 59.88±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, ‘AA’ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion: No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Topological Sholl descriptors for neuronal clustering and classification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Reem Khalil, Sadok Kallel, Ahmad Farhat, Pawel Dlotko</p>

Neuronal morphology is a fundamental factor influencing information processing within neurons and networks. Dendritic morphology in particular can widely vary among cell classes, brain regions, and animal species. Thus, accurate quantitative descriptions allowing classification of large sets of neurons is essential for their structural and functional characterization. Current robust and unbiased computational methods that characterize groups of neurons are scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to study dendritic morphology, complementing and advancing many of the existing techniques. Our approach is to conceptualize the notion of a Sholl descriptor and associate, for each morphological feature, and to each neuron, a function of the radial distance from the soma, taking values in a metric space. Functional distances give rise to pseudo-metrics on sets of neurons which are then used to perform the two distinct tasks of clustering and classification. To illustrate the use of Sholl descriptors, four datasets were retrieved from the large public repository https://neuromorpho.org/ comprising neuronal reconstructions from different species and brain regions. Sholl descriptors were subsequently computed, and standard clustering methods enhanced with detection and metric learning algorithms were then used to objectively cluster and classify each dataset. Importantly, our descriptors outperformed conventional morphometric techniques (L-Measure metrics) in several of the tested datasets. Therefore, we offer a novel and effective approach to the analysis of diverse neuronal cell types, and provide a toolkit for researchers to cluster and classify neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantifying biochemical reaction rates from static population variability within incompletely observed complex networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Timon Wittenstein, Nava Leibovich, Andreas Hilfinger</p>

Quantifying biochemical reaction rates within complex cellular processes remains a key challenge of systems biology even as high-throughput single-cell data have become available to characterize snapshots of population variability. That is because complex systems with stochastic and non-linear interactions are difficult to analyze when not all components can be observed simultaneously and systems cannot be followed over time. Instead of using descriptive statistical models, we show that incompletely specified mechanistic models can be used to translate qualitative knowledge of interactions into reaction rate functions from covariability data between pairs of components. This promises to turn a globally intractable problem into a sequence of solvable inference problems to quantify complex interaction networks from incomplete snapshots of their stochastic fluctuations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tracking the contribution of inductive bias to individualised internal models</a></h4>

Internal models capture the regularities of the environment and are central to understanding how humans adapt to environmental statistics. In general, the correct internal model is unknown to observers, instead they rely on an approximate model that is continually adapted throughout learning. However, experimenters assume an ideal observer model, which captures stimulus structure but ignores the diverging hypotheses that humans form during learning. We combine non-parametric Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming to infer rich and dynamic individualised internal models from response times. We demonstrate that the approach is capable of characterizing the discrepancy between the internal model maintained by individuals and the ideal observer model and to track the evolution of the contribution of the ideal observer model to the internal model throughout training. In particular, in an implicit visuomotor sequence learning task the identified discrepancy revealed an inductive bias that was consistent across individuals but varied in strength and persistence.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A method for the inference of cytokine interaction networks</a></h4>

Cell-cell communication is mediated by many soluble mediators, including over 40 cytokines. Cytokines, e.g. TNF, IL1<i>β</i>, IL5, IL6, IL12 and IL23, represent important therapeutic targets in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, asthma, rheumatoid and juvenile arthritis. The identification of cytokines that are causative drivers of, and not just associated with, inflammation is fundamental for selecting therapeutic targets that should be studied in clinical trials. As <i>in vitro</i> models of cytokine interactions provide a simplified framework to study complex <i>in vivo</i> interactions, and can easily be perturbed experimentally, they are key for identifying such targets. We present a method to extract a minimal, weighted cytokine interaction network, given <i>in vitro</i> data on the effects of the blockage of single cytokine receptors on the secretion rate of other cytokines. Existing biological network inference methods typically consider the correlation structure of the underlying dataset, but this can make them poorly suited for highly connected, non-linear cytokine interaction data. Our method uses ordinary differential equation systems to represent cytokine interactions, and efficiently computes the configuration with the lowest Akaike information criterion value for all possible network configurations. It enables us to study indirect cytokine interactions and quantify inhibition effects. The extracted network can also be used to predict the combined effects of inhibiting various cytokines simultaneously. The model equations can easily be adjusted to incorporate more complicated dynamics and accommodate temporal data. We validate our method using synthetic datasets and apply our method to an experimental dataset on the regulation of IL23, a cytokine with therapeutic relevance in psoriasis and IBD. We validate several model predictions against experimental data that were not used for model fitting. In summary, we present a novel method specifically designed to efficiently infer cytokine interaction networks from cytokine perturbation data in the context of IMIDs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic inference of indirect transcriptional regulation by protein kinases and phosphatases</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christian Degnbol Madsen, Jotun Hein, Christopher T. Workman</p>

Gene expression is controlled by pathways of regulatory factors often involving the activity of protein kinases on transcription factor proteins. Despite this well established mechanism, the number of well described pathways that include the regulatory role of protein kinases on transcription factors is surprisingly scarce in eukaryotes.
To address this, <i>PhosTF</i> was developed to infer functional regulatory interactions and pathways in both simulated and real biological networks, based on linear cyclic causal models with latent variables. <i>GeneNetWeaverPhos</i>, an extension of <i>GeneNetWeaver</i>, was developed to allow the simulation of perturbations in known networks that included the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases on gene regulation. Over 2000 genome-wide gene expression profiles, where the loss or gain of regulatory genes could be observed to perturb gene regulation, were then used to infer the existence of regulatory interactions, and their mode of regulation in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.
Despite the additional complexity, our inference performed comparably to the best methods that inferred transcription factor regulation assessed in the <i>DREAM4</i> challenge on similar simulated networks. Inference on integrated genome-scale data sets for yeast identified ∼ 8800 protein kinase/phosphatase-transcription factor interactions and ∼ 6500 interactions among protein kinases and/or phosphatases. Both types of regulatory predictions captured statistically significant numbers of known interactions of their type. Surprisingly, kinases and phosphatases regulated transcription factors by a negative mode or regulation (deactivation) in over 70% of the predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">An open-access database of infectious disease transmission trees to explore superspreader epidemiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Juliana C. Taube, Paige B. Miller, John M. Drake</p>

Historically, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases have caused large, deadly, and expensive multinational outbreaks. Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals and branches representing transmission from person to person. We compiled a database, called OutbreakTrees, of 382 published, standardized transmission trees consisting of 16 directly transmitted diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease, we calculated several key statistics, such as tree size, average number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the proportion of cases considered superspreaders, and examined how these statistics varied over the course of each outbreak and under different assumptions about the completeness of outbreak investigations. We demonstrated the potential utility of the database through 2 short analyses addressing questions about superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). First, we found that our transmission trees were consistent with theory predicting that intermediate dispersion parameters give rise to the highest proportion of cases causing superspreading events. Additionally, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected. Across trees with more than 1 superspreader, we found preliminary support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders. In sum, our findings put the role of superspreading in COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that of other diseases and suggest an approach to further research regarding the generation of superspreaders. These data have been made openly available to encourage reuse and further scientific inquiry.

<p>In the vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (<i>Scotinomys teguina</i>), each note of its rapid frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by modulation of larynx, breath, and gape. To elucidate the circuitry underlying song, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into two vocal muscles. We observed infection in separate motorneuron pools for each muscle, then coinfection in putative central pattern generators, followed by forebrain hypothalamic and limbic regions, and finally cortex. Our data suggest hierarchical song control resembles known circuits for both rodents and primates.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vocalizations are often elaborate, rhythmically structured behaviors. Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (<i>Scotinomys teguina</i>) each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening, respectively. Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguus for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally colabel neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong colabeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive colabeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production. The progress of both viruses is broadly consistent with vertebrate-general patterns of vocal circuitry, as well as with circuit models derived from primate literature.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has become a significant target of stress research in recent years because of its role in cognitive functioning, neuropathology, and regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Despite the pervasive impact of stress on psychiatric and neurological disease, many of the circuit- and cell-dependent mechanisms giving rise to the limbic regulation of the stress response remain unknown. Hippocampal excitatory neurons generally express high levels of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and are therefore positioned to respond directly to serum glucocorticoids. These neurons are, in turn, regulated by neighboring interneurons, subtypes of which have been shown to respond to stress exposure. However, GR expression among hippocampal interneurons is not well characterized. To determine whether key interneuron populations are direct targets for glucocorticoid action, we used two transgenic mouse lines to label parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneurons. GR immunostaining of labeled interneurons was characterized within the dorsal and ventral dentate hilus, dentate cell body layer, and CA1 and CA3 stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale. While nearly all hippocampal SST+ interneurons expressed GR across all regions, GR labeling of PV+ interneurons showed considerable subregion variability. The percentage of PV+, GR+ cells was highest in the CA3 stratum pyramidale and lowest in the CA1 stratum oriens, with other regions showing intermediate levels of expression. Together, these findings indicate that, under baseline conditions, hippocampal SST+ interneurons are a ubiquitous glucocorticoid target, while only distinct populations of PV+ interneurons are direct targets. This anatomical diversity suggests functional differences in the regulation of stress-dependent hippocampal responses.</p>

     alt="Integrated age-related immunohistological changes occur in human olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb"/>
<p>During human development a complete uninterrupted sheet of neuronal competent mucosa with well demarcated borders comprises the olfactory epithelium (OE) within the superior aspect of the nasal cavity along the septum and lateral wall. The axons of olfactory neurons within the epithelium target glomeruli along the peripheral edges of the olfactory bulb (OB). With advancing age, regions of the OE are disrupted and replaced with respiratory or aneuronal epithelium while the border becomes less defined. A decreasing area of OE occurs with a shift of neuronal density in a more posterior-dorsal direction. Intraepithelial neuromas and subepithelial cysts develop along with a decrease in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Proximally, distortions in olfactory targeting occur within the OB with an overall reduction in synapses in the ventral portion.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory epithelium (OE) is capable of lifelong regeneration due to presence of basal progenitor cells that respond to injury or neuronal loss with increased activity. However, this capability diminishes with advancing age and a decrease in odor perception in older individuals is well established. To characterize changes associated with age in the peripheral olfactory system, an in-depth analysis of the OE and its neuronal projections onto the olfactory bulb (OB) as a function of age was performed. Human olfactory tissue autopsy samples from 36 subjects with an average age of 74.1 years were analyzed. Established cell type-specific antibodies were used to identify OE component cells in whole mucosal sheets and epithelial sections as well as glomeruli and periglomerular structures in OB sections. With age, a reduction in OE area occurs across the mucosa progressing in a posterior-dorsal direction. Deterioration of the olfactory system is accompanied with diminution of neuron-containing OE, mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and OB innervation. On an individual level, the neuronal density within the epithelium appears to predict synapse density within the OB. The innervation of the OB is uneven with higher density at the ventral half that decreases with age as opposed to stable innervation at the dorsal half. Respiratory metaplasia, submucosal cysts, and neuromata, were commonly identified in aged OE. The finding of respiratory metaplasia and aneuronal epithelium with reduction in global basal cells suggests a progression of stem cell quiescence as an underlying pathophysiology of age-related smell loss in humans.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
<p>A gradual loss of olfactory sensory neurons with age in human olfactory epithelium is also reflected in a reduction in glomeruli within the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>This gradual loss of neurons and synaptic connections with age occurs in a specific, spatially inhomogeneous manner.</p>
<p>Decreasing mitotically active olfactory epithelium basal cells may contribute to age-related neuronal decline and smell loss in humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The diversity of the diprotodontids provides an excellent opportunity to study how a basic marsupial cortical plan has been modified for the needs of the mammals living in different habitats. Very little is known about the connections of the cerebral cortex with the deep brain structures (basal ganglia and thalamus) in this evolutionarily significant group of mammals. In this study, we performed mapping of brain regions and connections in a diprotodontid marsupial from data obtained from an excised brain scanned in high-field (9.4 T) microstructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instrument. The analysis was based on two MRI methodologies. First, high-resolution structural scans were used to map MRI visible brain regions from T1w and T2w images. Second, extensive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were obtained to elucidate connectivity between brain areas using deterministic diffusion tracking of neuronal brain fibers. From the data, we were able to identify corticostriate connections between the frontal association and dorsomedial isocortex and the head of the caudate, and between the lateral somatosensory cortex and the putamen. We were also able to follow the olfactory and limbic connections by tracing fibers in the fornix, cingulum, intrabulbar part of the anterior commissure, and lateral olfactory tract. There was segregation of fibers in the anterior commissure such that olfactory connections passed through the rostroventral part and successively more dorsal cortical areas connected through more dorsal parts of the commissure. Our findings confirm a common pattern of cortical connectivity in therian mammals, even where brain expansion has occurred independently in diverse groups.</p>

     alt="Lifespan of mature olfactory sensory neurons varies with location in the mouse olfactory epithelium and age of the animal"/>
<p>A genetic model based on the expression of an OMP-tTA transgene has been used for assessing survival of mature olfactory sensory neurons as a function of age of the animal and region of the olfactory epithelium (OE). A near-majority and a majority of mature neurons at 2 months and 4.5 months of age, respectively, live for more than 6 months demonstrating substantial stability of this sensory epithelium. However, the lifespan differs between dorsal and ventral epithelium. The diagram summarizes the relationship between mature neuron survival and rate of basal cell proliferation in dorsal vs. ventral OE.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory epithelium (OE) exhibit a remarkable regenerative capability, which protects the population against environmental insult and enables adjustment to new odors. The lifespan of OSNs is still open to question, with estimates ranging from 1 month to at least 1 year. However, the estimates come with some caveats, including low labeling efficiency and a focus solely on newborn neurons. We revisited the issue via the use of OMP-tTA; TetO-Cre; Rosa26-fl(stop)-Tdtomato (OMP-tTA;TdT) mice, which allowed us to selectively label ∼95% of the OMP(+) OSN population that reach maturity by a given time and, by switching to doxycycline chow, to “chase” this preexisting OSN population. Two loading protocols were used: conception to 2 months old and conception to 4.5 months old. Surviving OSNs were common up to 6 months chase time in both groups, but more neurons survived when loading for 4.5 months as compared with 2 months. A spatial difference was evident: higher percentages of OSNs survived in the dorsomedial OE as compared with ventrolateral and in posterior versus anterior OE regions. Finally, proliferation rates anticorrelated with the spatial differences in OSN survival; higher proliferation rates were observed ventrally. Together, these results demonstrate spatial and temporal differences in OSN survival, highlighting it as a dynamic system that can be studied for factors affecting neuronal survival.</p>

<p>The diversity of retinal ganglion cell subtypes spans further than protein markers, morphology, and physiology.

Immunofluorescent staining for prototypical primary cilia markers, Arl13b and AC3, showed that some RGC subtypes harbor one or the other marker and sometimes both

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies several forms of retinal disease including glaucomatous optic neuropathy, a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Several rare genetic disorders associated with cilia dysfunction have retinal degeneration as a clinical hallmark. Much of the focus of ciliopathy associated blindness is on the connecting cilium of photoreceptors; however, RGCs also possess primary cilia. It is unclear what roles RGC cilia play, what proteins and signaling machinery localize to RGC cilia, or how RGC cilia are differentiated across the subtypes of RGCs. To better understand these questions, we assessed the presence or absence of a prototypical cilia marker Arl13b and a widely distributed neuronal cilia marker AC3 in different subtypes of mouse RGCs. Interestingly, not all RGC subtype cilia are the same and there are significant differences even among these standard cilia markers. Alpha-RGCs positive for osteopontin, calretinin, and SMI32 primarily possess AC3-positive cilia. Directionally selective RGCs that are CART positive or Trhr positive localize either Arl13b or AC3, respectively, in cilia. Intrinsically photosensitive RGCs differentially localize Arl13b and AC3 based on melanopsin expression. Taken together, we characterized the localization of gold standard cilia markers in different subtypes of RGCs and conclude that cilia within RGC subtypes may be differentially organized. Future studies aimed at understanding RGC cilia function will require a fundamental ability to observe the cilia across subtypes as their signaling protein composition is elucidated. A comprehensive understanding of RGC cilia may reveal opportunities to understanding how their dysfunction leads to retinal degeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Florida manatees (<i>Trichechus manatus latirostris</i>) and rock hyraxes (<i>Procavia capensis</i>) exhibit expanded tactile arrays of vibrissae that are distributed not only on the face but also on the entire postfacial body. In contrast, the vibrissae of most mammals are principally restricted to the face. These facial vibrissae may be associated with central nervous system representations known as barrels in the cerebral cortex, barreloids in the thalamus, and barrelettes in the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem. To date, vibrissae representations found within the brainstem have been principally limited to facial vibrissae representations in the trigeminal nuclei. We hypothesized that the tactile specializations of the manatee and rock hyrax would produce a unique modification of typical mammalian central nervous system organization, with postfacial vibrissae representations appearing in the cuneate and gracile nuclei as “body barrelettes.” Using histological and histochemical methods, including cresyl violet, myelin, and cytochrome oxidase processing, we first delineated the rostral, middle, and caudal zones of the cuneate and gracile nuclei. Within the middle zone, divisions were present, including extensive parcellation in the cluster region, particularly in manatees. These clusters were particularly densely distributed and distinguishable in the presumptive postfacial body representations in the cuneate and gracile nuclei but otherwise shared many attributes with the barrelettes found in the trigeminal nuclei of other species. This study represents the first characterization of postfacial body vibrissae representations, or “body barrelettes,” in the brainstem of any species. Previous studies have predominantly focused on facial vibrissae representations, which have served for decades as a model for sensory organization and plasticity. Our results extend what is known about vibrissae representations in the central nervous system to include expansions related to peripheral specializations of the postfacial body. Unusual somatosensory adaptations in the manatee and rock hyrax are highly informative regarding how mammalian brain organization responds to evolutionary pressures on sensory systems.</p>

<p>The African spiny mouse, <i>Acomys cahirinus</i>, is a rodent with a unique regenerative capability among mammals. Studies on <i>A. cahirinus</i> brain are limited due to the lack of knowledge of its neuroanatomy. The brain of <i>A. cahirinus</i> was mapped in a coronal atlas in stereotaxic coordinates using cresyl violet staining. This atlas of the <i>A. cahirinus</i> represents a new tool for neuroscience studies in a new model for brain repair.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The African spiny mouse (<i>Acomys cahirinus</i>) is an emerging model of mammalian epimorphic regeneration that has aroused the interest of the scientific community in the last decade. To date, studies on brain repair have been hindered by the lack of knowledge on the neuroanatomy of this species. Here, we present a coronal brain atlas in stereotaxic coordinates, which allows for three-dimensional identification and localization of the brain structures of this species. The brain of 12-week-old spiny mice was mapped in stereotaxic coordinates using cresyl violet-stained brain sections obtained from coronal cryosectioning of the brain after transcardial perfusion with fixative. The atlas is presented in 42 plates representing sections spaced 240 μm apart. Stereotaxic coordinates were validated using both a model of Parkinsonian lesion of the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine and labeling of the corticospinal tract in the spiny mouse spinal cord using AAV1/2-GFP intracortical injections. This work presents a new tool in <i>A. cahirinus</i> neurobiology and opens new avenues of research for the investigation of the regenerative ability of <i>A. cahirinus</i> in models of brain disorders.</p>

<p>Rosy bitterling brain at 165 hours postfertilization. Tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT in this very early stage. Three-dimensional visualization with microCT scanning protocols is extremely useful for the study of the rosy bitterling and provides an updating of imaging modalities for morphological and anatomical analyses in this nonmodel organism.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bitterlings are carp-like teleost fish (Cypriniformes: Acheilanathidae) known for their specialized brood parasitic lifestyle. Bitterling embryos, in fact, develop inside the gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts. However, little is known about how their parasitic lifestyle affects brain development in comparison to nonparasitic species. Here, we document the development of the brain of the rosy bitterling, <i>Rhodeus ocellatus</i>, at four embryonic stages of 165, 185, 210, 235 hours postfertilization (hpf) using micro-computed tomography (microCT). Focusing on developmental regionalization and brain ventricular organization, we relate the development of the brain divisions to those described for zebrafish using the prosomeric model as a reference paradigm. Segmentation and three-dimensional visualization of the ventricular system allowed us to identify changes in the longitudinal brain axis as a result of cephalic flexure during development. The results show that during early embryonic and larval development, histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT. The results of this study visualized with differential CT profiles are broadly consistent with comparable histological studies, and with the genoarchitecture of teleosts like the zebrafish. Compared to the zebrafish, our study identifies distinct developmental heterochronies in the rosy bitterling, such as a precocious development of the inferior lobe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Burnout and work satisfaction are differentially associated in gastroenterologists in Germany [version 3; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout in the field of gastroenterology is an under-researched phenomenon. So far, only a few studies have dealt with this topic. There are large geographical variations in burnout rates with 16–20% of gastroenterologists in Mexico and Germany being at risk or having burnout, 30–40% in the United Kingdom, and 50–55% in South Korea, Canada, and the USA. The investigation of differential associations of burnout with important factors in gastroenterologists leading to tailored therapy recommendations is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the associations between work satisfaction and burnout in this specialization. Methods: We distributed an electronic survey to gastroenterologists organized mainly in the Federal Organization of Gastroenterology in Germany (the BVGD - Bundesverband Gastroenterologie Deutschland). The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ) were examined regarding their postulated internal structure in our sample of gastroenterologists. Canonical correlations were performed to examine the association between work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians. Results: An acceptable model fit was shown for both the MBI and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire. The canonical correlation analysis resulted in two statistically significant canonical functions with correlations of .62 (p<.001) and .27 (p<.001). The full model across all functions was significant (χ2 (18) = 386.26, p<.001). Burden, personal rewards, and global item regarding the job situation were good predictors for less exhaustion, while patient care and professional relations were good predictors for personal accomplishment. This supports the recognition of burnout as being a multidimensional construct which has to be thoroughly diagnosed. Conclusions: Specific interventions should be designed to improve symptoms of burnout in endoscopy physicians according to their individual complaints as burnout is a multidimensional construct. Differential interventions should be offered on the basis of our study results in order to alleviate the issue of work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Deep supervised hashing for gait retrieval [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gait recognition is perceived as the most promising biometric approach for future decades especially because of its efficient applicability in surveillance systems. Due to recent growth in the use of gait biometrics across surveillance systems, the ability to rapidly search for the required data has become an emerging need. Therefore, we addressed the gait retrieval problem, which retrieves people with gaits similar to a query subject from a large-scale dataset. Methods: This paper presents the deep gait retrieval hashing (DGRH) model to address the gait retrieval problem for large-scale datasets. Our proposed method is based on a supervised hashing method with a deep convolutional network. We use the ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the semantic gait features for feature representation and learn the compact hash codes with the compatible hash function. Therefore, our DGRH model combines gait feature learning with binary hash codes. In addition, the learning loss is designed with a classification loss function that learns to preserve similarity and a quantization loss function that controls the quality of the hash codes Results: The proposed method was evaluated against the CASIA-B, OUISIR-LP, and OUISIR-MVLP benchmark datasets and received the promising result for gait retrieval tasks. Conclusions: The end-to-end deep supervised hashing model is able to learn discriminative gait features and is efficient in terms of the storage memory and speed for gait retrieval.

                Background: A recent bioinformatics technique involves changing nucleotide sequences into 2D speckles. This technique produces speckles called GB-speckles (Gene Based speckles). All classical strategies of speckle-optics, namely speckle-interferometry, subtraction of speckle-images as well as speckle-correlometry have been inferred for processing of GB-speckles. This indicates the considerable improvement in the present tools of bioinformatics.   Methods: Colour s-LASCA imaging of virtual laser GB-speckles, a new method of high discrimination and typing of pathogenic viruses, has been developed. This method has been adapted to the detecting of natural mutations in nucleotide sequences, related to the spike glycoprotein (coding the gene «S») of SARS–CoV-2 gene as the molecular target.    Results: The rate of the colouring images of virtual laser GB-speckles generated by s-LASCA can be described by the specific value of R. If the nucleotide sequences compared utilizing this approach the relevant images are completely identical, then the three components of the resulting colour image will be identical, and therefore the value of R will be equal to zero. However, if there are at least minimal differences in the matched nucleotide sequences, then the value of R will be positive.    Conclusion: The high effectiveness of an application of the colour images of GB-speckles that were generated by s-LASCA- has been demonstrated for discrimination between different variants of the SARS–CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene.

                Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science research are promising tools to better inform public policy and public health responses, promoting automation and affordability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI has been an aid to forecast outbreak spread globally. The overall aim of the study is to contribute to the ongoing public health, socioeconomic, and communication challenges caused by COVID-19. Protocol: COLEV is a five-pronged interdisciplinary mixed methods project based on AI and data science from an inclusive perspective of age and gender to develop, implement, and communicate useful evidence for COVID-19-related response and recovery in Colombia. The first objective is identification of stakeholders’ preferences, needs, and their use of AI and data science relative to other forms of evidence. The second objective will develop locally relevant mathematical models that will shed light on the possible impact, trajectories, geographical spread, and uncertainties of disease progression as well as risk assessment. The third objective focuses on estimating the effect of COVID-19 on other diseases, gender disparities and health system saturation. The fourth objective aims to analyze popular social networks to identify health-related trending interest and users that act as ‘super spreaders’ for information and misinformation. Finally, the fifth objective, aims at designing disruptive cross-media communication strategies to confront mis- and dis-information around COVID-19. To understand stakeholders’ perspectives, we will use semi-structured interviews and ethnographic work. Daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 reported from the National Surveillance System (INS) of Colombia will be used for quantitative analysis, and data regarding the online conversation will be obtained from Facebook and Twitter. Conclusions: COLEV intends to facilitate the dialogue between academia and health policymakers. The results of COLEV will inform on the responsible, safe and ethical use of AI and data science for decision-making in the context of sanitary emergencies in deeply unequal settings.

<p>We demonstrate that administration of a novel selenopeptide named PSELT to a lesioned facial nerve improved its regeneration and ameliorated motor performances in rat, strongly suggesting that PSELT is a valuable therapeutic candidate to treat peripheral nerve injuries.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is frequent and many patients suffer lifelong disabilities in severe cases. Although the peripheral nervous system is able to regenerate, its potential is limited. In this study, we tested in a nerve regeneration model in rat the potential beneficial effect of a short mimetic peptide, named PSELT, which derives from SELENOT, an essential thioredoxin-like selenoprotein endowed with neuroprotective and antioxidant activities. For this purpose, the right facial nerve of female Long–Evans rats was axotomized then bridged with a free femoral vein interposition graft. PSELT (1 μM) was injected into the vein immediately and 48 h after the injury, and the effects observed were compared to those found after an end-to-end suture used as a gold standard treatment. Whisking behavior, electrophysiological potential, and histological analyses were performed 3 months after injury to determine the effects of these treatments. These analyses revealed that PSELT-treated animals exhibit a better motor recovery in terms of protraction amplitude and velocity of vibrissae compared to control and end-sutured nerve animal groups. Moreover, administration of PSELT following injury enhanced muscle innervation, axonal elongation, and myelination of newly formed nerve fibers. Altogether, these results indicate that a PSELT-based treatment is sufficient to enhance facial nerve myelination and regeneration and could represent a new therapeutic tool to treat PNI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Contributors to serum NfL levels in people without neurologic disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the effects of demographics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities on serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people without neurologic disease and establish demographic-specific reference ranges of sNfL.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a representative sample of the US population in which detailed information on demographic, lifestyle, routine laboratory tests and overall health status are systematically collected. From stored serum samples, we measured sNfL levels using a novel high-throughput immunoassay (Siemens Healthineers). We evaluated the predictive capacity of 52 demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, anthropometric, or laboratory characteristics in explaining variability in sNfL levels. Predictive performance was assessed using cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> (R<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub>) and forward selection was used to obtain a set of best predictors of sNfL levels. Adjusted reference ranges were derived incorporating characteristics using generalized additive models for location, scale and shape.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1706 NHANES participants (average age: 43.6±14.8y; 50.6% male, 35% non-white) without neurological disorders. In univariate models, age explained the most variability in sNfL (R<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub>=26.8%). Multivariable prediction models for sNfL contained 3 covariates (in order of their selection): age, creatinine, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (standardized β – age: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.50; creatinine: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.22; HbA1c: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.11). Adjusted centile curves were derived incorporating identified predictors. We provide an interactive R Shiny application to translate our findings and allow other investigators to use the derived centile curves.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results will help to guide interpretation of sNfL levels as they relate to neurologic conditions.</p>

<p>A necessary condition for forming episodic memories is the construction of specific episodes demarcated from other episodes in space and time. Evidence from studies of episodic memory formation using rodent models suggest that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) supports the representation of boundary information. Building on recent work using human microelectrode recordings as well, we hypothesized of human MTL neurons with firing rates sensitive to episodic boundary information. We identified 27 episodic boundary neurons out of 736 single neurons recorded across 27 subjects. Firing of these neurons increased at the beginning and end of mnemonically relevant episodes in the free recall task. We distinguish episodic boundary neurons from a population of ramping neurons (<i>n</i> = 58), which are time-sensitive neurons whose activity provides complementary information during episodic representation. Episodic boundary neurons exhibited a U-shaped activity pattern demonstrating increased activity after both beginning and end boundaries of encoding and retrieval epochs. We also describe evidence that the firing of boundary neurons within episodic boundaries is organized by hippocampal theta oscillations, using spike-field coherence metrics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Dominant role of adult neurogenesis‐induced structural heterogeneities in driving plasticity heterogeneity in dentate gyrus granule cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons and synapses manifest pronounced variability in the amount of plasticity induced by identical activity patterns. The mechanisms underlying such plasticity heterogeneity, which have been implicated in context-specific resource allocation during encoding, have remained unexplored. Here, we employed a systematic physiologically constrained parametric search to identify the cellular mechanisms behind plasticity heterogeneity in dentate gyrus granule cells. We used heterogeneous model populations to ensure that our conclusions were not biased by parametric choices in a single hand-tuned model. We found that each of intrinsic, synaptic, and structural heterogeneities independently yielded heterogeneities in synaptic plasticity profiles obtained with two different induction protocols. However, among the disparate forms of neural-circuit heterogeneities, our analyses demonstrated the dominance of neurogenesis-induced structural heterogeneities in driving plasticity heterogeneity in granule cells. We found that strong relationships between neuronal intrinsic excitability and plasticity emerged only when adult neurogenesis-induced heterogeneities in neural structure were accounted for. Importantly, our analyses showed that it was not imperative that the manifestation of neural-circuit heterogeneities must translate to heterogeneities in plasticity profiles. Specifically, despite the expression of heterogeneities in structural, synaptic, and intrinsic neuronal properties, similar plasticity profiles were attainable across all models through synergistic interactions among these heterogeneities. We assessed the parametric combinations required for the manifestation of such degeneracy in the expression of plasticity profiles. We found that immature cells showed physiological plasticity profiles despite receiving afferent inputs with weak synaptic strengths. Thus, the high intrinsic excitability of immature granule cells was sufficient to counterbalance their low excitatory drive in the expression of plasticity profile degeneracy. Together, our analyses demonstrate that disparate forms of neural-circuit heterogeneities could mechanistically drive plasticity heterogeneity, but also caution against treating neural-circuit heterogeneities as proxies for plasticity heterogeneity. Our study emphasizes the need for quantitatively characterizing the relationship between neural-circuit and plasticity heterogeneities across brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Granule cell dispersion in two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy and reeler mice is associated with changes in dendritic orientation and spine distribution</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by hippocampal neuronal death in CA1 and hilus. Dentate gyrus granule cells survive but show dispersion of the compact granule cell layer. This is associated with decrease of the glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates neuron migration and dendrite outgrow. Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice show no layering, their granule cells are dispersed throughout the dentate gyrus. We studied granule cell dendritic orientation and distribution of postsynaptic spines in reeler mice and two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy, namely the p35 knockout mice, which show Reelin-independent neuronal migration defects, and mice with unilateral intrahippocampal kainate injection. Granule cells were Golgi-stained and analyzed, using a computerized camera lucida system. Granule cells in naive controls exhibited a vertically oriented dendritic arbor with a small bifurcation angle if positioned proximal to the hilus and a wider dendritic bifurcation angle, if positioned distally. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed a dispersed granule cell layer, granule cells showed basal dendrites with wider bifurcation angles, which lost position-specific differences. Reeler mice lacked dendritic orientation. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed increased dendritic spine density in the granule cell layer. Molecular layer dendrites showed a reduced spine density in kainate-injected mice only, whereas in p35 knockouts no reduced spine density was seen. Reeler mice showed a homogenous high spine density. We hypothesize that granule cells migrate in temporal lobe epilepsy, develop new dendrites which show a spread of the dendritic tree, create new spines in areas proximal to mossy fiber sprouting, which is present in p35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice and loose spines on distal dendrites if mossy cell death is present, as it was in kainate-injected mice only. These results are in accordance with findings in epilepsy patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Pregnane neurosteroids exert opposite effects on GABA and glycine‐induced chloride current in isolated rat neurons</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of endogenous neurosteroids (NSs) with pregnane skeleton modified at positions C-3 and C-5 to modulate the functional activity of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyR) and ionotropic ɣ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) was estimated. The glycine and GABA-induced chloride current (<i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>) were measured in isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus and in isolated rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, respectively. Our experiments demonstrated that pregnane NSs affected <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> in a different manner. At low concentrations (up to 5 μM), tested pregnane NSs increased or did not change the peak amplitude of the <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>, but reduced the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> by decreasing the peak amplitude and/or accelerating desensitization. Namely, allopregnanolone (ALLO), epipregnanolone (EPI), pregnanolone (PA), pregnanolone sulfate (PAS) and 5β-dihydroprogesterone (5β-DHP) enhanced the <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub> in Purkinje cells. Dose–response curves plotted in the concentration range from 1 nM to 100 μM were smooth for EPI and 5β-DHP, but bell-shaped for ALLO, PA and PAS. The peak amplitude of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> was reduced by PA, PAS, and 5α- and 5β-DHP. In contrast, ALLO, ISO and EPI did not modulate it. Dose–response curves for the inhibition of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> peak amplitude were smooth for all active compounds. All NSs accelerated desensitization of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub>. The dose–response relationship for this effect was smooth for ALLO, PA, PAS and 5β-DHP, but it was U-shaped for EPI, 5α-DHP and ISO. These results, together with our previous results on NSs with androstane skeleton, offer comprehensive overview for understanding the mechanisms of effects of NSs on <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Neuroplastic changes in c‐Fos, ΔFosB, BDNF, trkB, and Arc expression in the hippocampus of male Roman rats: differential effects of sexual activity</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sexual activity causes differential changes in the expression of markers of neural activation (c-Fos and ΔFosB) and neural plasticity (Arc and BDNF/trkB), as determined either by Western Blot (BDNF, trkB, Arc, and ΔFosB) or immunohistochemistry (BDNF, trkB, Arc, and c-Fos), in the hippocampus of male Roman high (RHA) and low avoidance (RLA) rats, two psychogenetically selected rat lines that display marked differences in sexual behavior (RHA rats exhibit higher sexual motivation and better copulatory performance than RLA rats). Both methods showed (with some differences) that sexual activity modifies the expression levels of these markers in the hippocampus of Roman rats depending on: (i) the level of sexual experience, that is, changes were usually more evident in sexually naïve than in experienced rats; (ii) the hippocampal partition, that is, BDNF and Arc increased in the dorsal but tended to decrease in the ventral hippocampus; (iii) the marker considered, that is, in sexually experienced animals BDNF, c-Fos, and Arc levels were similar to those of controls, while ΔFosB levels increased; and (iv) the rat line, that is, changes were usually larger in RHA than RLA rats. These findings resemble those of early studies in RHA and RLA rats showing that sexual activity influences the expression of these markers in the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area, and show for the first time that also in the hippocampus sexual activity induces neural activation and plasticity, events that occur mainly during the first phase of the acquisition of sexual experience and depend on the genotypic/phenotypic characteristics of the animals.</p>
