                arXiv:2505.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IntrinsicTimescales.jl is a Julia package to perform estimation of intrinsic neural timescales (INTs). INTs are defined as the time window in which prior information from an ongoing stimulus can affect the processing of newly arriving information. INTs are estimated either from the autocorrelation function (ACF) or the power spectral density (PSD) of time-series data. In addition to the model-free estimates of INTs, IntrinsicTimescales.jl offers implementations of novel techniques of timescale estimation via performing parameter estimation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with adaptive approximate Bayesian computation (aABC) and automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11538">BrainNetMLP: An Efficient and Effective Baseline for Functional Brain Network Classification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have made great progress in functional brain network classification by modeling the brain as a network of Regions of Interest (ROIs) and leveraging their connections to understand brain functionality and diagnose mental disorders. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy? In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters. Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental results demonstrate pure MLP-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance, revealing the potential of MLP-based models as more efficient yet effective alternatives in functional brain network classification. The code will be available at https://github.com/JayceonHo/BrainNetMLP.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12068">Learning High-Order Relationships with Hypergraph Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Aggregation for Brain Disease Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional functional connectivity based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can only capture pairwise interactions between brain regions. Hypergraphs, which reveal high-order relationships among multiple brain regions, have been widely used for disease analysis. However, existing methods often rely on predefined hypergraph structures, limiting their ability to model complex patterns. Moreover, temporal information, an essential component of brain high-order relationships, is frequently overlooked. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns informative and sparse high-order brain structures along with their temporal dynamics. Inspired by the information bottleneck principle, we introduce an objective that maximizes information and minimizes redundancy, aiming to retain disease-relevant high-order features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Our model comprises a multi-hyperedge binary mask module for hypergraph structure learning, a hypergraph self-attention aggregation module that captures spatial features through adaptive attention across nodes and hyperedges, and a spatio-temporal low-dimensional network for extracting discriminative spatio-temporal representations for disease classification. Experiments on benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and successfully identifies meaningful high-order brain interactions. These findings provide new insights into brain network modeling and the study of neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12525">Development of a non-wearable support robot capable of reproducing natural standing-up movements</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reproduce natural standing-up motion, recent studies have emphasized the importance of coordination between the assisting robot and the human. However, many non-wearable assistive devices have struggled to replicate natural motion trajectories. While wearable devices offer better coordination with the human body, they present challenges in completely isolating mechanical and electrical hazards. To address this, we developed a novel standing-assist robot that integrates features of both wearable and non-wearable systems, aiming to achieve high coordination while maintaining safety. The device employs a four-link mechanism aligned with the human joint structure, designed to reproduce the S-shaped trajectory of the hip and the arc trajectory of the knee during natural standing-up motion. Subject-specific trajectory data were obtained using a gyroscope, and the link lengths were determined to drive the seat along the optimal path. A feedforward speed control using a stepping motor was implemented, and the reproducibility of the trajectory was evaluated based on the geometric constraints of the mechanism. A load-bearing experiment with weights fixed to the seat was conducted to assess the trajectory accuracy under different conditions. Results showed that the reproduction errors for the hip and knee trajectories remained within approximately 4 percent of the seat's total displacement, demonstrating high fidelity to the target paths. In addition, durability testing, thermal safety evaluation, and risk assessment confirmed the reliability and safety of the system for indoor use. These findings suggest that the proposed design offers a promising approach for developing assistive technologies that adapt to individual physical characteristics, with potential applications in elderly care and rehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12653">High-dimensional structure underlying individual differences in naturalistic visual experience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do different brains create unique visual experiences from identical sensory input? While neural representations vary across individuals, the fundamental architecture underlying these differences remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that individual visual experience emerges from a high-dimensional neural geometry across the visual cortical hierarchy. Using spectral decomposition of fMRI responses during naturalistic movie viewing, we find that idiosyncratic neural patterns persist across multiple orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. Remarkably, each dimensional range encodes qualitatively distinct aspects of individual processing, and this multidimensional neural geometry predicts subsequent behavioral differences in memory recall. These fine-grained patterns of inter-individual variability cannot be reduced to those detected by conventional intersubject correlation measures. Our findings demonstrate that subjective visual experience arises from information integrated across an expansive multidimensional manifold. This geometric framework offers a powerful new lens for understanding how diverse brains construct unique perceptual worlds from shared experiences.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13361">Feedback-Driven Dynamical Model for Axonal Extension on Parallel Micropatterns</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.

                arXiv:2505.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous papers, we demonstrated that an ontology of quantum mechanics, described in terms of states and events with internal phenomenal aspects (a form of panprotopsychism), is well suited to explain consciousness. We showed that the combination problems of qualities, structures and subjects in panpsychism and panprotopsychism stem from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics regarding supervenience, which are not applicable at the quantum level. Within this view, consciousness arises in entangled quantum systems coupled to the neural network of the brain. In entangled systems, the properties of individual parts disappear, giving rise to an exponential number of emergent properties and states. Here, we analyze self-consciousness as the capacity to view oneself as a subject of experience. The causal openness of quantum systems provides self-conscious beings the ability to make independent choices and decisions, reflecting a sense of self-governance and autonomy. In this context, the issue of personal identity takes a new form free from the problems of the simple view or the reductive approaches.

                arXiv:2505.12204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.

                arXiv:2505.12387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

Abstract: EEG preprocessing varies widely between studies, but its impact on classification performance remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we analyzed seven experiments with 40 participants drawn from the public ERP CORE dataset. We systematically varied key preprocessing steps, such as filtering, referencing, baseline interval, detrending, and multiple artifact correction steps. Then we performed trial-wise binary classification (i.e., decoding) using neural networks (EEGNet), or time-resolved logistic regressions. Our findings demonstrate that preprocessing choices influenced decoding performance considerably. All artifact correction steps reduced decoding performance across experiments and models, while higher high-pass filter cutoffs consistently increased decoding performance. For EEGNet, baseline correction further increased decoding performance, and for time-resolved classifiers, linear detrending, and lower low-pass filter cutoffs increased decoding performance. The influence of other preprocessing choices was specific for each experiment or event-related potential component. The current results underline the importance of carefully selecting preprocessing steps for EEG-based decoding. While uncorrected artifacts may increase decoding performance, this comes at the expense of interpretability and model validity, as the model may exploit structured noise rather than the neural signal.

Abstract: There is renewed interest in modeling and understanding the nervous system of the nematode $\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}$ ($\textit{C. elegans}$), as this small model system provides a path to bridge the gap between nervous system structure (connectivity) and function (physiology). However, existing physiology datasets, whether involving passive recording or stimulation, are in distinct formats, and connectome datasets require preprocessing before analysis can commence. Here we compile and homogenize datasets of neural activity and connectivity. Our neural activity dataset is derived from 12 $\textit{C. elegans}$ neuroimaging experiments, while our connectivity dataset is compiled from 9 connectome annotations based on 3 primary electron microscopy studies and 1 signal propagation study. Physiology datasets, collected under varying protocols, measure calcium fluorescence in labeled subsets of the worm's 300 neurons. Our preprocessing pipeline standardizes these datasets by consistently ordering labeled neurons and resampling traces to a common sampling rate, yielding recordings from approximately 900 worms and 250 uniquely labeled neurons. The connectome datasets, collected from electron microscopy reconstructions, represent the entire nervous system as a graph of connections. Our collection is accessible on HuggingFace, facilitating analysis of the structure-function relationship in biology using modern neural network architectures and enabling cross-lab and cross-animal comparisons.

Abstract: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique that measures the intricate brain dynamics underlying cognitive processes with an unparalleled combination of high temporal and spatial precision. MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG.

                arXiv:2502.04460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normative mapping is a framework used to map population-level features of health-related variables. It is widely used in neuroscience research, but the literature lacks established protocols in modalities that do not support healthy control measurements, such as intracranial EEG (icEEG). An icEEG normative map would allow researchers to learn about population-level brain activity and enable comparison of individual data against these norms to identify abnormalities. Currently, no standardised guide exists for transforming clinical data into a normative, regional icEEG map. Papers often cite different software and numerous articles to summarise the lengthy method, making it laborious for other researchers to understand or apply the process. Our protocol seeks to remedy this gap by providing a dataflow guide and key decision points that summarise existing methods. This protocol is used heavily in published works from our own lab (twelve peer-reviewed journal publications). Briefly, we take as input, icEEG recordings and neuroimaging data from people with epilepsy who are undergoing evaluation for resective surgery. As final outputs, we obtain a normative icEEG map, comprising signal properties localised to brain regions. Optionally, we can also process new subjects through the same pipeline and obtain their z-scores (or centiles) in each brain region, for abnormality detection and localisation. To date, a single, cohesive, dataflow pipeline for generating normative icEEG maps, along with abnormality mapping, has not been created. We envisage that this dataflow guide will not only increase understanding and application of normative mapping methods, but will also improve the consistency and quality of studies in the field.

                arXiv:2504.16096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease, are challenging to diagnose, particularly in the early stages where symptoms closely resemble healthy controls. Existing brain network analysis methods primarily focus on graph-based models that rely solely on imaging data, which may overlook important non-imaging factors and limit the model's predictive power and interpretability. In this paper, we present BrainPrompt, an innovative framework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge-driven prompts, enabling more effective capture of complex, non-imaging information and external knowledge for neurological disease identification. BrainPrompt integrates three types of knowledge-driven prompts: (1) ROI-level prompts to encode the identity and function of each brain region, (2) subject-level prompts that incorporate demographic information, and (3) disease-level prompts to capture the temporal progression of disease. By leveraging these multi-level prompts, BrainPrompt effectively harnesses knowledge-enhanced multi-modal information from LLMs, enhancing the model's capability to predict neurological disease stages and meanwhile offers more interpretable results. We evaluate BrainPrompt on two resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from neurological disorders, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a biomarker study demonstrates the framework's ability to extract valuable and interpretable information aligned with domain knowledge in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02564">Probing Human Visual Robustness with Neurally-Guided Deep Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.02564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans effortlessly navigate the dynamic visual world, yet deep neural networks (DNNs), despite excelling at many visual tasks, are surprisingly vulnerable to minor image perturbations. Past theories suggest that human visual robustness arises from a representational space that evolves along the ventral visual stream (VVS) of the brain to increasingly tolerate object transformations. To test whether robustness is supported by such progression as opposed to being confined exclusively to specialized higher-order regions, we trained DNNs to align their representations with human neural responses from consecutive VVS regions while performing visual tasks. We demonstrate a hierarchical improvement in DNN robustness: alignment to higher-order VVS regions leads to greater improvement. To investigate the mechanism behind such robustness gains, we test a prominent hypothesis that attributes human robustness to the unique geometry of neural category manifolds in the VVS. We first reveal that more desirable manifold properties, specifically, smaller extent and better linear separability, indeed emerge across the human VVS. These properties can be inherited by neurally aligned DNNs and predict their subsequent robustness gains. Furthermore, we show that supervision from neural manifolds alone, via manifold guidance, is sufficient to qualitatively reproduce the hierarchical robustness improvements. Together, these results highlight the critical role of the evolving representational space across VVS in achieving robust visual inference, in part through the formation of more linearly separable category manifolds, which may in turn be leveraged to develop more robust AI systems.

The appendix discusses the more subtle mathematical details, targeting readers who have already studied the active inference literature but struggle to make sense of the mathematical details and derivations. Throughout, we emphasize precise and standard mathematical notation, ensuring consistency with existing texts and linking all equations to widely used references on active inference. Additionally, we provide Python code that implements the action selection and learning mechanisms described in this paper and is compatible with pymdp environments.

Abstract: Human vision models are at the core of image processing. For instance, classical approaches to the problem of image quality are based on models that include knowledge about human vision. However, nowadays, deep learning approaches have obtained competitive results by simply approaching this problem as regression of human decisions, and training an standard network on human-rated datasets. These approaches have the advantages of being easily adaptable to a particular problem and they fit very efficiently when data is available. However, mainly due to the excess of parameters, they have the problems of lack of interpretability, and over-fitting. Here we propose a vision model that combines the best of both worlds by using a parametric neural network architecture. We parameterize the layers to have bioplausible functionality, and provide a set of bioplausible parameters. We analyzed different versions of the model and compared it with the non-parametric version. The parametric models achieve a three orders of magnitude reduction in the number of parameters without suffering in regression performance. Furthermore, we show that the parametric models behave better during training and are easier to interpret as vision models. Interestingly, we find that, even initialized with bioplausible trained for regression using human rated datasets, which we call the feature-spreading problem. This suggests that the deep learning approach is inherently flawed, and emphasizes the need to evaluate and train models beyond regression.

                arXiv:2505.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) are challenging due to their changing conditions. This requires algorithms to be highly adaptable and efficient in terms of finding rapidly new optimal solutions under changing conditions. Traditional approaches often depend on explicit change detection, which can be impractical or inefficient when the change detection is unreliable or unfeasible. We propose Perturbation and Speciation-Based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSPSO), a robust algorithm for uninformed dynamic optimization without requiring the information of environmental changes. The PSPSO combines speciation-based niching, deactivation, and a newly proposed random perturbation mechanism to handle DOPs. PSPSO leverages a cyclical multi-population framework, strategic resource allocation, and targeted noisy updates, to adapt to dynamic environments. We compare PSPSO with several state-of-the-art algorithms on the Generalized Moving Peaks Benchmark (GMPB), which covers a variety of scenarios, including simple and multi-modal dynamic optimization, frequent and intense changes, and high-dimensional spaces. Our results show that PSPSO outperforms other state-of-the-art uninformed algorithms in all scenarios and leads to competitive results compared to informed algorithms. In particular, PSPSO shows strength in functions with high dimensionality or high frequency of change in the GMPB. The ablation study showed the importance of the random perturbation component.

                arXiv:2505.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are recognized as a promising avenue for achieving efficient, low-energy neuromorphic computing. Recent advancements have focused on directly training high-performance SNNs by estimating the approximate gradients of spiking activity through a continuous function with constant sharpness, known as surrogate gradient (SG) learning. However, as spikes propagate among neurons, the distribution of membrane potential dynamics (MPD) will deviate from the gradient-available interval of fixed SG, hindering SNNs from searching the optimal solution space. To maintain the stability of gradient flows, SG needs to align with evolving MPD. Here, we propose adaptive gradient learning for SNNs by exploiting MPD, namely MPD-AGL. It fully accounts for the underlying factors contributing to membrane potential shifts and establishes a dynamic association between SG and MPD at different timesteps to relax gradient estimation, which provides a new degree of freedom for SG learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance at low latency. Moreover, it increases the proportion of neurons that fall into the gradient-available interval compared to fixed SG, effectively mitigating the gradient vanishing problem.

Abstract: Neuromorphic hardware has been proposed and also been produced for decades. One of the main goals of this hardware is to leverage distributed computing and event-driven circuit design and achieve power-efficient AI system. The name ``neuromorphic'' is derived from its spiking and local computational nature, which mimics the fundamental activity of an animal's nervous system. Neurons as well as distributed computing cores of neuromorphic hardware use single bit data, called a spike, for inter-communication. To construct a spiking model for neuromorphic hardware, the conventional approach is to build spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNN replaces the nonlinearity part of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the realm of deep learning with spiking neurons, where the spiking neuron mimic the basic behavior of bio-neurons. However, there is still a performance gap between SNN and ANN counterpart. In this paper, we explore a new path from ANN to neuromorphic hardware. The SDANN framework is proposed to directly implement quantized ANN on hardware, eliminating the need for tuning the trainable parameters or any performance degradation. With the power of quantized ANN, our SDANN provides a lower bound of the functionality of neuromorphic hardware. Meanwhile, we have also proposed scaling methods in case of the limited bit-width support in hardware. Spike sparsity methods are also provided for further energy optimization. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the usefulness of our SDANN framework. Beyond toy examples and software implementation, we successfully deploy the spiking models of SDANN on real neuromorphic hardware, demonstrating the feasibility of the SDANN framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12281">Bishop: Sparsified Bundling Spiking Transformers on Heterogeneous Cores with Error-Constrained Pruning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Bishop, the first dedicated hardware accelerator architecture and HW/SW co-design framework for spiking transformers that optimally represents, manages, and processes spike-based workloads while exploring spatiotemporal sparsity and data reuse. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Token-Time Bundle (TTB), a container that bundles spiking data of a set of tokens over multiple time points. Our heterogeneous accelerator architecture Bishop concurrently processes workload packed in TTBs and explores intra- and inter-bundle multiple-bit weight reuse to significantly reduce memory access. Bishop utilizes a stratifier, a dense core array, and a sparse core array to process MLP blocks and projection layers. The stratifier routes high-density spiking activation workload to the dense core and low-density counterpart to the sparse core, ensuring optimized processing tailored to the given spatiotemporal sparsity level. To further reduce data access and computation, we introduce a novel Bundle Sparsity-Aware (BSA) training pipeline that enhances not only the overall but also structured TTB-level firing sparsity. Moreover, the processing efficiency of self-attention layers is boosted by the proposed Error-Constrained TTB Pruning (ECP), which trims activities in spiking queries, keys, and values both before and after the computation of spiking attention maps with a well-defined error bound. Finally, we design a reconfigurable TTB spiking attention core to efficiently compute spiking attention maps by executing highly simplified "AND" and "Accumulate" operations. On average, Bishop achieves a 5.91x speedup and 6.11x improvement in energy efficiency over previous SNN accelerators, while delivering higher accuracy across multiple datasets.

                arXiv:2505.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tackling complex optimization problems often relies on expert-designed heuristics, typically crafted through extensive trial and error. Recent advances demonstrate that large language models (LLMs), when integrated into well-designed evolutionary search frameworks, can autonomously discover high-performing heuristics at a fraction of the traditional cost. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on verbal guidance, i.e., manipulating the prompt generation process, to steer the evolution of heuristics, without adapting the underlying LLM. We propose a hybrid framework that combines verbal and numerical guidance, the latter achieved by fine-tuning the LLM via reinforcement learning based on the quality of generated heuristics. This joint optimization allows the LLM to co-evolve with the search process. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across various optimization tasks, running locally on a single 24GB GPU using a 7B model with INT4 quantization. It surpasses methods that rely solely on verbal guidance, even when those use significantly more powerful API-based models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12292">SpikeX: Exploring Accelerator Architecture and Network-Hardware Co-Optimization for Sparse Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising biologically plausible models of computation which utilize a spiking binary activation function similar to that of biological neurons. SNNs are well positioned to process spatiotemporal data, and are advantageous in ultra-low power and real-time processing. Despite a large body of work on conventional artificial neural network accelerators, much less attention has been given to efficient SNN hardware accelerator design. In particular, SNNs exhibit inherent unstructured spatial and temporal firing sparsity, an opportunity yet to be fully explored for great hardware processing efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel systolic-array SNN accelerator architecture, called SpikeX, to take on the challenges and opportunities stemming from unstructured sparsity while taking into account the unique characteristics of spike-based computation. By developing an efficient dataflow targeting expensive multi-bit weight data movements, SpikeX reduces memory access and increases data sharing and hardware utilization for computations spanning across both time and space, thereby significantly improving energy efficiency and inference latency. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of SNN network and hardware co-design, we develop a co-optimization methodology facilitating not only hardware-aware SNN training but also hardware accelerator architecture search, allowing joint network weight parameter optimization and accelerator architectural reconfiguration. This end-to-end network/accelerator co-design approach offers a significant reduction of 15.1x-150.87x in energy-delay-product(EDP) without comprising model accuracy.

                arXiv:2505.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an advanced hybrid optimization (GMPA) algorithm to effectively address the inherent limitations of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) when applied to complex optimization scenarios. Specifically, GMPA integrates essential features from the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) into the GWO framework, enabling superior performance through enhanced exploration and exploitation balance. The evaluation utilizes the GTOPX benchmark dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA), encompassing highly complex interplanetary trajectory optimization problems characterized by pronounced nonlinearity and multiple conflicting objectives reflective of real-world aerospace scenarios. Central to GMPA's methodology is an elite matrix, borrowed from MPA, designed to preserve and refine high-quality solutions iteratively, thereby promoting solution diversity and minimizing premature convergence. Furthermore, GMPA incorporates a three-phase position updating mechanism combined with L\'evy flights and Brownian motion to significantly bolster exploration capabilities, effectively mitigating the risk of stagnation in local optima. GMPA dynamically retains historical information on promising search areas, leveraging the memory storage features intrinsic to MPA, facilitating targeted exploitation and refinement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate GMPA's superior effectiveness compared to traditional GWO and other advanced metaheuristic algorithms, achieving markedly improved convergence rates and solution quality across GTOPX benchmarks. Consequently, GMPA emerges as a robust, efficient, and adaptive optimization approach particularly suitable for high-dimensional and complex aerospace trajectory optimization, offering significant insights and practical advancements in hybrid metaheuristic optimization techniques.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12627">Efficient Heuristics Generation for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems Using Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies exploited Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate heuristics for solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), by prompting LLMs to first provide search directions and then derive heuristics accordingly. However, the absence of task-specific knowledge in prompts often leads LLMs to provide unspecific search directions, obstructing the derivation of well-performing heuristics. Moreover, evaluating the derived heuristics remains resource-intensive, especially for those semantically equivalent ones, often requiring omissible resource expenditure. To enable LLMs to provide specific search directions, we propose the Hercules algorithm, which leverages our designed Core Abstraction Prompting (CAP) method to abstract the core components from elite heuristics and incorporate them as prior knowledge in prompts. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of CAP in reducing unspecificity and provide empirical results in this work. To reduce computing resources required for evaluating the derived heuristics, we propose few-shot Performance Prediction Prompting (PPP), a first-of-its-kind method for the Heuristic Generation (HG) task. PPP leverages LLMs to predict the fitness values of newly derived heuristics by analyzing their semantic similarity to previously evaluated ones. We further develop two tailored mechanisms for PPP to enhance predictive accuracy and determine unreliable predictions, respectively. The use of PPP makes Hercules more resource-efficient and we name this variant Hercules-P. Extensive experiments across four HG tasks, five COPs, and eight LLMs demonstrate that Hercules outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based HG algorithms, while Hercules-P excels at minimizing required computing resources. In addition, we illustrate the effectiveness of CAP, PPP, and the other proposed mechanisms by conducting relevant ablation studies.

                arXiv:2505.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage: each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation (UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.

Abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization, and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths, widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression, regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.

                arXiv:2505.12806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal networks offer an intuitive framework to understand influence structures within time series systems. However, the presence of cycles can obscure dynamic relationships and hinder hierarchical analysis. These networks are typically identified through multivariate predictive modelling, but enforcing acyclic constraints significantly increases computational and analytical complexity. Despite recent advances, there remains a lack of simple, flexible approaches that are easily tailorable to specific problem instances. We propose an evolutionary approach to fitting acyclic vector autoregressive processes and introduces a novel hierarchical representation that directly models structural elements within a time series system. On simulated datasets, our model retains most of the predictive accuracy of unconstrained models and outperforms permutation-based alternatives. When applied to a dataset of 100 cryptocurrency return series, our method generates acyclic causal networks capturing key structural properties of the unconstrained model. The acyclic networks are approximately sub-graphs of the unconstrained networks, and most of the removed links originate from low-influence nodes. Given the high levels of feature preservation, we conclude that this cryptocurrency price system functions largely hierarchically. Our findings demonstrate a flexible, intuitive approach for identifying hierarchical causal networks in time series systems, with broad applications to fields like econometrics and social network analysis.

                arXiv:2505.12944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.

                arXiv:2505.12982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses, focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies. We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem sizes up to $40{,}000$.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13058">A Path to Universal Neural Cellular Automata</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13078">Stochastic Orthogonal Regularization for deep projective priors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many crucial tasks of image processing and computer vision are formulated as inverse problems. Thus, it is of great importance to design fast and robust algorithms to solve these problems. In this paper, we focus on generalized projected gradient descent (GPGD) algorithms where generalized projections are realized with learned neural networks and provide state-of-the-art results for imaging inverse problems. Indeed, neural networks allow for projections onto unknown low-dimensional sets that model complex data, such as images. We call these projections deep projective priors. In generic settings, when the orthogonal projection onto a lowdimensional model set is used, it has been shown, under a restricted isometry assumption, that the corresponding orthogonal PGD converges with a linear rate, yielding near-optimal convergence (within the class of GPGD methods) in the classical case of sparse recovery. However, for deep projective priors trained with classical mean squared error losses, there is little guarantee that the hypotheses for linear convergence are satisfied. In this paper, we propose a stochastic orthogonal regularization of the training loss for deep projective priors. This regularization is motivated by our theoretical results: a sufficiently good approximation of the orthogonal projection guarantees linear stable recovery with performance close to orthogonal PGD. We show experimentally, using two different deep projective priors (based on autoencoders and on denoising networks), that our stochastic orthogonal regularization yields projections that improve convergence speed and robustness of GPGD in challenging inverse problem settings, in accordance with our theoretical findings.

                arXiv:2505.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation. However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". Through an extensive analysis of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer architectures. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).

                arXiv:2505.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate-economic modeling under uncertainty presents significant computational challenges that may limit policymakers' ability to address climate change effectively. This paper explores neural network-based approaches for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems arising from models that incorporate ambiguity aversion in climate mitigation decisions. We develop a continuous-time endogenous-growth economic model that accounts for multiple mitigation pathways, including emission-free capital and carbon intensity reductions. Given the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of these models, traditional numerical methods become computationally intractable. We benchmark several neural network architectures against finite-difference generated solutions, evaluating their ability to capture the dynamic interactions between uncertainty, technology transitions, and optimal climate policy. Our findings demonstrate that appropriate neural architecture selection significantly impacts both solution accuracy and computational efficiency when modeling climate-economic systems under uncertainty. These methodological advances enable more sophisticated modeling of climate policy decisions, allowing for better representation of technology transitions and uncertainty-critical elements for developing effective mitigation strategies in the face of climate change.

                arXiv:2501.14539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of abstract rules from exemplars is central to the brain's capability of flexible generalization and rapid adaptation. However, the internal organizing mechanisms underlying rule abstraction remain elusive, largely due to the limitations of conventional models that lack intrinsic neuronal heterogeneity, making it hard to examine neuronal and structural differentiations. Inspired by astrocyte-mediated neuromodulation, this work introduces a hierarchically modulated recurrent spiking neural network (HM-RSNN) that can tune intrinsic neuronal properties, where a global stage simulates calcium wave-driven task-specific configuration and a local one mimics gliotransmitter-mediated fine-tuning. We conduct modeling using HM-RSNN across four cognitive tasks and rule abstraction contingent differentiation is observed at both network and neuron levels, leading to better performance compared to artificial neural networks. These findings highlight the critical role of dynamic internal organization in supporting the accomplishment of various cognitive tasks.

                arXiv:2501.16745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that mimic how neurons in the brain communicate through discrete spikes, which have great potential in various tasks due to their energy efficiency and temporal processing capabilities. SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks, and inspired by traditional Transformers, several studies have demonstrated that spiking absolute positional encoding can help capture sequential relationships for input data, enhancing the capabilities of spiking Transformers for tasks such as sequential modeling and image classification. However, how to incorporate relative positional information into SNNs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce several strategies to approximate relative positional encoding (RPE) in spiking Transformers while preserving the binary nature of spikes. Firstly, we formally prove that encoding relative distances with Gray Code ensures that the binary representations of positional indices maintain a constant Hamming distance whenever their decimal values differ by a power of two, and we propose Gray-PE based on this property. In addition, we propose another RPE method called Log-PE, which combines the logarithmic form of the relative distance matrix directly into the spiking attention map. Furthermore, we extend our RPE methods to a two-dimensional form, making them suitable for processing image patches. We evaluate our RPE methods on various tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification, and the experimental results demonstrate a satisfying performance gain by incorporating our RPE methods across many architectures.

                arXiv:2503.02303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many tasks require flexibly modifying perception and behavior based on current goals. Humans can retrieve episodic memories from days to years ago, using them to contextualize and generalize behaviors across novel but structurally related situations. The brain's ability to control episodic memories based on task demands is often attributed to interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). We propose a reinforcement learning model that incorporates a PFC-HPC interaction mechanism for goal-directed generalization. In our model, the PFC learns to generate query-key representations to encode and retrieve goal-relevant episodic memories, modulating HPC memories top-down based on current task demands. Moreover, the PFC adapts its encoding and retrieval strategies dynamically when faced with multiple goals presented in a blocked, rather than interleaved, manner. Our results show that: (1) combining working memory with selectively retrieved episodic memory allows transfer of decisions among similar environments or situations, (2) top-down control from PFC over HPC improves learning of arbitrary structural associations between events for generalization to novel environments compared to a bottom-up sensory-driven approach, and (3) the PFC encodes generalizable representations during both encoding and retrieval of goal-relevant memories, whereas the HPC exhibits event-specific representations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of goal-directed prefrontal control over hippocampal episodic memory for decision-making in novel situations and suggest a computational mechanism by which PFC-HPC interactions enable flexible behavior.

Abstract: The neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) method has shown great potential for solving routing problems of intelligent transportation systems without requiring expert knowledge. However, existing constructive NCO methods still struggle to solve large-scale instances, which significantly limits their application prospects. To address these crucial shortcomings, this work proposes a novel Instance-Conditioned Adaptation Model (ICAM) for better large-scale generalization of neural routing solvers. In particular, we design a simple yet efficient instance-conditioned adaptation function to significantly improve the generalization performance of existing NCO models with a small time and memory overhead. In addition, with a systematic investigation on the performance of information incorporation between different attention mechanisms, we further propose a powerful yet low-complexity instance-conditioned adaptation module to generate better solutions for instances across different scales. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and benchmark instances show that our proposed method is capable of obtaining promising results with a very fast inference time in solving large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs), Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs), and Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems (ATSPs). Our code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/ICAM.

                arXiv:2412.00059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tuning step sizes is crucial for the stability and efficiency of optimization algorithms. While adaptive coordinate-wise step sizes have been shown to outperform scalar step size in first-order methods, their use in second-order methods is still under-explored and more challenging. Current approaches, including hypergradient descent and cutting plane methods, offer limited improvements or encounter difficulties in second-order contexts. To address these limitations, we first conduct a theoretical analysis within the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) framework, a prominent quasi-Newton method, and derive sufficient conditions for coordinate-wise step sizes that ensure convergence and stability. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce a novel learn-to-optimize (L2O) method that employs LSTM-based networks to learn optimal step sizes by leveraging insights from past optimization trajectories, while inherently respecting the derived theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements over scalar step size methods and hypergradient descent-based method, offering up to 4$\times$ faster convergence across diverse optimization tasks.

Abstract: With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life, Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone.

                arXiv:2501.18280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained wide attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful output, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the output distribution of text embedding models is severely biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel, efficient methods to search for **universal magic words** that attack text embedding models. Universal magic words as suffixes can shift the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, thus manipulating the similarity of any text pair and misleading safeguards. Attackers can jailbreak the safeguards by appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words. Experiments show that magic word attacks significantly degrade safeguard performance on JailbreakBench, cause real-world chatbots to produce harmful outputs in full-pipeline attacks, and generalize across input/output texts, models, and languages. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense methods against such attacks, which can correct the bias of text embeddings and improve downstream performance in a train-free manner.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03137">Learning to Reduce Search Space for Generalizable Neural Routing Solver</a></h4>

Abstract: Constructive neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has attracted growing research attention due to its ability to solve complex routing problems without relying on handcrafted rules. However, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in generalizing to large-scale problems due to high computational complexity and inefficient capture of structural patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning-based search space reduction method that adaptively selects a small set of promising candidate nodes at each step of the constructive NCO process. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed heuristics, our selection model dynamically prioritizes nodes based on learned patterns, significantly reducing the search space while maintaining solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained solely on 100-node instances from uniform distribution, generalizes remarkably well to large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) instances with up to 1 million nodes from the uniform distribution and over 80K nodes from other distributions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10771">Pipelining Kruskal's: A Neuromorphic Approach for Minimum Spanning Tree</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.10771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, characterized by its event-driven computation and massive parallelism, is particularly effective for handling data-intensive tasks in low-power environments, such as computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) for large-scale graphs. The introduction of dynamic synaptic modifications provides new design opportunities for neuromorphic algorithms. Building on this foundation, we propose an SNN-based union-sort routine and a pipelined version of Kruskal's algorithm for MST computation. The event-driven nature of our method allows for the concurrent execution of two completely decoupled stages: neuromorphic sorting and union-find. Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art Prim 's-based methods on large-scale graphs from the DIMACS10 dataset, achieving speedups by 269.67x to 1283.80x, with a median speedup of 540.76x. We further evaluate the pipelined implementation against two serial variants of Kruskal's algorithm, which rely on neuromorphic sorting and neuromorphic radix sort, showing significant performance advantages in most scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98800">Perturbation-response analysis of in silico metabolic dynamics revealed hard-coded responsiveness in the cofactors and network sparsity</a></h4>

              
                Homeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of living systems. Unlike rigidity, homeostasis necessitates that systems respond flexibly to diverse environments. Understanding the dynamics of biochemical systems when subjected to perturbations is essential for the development of a quantitative theory of homeostasis. In this study, we analyze the response of bacterial metabolism to externally imposed perturbations using kinetic models of <i>Escherichia coli</i>’s central carbon metabolism in nonlinear regimes. We found that three distinct kinetic models consistently display strong responses to perturbations; in the strong responses, minor initial discrepancies in metabolite concentrations from steady-state values amplify over time, resulting in significant deviations. This pronounced responsiveness is a characteristic feature of metabolic dynamics, especially since such strong responses are seldom seen in toy models of the metabolic network. Subsequent numerical studies show that adenyl cofactors consistently influence the responsiveness of the metabolic systems across models. Additionally, we examine the impact of network structure on metabolic dynamics, demonstrating that as the metabolic network becomes denser, the perturbation response diminishes—a trend observed commonly in the models. To confirm the significance of cofactors and network structure, we constructed a simplified metabolic network model underscoring their importance. By identifying the structural determinants of responsiveness, our findings offer implications for bacterial physiology, the evolution of metabolic networks, and the design principles for robust artificial metabolism in synthetic biology and bioengineering.

                Cryo-EM single-particle analyses typically require target macromolecule concentration at 0.05~5.0 mg/ml, which is often difficult to achieve. Here, we devise <i>Ma</i><span class="underline">g</span>netic <i>I</i>solation and <i>C</i>oncentration (MagIC)-cryo-EM, a technique enabling direct structural analysis of targets captured on magnetic beads, thereby reducing the targets’ concentration requirement to &lt;0.0005 mg/mL. Adapting MagIC-cryo-EM to a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation protocol, we characterized structural variations of the linker histone H1.8-associated nucleosomes that were isolated from interphase and metaphase chromosomes in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extract. Combining <i>Du</i>plicated <i>S</i>election <i>T</i>o <i>E</i>xclude <i>R</i>ubbish particles (DuSTER), a particle curation method that excludes low signal-to-noise ratio particles, we also resolved the 3D cryo-EM structures of nucleoplasmin NPM2 co-isolated with the linker histone H1.8 and revealed distinct open and closed structural variants. Our study demonstrates the utility of MagIC-cryo-EM for structural analysis of scarce macromolecules in heterogeneous samples and provides structural insights into the cell cycle-regulation of H1.8 association to nucleosomes.

We find the translation environment is significantly altered in a manner that is distinct from the <I>Fmr1<sup>&ndash;/y</sup></I> model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), another monogenic model of autism and intellectual disability. The <I>Syngap<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> translatome is enriched for regulators of DNA repair and mimics changes induced with chemical LTP (cLTP) in WT. This includes a striking upregulation in the translation of mRNAs with a longer-length (&gt;2&nbsp;kb) coding sequence (CDS). In contrast, long CDS transcripts are downregulated with induction of Gp1 metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) in WT, and in the <I>Fmr1<sup>&ndash;/y</sup></I> model that exhibits occluded mGluR-LTD. Together, our results show the <I>Syngap<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> and <I>Fmr1<sup>&ndash;/y</sup></I> models mimic the translation environments of LTP and LTD, respectively, consistent with the saturation of plasticity states in each model. Moreover, we show that translation of &gt;2&nbsp;kb mRNAs is a defining feature of LTP that is oppositely regulated during LTD, revealing a novel mRNA signature of plasticity.</p>

Advancements in calcium indicators and optical techniques have made optical neural recording common in neuroscience. As data volumes grow, streamlining the analysis pipelines for image preprocessing, signal extraction, and subsequent neural activity analyses becomes essential. Challenges in analysis includes 1) ensuring data quality of original and processed data at each step. 2) Selecting optimal algorithms and their parameters from numerous options, each with its own pros and cons, by implementing or installing them manually. 3) systematically recording each analysis step for reproducibility 4) adopting standard data formats for data sharing and meta-analyses. To address these challenges, we developed Optical Neuroimage Studio (OptiNiSt), a scalable, extendable, and reproducible framework for creating calcium data analysis pipelines. OptiNiSt includes the following features. 1) Researchers can easily create analysis pipelines by selecting multiple processing modules, tuning their parameters, and visualizing the results at each step through a graphic user interface in a web browser. 2) In addition to pre-installed tools, new analysis algorithms can be easily added. 3) Once a processing pipeline is designed, the entire workflow with its modules and parameters are stored in a YAML file, which makes the pipeline reproducible and deployable on high-performance computing clusters. 4) OptiNiSt can read image data in a variety of file formats and store the analysis results in NWB (Neurodata Without Borders), a standard data format for data sharing. We expect that this framework will be helpful in standardizing optical neural data analysis protocols.

                <p>by Raffaele Marchesi, Nicolo Micheletti, Nicholas I-Hsien Kuo, Sebastiano Barbieri, Giuseppe Jurman, Venet Osmani</p>

Representation bias in health data can lead to unfair decisions and compromise the generalisability of research findings. As a consequence, underrepresented subpopulations, such as those from specific ethnic backgrounds or genders, do not benefit equally from clinical discoveries. Several approaches have been developed to mitigate representation bias, ranging from simple resampling methods, such as SMOTE, to recent approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). However, generating high-dimensional time-series synthetic health data remains a significant challenge. In response, we devised a novel architecture (CA-GAN) that synthesises authentic, high-dimensional time series data. CA-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation while avoiding mode collapse, a serious GAN failure. We perform evaluation using 7535 patients with hypotension and sepsis from two diverse, real-world clinical datasets. We show that synthetic data generated by our CA-GAN improves model fairness in Black patients as well as female patients when evaluated separately for each subpopulation. Furthermore, CA-GAN generates authentic data of the minority class while faithfully maintaining the original distribution of data, resulting in improved performance in a downstream predictive task.

The unprecedented mpox outbreak in non-endemic regions during 2022–2023, which has seen a recent resurgence in late 2023–2024, poses a significant public health threat. Despite its global spread, the viral dynamics of mpox infection and the specific characteristics driving these outbreaks remain insufficiently explored. We develop mathematical models to examine the interactions between host immune responses and the virus across three distinct infection routes (intravenous, intradermal, and intrarectal). The models are calibrated using viral load data from macaques infected through each of these three infection routes. Subsequently, we calculate the infectiousness of each infected macaque, finding that the proportion of presymptomatic infectiousness is highest in those infected via sexual contact, followed by skin-to-skin contact. These observations demonstrate that close contact during sexual activity is a significant route of viral transmission, with presymptomatic spread playing a crucial role in the 2022–2023 multi-country outbreak and potentially also in the 2023–2024 multi-source outbreak. Leveraging model predictions and infectiousness data, we assess the impact of antiviral drugs on interventions against mpox infection. Model simulations suggest that early administration of antiviral drugs can reduce peak viral loads, even in individuals with compromised immunity, particularly in cases of infection through skin-to-skin and sexual contact. These results underscore the importance of initiating antiviral treatment as early as possible for mpox-infected patients with compromised immune systems, such as those who are HIV-positive.

Biochemical Reaction Networks (BCRNs) model species and their interactions via reactions. They have been extensively used in chemistry and extended to biological settings by generalizing the reactions’ kinetics. However, detailed models of biochemical processes tend to result in complex BCRN models. We present the Meta-species Oriented Biosystem Syntax (MobsPy), a language designed to simplify the modeling process using the concept of meta-species. Meta-species are constructed using a bottom-up approach from base species, which represent elementary, simple characteristics. These characteristics are then combined to create meta-species with all their complex behavior. The combined species have characteristics that are the Cartesian product of the base species’ characteristics and feature inheritance of reactions involving the base species. New reactions can involve all the states of a meta-species or only a subset that is selected via a query. In particular, reactions of meta-species can express a state change of one of the reactants. MobsPy is deployed as a Python package. We showcase its modeling capabilities by building concise models for biochemical systems from the literature.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating form of dementia, with the number of affected individuals rising sharply. The main hallmarks of the disease include amyloid-beta plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, besides other pathological features that contribute to the disease's complexity. The causes of sporadic AD are multifactorial and mostly age-related and involve risk factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disorders. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is another type of dementia characterized by a spectrum of behaviors, memory, and motor abnormalities and associated with abnormal depositions of protein aggregation, including tau protein. Currently approved medications are symptomatic, and no disease-modifying therapy is available to halt the disease progression. Therefore, the development of multi-targeted therapeutic approaches could hold promise for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, including tauopathies. In this article, we will discuss the pathophysiology of AD and FTD, the proposed hypotheses, and current therapeutic approaches, highlighting the development of novel drug candidates and the progress of clinical trials in this field of research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-827/v2?src=rss">Adjusting for covariates representing potential confounders, mediators, or competing predictors in the presence of measurement error: Dispelling a potential misapprehension and insights for optimal study design with nutritional epidemiology examples [vers</a></h4>

              
                Background Variables such as dietary intake are measured with error yet frequently used in observational epidemiology. Although this limitation is sometimes noted, these variables are still often modeled as covariates without formal correction or sincere dialogue about measurement unreliability potentially weakening the validity of statistical conclusions. Further, larger sample sizes increase power (bias) to detect spurious correlations. Counterintuitively, recent work suggested a non-monotonic relationship between confounder unreliability and how much controlling for the confounder reduces (or induces) bias when testing for an exposure-outcome association. If true, such non-monotonicity would be especially concerning for applications such as nutrition, where measurement reliability varies substantially, and large sample sizes are common. Methods We offer a detailed derivations of the square partial correlation between the outcome and exposure, controlling for the confounder. In our derivation, the measurement reliabilities of exposures and confounders are not arbitrarily constrained to be equal. Further, our theoretical results are investigated using simulations. Results Reassuringly, these derivations and simulations show that the counterintuitive non-monotonicity relationship between confounder unreliability and how much controlling for the confounder reduces (or induces) bias when testing for an exposure-outcome association is an artifact of the arbitrary constraint which forces the measurement reliabilities of exposures and confounders to be equal, which that does not always hold. Conclusions The profound and manifold effects of measurement error on estimation and statistical conclusion validity in realistic scenarios indicate that merely mentioning measurement error as a limitation and then dispensing with it is not an adequate response. We also explore questions for optimal study design subject to resource constraints when considering reliability of exposures, covariates, and outcomes.

                Background Antiviral therapy is not routinely recommended for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients exhibiting persistently elevated serum HBV DNA levels (>2000 IU/mL), normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and without significant liver fibrosis – a clinical state termed the indeterminate phase. Recognizing the evolving treatment landscape, this study aimed to identify factors associated with liver fibrosis progression in chronic HBV patients within this indeterminate phase. Methods This retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted in the Infectious Disease and Hepato-gastroenterology departments of Farhat Hached University Hospital in Sousse, Tunisia, between January 2008 and January 2022. We included HBsAg-positive patients initially untreated, presenting at evaluation with a viral load >2,000 IU/mL for at least six months, normal ALT (<40 IU/L), and a fibrosis score of F0 and/or F1 (determined by liver biopsy or FibroScan). Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with liver fibrosis progression. Results A total of 97 patients were included, with a median age of 32.9 ± 9.1 years, and a female predominance (M/F ratio = 0.64). Fibrosis progression was observed in 16 patients (16.5%), with a mean delay of 70.9 ± 41.1 months. Univariate analysis revealed associations between fibrosis progression and the presence of comorbidities (p=0.001), a high initial viral load (p=0.004), elevated liver enzymes (p=0.001), and an increase in viral load during follow-up (p=0.002). Multivariate analysis identified comorbidities (p<0.001) and changes in ALT levels (p<0.001) as independent predictors of fibrosis progression. The AUROC of the initial viral load was 0.664 (95%CI: 0.500-0.820). Conclusion The presence of comorbidities and changes in ALT levels during follow-up were associated with fibrosis progression in the indeterminate phase of chronic HBV infection. These findings suggest a potential rationale for extending therapeutic indications to include this patient population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-500/v1?src=rss">“It’s messy and it’s massive”: How has the open science debate developed in the post-COVID era? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the global adoption of open science (OS) practices. However, as the pandemic subsides, the debate around OS continues to evolve. This study investigates how the pandemic has shaped the OS discourse and identifies key issues and challenges. Interviews were conducted with influential stakeholders across the research and publishing communities. The findings show that while many areas of debate remained constant, the ways in which they were discussed exposed underlying systemic challenges, which must be addressed if OS is to progress. These issues included the scope and definition of OS; regional variations in its implementation; the relationship between OS and fundamental questions of the purpose and practice of science; and the need to reform incentives and reward structures within the research system. A more complex understanding of OS is required, which takes into account the importance of equity and diversity and the challenges of implementing OS in different cultural and geographical contexts. The study emphasises the importance of shifting scientific culture to prioritise values such as quality, integrity, and openness, and reforming rewards structures to incentivise open practices.

                Background Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) is a well-known diagnosis among physiotherapists specializing in pediatric care, especially when working with infants. However, knowledge of bilateral torticollis is limited. The purpose of this article was to describe how bilateral torticollis may present itself clinically. Case Case I describes an infant with CMT with a sternocleidomastoid tumor (SMT) on the right side, with some limitation in rotation towards the right side and in lateral flexion towards the left side, the muscle on the right side was shortened. While sitting with support, he tilted his head to the left and was stronger in the lateral flexors on the left side which fits well with postural left-sided torticollis. The other infant had bilateral muscular torticollis, the sternocleidomastoid muscle had thickened bilaterally, and both active and passive rotations were affected. The head was held in flexion, and active rotation was severely limited on both sides. For both cases the therapeutic interventions were to gain a normal range of motion (ROM) and a good head position. Conclusions CMT can appear in different ways and may be bilateral. Both infants gained good ROM and better head position, however case I still needs some training. To gain more knowledge about bilateral CMT, we should follow these cases over a longer period of time. It is important to communicate and discuss our experiences with each other to understand rare cases of CMT.

                Background The provision of meals by colleges of nursing is geared towards meeting the nutrient requirements of students, thereby, improving their nutritional status. However, several studies revealed that the calorie and nutrient content of meals consumed at school frequently fall short of meeting the needs of schoolchildren in terms of nutrition. Methods The study estimated nutritional status and nutrient intake adequacy in a cross-sectional study consisting of 230 student nurses of Bole Nursing and Midwifery Training College-Ghana. Anthropometric measurements were used to determine students’ nutritional status while food frequency questionnaires and weighed food methods were used to assess dietary diversity and nutrient intake. HemoCue1 Hb 201+ was used to determine the haemoglobin concentration of the students. Results About 68% had BMIs within the range of acceptable body weight, whereas 4% and 27.8%, respectively, were underweight or overweight. There was a significant difference in BMI between males and females (p < .001) and among the program of study (p < .001). The anaemia prevalence in the study was 21.5% with the risk greater among females than males (p < .005). The waist-to-hip ratio was larger in 22 per cent of females than in 7.3 per cent of males (χ2 (1)= 6.086, p < .05). Conclusion The study found evidence of the triple burden of malnutrition in the school with undernutrition, overnutrition, and anaemia prevalence. More so, the college’s meals are not diversified and hence contribute less than the needed micronutrient requirements of students.

                Park et al. define a combination MYC and class IIa HDAC inhibition paradigm that has efficacy in NSCLC with high MYC and mitochondrial activity. Therapeutic benefit is dependent on MYC suppression and mitochondrial ROS production. In vivo activity is confirmed across multiple animal models of NSCLC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106450">Viral-mediated Pou5f1 (Oct4) overexpression and inhibition of Notch signaling synergistically induce neurogenic competence in mammalian Müller glia</a></h4>

              
                Retinal Müller glia in cold-blooded vertebrates can reprogram into neurogenic progenitors to replace neurons lost to injury, but mammals lack this ability. While recent studies have shown that transgenic overexpression of neurogenic bHLH factors and glial-specific disruption of NFI family transcription factors and Notch signaling induce neurogenic competence in mammalian Müller glia, induction of neurogenesis in wildtype glia has thus far proven elusive. Here, we report that viral-mediated overexpression of the pluripotency factor <i>Pou5f1 (Oct4)</i> induces transdifferentiation of mouse Müller glia into bipolar neurons, and synergistically stimulates glial-derived neurogenesis in parallel with Notch loss of function. Single-cell multiomic analysis shows that <i>Pou5f1</i> overexpression leads to widespread changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, inducing activity of both the neurogenic transcription factor Rfx4 and the Yamanaka factors Sox2 and Klf4. This study demonstrates that viral-mediated overexpression of <i>Pou5f1</i> induces neurogenic competence in adult mouse Müller glia, identifying mechanisms that could be used in cell-based therapies for treating retinal dystrophies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103205">Variation in albumin glycation rates in birds suggests resistance to relative hyperglycaemia rather than conformity to the pace of life syndrome hypothesis</a></h4>

              
                The pace of life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis suggests that organisms’ life history and physiological and behavioural traits should co-evolve. In this framework, how glycaemia (i.e. blood glucose levels) and its reaction with proteins and other compounds (i.e. glycation) covary with life history traits remain relatively under-investigated, despite the well-documented consequences of glucose and glycation on ageing, and therefore potentially on life history evolution. Birds are particularly relevant in this context given that they have the highest blood glucose levels within vertebrates and still higher mass-adjusted longevity compared to organisms with similar physiology as mammals. We thus performed a comparative analysis on glucose and albumin glycation rates of 88 bird species from 22 orders in relation to life history traits (body mass, clutch mass, maximum lifespan, and developmental time) and diet. Glucose levels correlated positively with albumin glycation rates in a non-linear fashion, suggesting resistance to glycation in species with higher glucose levels. Plasma glucose levels decreased with increasing body mass, but, contrary to what is predicted in the POLS hypothesis, glucose levels increased with maximum lifespan before reaching a plateau. Finally, terrestrial carnivores showed higher albumin glycation compared to omnivores despite not showing higher glucose, which we discuss may be related to additional factors as differential antioxidant levels or dietary composition in terms of fibres or polyunsaturated fatty acids. These results increase our knowledge about the diversity of glycaemia and glycation patterns across birds, pointing towards the existence of glycation resistance mechanisms within comparatively high glycaemic birds.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95733">A memory model of rodent spatial navigation in which place cells are memories arranged in a grid and grid cells are non-spatial</a></h4>

              
                A theory and neurocomputational model are presented that explain grid cell responses as the byproduct of equally dissimilar hippocampal memories. On this account, place and grid cells are best understood as the natural consequence of memory encoding and retrieval; a precise hexagonal grid is the exception rather than the rule, emerging when the animal explores a large surface that is devoid of landmarks and objects. In the proposed memory model, place cells represent memories that are conjunctions of both spatial and non-spatial attributes, and grid cells primarily represent the non-spatial attributes (e.g. sounds, surface texture, etc.) found throughout the two-dimensional recording enclosure. Place cells support memories of the locations where non-spatial attributes can be found (e.g. positions with a particular sound), which are arranged in a hexagonal lattice owing to memory encoding and consolidation processes (pattern separation) as applied to situations in which the non-spatial attributes are found at all locations of a two-dimensional surface. Grid cells exhibit their spatial firing pattern owing to feedback from hippocampal place cells (i.e. a hexagonal pattern of remembered locations for the non-spatial attribute represented by a grid cell). Model simulations explain a wide variety of results in the rodent spatial navigation literature.

                The intuitive manipulation of specific amino acids to alter the activity or specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 has been a topic of great interest. As a large multi-domain RNA-guided endonuclease, the intricate molecular crosstalk within the Cas9 protein hinges on its conformational dynamics, but a comprehensive understanding of the extent and timescale of the motions that drive its allosteric function and association with nucleic acids remains elusive. Here, we investigated the structure and multi-timescale molecular motions of the recognition (Rec) lobe of <i>Geo</i>Cas9, a thermophilic Cas9 from <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</i>. Our results provide new atomic details about the <i>Geo</i>Rec subdomains (<i>Geo</i>Rec1, <i>Geo</i>Rec2) and the full-length domain in solution. Two rationally designed mutants, K267E and R332A, enhanced and redistributed micro-millisecond flexibility throughout <i>Geo</i>Rec, and NMR studies of the interaction between <i>Geo</i>Rec and its guide RNA showed that mutations reduced this affinity and the stability of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Despite measured biophysical differences due to the mutations, DNA cleavage assays reveal no functional differences in on-target activity, and similar specificity. These data suggest that guide RNA interactions can be tuned at the biophysical level in the absence of major functional losses but also raise questions about the underlying mechanism of <i>Geo</i>Cas9, since analogous single-point mutations have significantly impacted on- and off-target DNA editing in mesophilic <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9. A K267E/R332A double mutant did also did not enhance <i>Geo</i>Cas9 specificity, highlighting the robust tolerance of mutations to the Rec lobe of <i>Geo</i>Cas9 and species-dependent complexity of Rec across Cas9 paralogs. Ultimately, this work provides an avenue by which to modulate the structure, motion, and guide RNA interactions at the level of the Rec lobe of <i>Geo</i>Cas9, setting the stage for future studies of <i>Geo</i>Cas9 variants and their effect on its allosteric mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102422">Crystal structure and catalytic mechanism of PL35 family glycosaminoglycan lyases with an ultrabroad substrate spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Recently, a new class of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) lyases (GAGases) belonging to PL35 family has been discovered with an ultrabroad substrate spectrum that can degrade three types of uronic acid-containing GAGs (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate) or even alginate. In this study, the structures of GAGase II from <i>Spirosoma fluviale</i> and GAGase VII from <i>Bacteroides intestinalis</i> DSM 17393 were determined at 1.9 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively, and their catalytic mechanism was investigated by the site-directed mutant of their crucial residues and molecular docking assay. Structural analysis showed that GAGase II and GAGase VII consist of an N-terminal (α/α)<sub>6</sub> toroid multidomain and a C-terminal two-layered β-sheet domain with Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Notably, although GAGases share similar folds and catalytic mechanisms with some GAG lyases and alginate lyases, they exhibit higher structural similarity with alginate lyases than GAG lyases, which may present a crucial structural evidence for the speculation that GAG lyases with (α/α)<sub>n</sub> toroid and antiparallel β-sheet structures arrived by a divergent evolution from alginate lyases with the same folds. Overall, this study not only solved the structure of PL35 GAG lyases for the first time and investigated their catalytic mechanism, especially the reason why GAGase III can additionally degrade alginate, but also provided a key clue in the divergent evolution of GAG lyases that originated from alginate lyases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105112">Cortical dynamics in hand/forelimb S1 and M1 evoked by brief photostimulation of the mouse’s hand</a></h4>

              
                Spiking activity along synaptic circuits linking primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas is fundamental for sensorimotor integration in cortex. Circuits along the ascending somatosensory pathway through mouse hand/forelimb S1 and M1 were recently described in detail (Yamawaki et al., 2021). Here, we characterize the peripherally evoked spiking dynamics in these two cortical areas. Brief (5 ms) optogenetic photostimulation of the hand generated short (~25 ms) barrages of activity first in S1 (onset latency 15 ms) then M1 (10 ms later). The estimated propagation speed was 20-fold faster from hand to S1 than from S1 to M1. Amplitudes in M1 were strongly attenuated. Responses were typically triphasic, with suppression and rebound following the initial peak. Evoked activity in S1 was biased to middle layers, consistent with thalamocortical connectivity, while that in M1 was biased to upper layers, consistent with corticocortical connectivity. Parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory interneurons were involved in each phase, accounting for three quarters of the initial spikes generated in S1, and their selective photostimulation sufficed to evoke suppression and rebound in both S1 and M1. Partial silencing of S1 by PV activation during hand stimulation reduced the M1 sensory responses. Overall, these results characterize how evoked spiking activity propagates along the hand/forelimb transcortical loop, and illuminate how in vivo cortical dynamics relate to the underlying synaptic circuit organization in this system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101630">MorphoCellSorter is an Andrews plot-based sorting approach to rank microglia according to their morphological features</a></h4>

              
                Microglia exhibit diverse morphologies reflecting environmental conditions, maturity, or functional states. Thus, morphological characterization provides important information to understand microglial roles and functions. Most recent morphological analysis relies on classifying cells based on morphological parameters. However, this classification may lack biological relevance, as microglial morphologies represent a continuum rather than distinct, separate groups, and do not correspond to mathematically defined clusters irrelevant of microglial cells function. Instead, we propose a new open-source tool, MorphoCellSorter, which assesses microglial morphology by automatically computing morphological criteria, using principal component analysis and Andrews plots to score cells. MorphoCellSorter properly ranked cells from various microglia datasets in mice and rats of different ages, from <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>ex vivo</i> models, that were acquired using diverse imaging techniques. This approach allowed for the discrimination of cell populations in various pathophysiological conditions. Finally, MorphoCellSorter offers a versatile, easy, and ready-to-use method to evaluate microglial morphological diversity that could easily be generalized to standardize practices across laboratories.

                Tendon injury occurs at high frequency and is difficult to repair. Identification of human stem cells being able to regenerate tendon will greatly facilitate the development of regenerative medicine for tendon injury. Genetic and functional analyses identify human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors with tenogenic differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo. Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors contributes to injured tendon repair and thus improves locomotor function. Interestingly, the tendon differentiation potential in mouse muscle stem cells is minimal and the higher TGFβ signaling level may be the key for the distinct feature of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. The discovery of bi-potential CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors highlights their potential as a novel adult stem cell source for tendon regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100337">Sensitivity to visual features in inattentional blindness</a></h4>

              
                The relation between attention, perception, and awareness is among the most fundamental problems in the science of the mind. One of the most striking and well-known phenomena bearing on this question is <i>inattentional blindness</i> (IB). In IB, naive observers fail to report clearly visible stimuli when their attention is otherwise engaged—famously missing a gorilla parading before their eyes. IB carries tremendous significance, both as evidence that awareness requires attention and as a tool in seeking the neural correlates of consciousness. However, such implications rest on a notoriously biased measure: asking participants whether they noticed anything unusual (and interpreting negative answers as reflecting a complete lack of perception). Here, in the largest ever set of IB studies, we show that, as a group, inattentionally blind participants can successfully report the location, color, and shape of stimuli they deny noticing, demonstrating that perceptual information remains accessible in IB. By introducing absent trials, we further show that observers are collectively biased to report not noticing in IB—essentially ‘playing it safe’ in reporting their sensitivity. These data provide the strongest evidence to date of significant residual visual sensitivity in IB. They also challenge the use of inattentional blindness to argue that awareness requires attention.

">Spatial Attention Weakly Modulates Visual Responses in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Visual responses in the cerebral cortex are strongly influenced by shifts in spatial attention. This modulation of visual processing includes changes in firing rate, decreased response variability, and decreased interneuronal correlations; all of which are thought to underlie enhanced visual perception near the center of attention at the cost of visual perception at other locations. Visual information from the retina is relayed to primary visual cortex via neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus. Although early studies describe an enhancement of LGN activity with spatial attention, more recent work has cast doubt on this view. Given its strategic position as the gateway to the cortex, an understanding of the effects of attention on visual processing in the LGN is important. We therefore performed experiments to reexamine the influence of covert spatial attention on the spiking activity of single units in the macaque LGN and applied a broad set of analyses and functional metrics to assess possible effects. Our results reveal a statistically significant effect of spatial attention in the LGN: firing rates were slightly higher and more reliable when monkeys directed attention towards the receptive fields of recorded neurons compared to when attention was directed to different retinotopic locations. However, effects were much smaller than previously reported (~1% vs ~4%) and further analyses suggest that effects are weak and inconsistent. Thus, while spatial attention does exert an influence in the LGN, its effects are weak and may have limited impact on downstream processing.

">Evidence-based guidelines for improving network detectability in rodent fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Mouse resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an increasingly popular tool for probing brain activity under experimental manipulations; however, there remains considerable variability in data quality throughout the field. There is a need for an accessible set of acquisition guidelines such that a baseline level of data quality can be attained regardless of domain expertise or specialized equipment (i.e. in anesthetized, free-breathing mice). In particular, there is a gap in the literature regarding the interpretation of physiological parameters as markers of anesthetic depth, and ultimately, data quality. To this end, we developed a set of acquisition guidelines after examining whether continuous physiological variables predict network detectability above and beyond categorical external variables (anesthetic dose, session, time) in C57Bl/7 and C3HeB/FeJ mice anesthetized with isoflurane-dexmedetomidine. Standard physiological metrics (respiration rate and heart rate) did not predict network detectability above and beyond anesthetic dose but instead depended strongly on strain and subject, thus we advise against tuning anesthesia based on respiration or heart rate when the goal is obtaining clear resting-state networks. The most important predictor of improved network detectability was a low isoflurane dose of 0.23%, hence we recommend that researchers prioritize piloting the minimal possible isoflurane dose for their mouse model. In summary, our work examines the contributions from sources of variability that impact rs-fMRI data quality and synthesizes the findings into practical guidelines to help experimenters adapt their acquisition protocols and improve data quality.

">Multiscale analysis of myelin alterations in skin biopsies from synucleinopathies.</a></h4>

              
                Loss of myelin and demyelination play a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the ultrastructure of the myelin-axon unit in the peripheral nervous system of subjects diseased with synucleinopathies. We here present an analysis of the myelin ultrastructure and the myelin protein abundance that characterize myelinated axons of nerve fiber bundles in cervical skin biopsies of 45 pathologically confirmed PD, DLB, MSA and non-neurological control donors. We calculated a myelin damage score and classified over 1100 myelin sheaths by looking at myelin fragmentation and swellings with correlative light and electron microscopy. We found a higher load of myelin damage in the PD compared to MSA and control groups. Quantification with ELISA did not reveal any differences in myelin protein zero (MPZ) concentrations in skin tissue homogenates between synucleinopathies. The observed structural abnormalities in the myelin sheaths may help to discriminate among subjects with synucleinopathies and control subjects and to understand the involvement of the peripheral innervation in the diseases. Our multiscale analysis of peripheral nerves highlights their potential as future biomarkers for the detection and differentiation of synuclein diseases.

">Dual cholinergic and serotonergic excitatory pathways mediate oxygen sensing in the zebrafish gill</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of oxygen sensing included a transition from a diffuse distribution of respiratory chemoreceptors in the gills of water-breathing vertebrates to chemoreceptor clusters confined to the pulmonary epithelium and carotid body in air-breathers. Since the excitatory neurotransmitters mediating oxygen sensing in anamniotes have never been confirmed, the origins of oxygen sensing in vertebrates have remained controversial. In gills isolated from Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) zebrafish expressing a genetically-encoded reporter of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), we demonstrate that acetylcholine (ACh) and nicotine induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in postsynaptic sensory neurons innervating oxygen-chemoreceptive neuroepithelial cells (NECs). Hypoxic stimulation of NECs evoked a similar rise in neuronal [Ca2+]i that was abolished by nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium. Using immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR, we identified a novel population of ACh-containing NECs associated with sensory neurons expressing the a2 subunit of nicotinic ACh receptors. In vivo whole-larva Ca2+ imaging showed that cholinergic and hypoxic activation of the gills generated Ca2+ activity in neurons of vagal sensory ganglia with time-dependent characteristics of neurotransmission towards the hindbrain. We identified a second source of hypoxic activity in vagal sensory ganglia operating exclusively through 5-HT3 receptors and dependent upon vesicular monoamine transport (VMAT2) in the gill. We traced expression of 5-HT3 receptors to nerve terminals surrounding a separate population of serotonergic VMAT2-positive NECs. Our investigation reveals independent cholinergic and serotonergic autonomic pathways of oxygen sensing in zebrafish and provides the first physiological evidence that gill chemoreceptors may be homologues of both pulmonary and carotid body chemoreceptors in mammals.

">Dynamic fusion of structural and functional connectivity via joint connectivity matrix ICA</a></h4>

              
                The integration of multimodal MRI images, including functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), depicts a key advancement in neuroimaging, since it offers a more comprehensive and better understanding of brain function and connections. FMRI captures brain functional activity while dMRI reveals structural connectivity via white matter bundles, each of which provide unique yet complementary insights; however combing these two modalities, particularly at a dynamic level, is challenging due to their drastically different data characteristics. This study introduces a novel framework named "dynamic fusion," which extends joint component analysis (cmICA) to integrate static structural connectivity (SC) with dynamic functional connectivity (FC). Our approach gauges the relationship between these joint components across various temporal states, aiming to discover both static and dynamic features of brain connectivity. We applied this approach to fMRI and dMRI data from the same set of control subjects, which we had previously studied to estimate joint parcellation and their structural and functional connections using a static model only, and also included a comparable number of individuals with schizophrenia from the same study. Our results reveal that dynamic fusion not only highlights diverse temporal dynamics in FC but, more importantly, also shows how SC patterns differ across dynamic functional states at different time frames, providing new insights into brain organization. Furthermore, it successfully detects joint structural-functional connectivity differences between individuals with schizophrenia and controls, demonstrating its potential for detecting hidden group differences. Overall, this study establishes our dynamic fusion as a powerful tool for integrating structural and dynamic functional connectivity data, enhancing our understanding of brain connectivity and offering new perspectives for studying neurological disorders.

">Higher-level spatial prediction in natural vision across mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Theories of predictive processing propose that sensory systems constantly predict incoming signals, based on spatial and temporal context. However, evidence for prediction in sensory cortex largely comes from artificial experiments using simple, highly predictable stimuli, that arguably encourage prediction. Here, we test for sensory prediction during natural scene perception. Specifically, we use deep generative modelling to quantify the spatial predictability of receptive field (RF) patches in natural images, and compared those predictability estimates to brain responses in the mouse visual cortex - while rigorously accounting for established tuning to a rich set of low-level image features and their local statistical context - in a large scale survey of high-density recordings from the Allen Institute Brain Observatory. This revealed four insights. First, cortical responses across the mouse visual system are shaped by sensory predictability, with more predictable image patches evoking weaker responses. Secondly, visual cortical neurons are primarily sensitive to the predictability of higher-level image features, even in neurons in the primary visual areas that are preferentially tuned to low-level visual features. Third, unpredictability sensitivity is stronger in the superficial layers of primary visual cortex, in line with predictive coding models. Finally, these spatial prediction effects are independent of recent experience, suggesting that they rely on long-term priors about the structure of the visual world. Together, these results suggest visual cortex might predominantly predict sensory information at higher levels of abstraction - a pattern bearing striking similarities to recent, successful techniques from artificial intelligence for predictive self-supervised learning.

">Medial olivocochlear efferent modulation of cochlear micromechanics requires P2X4 expression in outer hair cells</a></h4>

              
                The role of P2X4, one of the most abundant ionotropic purinergic receptors in the central nervous system, is explored here in the context of auditory function. We observed, by using constitutive and conditional P2X4mCherryIN knock-in adult mouse models, a specific high expression of mCherry-tagged P2X4 in living cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs), from immature postnatal stages to adulthood. This P2X4-mCherry expression, confirmed by immuno-confocal fluorescence microscopy in wild-type mice, was mainly concentrated in the intracellular apical region of the OHCs, in the area of the Hensen's body, a lysosomal rich region, specifically labeled with the fluorescent dye lysotracker. In addition, the basal cholinergic efferent synaptic region of the OHCs was found to express P2X4 at the cell membrane. Surprisingly, the assessment of the hearing function in constitutive P2X4 knock-out (P2X4KO) mice showed improved auditory brainstem responses with smaller latencies, larger amplitudes and smaller thresholds. These P2X4KO mice, as well as conditional P2X4KO-Myo15-Cre mice, displayed enhanced distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), suggesting an improved electromechanical amplification activity by OHCs. These mutant animals showed reduced inhibition of DPOAEs by contralateral noise, consistent with a weaker inhibitory effect of the medial cholinergic olivocochlear efferent circuit (MOC) on OHCs. We concluded that the MOC negative feedback modulation of cochlear micromechanics, in addition to involve Ca2+ permeable alpha9/alpha0 nicotinic receptors, also requires the activation of postsynaptic P2X4 receptors in OHCs.

">Amyloid-beta deposition and reduced drainage at the cribriform plate lymphatics in APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, leading to substantial personal, economic, and medical costs to patients and society; it is characterized by the build-up of toxic amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau. It is crucial to the health of the brain that these proteins are processed or drained effectively, but mounting research has shown that in AD pathology there is dysfunction in the ability of the brain to effectively clear pathological A{beta} and tau. In this report, we detail the involvement of one important brain drainage pathway and potential site of A{beta} clearance, the cribriform plate lymphatics, in 24-month old APP/PS1 mice. We show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) efflux is decreased across the cribriform plate area utilizing multiple methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that A{beta} aggregates at the cribriform plate -- coating surface of olfactory bulbs (OB), olfactory nerve (ON) bundles, and cribriform plate lymphatic endothelial cells (cpLECs). At 24-months, APP/PS1 mice have increased CD45+ cell infiltration and decreased LYVE-1+ vessel area at the cribriform plate, suggesting local inflammation and lymphatic atrophy. Additionally, cpLECs have higher expression of caspase-3 suggesting the decreased LYVE-1 area is due to cellular toxicity resulting in apoptosis. This study demonstrates that the cribriform plate is an important area for further research elucidating its contribution to AD disease pathogenesis.

">Whole-brain chemosensory responses of both C. elegans sexes</a></h4>

              
                Sexually-dimorphic neural circuits play a critical role in shaping sex-specific animal behaviors. Maps of the structural dimorphisms in these circuits have been explored by analyzing synaptic connectomes, electron micrograph reconstructions of synaptic connectivity. Nevertheless, recent studies in the model organism C. elegans have shown little to no correlation between the synaptic connectome and dynamic neural activity. Therefore, the extent of sexual dimorphism in functional neural activity remains unknown. To determine the extent of functional sexual-dimorphisms in C. elegans we compared activity, neuron-by-neuron, across all neurons in the heads of both sexes. To sample a broad view of responses to different sensory modalities, we tested a diverse panel of ethologically-relevant olfactory, gustatory, and chemical stimuli, representing both attractive and aversive cues. We found that nearly every sensory neuron responded dimorphically to at least one cue and monomorphically to other cues, indicating that sexually-dimorphic circuits are pervasive and stimulus dependent. This dimorphic and monomorphic activity was present to a lesser extent in downstream interneurons and even less so in motoneurons, implicating sensory neurons as the primary source and location of sexually-dimorphic activity. Comparing the functional activity we measured to the published synaptic connectomes of both sexes revealed that sexual dimorphism in functional connectivity was distinct from and complementary to sexual dimorphism in synaptic connectivity. Our results provide a first-of-its-kind comparison of whole-brain dynamics between sexes at the level of single neurons, serving as an extensive resource for further investigations of functional sex differences.

">Personalized whole-brain models of seizure propagation</a></h4>

              
                Computational modeling has recently emerged as a powerful tool to better understand seizure dynamics and guide new treatment strategies. This work presents a method for personalizing whole-brain computational models in epilepsy, integrating SEEG, MRI, and diffusion MRI data to enhance therapeutic approaches. The objective of this method is to construct a mechanistic model replicating seizure propagation from the epileptogenic network to the entire brain, which can then be used to simulate and evaluate patient-specific therapeutic interventions. The pipeline uses neural mass models for each node in the network, simulating whole-brain dynamics. Model personalization involves adjusting global and local parameters representing the excitability of individual brain areas, using an evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the correlation between empirical and synthetic functional connectivity matrices derived from SEEG data. The resulting personalized models successfully reproduce individual seizure propagation patterns and can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions like surgery, stimulation, or pharmacological interventions within a unified physiological framework. Notably, model predictions reveal distinct patient-specific responses across interventions, highlighting the potential of whole-brain modeling to guide individualized treatment by identifying accessible and functionally relevant targets.

">Proprioceptive limit detectors mediate sensorimotor control of the Drosophila leg</a></h4>

              
                Many animals possess mechanosensory neurons that fire when a limb nears the limit of its physical range, but the function of these proprioceptive limit detectors remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate a class of proprioceptors on the Drosophila leg called hair plates. Using calcium imaging in behaving flies, we find that a hair plate on the fly coxa (CxHP8) detects the limits of anterior leg movement. Reconstructing CxHP8 axons in the connectome, we found that they are wired to excite posterior leg movement and inhibit anterior leg movement. Consistent with this connectivity, optogenetic activation of CxHP8 neurons elicited posterior postural reflexes, while silencing altered the swing-to-stance transition during walking. Finally, we use comprehensive reconstruction of peripheral morphology and downstream connectivity to predict the function of other hair plates distributed across the fly leg. Our results suggest that each hair plate is specialized to control specific sensorimotor reflexes that are matched to the joint limit it detects. They also illustrate the feasibility of predicting sensorimotor reflexes from a connectome with identified proprioceptive inputs and motor outputs.

">Characterizing the frequency-specific and spatiotemporal dynamics of β-γ Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been proposed to facilitate neural information transfer across spatial and temporal scales. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a type of CFC in which the amplitude of a faster brain oscillation is coupled to the phase of a slower brain oscillation, is implicated in various higher-order cognitive functions and was shown to be pathologically altered in neurological and psychiatric disease. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the coupling between gamma amplitude (50-150 Hz) to beta phase (13-35 Hz) is exaggerated. Enhanced {beta}-{gamma} PAC was found in the subthalamic nucleus and various cortical sources and shown to be responsive to dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Therefore, exaggerated {beta}-{gamma} PAC has been proposed to be a disease marker and a potential target for brain circuit interventions. Despite these promising findings, a significant knowledge gap remains, as the spatial and frequency-specific dynamics of {beta}-{gamma} PAC and its association with motor symptoms and therapy remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we employed high-density electroencephalography (EEG) with advanced source localisation techniques for PD patients at rest. We highlight three key findings: (1) a frequency-specific increase in high {beta} (23-35 Hz)-{gamma} PAC within and between sources of the cortical motor network, (2) a link between elevated high {beta}-{gamma} PAC and bradykinesia and rigidity when OFF medication, but not tremor, and (3) a medication-induced reduction in high {beta}-{gamma} PAC in the supplementary motor area correlating with clinical improvement. Altogether, this study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of PD as an oscillopathy and identifies high {beta}-{gamma} PAC as a potential marker of Parkinsonian symptoms and treatment effects. This has important implications for invasive as well as non-invasive therapeutic strategies as high {beta}-{gamma} PAC targeting might hold greater promise than targeting {beta}-{gamma} PAC per se.

">High-resolution laminar recordings reveal structure-function relationships in monkey V1</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between the structural properties of diverse neuronal populations in the monkey primary visual cortex (V1) and their functional visual processing in vivo remains a critical knowledge gap in visual neuroscience. We took advantage of high-density Neuropixels electrodes to record large populations of neurons across layers of macaque V1 and used a state-of-the-art non-linear dimensionality reduction approach on waveform shape to delineate nine putative cell classes, 4 narrow-spiking (NS), 4 broad-spiking (BS) and 1 tri-phasic (TP). Then, we performed targeted analyses of laminar organization, spike amplitude, multichannel spatial features, functional properties, and network connectivity of these cell classes, to discover four fundamental aspects of the V1 microcircuit predicted by anatomical studies, but never fully demonstrated before in vivo: First, NS neurons were most concentrated in layer 4 and more numerous than parvalbumin positive neurons, consistent with studies of potassium channel expression in excitatory neurons in V1. Second, a large amplitude NS cell class in layer 4B was strongly direction selective, with multichannel waveforms consistent with a stellate morphology, which is a likely functional correlate of anatomical descriptions of neurons that project between V1 and MT. Third, an NS cell class in layer 4B showed robust bursting activity and strong orientation selectivity. Finally, cross-correlation analysis of neuron pairs revealed distinct functional interactions between cell classes. These results demonstrate that high-resolution electrophysiology enables discovery of novel relationships between structural organization and in vivo functional responses of neurons, and can inform biologically realistic microcircuit models of primate V1, perhaps even extending to all of neocortex.

">Dynamic regulation of neuronal Vault trafficking and RNA cargo by the noncoding RNA, Vaultrc5</a></h4>

              
                Vaults are large ribonucleoprotein complexes of unknown function in neurons. Here, we report that the Vault-associated noncoding RNA, Vaultrc5, is highly enriched at the synapse and is required for activity-dependent Vault trafficking in neurons. We have discovered that Vaults are comprised of unique populations of coding and non-coding RNA, and that this cargo varies dynamically between subcellular compartments. In addition, Vaultrc5 knockdown at the synapse shifts the RNA cargo toward transcripts associated with immune surveillance, and Vaultrc5 knockdown, in vivo, leads to impaired fear learning. These findings suggest that the Vaultrc5 is critically involved in coordinating the experience-dependent trafficking of Vaults and related RNA cargo, which represents a novel feature of neuronal plasticity underlying learning and memory.

">The polyamine naphthyl-acetyl spermine trihydrochloride (NASPM) lacks specificity for Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors and suppresses seizure like activity in human brain tissue by inhibition of NMDA receptors.</a></h4>

              
                For decades, naphthyl-acetyl spermine trihydrochloride (NASPM) has been used as a selective inhibitor of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPAR). In rodents, NASPM is known to suppress seizures in vivo and seizure-like events (SLE) in vitro, suggesting possible involvement of CP-AMPAR in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. To address whether these findings can be translated to human brain, we investigated the involvement of glutamatergic receptor subclasses in SLE in human cortex ex vivo, demonstrating that glutamatergic receptor antagonists can block (NASPM and APV) or reduce (UBP302, GYKI52466, GYKI53655) SLE. Using a multimethodological approach we were able to demonstrate that both NASPM and APV inhibit human SLE by inhibition of NMDA receptors. Our results further show that the inhibitory effect of NASPM on NMDA receptors is sufficient to explain its inhibition of seizure like activity, rather than its action on CP-AMPA receptors. Thus, our findings challenge previous knowledge on the use of NASPM as a specific CP-AMPAR inhibitor. Some phenomena previously attributed to CP-AMPAR, may need to be re-examined more closely. Overall, our study raises awareness about potential pitfalls in the use of existing pharmacological agents and sets a new paradigm for the use of NASPM in neuroscience research while questioning its therapeutic potential in a clinical context.

">Ambient Light Impacts Innate Behaviors of New-World and Old-World Mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals encounter predators and prey under diverse lighting conditions that signal different risks and opportunities, yet how ambient illumination shapes innate approach and avoidance behaviors remains poorly understood. Here we have systematically tested the visually guided behaviors of New-World (North American Peromyscus) and Old-World (Eurasian Mus) mice under conditions mimicking bright daylight or dim moonlit environments. We identified common and species-specific adaptations to the different lighting conditions. Across species, dim light enhanced the speed and vigor of escape responses to predator-like looming stimuli. However, species diverged in their reactions to non-threatening stimuli, with Mus musculus and Peromyscus polionotus increasing aversive behaviors under dim light, while Peromyscus maniculatus showed stronger avoidance under bright conditions. Finally, although ambient light levels had a common effect on exploratory behavior, these changes were not predictive of subsequent visually evoked behaviors. Our findings reveal that ambient lighting profoundly and differentially shapes innate behavioral strategies across species, and demonstrate that these context-specific survival responses are inherited rather than learned.

">In-vivo evidence for increased tau deposition in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common pharmaco-resistant epilepsy in adults, has been linked to structural brain changes extending beyond the mesiotemporal areas. While not traditionally viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder, recent ex-vivo studies have shown elevated levels of misfolded tau protein in TLE. This study investigated tau deposition in TLE patients using the in-vivo PET tracer [18F]MK-6240. 18 TLE patients and 20 healthy controls underwent PET imaging, with data analyzed to assess tau uptake and its relationship with brain connectivity, clinical variables, and cognitive function. Compared to controls, TLE patients exhibited markedly increased [18F]MK-6240 uptake in bilateral superior and medial temporal regions and the parietal cortex, with tau accumulation following regional functional and structural connectivity, disease duration, and cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that tau accumulation may contribute to the progression of TLE and cognitive decline, supporting a potential role of tau in epilepsy-related neurodegeneration.

">The relationship between task-related aperiodic EEG activity, neural inefficiency and verbal working memory in younger and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) decline in ageing may be related to increases in neural noise, potentially reflected in the EEG aperiodic exponent. We reanalysed previously published data to investigate age-related differences in the aperiodic exponent during verbal WM and its relationship with neural inefficiency. EEG was recorded from 24 younger (18-35 years) and 30 older adults (50-86 years) during a modified Sternberg task with 1-letter, 3-letter, and 5-letter load conditions. Younger adults consistently demonstrated steeper aperiodic slopes than older adults, though this difference was less pronounced in frontal regions during retention. Unexpectedly, both age groups showed decreased (i.e. flattened) aperiodic exponents during retention relative to fixation, with minimal load-dependent effects. Notably, the relationship between task-related exponent changes and WM performance was complex and dependent on the exponent at fixation, particularly in older adults. Finally, flatter exponents during fixation and late retention were associated with greater neural inefficiency during stimulus processing, reflected by increased P3b amplitudes without corresponding WM performance improvements. These findings suggest that flatter exponents are associated with less efficient neural processing and that older adults flexibly modulate their aperiodic exponent during retention to support WM performance.

">Dopaminergic processes predict temporal distortions in event memory</a></h4>

              
                Our memories do not simply keep time - they warp it, bending the past to fit the structure of our experiences. For example, people tend to remember items as occurring farther apart in time if they spanned a change in context, or 'event boundary,' compared to the same context. While these distortions can sacrifice precise timing, they may serve to help separate temporally adjacent memories. However, the neural bases of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 32) with eye-tracking (n = 28) to test whether the dopaminergic system, known to influence encoding and time perception, predicts time dilation between adjacent events in memory. Participants encoded item sequences while listening to tones that mostly repeated over time, forming a stable auditory context, but occasionally switched, creating an event boundary. We found that boundaries predicted greater retrospective estimates of time between item pairs. Critically, tone switches significantly activated the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key midbrain dopaminergic region, and these responses in turn predicted greater time dilation between item pairs spanning those switches. Boundaries furthermore predicted a momentary increase in blinks. VTA activation also predicted blinking in general, consistent with the idea that blink behavior is a potential marker of dopaminergic activity. On a larger timescale, higher blink rates predicted greater time dilation in memory, but only for boundary-spanning pairs. Together, these findings suggest that dopaminergic processes are sensitive to event structure and may drive temporal distortions that help disjoin memories of distinct events.

">Control of Blood Pressure Variability Across Behavioral States by Brainstem Adrenergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Short-term blood pressure (BP) variability is increasingly recognized as an independent predictor of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk, yet the central mechanisms that govern this variability, particularly across behavioral states, remain poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the role of C1 adrenergic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLMC1) in the short-term BP regulation during sleep-wake transitions and physical activity in freely behaving rats. Using genetically targeted fiber photometry, we show that RVLMC1 neurons exhibit state-dependent activity, with rapid activation during arousal from non-REM sleep, sustained activity in REM sleep, and further recruitment during physical activity. We further demonstrate that baroreflex input is essential for the dynamic response of RVLMC1 neurons to pharmacological manipulations of BP and transitions to REM sleep. Strikingly, selective ablation of RVLMC1 neurons did not affect mean BP but caused pronounced instability during arousal and movement, underscoring their role in buffering BP fluctuations. These findings demonstrate that RVLMC1 neurons integrate arousal-related central drive with baroreceptor feedback to stabilize BP during changes in behavioral state. These findings suggest that the disruption of RVLMC1 neurons could underlie increased BP variability observed in pathological conditions, such as multiple system atrophy, even when mean BP is preserved.

">PATZ1 Reinstates a Growth-Permissive Chromatin Landscape in Adult Corticospinal Neurons After Injury</a></h4>

              
                As the CNS matures, chromatin at growth associated genes gradually becomes less accessible, but the timing of this shift, the mechanisms behind it, and whether it can be reversed in adults have remained unclear. To address this, we mapped chromatin accessibility in corticospinal neurons across postnatal development and found two distinct waves of restriction, an early, partial closure between P0 to P4, followed by a stronger, more widespread restriction from P7 into adulthood. We also asked whether the distance of injury influences chromatin remodeling and found that distal (thoracic) injuries triggered only modest changes, while proximal (intracortical) injuries led to much broader accessibility shifts, pointing to injury proximity as a key factor in epigenetic responsiveness. We then tested whether this restricted chromatin could be reopened by introducing PATZ1, a transcription factor normally expressed during early postnatal growth. AAV based delivery of PATZ1 after injury caused marked chromatin remodeling, including an 11.6 fold increase in H3K27ac at growth-relevant sites and large-scale reorganization of 3D genome structure, with compartment shifts toward active states and altered TAD boundaries. These changes were accompanied by reactivation of gene networks linked to developmental growth. Our results help define when and how chromatin becomes restrictive in CNS neurons and show that it can be reopened using targeted interventions like PATZ1 to support regeneration.

                Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a transformative platform for mRNA delivery, enabling vaccines and gene editing with transient expression and high cargo capacity. However, their potential for ocular gene editing remains underexplored. In this study, we assessed the transduction efficiency, inflammatory response, and gene editing capability of LNP-encapsulated mRNA in murine eyes. Intravitreal delivery of LNPs achieved targeted mRNA expression in the trabecular meshwork (TM) with superior specificity and efficiency compared to adenoviral or adeno-associated viral vectors, while inducing minimal microglial activation in the retina. Using LNPs co-encapsulating SpCas9 mRNA and sgRNA, we demonstrated efficient CRISPR-mediated knockout (KO) of Matrix Gla Protein (Mgp), a key inhibitor of TM calcification. Mgp-KO eyes exhibited sustained intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation and anterior chamber deepening with normal anterior chamber angle, recapitulating key features of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Chronic IOP elevation led to reactive Muller gliosis and ganglion cell complex thinning, reflecting retinal stress and progressive neurodegeneration. Our findings establish LNP-CRISPR as a safe and efficient system for TM-targeted gene editing, with broad applicability in glaucoma pathogenesis modelling and therapeutic discovery.

">Mice discriminate odour source distance via sub-sniff temporal features of odour plumes</a></h4>

              
                Rodents rely on olfaction to navigate complex environments, particularly where visual cues are limited. Yet how they estimate the distance to an odour source remains unclear. The spatiotemporal dynamics of natural odour plumes, shaped by airflow turbulence, offer valuable cues for locating odour sources. Here, we show that mice can discriminate odour sources placed at different distances by extracting information from the sub-sniff temporal structure of naturalistic odour plumes. Using a wind tunnel and an olfactory virtual reality system, we generated dynamic plumes and demonstrated, through high-throughput automated behaviour, that mice distinguish near from far sources based on odour fluctuations operating faster than their respiratory cycle. Two-photon calcium imaging of olfactory bulb projection neurons revealed that distance-dependent responses are present in a small subset of mitral and tufted cells, and that population activity encodes source distance. Critically, neural responses correlated more strongly with high-frequency plume features than with mean odour concentration. Our results identify a neural basis for distance estimation from odour dynamics and highlight the importance of rapid temporal processing in mammalian olfaction.

">Preventing light-induced toxicity in a new mouse model of rhodopsin sector retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by the progressive loss of rod photoreceptors. Sector RP is a form of RP, where degeneration originates in the inferior retina, mainly influenced by light exposure. Over 200 RHO variants are pathogenic and associated with autosomal dominant RP. RHOM39R is one of the most common RHO variants linked to sector RP in the UK. A knock-in (KI) mouse model expressing RhoM39R was generated and characterized to investigate the mechanisms of degeneration associated with this variant and explore novel therapeutic strategies for rhodopsin sector RP. Under ambient light, RhoM39R/+ KI mice exhibited impaired retinal function by ERG, with some defects in OS ultrastructure, but retained normal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness. Repeated exposure to bright light led to photoreceptor loss. In contrast, RhoM39R/M39R KI mice in ambient light displayed severe retinal dysfunction, ONL thinning, and grossly abnormal OS ultra structure. In homozygous mice, a single bright light exposure significantly reduced ONL thickness within 48 h. The rescue of these models was achieved through reduced light exposure and pharmacological intervention. Rearing in dim red light (red cage condition) restored ERG responses in RhoM39R/+ KI mice and improved ONL thickness in RhoM39R/M39R KI mice. Transcriptomic analysis in RhoM39R/M39R KI mice revealed upregulation of Sphingosine 1-P Receptor (S1PR) transcripts. Treatment with the S1PR agonist Fingolimod (FTY720) before bright light exposure significantly reduced degeneration, demonstrating a protective effect in both heterozygous and homozygous models and suggesting potential a therapeutic approach for sector RP patients.

">Arithmetic learning is associated with developmental increases in similarity between brain activity and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The ability to learn simple arithmetic is often thought to rely on the associative nature of human memory, where repeated exposure to arithmetic problems strengthens the relations between operands and outcomes. This view is reminiscent of learning in large language artificial neural networks (ANNs), where training involves statistical associations between symbolic inputs and outputs. Based on this parallel, we hypothesized that brain activity during arithmetic problem-solving should be increasingly similar to ANN-derived representations with learning and development. We used fMRI to investigate the relation between brain activity during single-digit addition problem-solving and ANN features in 104 participants across four age groups (8-, 11-, 14-year-olds, and adults). Vertex-wise encoding models were used to predict brain activity using latent features extracted from pre-trained ANNs. Results revealed that the ANN-based model better predicted arithmetic-related activity in older than younger participants in a specific region of the left precentral sulcus. Prediction accuracy was higher for smaller than larger problems, consistent with the idea that associations between problems may decrease in strength with problem size. Furthermore, ANN prediction patterns aligned with a model in which each addition problem was increasingly represented separately with age. On the one hand, these findings may support the idea that, with learning and development, some neural representations of arithmetic problems become discretely organized in memory and increasingly resemble ANN-like processing. On the other hand, the lack of relation between the ANN-based model and activity in other brain regions suggests some degree of dissimilarity between arithmetic processing in humans and ANNs, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms for simple arithmetic learning in humans.

">Enhancing Biomedical Optical Volumetric Imaging via Self-Supervised Orthogonal Learning</a></h4>

              
                Optical volumetric imaging grapples with inherent noise problems arising from photon budget constraints, light scattering, and space-bandwidth product bottlenecks, all of which degrade structural fidelity and become even more pronounced than in planar imaging. While deep learning presents potential for denoising, supervised methods are hindered by the impracticality of paired datasets, and existing self-supervised approaches fail to fully exploit the intrinsic volumetric structural redundancy inherent to optical imaging. Here, we present a self-supervised Volumetric biomedicAL Imaging Denoiser (VALID) that leverages intrinsic three-dimensional spatial coherence for highly efficient volumetric denoising through a self-supervised orthogonal learning framework. VALID demonstrates robust denoising performance across diverse imaging modalities, including two- and three-photon microscopy, light-field microscopy, and optical coherence tomography, substantially enhancing structural fidelity in deep-tissue, multimodal, and dynamic imaging scenarios. By combining computational efficiency with zero-shot adaptability, VALID establishes a transformative approach to volumetric image enhancement with structure-aware precision.

">The temporal and perceptual characteristics of emotion-induced blindness</a></h4>

              
                Attentional capture by emotionally salient stimuli is adaptive, permitting identification of possible threats; however, an excessive bias towards emotional stimuli can interrupt goal-directed behavior. This is especially relevant in psychiatric disease, where severe emotional distress can interfere with daily function. As such, understanding the mechanisms by which emotional stimuli compete for attentional resources is a critical area of investigation. Previous studies using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigms observe that emotional distractors disrupt the detection of subsequent stimuli, referred to as emotion-induced blindness (EIB). Our study expands upon this work, characterizing how temporal and perceptual factors shape the emergence and intensity of EIB. Contrary to previous assumptions regarding temporal dynamics of EIB, we found that effects of emotional distractors persisted across prolonged image presentation durations. Further, we investigated the extent to which the depth of distractor processing influences EIB using a distractor recall task. While recall was predictive of EIB magnitude, a significant effect of emotional distractors on target detection was nonetheless present even without conscious recall of the distractor. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the EIB effect in RSVP in the context of temporal and perceptual manipulations.

">Global motor system suppression as the primary mechanism of human action stopping: challenging the pause-then-cancel model</a></h4>

              
                The ability to stop a planned or ongoing action is fundamental to inhibitory control. A recent theory proposes that stopping involves two distinct phases: an initial global suppression of motor activity ("pause") followed by a selective cancellation of the targeted action. However, the necessity of a second "cancel" stage remains debated. We tested whether global suppression alone is sufficient to stop movement by analysing electromyography from task-relevant agonist and antagonist muscles, alongside transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of global motor suppression from task-irrelevant muscles, during a stop-signal task in adult human participants of both sexes. In Experiment 1, reanalysis of ballistic finger movements revealed that agonist muscle offset consistently preceded behavioural stopping, aligning with the time course of global suppression. In Experiment 2, we extended these findings to whole-arm reaching movements, demonstrating that global motor suppression persisted beyond the termination of muscle activity when stopping prevented movement initiation, but disengaged in time for antagonist activation used to interrupt movements once they had begun. These findings challenge the pause-then-cancel model, instead supporting a single-stage global suppression framework. They also suggest that the global suppression mechanism is not a rigid, top-down stopping mechanism but rather part of a broader motor control system that flexibly adjusts movement commands based on task demands.

">Hypoxia and Cognitive Ability in Humans: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</a></h4>

              
                This systematic and meta-analytical review examined how a reduction in oxygen availability to tissue (hypoxia) affects cognitive function. Hypoxia had a moderate-to-large detrimental effect on general cognitive ability and across domains, including memory, attention, executive function, processing speed, and psychomotor speed. Increased hypoxic severity was associated with greater declines in general cognitive ability and executive function, while longer duration of exposure was associated with greater declines in executive function and psychomotor speed. Participant age was a moderator for executive function and psychomotor speed, with older adults experiencing greater impairments. For executive function and psychomotor speed, the magnitude of these effects was less pronounced during intermittent and hypobaric exposures, potentially due to adaptive physiological mechanisms. While our models accounted for exposure characteristics and age of participants, substantial unexplained variance remained. These findings highlight hypoxias impact on cognition and emphasize the need to investigate underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that may influence individual vulnerability.

">Volitional and forced running ability in mice lacking intact primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                The coordination of various brain regions achieves both volitional and forced motor control, but the role of the primary motor cortex in proficient running motor control remains unclear. This study trained mice to run at high performance (>10,000 rotations per day or >2,700 rotations per hour) using a running wheel, and then assessed the effects of the removal of bilateral cortical areas including the primary motor cortex on volitional and forced running locomotion. The control sham-operated group revealed a quick recovery of volitional running, reaching half of the maximum daily rotation in 3.9 +/- 2.6 days (n = 10). In contrast, the cortical injury group took significantly a longer period (7.0 +/- 3.3 days, n = 15) to reach half of the maximum volitional daily rotation, but recovered to preoperative levels in about two weeks. Furthermore, even 3 days after surgery to remove cortical regions, the running time on a treadmill moving at 35.3 cm/sec, which is difficult for naive mice to run on, was not significantly different from that in the sham-operated group. These results suggest that the intact primary motor cortex is not necessarily required to execute trained fast-running locomotion, but rather contributes to the spontaneity of running in mice.

                Background Anemia is defined as a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the hemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. Objectives To determine the prevalence of anemia and the associated factors among adults residing in the UAE. The study also aims to assess the knowledge about anemia among the study population. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among the adults residing in the UAE using a self-administered questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 29. A score of six and higher was considered above average, whereas below six was considered below average knowledge. A chi-square test and logistic regression were done. Results Around 8.9% of participants currently had anemia. Around 100% of participants with secondary qualifications knew average compared to 93.5% of postgraduate participants with below-average knowledge about anemia. Consumption of dates, jaggery/molasses, beef liver, and sardines possessed statistically significant associations. Conclusion 8.9% of adults in the UAE are diagnosed with anemia. Consumption of dates, jaggery/molasses, beef liver, and sardines are the statistically significant factors associated. Knowledge about anemia is associated with age, gender, education, employment, marital status and the emirate of residence.

                <p>by Grace E. Johnson, Chenyi Fei, Ned S. Wingreen, Bonnie L. Bassler</p>

Bacteria commonly exist in multicellular, surface-attached communities called biofilms. Biofilms are central to ecology, medicine, and industry. The <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> pathogen forms biofilms from single founder cells that, via cell division, mature into three-dimensional structures with distinct, yet reproducible, regional architectures. To define mechanisms underlying biofilm developmental transitions, we establish a single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) approach that enables accurate quantitation of spatiotemporal gene-expression patterns in biofilms at cell-scale resolution. smFISH analyses of <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm regulatory and structural genes demonstrate that, as biofilms mature, overall matrix gene expression decreases, and simultaneously, a pattern emerges in which matrix gene expression becomes largely confined to peripheral biofilm cells. Both quorum sensing and c-di-GMP-signaling are required to generate the proper temporal pattern of matrix gene expression. Quorum sensing signaling is uniform across the biofilm, and thus, c-di-GMP-signaling alone sets the regional matrix gene expression pattern. The smFISH strategy provides insight into mechanisms conferring particular fates to individual biofilm cells.

In the glucose-free environment of the midgut of the tsetse fly vector, the procyclic forms of <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> primarily consume proline to feed its central carbon and energy metabolism. In this context, the parasite produces through gluconeogenesis, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), the precursor of essential metabolic pathways, from proline catabolism. We show here that the parasite uses three different enzymes to perform the key gluconeogenic reaction producing fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, (<i>i</i>) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), the canonical enzyme performing this reaction, (<i>ii</i>) sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase), and (<i>iii</i>) more surprisingly ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK), an enzyme considered to irreversibly catalyze the opposite reaction involved in glycolysis. These three enzymes, as well as six other glycolytic/gluconeogenic enzymes, are located in peroxisome-related organelles, named glycosomes. Incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C-enriched glycerol (a more effective alternative to proline for monitoring gluconeogenic activity) into F6P and G6P was more affected in the PFK null mutant than in the FBPase null mutant, suggesting the PFK contributes at least as much as FBPase to gluconeogenesis. We also showed that glucose deprivation did not affect the quantities of PFK substrates and products, whereas an approximately 500-fold increase in the substrate/product ratio was expected for PFK to carry out the gluconeogenic reaction. In conclusion, we show for the first time that ATP-dependent PFK can function in vivo in the gluconeogenic direction, even in the presence of FBPase activity. This particular feature, which precludes loss of ATP through a futile cycle involving PFK and FBPase working simultaneously in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic directions, respectively, is possibly due to the supramolecular organization of the metabolic pathway within glycosomes to overcome thermodynamic barriers through metabolic channeling.

                Background Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, has emerged as a global health concern due to the migration of infected individuals. With its epidemiological complexity, by difficulty to obtain appropriate diagnoses and poor treatment, the search for novel therapeutic options remains. Methods In this context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies employing animal models to verify the progress in CD treatment. We searched the PubMed database for CD treatment studies published between 1990 and 2023, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Results Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that the fifteen treatment alternatives examined, mainly between 2010 and 2014, demonstrated efficacy in experimental CD models, evidenced by significant parasitemia reduction. Bis-triazole DO870 and VNI were effective in the acute and chronic phases, respectively. However, of these emerging therapies, only posaconazole and fexinidazole have progressed to clinical trials, yielding unsatisfactory outcomes as CD monotherapies Conclusions This meta-analysis highlights the existence of promising new drug candidates for CD treatment, but most remain in the preclinical stages. Those that reached clinical trials did not demonstrate optimal results, underscoring the ongoing challenges in CD therapy. Collaborative efforts among the academic community, pharmaceutical industries, funding agencies, and government agencies are urgently needed to accelerate the development of more effective medications against CD.

Objective This study aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model for early detection and classification of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. Methods The dataset, comprising 569 samples and 32 features derived from fine needle aspirate biopsy images, was pre-processed through data cleaning, normalization using the Robust Scaler, and feature selection. Five supervised ML algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were implemented. Models were evaluated using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores. Results The SVC-RBF model demonstrated the highest accuracy (98.68%) and balanced performance across other metrics, making it the most effective classifier for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Key features such as texture mean and area (worst) significantly contributed to classification accuracy. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of ML algorithms, particularly SVC-RBF, to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics through improved accuracy and efficiency. Future research should validate these findings with diverse datasets and explore their integration into clinical workflows to enhance decision-making and patient care.

                Background Women’s studies in Latin America are transcendental because they make visible and challenge gender inequalities to achieve a more just and equitable society. However, despite this, there are still many research gaps, for which the objective is to examine the trends in research on women’s studies in Latin America. Methods An exploratory methodology based on bibliometric analysis is proposed to evaluate the scientific literature, based on the parameters of the PRISMA-2020 declaration. Results The bibliometric analysis reveals a growth in women’s studies in Latin America, reflecting its importance and relevance. Scientific production has experienced exponential growth, with leading researchers and journals. The United States and Canada lead scientific production. A change is observed in the topics addressed, focusing more on gender and equality. The thematic clusters identified highlight priority areas such as politics, institutions and representation. Conclusions Emerging keywords include neoliberalism, gender violence, political participation, female empowerment, and femicide, reflecting new concerns and challenges addressed in gender studies in Latin America.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-483/v2?src=rss">A study of clinical profile in patients of cataracts with pseudoexfoliation in rural populations of central India [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ophthalmologists deal with daily pseudoexfoliation (PXF) due to severe secondary glaucoma, which arises after cataract surgery. Cataracts with pseudoexfoliation are age-related and are associated with open-angle glaucoma. Therefore, pseudoexfoliation is expected to occur more frequently. Pseudoexfoliation is occasionally associated with the development of thick nuclear cataracts, which may make surgery challenging. risks of cataract extraction in patients with pseudoexfoliation include zonular weakness and inadequate pupillary dilation. This may cause vitreous loss, and intraoperative or postoperative lens displacement. It could also lead to a rise in postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), progressing to long-term inflammation, phimosis of the capsular tissue, glaucoma, and surgical corneal decompensation. Recurrent secondary cataracts are typically caused by some remaining cortical tissue and decreased zonular support, which may lead to lens epithelial cell migration. Surgery for glaucoma and cataracts is complicated by the presence of pseudoexfoliative debris. Objectives To determine the prevalence of pseudoexfoliation in cataract patients visiting the ophthalmic OPD, AVBRH hospital, to locate patients with pseudoexfoliative cataracts, to evaluate their likelihood of progressing to open-angle glaucoma, and to examine the various ocular characteristics of these patients. Methodology The study participants will undergo ophthalmological examination after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This examination will include sac syringing on the lacrimal gland, estimation of the highest corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, application tonometer assessment of intraocular pressure (IOP), and fundus examination using an indirect ophthalmoscope. All individuals with cataracts visiting the ophthalmology department of AVBRH will be examined under a slit-lamp to determine the presence of pseudoexfoliation in the operating eye. Expected Results Hospital statistics from India indicated that the percentage of patients with pseudoexfoliation, in addition to cataracts, ranges from 1.87% to 13.5%.

                <p>A host of acquired abnormalities in visual function are known to occur in persons who suffer stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders. Cerebral visual impairment occurs in children with early neurological injury or disorders, especially neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. With the improved survival of pre-term infants through meticulous neonatal intensive care unit care, cerebral visual impairment in children has become much more common in developed countries. In recent months a number of National Institutes of Health institutes and the American Academy of Pediatrics have brought new attention to this major public health problem, which is highly relevant to child neurologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, as well as the general neurologists who will care for affected individuals as they enter adulthood.

<p>The need for pragmatic clinical trials evaluating therapeutic interventions in patients with neurological disease is continually increasing due to availability of multiple therapeutic interventions (comparative effectiveness), multifaceted approaches (multiple concurrent synergistic therapeutic interventions), and gaps in trial-specific and real-world population outcomes. Several designs for pragmatic trials are available, including individual randomized trials with pragmatic characteristics, cluster-randomized and non-randomized trials, and observational prospective cohort studies. Cluster trials may have parallel cluster and crossover (unidirectional, bidirectional, and alternating crossover) designs. There are unique aspects of consenting and data collection leveraging existing registries, electronic health records (EHRs), and claims data that make pragmatic trials most suited to study the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with neurological diseases in real-world settings.

                <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease are neurodegenerative diseases with age-related disability accumulation. In MS, inflammation spans decades, whereas AD is characterized by Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Few studies explore accumulation of amyloids in MS. We examined Aβ deposition and NFT density in temporal and frontal cortices from postmortem MS (<i>n</i> = 75) and control (<i>n</i> = 66) cases. Compared with controls, MS cases showed reduced Aβ, especially in those aged &lt;65 years, and reduced NFT, notably in cases aged &gt;65 years. Aβ deposition predicted greater NFT density both in MS cases and controls. MS-related factors may affect Aβ/NFT deposition and/or clearance, offering new therapeutic insights for both diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27245?af=R">UNC13A Polymorphism Influences Survival in Patients with Frontotemporal Dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p><i>UNC13A</i> (rs12608932-CC) is associated with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and shortens survival in ALS. We aim to describe the association for <i>UNC13A</i> and survival in FTD. We included 626 patients with FTD from Dutch memory clinics, including a subcohort of 150 patients with TDP-43 pathology. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models in a recessive manner. Homozygosity for rs12608932-C in <i>UNC13A</i> was associated with a shorter survival compared with other genotypes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.60, <i>p</i> = 0.033), which has implications for patient counselling and trial design.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite diagnostic criteria refinements, Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical diagnosis still suffers from a not satisfying accuracy, with the post-mortem examination as the gold standard for diagnosis. Seminal clinicopathological series highlighted that a relevant number of patients alive-diagnosed with idiopathic PD have an alternative post-mortem diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PD comparing the in-vivo clinical diagnosis with the post-mortem diagnosis performed through the pathological examination in 2 groups.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective case–control study, patients and healthy subjects who consented to the post-mortem pathological diagnosis at the UK Brain Bank were consecutively enrolled from the UK Brain Bank. Medical records were reviewed to classify participants and performance metrics were further calculated using neuropathological diagnosis as the gold standard.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four thousand five hundred seventy one subjects were eligible for the study. The clinical diagnosis group was: 1,048 Parkinson's patients and 1,242 healthy subjects. Pathology diagnosis group were: 996 Parkinson's patients and 1,288 subjects with no post-mortem abnormality. For the group of clinical diagnosis, PD diagnosis showed: sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, accuracy of 90.96%, F1-Score 0.89, and a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.925 (SE ± 0.006) [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.913, 0.937], 𝑝&lt;0.001. In this group, the most frequent pathology diagnosis among clinically misdiagnosed PD (false positive) patients was dementia with Lewy bodies (19.4%). Conversely, the most frequent clinical diagnosis among PD missed clinical diagnosis (false negative) patients was Alzheimer's disease (18.5%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings confirm a still significant diagnostic error and emphasize the need for more fine and homogeneous criteria to classify idiopathic Parkinson's patients correctly. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1110–1121</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of heparin-binding protein (HBP) in cerebrospinal fluid for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in patients with a suspected central nervous system infection.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective multicenter cohort study determined the diagnostic accuracy of HBP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for bacterial meningitis among a cohort of consecutive patients with a suspected central nervous infection. The final clinical diagnosis was considered the reference standard. The results were validated in a separate cohort.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 631 Dutch patients were evaluated for the current study, of which 73 (12%) had a final diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. For the differentiation of bacterial meningitis from all other disorders, diagnostic accuracy was high with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96–1.00). With the proposed cutoff of 5.2 ng/ml, sensitivity was 97% with a specificity of 96%. In the population of patients with a CSF leukocyte count of 5-1,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI 0.87–1.00), outperforming CSF leukocytes (AUC 0.88 [95% CI 0.79–0.97]). Combining HBP with CSF C-reactive protein (CRP) significantly increased accuracy in this population and reached a 100% sensitivity (AUC 1.00 [95% CI 0.99–1.00], cutoff 0.07, sensitivity 100%, specificity 96%). These results remained robust in an external validation cohort of 120 Danish patients (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.93–1.00]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HBP can correctly distinguish bacterial meningitis from other disorders. It can be of additional value to current diagnostics in cases where CSF leukocyte count is relatively low, particularly when combined with CSF CRP. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1088–1095</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective is to evaluate cognitive and behavioral progression and identify early predictors of these changes in a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 161 ALS patients were tested at diagnosis (T0), and 107 were re-tested after 1 year (T1) using cognitive/behavioral tests. All patients underwent whole-genome sequencing, and 46 patients (ALS-normal cognition [CN]) underwent [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 161 patients, 107 were re-rested at T1; non-retested patients included 10 with frontotemporal dementia and 44 who were either non-testable or deceased. At T0, 67 patients (62.6%) were classified as ALS-CN, whereas 40 (38.4%) showed some degree of cognitive/behavioral impairment. Eighteen ALS-CN patients (26.9%) experienced cognitive decline at T1. Phenoconverters had lower baseline scores in letter fluency (Letter Fluency Test [FAS]) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Both tests were independently predictive of phenoconversion in binary logistic regression models, with optimal cut-off scores of 28.75 and 14.2, with good sensitivity and specificity. Other predictors included older age, lower education, and ALS-related genetic variants. Phenoconverters were hypometabolic in the left temporal lobe. Thirteen (32.5%) of the 40 patients with cognitive impairment at T0 worsened by T1, with FAS (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and the ECAS verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.023) predicting further decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximately 30% of ALS patients experienced cognitive/behavioral decline within the first year after diagnosis. FAS and ECAS verbal fluency were predictive of cognitive phenoconversion. Our findings highlight the importance of early detection of at-risk individuals and the need for longitudinal cognitive assessments to monitor disease progression.
