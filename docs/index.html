                Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for understanding species trends and their responses to anthropogenic change. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers a scalable, non-invasive approach to capture ecological information across large spatial and temporal scales. However, it generates vast amounts of audio recordings, whose management and analysis present technical challenges. To support diverse user needs in ecoacoustic research, a growing number of software tools have emerged, but the landscape remains fragmented and difficult to navigate. We provide a systematic overview of software tools used for soundscape assessment across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. We screened peer-reviewed literature and complemented it with database cross-checking to identify and categorize tools according to four PAM data workflow components: data management, signal pre-processing, visualisation and navigation, and acoustic analysis. We found 221 available tools of which 174 were explicitly designed for PAM. Most tools were freely accessible (83%) with only a smaller fraction being commercial (12%) or limited access (5%). Terrestrial research accounted for most software mentions (476 studies), followed by aquatic (319) and cross-realm (64) studies. Nearly half (45%) were package-based frameworks within R, Python, or MATLAB. Acoustic analysis was the most represented workflow component, while only 40 tools covered all four of them. This diversity illustrates the field’s rapid technical growth but also its redundancy and methodological fragmentation: to date, many tools target only a subset of workflow components and replicate similar functionalities. Despite this, the prevalence of PAM-dedicated software indicates increasing specialization and technical maturity within ecoacoustics. Our structured inventory underscores the need for greater collaboration and continuity in software development, promoting the improvement and accessibility of existing tools rather than further proliferation. This living systematic review, provides a practical, biannually updated reference for tool selection and fosters transparency, comparability, and cooperation across bioacoustic and ecoacoustic research communities.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to descriptively characterize and explore the differences in the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20-40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the descriptive relationship between the relative abundance of periodontopathogens and nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected from all participants. Genomic DNA was isolated and pooled in equimolar quantities from all individuals within each group to create three pooled libraries: type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3). Sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity were measured using bioinformatic methods, and all analyses of sequencing data were strictly descriptive and exploratory. Salivary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were measured on individual, un-pooled samples. Results The salivary microbiota among people with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease (G2; G3) was observed to have greater bacterial diversity and abundance than that of patients without periodontal disease (G1), according to descriptive alpha-diversity analysis. The G3 group exhibited the largest relative abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key periodontopathogen. Descriptive analysis also suggested that periodontopathic bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria have different community structures across the groups. Furthermore, comparison of individual salivary samples showed that nitrite/nitrate concentration was significantly lower in the G3 group compared to the G1 group (p< 0.05). Results reveal that the inverse interaction between increased P. gingivalis and decreased nitrate-reducing bacteria serves as a descriptive hallmark for periodontal disease progression in the T2DM population. Conclusion Results of this exploratory study suggest that the relationship between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in the salivary microbiome varies among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis. These distinct microbial features observed may be microbiological characteristics associated with the progression of periodontal disease in this population, warranting further validation as potential indicators for early management.

                Biological experiments often require a series of precisely timed operations, and small variations in treatment can result in inconsistent or biased results. To handle multiple samples in parallel with precise temporal resolution, experimentalists may stagger treatments by initiating the workflow of one sample during the wait or incubation time of another. However, as the number of samples processed in parallel and the number of operations increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and execute valid treatment regimens that permit the handling of each sample. To address this, I developed StaggR, an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes compatible staggering intervals for parallelized execution of identical processing workflows. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for defining protocol operations, durations, and wait times. It can automatically calculate the shortest possible conflict-free interval for initiating sample treatments, or allow users to simulate specific intervals to explore potential treatment regimens or bottlenecks. Using StaggR, users of any experience level can rapidly generate complete, color-coded experimental schedules, visualize these workflows in an easy-to-read chart, and execute them using a built-in timer displaying a treatment schedule with live updates. The experimental designs can be saved, shared, and re-imported, ensuring full reproducibility and user control. The application of StaggR is expected to expedite the design and throughput of complex experimental workflows while maximizing reproducibility.

                Background Smoking remains a major public health problem, particularly among Tunisian health students, with a prevalence of 26%. Assessing motivation to quit smoking requires tools that have been validated in the local language. This study aimed to translate and validate the psychometric properties of the Motivation to Quit Smoking Questionnaire (Q-MAT) into Arabic. Method A cross-sectional methodological study was conducted among 203 smoking health science students in March 2022. The cross-cultural validation process followed Vallerand’s seven steps, including translation/back-translation, expert panel review, pre-testing, and psychometric analyses. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and temporal stability (test-retest). Content validity was measured by the CVI index, and construct validity by exploratory factor analysis. Results The sample included 197 students (mean age: 18.95±1.07 years, sex ratio: 0.89). The Arabic Q-MAT demonstrated excellent reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.840, a test-retest correlation of 0.831, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.886. Content validity was satisfactory (CVI = 0.89). Principal component analysis revealed that two factors explained 89.148% of the total variance. Conclusions This initial validation of the Q-MAT in literary Arabic provides a reliable and valid tool for assessing motivation to quit smoking among Arabic-speaking populations, facilitating the development of targeted public health interventions.

                Background Research misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of research misconduct (KoRM) level in this population is lacking. This brief report assessed KoRM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey (i.e. ; Laval University quiz) with 11 questions on KoRM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoRM. Results The mean±SD KoRM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoRM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoRM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoRM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). Conclusion North-African PGDSs have a low-level of KoRM. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoRM in this population.

                Background Every day we are faced with different treatment claims, in the news, in social media, and by our family and friends. Some of these claims are true, but many are unsubstantiated. Without being supported by reliable evidence such guidance can lead to waste and harmful health choices. The Informed Health Choices (IHC) Network facilitates development of interventions for teaching children and adults the ability to assess treatment claims (informedhealthchoices.org). Our objective was to develop and evaluate a new assessment tool developed from the item bank for use in an upcoming trial of lower secondary school resources in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. Methods A cross-sectional study evaluating a questionnaire including two item-sets was used. The first evaluated ability using multiple-choice questions (scored dichotomously) and the other evaluated intended behaviour and self-efficacy (measured using Likert scales). This study was conducted in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda in 2021. We recruited children (over 12 years old) and adults through schools and our networks. We entered 1,671 responses into our analysis. Summary and individual fit to the Rasch model (including Cronbach’s Alpha) were assessed using the RUMM2030 software. Results Both item-sets were found to have good fit to the Rasch model and were acceptable to our target audience. The reliability was good (Cronbach’s alpha >0.7). Observations of the individual item and person fit provided us with guidance on how we could improve the design, scoring, and administration of the two item-sets. There was no local dependency in either of the item-sets, and both item-sets were found to have acceptable unidimensionality. Conclusion Overall, the two item-sets were found to have satisfactory measurement properties. Based on our analysis, we consider these instruments to be suitable for our target audiences in Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06257">Gamma2Patterns: Deep Cognitive Attention Region Identification and Gamma-Alpha Pattern Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep cognitive attention is characterized by heightened gamma oscillations and coordinated visual behavior. Despite the physiological importance of these mechanisms, computational studies rarely synthesize these modalities or identify the neural regions most responsible for sustained focus. To address this gap, this work introduces Gamma2Patterns, a multimodal framework that characterizes deep cognitive attention by leveraging complementary Gamma and Alpha band EEG activity alongside Eye-tracking measurements. Using the SEED-IV dataset [1], we extract spectral power, burst-based temporal dynamics, and fixation-saccade-pupil signals across 62 channels or electrodes to analyze how neural activation differs between high-focus (Gamma-dominant) and low-focus (Alpha-dominant) states. Our findings reveal that frontopolar, temporal, anterior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions exhibit the strongest Gamma power and burst rates, indicating their dominant role in deep attentional engagement, while Eye-tracking signals confirm complementary contributions from frontal, frontopolar, and frontotemporal regions. Furthermore, we show that Gamma power and burst duration provide more discriminative markers of deep focus than Alpha power alone, demonstrating their value for attention decoding. Collectively, these results establish a multimodal, evidence-based map of cortical regions and oscillatory signatures underlying deep focus, providing a neurophysiological foundation for future brain-inspired attention mechanisms in AI systems.

                arXiv:2601.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain's computational prowess emerges not despite but because of its inherent "non-ideal factors"-noise, heterogeneity, structural irregularities, decentralized plasticity, systemic errors, and chaotic dynamics-challenging classical neuroscience's idealized models. These traits, long dismissed as flaws, are evolutionary adaptations that endow the brain with robustness, creativity, and adaptability. Classical frameworks falter under the brain's complexity: simulating 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses is intractable, stochastic neurotransmitter release confounds signal interpretation, and the absence of global idealized models invalidates deterministic learning frameworks. Technological gaps further obscure whole-brain dynamics, revealing a disconnect between biological reality and computational abstraction.

                arXiv:2601.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action potential constitutes the digital component of the signaling dynamics of neurons. But the biophysical nature of the full time course of the action potential associated with changes in membrane potential is fundamentally and mathematically distinct from its representation as a discrete set of events that encode when action potentials triggered in a collection spike trains. In this paper, we rigorously explore from first principles the transition and modeling from the standard biophysical picture of a single action potential to its representation as a spike in a spike train. In particular, we adopt a functional-analytic framework, using Schwartz distribution theory to represent spike trains as generalized Dirac delta functions acting on smooth test functions. We then show how and why this representation transcends a purely descriptive formalism to support deep downstream analysis and modeling of spike train neural dynamics in a mathematically consistent way.

                arXiv:2601.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain charts have emerged as a highly useful approach for understanding brain development and aging on the basis of brain imaging and have shown substantial utility in describing typical and atypical brain development with respect to a given reference model. However, all existing models are fundamentally cross-sectional and cannot capture change over time at the individual level. We address this using velocity centiles, which directly map change over time and can be overlaid onto cross-sectionally derived population centiles. We demonstrate this by modelling rates of change for 24062 scans from 10795 healthy individuals with up to 8 longitudinal measurements across the lifespan. We provide a method to detect individual deviations from a stable trajectory, generalising the notion of thrive lines, which are used in pediatric medicine to declare failure to thrive. Using this approach, we predict transition from mild cognitive impairment to dementia more accurately than by using either time point alone, replicated across two datasets. Last, by taking into account multiple time points, we improve the sensitivity of velocity models for predicting the future trajectory of brain change. This highlights the value of predicting change over time and makes a fundamental step towards precision medicine.

                arXiv:2601.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06991">Continuous Energy Landscape Model for Analyzing Brain State Transitions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.06991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy landscape models characterize neural dynamics by assigning energy values to each brain state that reflect their stability or probability of occurrence. The conventional energy landscape models rely on binary brain state representation, where each region is considered either active or inactive based on some signal threshold. However, this binarization leads to significant information loss and an exponential increase in the number of possible brain states, making the calculation of energy values infeasible for large numbers of brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel continuous energy landscape framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a continuous precision matrix directly from functional MRI (fMRI) signals, preserving the full range of signal values during energy landscape computation. We validated our approach using both synthetic data and real-world fMRI datasets from brain tumor patients. Our results on synthetic data generated from a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and a Kuramoto model show that the continuous energy model achieved higher likelihood and more accurate recovery of basin geometry, state occupancy, and transition dynamics than conventional binary energy landscape models. In addition, results from the fMRI dataset indicate a 0.27 increase in AUC for predicting working memory and executive function, along with a 0.35 improvement in explained variance (R2) for predicting reaction time. These findings highlight the advantages of utilizing the full signal values in energy landscape models for capturing neuronal dynamics, with strong implications for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.

Abstract: The accurate classification of neuronal cell types is central to decoding brain function, yet remains hindered by data scarcity and cellular heterogeneity. Here, we benchmarked classical and deep generative synthetic data augmentation strategies -- including SMOTE, GANs, VAEs, Normalizing Flows, and DDPMs -- for supervised classification of both electrophysiological (e-type) and morpho-electrophysiological (mee-type) neuron types from the mouse visual cortex. Using a curated dataset annotated with 48 electrophysiological and 24 morphological features, we established baseline classifiers and introduced synthetic data generated by each method. Our results demonstrate that SMOTE-based augmentation yields the highest classification accuracies (absolute gains of 0.16 for e-types, 0.12 for mee-types), outperforming deep generative models. GANs approached similar performance when hyperparameters and sample sizes were optimized, but were more sensitive to model specification. In addition, we benchmarked synthetic neuron fidelity by comparing mean absolute errors between synthetic and real class profiles against the natural phenotypic variability observed between real neuronal classes.

                arXiv:2512.12802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific theories of consciousness should be falsifiable and non-trivial. Recent research has given us formal tools to analyze these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality for theories of consciousness. Surprisingly, many contemporary theories of consciousness fail to pass this bar, including theories based on causal structure but also (as I demonstrate) theories based on function. Herein I show these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.

                arXiv:2601.02063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How much of the brain's learned algorithms depend on the fact it is a brain? We argue: a lot, but surprisingly few details matter. We point to simple biological details -- e.g. nonnegative firing and energetic/space budgets in connectionist architectures -- which, when mixed with the requirements of solving a task, produce models that predict brain responses down to single-neuron tuning. We understand this as details constraining the set of plausible algorithms, and their implementations, such that only `brain-like' algorithms are learned. In particular, each biological detail breaks a symmetry in connectionist models (scale, rotation, permutation) leading to interpretable single-neuron responses that are meaningfully characteristic of particular algorithms. This view helps us not only understand the brain's choice of algorithm but also infer algorithm from measured neural responses. Further, this perspective aligns computational neuroscience with mechanistic interpretability in AI, suggesting a more unified approach to studying the mechanisms of intelligence, both natural and artificial.

                arXiv:2504.10752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing interest has developed in the problem of training models of EEG features to predict brain activity measured using fMRI, i.e. the problem of EEG-to-fMRI synthesis. Despite some reported success, the statistical significance and generalizability of EEG-to-fMRI predictions remains to be fully demonstrated. Here, we investigate the predictive power of EEG for both task-evoked and spontaneous activity of the somatomotor network measured by fMRI, based on data collected from healthy subjects in two different sessions. We trained subject-specific distributed-lag linear models of time-varying, multi-channel EEG spectral power using Sparse Group LASSO regularization, and we showed that learned models outperformed conventional EEG somatomotor rhythm predictors as well as massive univariate correlation models. Furthermore, we showed that learned models were statistically significantly better than appropriate null models in most subjects and conditions, although less frequently for spontaneous compared to task-evoked activity. Critically, predictions improved significantly when training and testing on data acquired in the same session relative to across sessions, highlighting the importance of temporally separating the collection of train and test data to avoid data leakage and optimistic bias in model generalization. In sum, while we demonstrate that EEG models can provide fMRI predictions with statistical significance, we also show that predictive power is impaired for spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity and for models trained on data acquired in a different session. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly consider these often overlooked issues in the growing literature of EEG-to-fMRI synthesis.

                arXiv:2505.24580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this commentary, we argue that El Hady and Machta's "surface wave" model for mechanical waves accompanying action potential (AP) propagation describes the same underlying process as the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model introduced earlier by Rvachev. Both models describe mechanical modes that store potential energy in the elastic components of the axon (axonal membrane, cytoskeleton, bulk axoplasmic deformation), with kinetic energy carried by the axoplasmic fluid and axoplasmic viscosity playing a significant role. The "surface wave" model quantitatively considers driving by the traveling electrical depolarization wave of the AP, whereas the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model qualitatively considers driving not only by the AP's electrical depolarization but also by other mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal actomyosin contractility. In addition, the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model considers mechanisms for synchronizing the depolarization wave and the pressure wave. Although derived using different approaches, the two models yield identical dependencies for the mechanical modes in key limits. The confusion in the literature, which treats these models as describing distinct processes, needs to be resolved to improve comprehensive understanding of the AP phenomenon and to guide future research.

                arXiv:2507.17224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07830">Optimal Learning Rate Schedule for Balancing Effort and Performance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16933">Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain</a></h4>

Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06318">Random is Faster than Systematic in Multi-Objective Local Search</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local search is a fundamental method in operations research and combinatorial optimisation. It has been widely applied to a variety of challenging problems, including multi-objective optimisation where multiple, often conflicting, objectives need to be simultaneously considered. In multi-objective local search algorithms, a common practice is to maintain an archive of all non-dominated solutions found so far, from which the algorithm iteratively samples a solution to explore its neighbourhood. A central issue in this process is how to explore the neighbourhood of a selected solution. In general, there are two main approaches: 1) systematic exploration and 2) random sampling. The former systematically explores the solution's neighbours until a stopping condition is met -- for example, when the neighbourhood is exhausted (i.e., the best improvement strategy) or once a better solution is found (i.e., first improvement). In contrast, the latter randomly selects and evaluates only one neighbour of the solution. One may think systematic exploration may be more efficient, as it prevents from revisiting the same neighbours multiple times. In this paper, however, we show that this may not be the case. We first empirically demonstrate that the random sampling method is consistently faster than the systematic exploration method across a range of multi-objective problems. We then give an intuitive explanation for this phenomenon using toy examples, showing that the superior performance of the random sampling method relies on the distribution of ``good neighbours''. Next, we show that the number of such neighbours follows a certain probability distribution during the search. Lastly, building on this distribution, we provide a theoretical insight for why random sampling is more efficient than systematic exploration, regardless of whether the best improvement or first improvement strategy is used.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06387">An Efficient Evolutionary Algorithm for Few-for-Many Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-for-many (F4M) optimization, recently introduced as a novel paradigm in multi-objective optimization, aims to find a small set of solutions that effectively handle a large number of conflicting objectives. Unlike traditional many-objective optimization methods, which typically attempt comprehensive coverage of the Pareto front, F4M optimization emphasizes finding a small representative solution set to efficiently address high-dimensional objective spaces. Motivated by the computational complexity and practical relevance of F4M optimization, this paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm explicitly tailored for efficiently solving F4M optimization problems. Inspired by SMS-EMOA, our proposed approach employs a $(\mu+1)$-evolution strategy guided by the objective of F4M optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate rigorous performance assessment, we propose a novel benchmark test suite specifically designed for F4M optimization by leveraging the similarity between the R2 indicator and F4M formulations. Our test suite is highly flexible, allowing any existing multi-objective optimization problem to be transformed into a corresponding F4M instance via scalarization using the weighted Tchebycheff function. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, especially on instances involving a large number of objectives. The source code of the proposed algorithm will be released publicly. Source code is available at https://github.com/MOL-SZU/SoM-EMOA.

                arXiv:2601.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback-rich neural architectures can regenerate earlier representations and inject temporal context, making them a natural setting for strictly local synaptic plasticity. We ask whether a minimal, backpropagation-free feedback--Hebbian system can already express interpretable continual-learning--relevant behaviors under controlled training schedules. We introduce a compact prediction--reconstruction architecture with two feedforward layers for supervised association learning and two dedicated feedback layers trained to reconstruct earlier activity and re-inject it as additive temporal context. All synapses are updated by a unified local rule combining centered Hebbian covariance, Oja-style stabilization, and a local supervised drive where targets are available, requiring no weight transport or global error backpropagation. On a small two-pair association task, we characterize learning through layer-wise activity snapshots, connectivity trajectories (row/column means of learned weights), and a normalized retention index across phases. Under sequential A->B training, forward output connectivity exhibits a long-term depression (LTD)-like suppression of the earlier association while feedback connectivity preserves an A-related trace during acquisition of B. Under deterministic interleaving A,B,A,B,..., both associations are concurrently maintained rather than sequentially suppressed. Architectural controls and rule-term ablations isolate the role of dedicated feedback in regeneration and co-maintenance, and the role of the local supervised term in output selectivity and unlearning. Together, the results show that a compact feedback pathway trained with local plasticity can support regeneration and continual-learning--relevant dynamics in a minimal, mechanistically transparent setting.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06920">Calibrating Agent-Based Financial Markets Simulators with Pretrainable Automatic Posterior Transformation-Based Surrogates</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrating Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is an important optimization problem for simulating the complex social systems, where the goal is to identify the optimal parameter of a given ABM by minimizing the discrepancy between the simulated data and the real-world observations. Unfortunately, it suffers from the extensive computational costs of iterative evaluations, which involves the expensive simulation with the candidate parameter. While Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely adopted to alleviate the computational burden, existing methods face two key limitations: 1) surrogating the original evaluation function is hard due the nonlinear yet multi-modal nature of the ABMs, and 2) the commonly used surrogates cannot share the optimization experience among multiple calibration tasks, making the batched calibration less effective. To address these issues, this work proposes Automatic posterior transformation with Negatively Correlated Search and Adaptive Trust-Region (ANTR). ANTR first replaces the traditional surrogates with a pretrainable neural density estimator that directly models the posterior distribution of the parameters given observed data, thereby aligning the optimization objective with parameter-space accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate a diversity-preserving search strategy to prevent premature convergence and an adaptive trust-region method to efficiently allocate computational resources. We take two representative ABM-based financial market simulators as the test bench as due to the high non-linearity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed ANTR significantly outperforms conventional metaheuristics and state-of-the-art SAEAs in both calibration accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in batch calibration scenarios across multiple market conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, the foundations of neuromorphic computing, spiking neural networks (SNNs) and memristors, are analyzed and discussed. Neuromorphic computing is then applied to FPGA design for digital signal processing (DSP). Finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are implemented with and without neuromorphic computing in Vivado using Verilog HDL. The results suggest that neuromorphic computing can provide low-latency and synaptic plasticity thereby enabling continuous on-chip learning. Due to their parallel and event-driven nature, neuromorphic computing can reduce power consumption by eliminating von Neumann bottlenecks and improve efficiency, but at the cost of reduced numeric precision.

                arXiv:2601.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a prominent swarm intelligence algorithm extensively applied to path planning. However, traditional ACO methods often exhibit shortcomings, such as blind search behavior and slow convergence within complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Pheromone-Focused Ant Colony Optimization (PFACO) algorithm, which introduces three key strategies to enhance the problem-solving ability of the ant colony. First, the initial pheromone distribution is concentrated in more promising regions based on the Euclidean distances of nodes to the start and end points, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Second, promising solutions are reinforced during colony iterations to intensify pheromone deposition along high-quality paths, accelerating convergence while maintaining solution diversity. Third, a forward-looking mechanism is implemented to penalize redundant path turns, promoting smoother and more efficient solutions. These strategies collectively produce the focused pheromones to guide the ant colony's search, which enhances the global optimization capabilities of the PFACO algorithm, significantly improving convergence speed and solution quality across diverse optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate that PFACO consistently outperforms comparative ACO algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.

Abstract: Radio astronomy relies on bespoke, experimental and innovative computing solutions. This will continue as next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) take shape. Under increasingly demanding power consumption, and increasingly challenging radio environments, science goals may become intractable with conventional von Neumann computing due to related power requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory. High-data-rate spectrographic processing could be a well-suited target for the neuromorphic computing industry, as we cast radio telescopes as the world's largest in-sensor compute challenge.

                arXiv:2601.07348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks.To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

                arXiv:2506.19256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe temporal gradient vanishing and overfitting issues, which fundamentally constrain their performance and generalizability. This paper unveils a temporal regularization training (TRT) memthod, designed to unleash the generalization and performance potential of SNNs through a time-decaying regularization mechanism that prioritizes early timesteps with stronger constraints. We perform theoretical analysis to reveal TRT's ability on mitigating the temporal gradient vanishment. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conduct experiments on both static image datasets and dynamic neuromorphic datasets, perform analysis of their results, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and help SNNs converge into flatter local minima with better generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism by analyzing the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs. We track the Fisher information of SNNs during training process, showing that Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00245">Modern Neuromorphic AI: From Intra-Token to Inter-Token Processing</a></h4>

Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought novel data processing and generative capabilities but also escalating energy requirements. This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-219/v2?src=rss">Factors Influencing Food Safety and Hygiene Practices among Food Vendors in the Bibiani-Anwhiaso-Bekwai Municipality. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Food safety is a major public health concern, particularly in developing countries where inadequate hygiene practices among street food vendors contribute to foodborne illnesses. In Ghana, street-vended foods remain a common source of meals for many households, necessitating regular assessment of vendors’ food hygiene and safety practices. Objective This study assessed food hygiene and safety practices among street food vendors in the Bibiani–Anhwiaso–Bekwai Municipality of the Western North Region of Ghana. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study design was employed involving 152 street food vendors selected through purposive and simple random sampling techniques. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and observational checklists. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 15. Descriptive statistics summarized socio-demographic characteristics and hygiene practices. Chi-square tests were used to examine associations between socio-demographic factors and hygiene practices, while binary logistic regression identified predictors of good food hygiene and safety practices. Results Most vendors were female (93.4%) and married (61.8%). Awareness of food hygiene was high (92.1%). Only 56.6% of vendors had undergone medical screening, 53.3% had received food hygiene training, and 53.9% had been inspected within the past six months. Observational findings indicated that while most vendors washed foodstuffs before cooking (86.2%) and maintained clean surroundings (84.2%), some did not use aprons or hair coverings (17.8%), operated in unhygienic environments (21.7%), or lacked valid medical certificates (27.0%). Significant associations were found between hygiene practices and educational level, prior food hygiene training, and municipal health inspections (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that food hygiene training and regular inspections significantly increased the likelihood of practicing safe food handling. Conclusion Despite high awareness of food hygiene, adherence to recommended hygiene and safety practices among street food vendors remains suboptimal. Strengthening food hygiene training, enhancing regulatory enforcement, and improving environmental sanitation are essential to improve food safety and protect public health. Recommendation The government of Ghana and MMDAs should establish the pre-requisite standard operating procedures for all institutions undertaking hospitality regarding food safety and hygiene.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97106">Brain-derived estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen receptor signaling in medaka</a></h4>

              
                In rodents, estrogens aromatized from androgens in the brain are essential for the development of male-typical behaviors. In many other vertebrates, including humans and teleost fish, however, androgens facilitate these behaviors directly via the androgen receptor without aromatization into estrogens. Here, we report that mutagenesis-derived male medaka fish lacking Cyp19a1b (a subtype of aromatase predominantly expressed in the brain) exhibit severely impaired male-typical mating and aggression, despite elevated brain androgen levels. These phenotypes can be rescued by estrogen administration, indicating that brain-derived estrogens are pivotal for male-typical behaviors even in teleosts. Our results further suggest that these estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen action in the brain via the direct stimulation of androgen receptor transcription. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated mode of action of brain-derived estrogens in facilitating male-typical behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106383">Hypothalamic deiodinase type-3 establishes the period of circannual interval timing in mammals</a></h4>

              
                Animals respond to environmental cues to time phenological events, but the intrinsic mechanism of circannual timing remains elusive. We used transcriptomic sequencing and frequent sampling of multiple hypothalamic nuclei in Djungarian hamsters to examine the neural and molecular architecture of circannual interval timing. Our study identified three distinct phases of transcript changes, with deiodinase type-3 (<i>Dio3</i>) expression activated during the early induction phase. Subsequent work demonstrated that targeted mutation of <i>Dio3</i> using CRISPR–Cas resulted in a shorter period for circannual interval timing. Hamsters that are non-responsive to short photoperiods and fail to show any winter adaptations do not display changes in <i>Dio3</i> expression and do not show any change in body mass or pelage. Our work demonstrates that changes in <i>Dio3</i> induction are essential for setting the period of circannual interval timing.

                <p>An exciting aspect of neuroscience is developing and testing hypotheses via experimentation. However, due to logistical and financial hurdles, the experiment and discovery component of neuroscience is generally lacking in classroom and outreach settings. To address this issue, here we introduce RetINaBox: a low-cost open&ndash;source electronic visual system simulator that provides users with a hands-on tool to discover how the visual system builds feature detectors. RetINaBox includes an LED array for generating visual stimuli and photodiodes that act as an array of model photoreceptors. Custom software on a Raspberry Pi computer reads out responses from model photoreceptors and allows users to control the polarity and delay of the signal transfer from model photoreceptors to model retinal ganglion cells. Interactive lesson plans are provided, guiding users to discover different types of visual feature detectors&mdash;including ON/OFF, center-surround, orientation-selective, and direction-selective receptive fields&mdash;as well as their underlying circuit computations.</p>

                <p>Autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder are neuropsychiatric conditions that manifest early in life with a wide range of phenotypes, including repetitive behavior, agitation, and anxiety (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">American Psychological Association, 2013</cross-ref>). While the etiology of these disorders is incompletely understood, recent data implicate a role for mitochondrial dysfunction (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B38">Norkett et al., 2017</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B19">Khaliulin et al., 2025</cross-ref>). Mitochondria translocate to intracellular compartments to support energetics and free-radical buffering; failure to achieve this localization results in cellular dysfunction (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Picard et al., 2016</cross-ref>). Mitochondrial Rho-GTPase 1 (<I>Miro1</I>) resides on the outer mitochondrial membrane and facilitates microtubule-mediated mitochondrial motility (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Fransson et al., 2003</cross-ref>). The loss of <I>MIRO1</I> is reported to contribute to the onset/progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B18">Kay et al., 2018</cross-ref>). We have hypothesized that MIRO1 also has a role in nervous system development (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B22">Lin-Hendel et al., 2016</cross-ref>). To test this, we ablated <I>Miro1</I> from cortical excitatory progenitors by crossing floxed <I>Miro1</I> mice with <I>Emx1-Cre</I> mice and studied mice of both sex. We found that mitochondrial mislocalization in migrating excitatory neurons was associated with reduced brain weight, decreased cortical volume, and subtle cortical disorganization. Adult <I>Miro1</I> conditional mutants exhibit agitative-like behaviors, including decreased nesting and abnormal home cage activity. The mice exhibited anxiety-like behavior and avoided confined spaces, features that have been linked to several human behavioral disorders. Our data link MIRO1 function with mitochondrial dynamics in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders and implicate intracellular mitochondrial dynamics to several anxiety-like behaviors.</p>

                This paper investigates the Single-Machine Scheduling Problem under a multi-criteria optimization framework with due-window constraints, a class of NP-hard problems. The research introduces a mathematical formulation that integrates three performance measures—maximum earliness, maximum tardiness, and maximum late work—into a unified scheduling model. The due date of each job is represented as a flexible time interval bounded by minimum and maximum limits, providing a more realistic representation of production and service systems. To address the complexity of the problem, several special cases are analyzed, and a set of dominance rules is proposed to identify efficient sequences that minimize computational effort while maintaining optimality. These rules extend classical sequencing principles such as the Minimum Slack Time and Earliest Due Date rules to multi-objective contexts. So, in Results and Discussion the comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed dominance-based approach provides reliable and efficient solutions consistent with those obtained by the Complete Enumeration Method (CEM), but with significantly reduced computational complexity. The theoretical contributions of this study offer a solid foundation for understanding trade-offs between different scheduling criteria within due-window environments. Practical implications arise in Just-in-Time (JIT) systems, where minimizing both early and late job completions directly impacts cost efficiency and workflow stability. Although the analysis is restricted to a deterministic single-machine setup, the proposed framework can be extended to multi-machine, stochastic, or dynamic scheduling environments. Future research may focus on developing heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms to solve larger instances efficiently. Overall, the study contributes to the advancement of multi-criteria scheduling theory by combining mathematical rigor with practical relevance for real-world manufacturing and service operations.

                Sinha and Goulian demonstrate that the phosphatase SixA is critical for E. coli to survive the starvation stress of long-term stationary phase. Genetic and biochemical analyses show that this survival advantage depends on SixA-mediated dephosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphate kinase, revealing a new mechanism for regulating this enzyme in bacteria.

                Graf et al. optogenetically mapped 24 inhibitory circuits formed between interneurons and postsynaptic targets within the claustrum. A computational model predicts that the spatial structure of local circuits filters claustral input, and experimental tests confirm model predictions. Claustrum filtering precisely transforms excitatory input into output to cortical and subcortical targets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104808">Dilated cardiomyopathy-associated RNA-binding motif protein 20 regulates long pre-mRNAs in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Precise coordination of molecular programs and neuronal growth governs the formation, maintenance, and adaptation of neuronal circuits. RNA metabolism has emerged as a key regulatory node of neural development and nervous system pathologies. To uncover cell-type-specific RNA regulators, we systematically investigated expression of RNA recognition motif-containing proteins in the mouse neocortex. Surprisingly, we found RNA-binding motif protein 20 (RBM20), an alternative splicing regulator associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, to be expressed in cortical parvalbumin interneurons and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Genome-wide mapping of RBM20 target mRNAs revealed that neuronal RBM20 binds pre-mRNAs in distal intronic regions. Loss of neuronal RBM20 has only modest impact on alternative splice isoforms but results in a significant reduction in an array of mature mRNAs in the neuronal cytoplasm. This phenotype is particularly pronounced for genes with long introns that encode synaptic proteins. We hypothesize that RBM20 ensures fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing by suppressing nonproductive splicing events in long neuronal genes. This work highlights a common requirement for RBM20-dependent transcriptome regulation in cardiomyocytes and neurons and demonstrates that a major genetic risk factor of heart disease impacts neuronal gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106464">A geometric shape regularity effect in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The perception and production of regular geometric shapes, a characteristic trait of human cultures since prehistory, has unknown neural mechanisms. Behavioral studies suggest that humans are attuned to discrete regularities such as symmetries and parallelism and rely on their combinations to encode regular geometric shapes in a compressed form. To identify the brain systems underlying this ability, as well as their dynamics, we collected functional MRI in both adults and 6-year-olds, and magnetoencephalography data in adults, during the perception of simple shapes such as hexagons, triangles, and quadrilaterals. The results revealed that geometric shapes, relative to other visual categories, induce a hypoactivation of ventral visual areas and an overactivation of the intraparietal and inferior temporal regions also involved in mathematical processing, whose activation is modulated by geometric regularity. While convolutional neural networks captured the early visual activity evoked by geometric shapes, they failed to account for subsequent dorsal parietal and prefrontal signals, which could only be captured by discrete geometric features or by bigger deep-learning models of vision. We propose that the perception of abstract geometric regularities engages an additional symbolic mode of visual perception.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92991">Predicting the effect of CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenome editing</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic regulation orchestrates mammalian transcription, but functional links between them remain elusive. To tackle this problem, we use epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 13 ENCODE cell types to train machine learning models to predict gene expression from histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), achieving transcriptome-wide correlations of ∼0.70−0.79 for most cell types. Our models recapitulate known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, including predicting that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how natural vs. engineered deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line and to 5 genes in the K562 cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold-changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold-changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments. Together, these improvements would facilitate the ability to understand and predictably control the dynamic human epigenome with consequences for human health.

                Invasive cancer is defined by the loss of epithelial cell traits resulting from the ectopic expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related transcription factors such as Snail. Although EMT is known to impart chemoresistance to cancer cells, the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We found that Snail expression confers chemoresistance by upregulating the cholesterol efflux pump ABCA1 as a countermeasure to the excess of cytotoxic free cholesterol relative to its major interaction partner in cellular membranes, sphingomyelin. This imbalance is introduced by the transcriptional repression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sphingomyelin by Snail. Inhibiting esterification of cholesterol, which renders it inert, selectively suppresses growth of a xenograft model of Snail-positive kidney cancer. Our findings offer a new perspective on lipid-targeting strategies for invasive cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105948">Linking complex microbial interactions and dysbiosis through a disordered Lotka–Volterra model</a></h4>

              
                The rapid advancement of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has significantly enhanced our ability to study microbial communities. The eubiotic composition of these communities is crucial for maintaining ecological functions and host health. Species diversity is only one facet of a healthy community’s organization; together with abundance distributions and interaction structures, it shapes reproducible macroecological states, that is, joint statistical fingerprints that summarize whole-community behavior. Despite recent developments, a theoretical framework connecting empirical data with ecosystem modeling is still in its infancy, particularly in the context of disordered systems. Here, we present a novel framework that couples statistical physics tools for disordered systems with metagenomic data, explicitly linking diversity, interactions, and stability to define and compare these macroecological states. By employing the generalized Lotka–Volterra model with random interactions, we reveal two different emergent patterns of species interaction networks and species abundance distributions for healthy and diseased microbiomes. On the one hand, healthy microbiomes have similar community structures across individuals, characterized by strong species interactions and abundance diversity consistent with neutral stochastic fluctuations. On the other hand, diseased microbiomes show greater variability driven by deterministic factors, thus resulting in less ecologically stable and more divergent communities. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered system theory to characterize microbiomes and to capture the role of ecological interactions on stability and functioning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108892">Overexpression of Ssd1 and calorie restriction extend yeast replicative lifespan by preventing deleterious age-dependent iron uptake</a></h4>

              
                Overexpression of the mRNA binding protein Ssd1 extends the yeast replicative lifespan. Using microfluidics to trap and image single cells throughout their lifespans, we find that lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression is accompanied by formation of cytoplasmic Ssd1 foci. The age-dependent Ssd1 foci are condensates that appear dynamically in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, and their failure to resolve during mitosis coincided with the end of lifespan. Ssd1 overexpression was epistatic with calorie restriction (CR) for lifespan extension, and yeast overexpressing Ssd1 or undergoing CR were resistant to iron supplementation-induced lifespan shortening, while their lifespans were reduced by iron chelation. The nuclear translocation of the Aft1 transcriptional regulator of the iron regulon occurred during aging in a manner that predicted remaining lifespan but was prevented by CR. Accordingly, age-dependent induction of the Fit2 and Arn1 high-affinity iron transporters within the iron regulon was reduced by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Consistent with age-dependent activation of the iron regulon, intracellular iron accumulated during aging but was prevented by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Moreover, lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression or CR was epistatic to inactivation of the iron regulon. These studies reveal that CR and Ssd1 overexpression extend the yeast replicative lifespan by blocking deleterious age-dependent iron uptake, identifying novel therapeutic targets for lifespan extension and providing insight into how CR may extend the lifespan and healthspan in humans.

">Adult human ex vivo brain slices for dissecting glial biology and multicellular communication</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells are critical modulators of brain function in health, aging, and disease, emerging as promising therapeutic targets. However, exploring their roles and therapeutic potential is limited by the lack of experimental systems that faithfully capture the repertoire of mature human glial cells while permitting controlled perturbations. Here, we establish a robust ex vivo platform for cell-type specific interrogation of glial responses and multicellular crosstalk, based on adult human organotypic brain slice cultures, obtained from neurosurgical resections. We show that slice cultures preserve tissue architecture, maintain all major cell types and mature cellular identities over weeks in culture. These cultures elicit robust, stimulus-specific transcriptional programs to diverse stressors and inflammatory stimuli, demonstrating sensitivity to distinguish closely related signals and reproducibility despite biological and technical variation. Moreover, we resolved coordinated glial cell type-specific responses to TNF, a key mediator of neuroinflammation, uncovering distinct and physiologically relevant functional roles validated in postmortem human brains. Network analyses discovered balanced pro- and anti- inflammatory loops among microglia and astrocyte cells, which notably also involved oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), confirming their suggested role in regulation of the tissue level inflammatory response in human brains. We experimentally validated that glial activation in slice cultures is orchestrated not only by direct stimulation but also through intercellular signaling across cell types, mirroring natural multicellular dynamics in brain tissue. Together, organotypic brain slice cultures emerge as a sensitive and robust platform for dissecting adult human glial biology, paving the way for deeper mechanistic insights and advanced drug-screening applications.

">More is better: Improved visual discrimination through local feature diversity in naturalistic objects</a></h4>

              
                Visual discrimination is traditionally studied with highly controlled, artificial stimuli such as gratings. Yet real-world object discrimination relies on many interacting image dimensions. Here we compared human discrimination performance of oriented gratings with that of natural object morphs, and then asked which stimulus dimensions are most important for morph discrimination. In Experiment 1, participants discriminated between two artificial gratings, two natural grating-like textures, and two natural, morphed stimuli. Morph stimuli were discriminated faster and over a larger stimulus range. In Experiment 2, we separated the contribution of distinct image features, specifically colour, texture, and shape, to the discriminability of the morph stimuli. To this end, we varied two feature dimensions at a time while keeping the third dimension constant. Discrimination was best when colour and texture varied together, resulting in steeper psychometric functions and faster responses than when shape changed. Together, these results suggest a discriminative advantage for natural-object morphs over gratings, driven primarily by local colour and texture information rather than global shape.

">Oxytocin Modulation of Spinal Circuits Drives Therapeutic Benefits of Massage</a></h4>

              
                Across social species, social touch enhances well-being and reduces pain - two seemingly distinct benefits that enhance survival. Yet where and how the nervous system integrates these functions, and whether a single mechanism could serve both, remains unknown. Here we show that massage triggers oxytocin release, which shapes both pain and touch reward at the earliest stage of central processing - the spinal cord - through a single, state-dependent circuit mechanism. We report that in humans, massage enhances well-being, effects that correlate with endogenous oxytocin release. In mice, gentle touch activates hypothalamic oxytocin neurons that project directly to the spinal dorsal horn. Genetic manipulation of spinal oxytocin circuits alters behavioral responses to both gentle touch and noxious stimuli. Spinal calcium imaging and slice electrophysiology reveal that oxytocin acts on both excitatory and inhibitory spinal neurons to sculpt the relative activity of spinal ascending systems that convey both social touch and pain to the brain. Extending these findings to humans, we show that oxytocin receptors are also expressed on spinal excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and that endogenous oxytocin during massage correlates with altered spinal touch processing. Thus, spinal oxytocin signaling provides an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the therapeutic benefits of massage.

                Autism spectrum conditions are characterised by substantial heterogeneity in brain function, yet most neuroimaging studies rely on brief single-session acquisitions that prioritise group-level comparisons over individual characterisation. We present a precision functional imaging dataset with extended neuroimaging acquisitions to advance research on individual differences in autism. The dataset comprises 33 autistic adults between the ages of 18 and 30, and 34 age- and gender-matched comparison participants, each scanned across three sessions with up to 90 minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging per participant. Functional data were acquired during eyes-open rest, news viewing, and reality television viewing to probe state-dependent differences in network engagement. The dataset includes high-resolution structural imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging with dual phase-encoding, and physiological recordings of cardiac and respiratory activity acquired simultaneously with functional scans. All data are organised following Brain Imaging Data Structure principles and accompanied by comprehensive quality control metrics and preprocessed derivatives. This dataset enables investigation of individual-specific functional brain organisation, test-retest reliability of connectivity patterns, and state-dependency of functional networks in autism, addressing a notable gap in publicly available neuroimaging resources.

">Pharmacological intervention targeting neuroimmune axis in the aging hypothalamus prevents age-associated physiological decline</a></h4>

              
                Systemic physiological aging is largely driven by disrupted metabolic homeostasis, yet the central mechanisms of this metabolic dysfunction remain poorly defined. Here, we identify the hypothalamus as a critical hub driving systemic aging through neuroimmune-mediated mechanisms. Single-cell transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that aged hypothalami exhibit significant infiltration of CD8 T lymphocytes, beginning in middle age, with signatures of activation and tissue residency. These T cells intimately interact with tanycytes and microglia, promoting neuroinflammation and progressive tanycyte loss, a defining hallmark of hypothalamic aging. T cell receptor profiling revealed a substantial presence of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, likely activated through cytokine-driven, antigen-independent mechanisms. In aged hypothalamus, microglia secrete chemokines CCL3 and CCL4, whose ectopic expression in young mice was sufficient to trigger persistent hypothalamic T cell infiltration and accelerated systemic aging. Circulating oxidized LDLs (OxLDLs) were identified as upstream inducers of this chemokine response. Notably, pharmacological blockade of the CCL3/4-CCR5 axis with Maraviroc and Cenicriviroc prevented T cell recruitment and ameliorated metabolic and physiological impairments. Given the clinical safety of CCR5 antagonists and individuals lacking functional CCR5 remain generally healthy throughout life, our findings highlight midlife CCL3/4-CCR5 inhibition as a translatable therapeutic target for delaying age-related decline and promoting healthspan.

Complete head-fixation that creates vestibular conflict disrupts both unit and population encoding of head direction, while selectively constraining head-on-body movements either in real or virtual reality uniquely impairs HD population activity. More specifically, attractor dynamics is altered in head-restrained mice during periods of immobility, but remarkably recover several hundred milliseconds prior to locomotion onset. The rescue preceding movement onset suggests that an efference copy or prediction of a re-afferent signal is necessary to maintain HD network activity during head restraint. A computational model recapitulates these effects by perturbing lateral connectivity among HD neurons. More generally, the results indicate that the HD network is a context- and state-dependent predictive estimator, stabilized by forthcoming self-motion signals. The classic ring-attractor models should be revised to integrate context-dependent dynamics with prospective motor signals, offering a more complete account of how the brains compass remains stable across both naturalistic and constrained conditions.

">Boundary Vector Cells Encode a Future-Biased Spectrum of Positions in the Rat</a></h4>

              
                Spatial tuning is a hallmark property of neural firing in the hippocampal formation. Yet, that tuning is often less well correlated with the instantaneous current position of an animal than it is with an integrated version of the past or future state of the animal. Whether that encoding is biased towards past or future states and the extent to which it shows fixed versus multi-scale encoding varies across circuits and cell types. The temporal encoding properties of boundary vector cells of the subiculum are not well established. To address this here, we re-analyzed recordings of BVCs described previously by Lever et al. (2009) with multiple approaches. In the first, we asked if adding a temporal offset between the rat position and the spiking of a BVC increased the apparent spatial tuning in the firing rate map. We found that aligning BVC spiking with future states maximized the rate map spatial tuning. These results were mirrored in a second analysis that, instead of optimizing rate map spatial tuning, optimized how well the firing rate map predicted the BVC spiking. The second analysis also allowed us to ask whether that encoding is focused on a particular temporal horizon or whether the encoding captures behavior at multiple scales. To this end, for a given recording, we asked ``How much time-integration of the behavioral state is the observed spiking most consistent with?'' We observed a wide spectrum of time-constants of integration across cells, indicating that BVCs form a multiscale encoding of future states. The distribution of both offsets and integration rates observed across BVCs did not differ significantly from other, non-BVC, subiculum neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate that BVCs, along with other subiculum neurons, form a multi-scale encoding of future states.

">DREADD agonist Clozapine-N-oxide, but not Compound 21, impairs spatial memory encoding</a></h4>

              
                Chemogenetic studies using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) enable the precise manipulation of neuronal activity in specific brain regions and cell types. DREADDs are widely used to dissect neural circuits underlying animal behavior, including learning and memory. Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO), a metabolite of clozapine and one of the earliest-developed ligands for muscarinic DREADDs, was initially considered pharmacologically inert. However, CNO is now known to undergo back-metabolism to clozapine, leading to undesired off-target behavioral effects, including alterations in locomotion and anxiety-related behaviors. New ligands such as Compound 21 (C21) have been developed to improve selectivity and reduce these effects. However, despite their widespread use, no studies to date have directly compared the effects of CNO and C21 themselves on specific cognitive processes such as hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Here, we measured acute effects of CNO and C21 on spatial memory encoding, using an object-location memory (OLM) paradigm in male and female mice. We also quantified encoding-associated hippocampal principal neuron and parvalbumin (PV+) interneuron activity by measuring cFos expression in these populations. Across dorsal hippocampal subregions, neither ligand altered overall neuronal activity nor PV+ interneuron activity during encoding. Nonetheless, we find that CNO administration impairs OLM encoding, while C21 does not. Together, these findings highlight a previously unrecognized behavioral effect of CNO administration on hippocampus-dependent memory formation - even in the absence of DREADD expression - and indicate that C21 may be a preferable ligand for chemogenetic studies examining memory and hippocampal function.

">Location and mapping of the human rostromedial tegmental nucleus and associated midbrain inhibitory nuclei regulating dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background: Animal experiments reveal distinct GABAergic cell clusters within the dopaminergic midbrain regions in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and retrorubral fields (RRF) that have yet to be clearly defined in humans. These neurons send prominent inhibitory projections to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area that impact motor, reward and threat processing. Objective: To identify GABergic RMTg and RRF cell clusters in the human brain. Methods: Ten m formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded transverse human brainstem sections from ten control cases were obtained from the Sydney Brain Bank and immunohistochemistry for GABA and tyrosine hydroxylase was used to determine the location and cell size of RMTg and RRF GABAergic neurons. These cell populations were further mapped in transverse 50m thick cresyl violet stained serial midbrain sections (every 750m) from previously published controls (Halliday et al. 1990a). Results: GABAergic neurons were cytoarchitecturally distinct, with the largest GABAergic neurons in the RRF, followed by RMTg neurons which were larger than GABAergic neurons in the interpedunclular nucleus (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.0001). RMTg and RRF GABAergic neurons first appear in caudal transverse midbrain sections approximately 38mm above the obex. RMTg moves rostrally and medially from underneath the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle to just lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus. The RRF cluster also moves rostrally and medially to the parabrachial pigmented nucleus (PBP) just under the red nucleus. Conclusion: The GABAergic neurons in RMTg and RRF/PBP that modulate dopamine neuronal excitability have distinct morphologies in humans. Identifying these inhibitory neurons is key to evaluating their role in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Inflammatory signaling differentially changes chromatin accessibility and gene expression of the PD- associated kinase LRRK2 between human and mice</a></h4>

              
                The genomic locus that encodes the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene is highly pleiotropic, being associated with both Parkinsons disease (PD) and Crohns disease (CD). Coding variants associated with risk of PD and CD act as gain of function kinase mutations increasing phosphorylation of RAB substrates, and non-coding variants in the promoter region of LRRK2 increase expression of the gene, notably in immune cells. If regulation of LRRK2 expression is a causal contributor to age-related diseases, it is important to understand the mechanism(s) by which LRRK2 is regulated, particularly in the context of inflammation. Here, we show that interferon-gamma exposure induces robust LRRK2 activation in human iPSC derived microglia through signaling of the Janus-activated Kinase complex to phosphorylate STAT1, which then binds to the LRRK2 promoter and is associated with remodeling of chromatin structure in this genomic locus. Additional regulatory mechanisms include the stress-induced transcription factor and long non-coding RNA encoded at the same locus, resulting in increased LRRK2 mRNA levels. We also show evidence of the same effect in acutely cultured human brain slices. While we were unable to demonstrate any induction of Lrrk2 mRNA in the mouse brain, the introduction of a human bacterial artificial chromosome transgene into the mouse genome recapitulated sensitivity to interferon-gamma in microglia. A comparative genomic analysis across mammals suggests that these species differences are driven by regulatory regions upstream of LRRK2 that are specific to anthropoid primates. These results demonstrate that there are differences between species in how genes associated with human diseases are regulated and provide important information that should be incorporated in disease modeling.

">A Quantitative Benchmark of Visual Information in Human Brain Recordings Across fMRI, MEG, and EEG</a></h4>

              
                Noninvasive human brain recordings such as fMRI, MEG, and EEG are widely used to study visual representations, yet their relative information content has never been quantitatively benchmarked under matched experimental conditions. Here, we develop a unified decoding framework that enables fair cross-modal comparison using identical naturalistic stimuli (THINGS) and a common decoding analysis. Using a matched stimulus set, we first quantify modality performance via object-category decoding accuracy. Under these conditions, fMRI yielded the highest accuracy (mean 87%), MEG showed intermediate performance (mean 35%), and single-subject EEG achieved lower accuracy (mean 7%), while remaining reliably above chance level (1%). Notably, EEG performance improved substantially when decoding outputs were aggregated across participants in the form of a stimulus-level relational structure, yielding a group-level EEG measure (28%) with accuracy comparable to MEG. We then examined how decoding performance scales with the number of training stimuli and effective measurement time. These analyses revealed distinct efficiency-precision trade-offs across modalities: MEG and group-level EEG were most efficient for short measurement times, whereas fMRI achieved the highest asymptotic performance when sufficient data were collected. Together, these findings demonstrate that modality performance differs systematically even under tightly matched conditions and that decoding provides a principled way to assess the information content of fMRI, MEG, and EEG. The proposed unified framework offers practical guidelines for modality selection, experimental design, and data collection planning in neuroscience.

">ANKS1B in the Nucleus Accumbens controls escalated cocaine self-administration via regulating CBP-FoxO3 complex</a></h4>

              
                The transition from controlled to escalated drug intake is a core feature of cocaine use disorder (CUD), yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this behavioral escalation remain poorly defined. Our prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified ANKS1B as a significant shared genetic risk factor for heroin, methamphetamine, and alcohol dependence, suggesting a broad role in addiction vulnerability. However, the specific function of ANKS1B in cocaine addiction and its associated neural mechanisms were unknown. Here, we found that ANKS1B expression level in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) was downregulated after extended cocaine use, and manipulating ANKS1B could selectively influence the escalation of cocaine intake and the subsequent cocaine-seeking behavior in the long-access cocaine self-administration rat model. Molecular experiments reveal that ANKS1B interacts with the histone acetyltransferase CBP to control H3K27 acetylation and extended cocaine intake, via epigenetically repressing the transcription factor FoxO3. Overall, these findings suggest that ANKS1B is a crucial factor influencing the escalation of cocaine use. The ANKS1B-CBP-FoxO3 signaling pathway presents a promising target for potential therapeutic interventions for controlling extended cocaine use.

">Loss of contractile pericytes and their impaired calcium dynamics exacerbate brain ischemic stroke of awake mice in acute and chronic phases</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic stroke frequently results in persistent neurovascular uncoupling, whereby neuronal activity fails to evoke appropriate microvascular responses despite restoration of upstream blood flow. The cellular mechanisms governing this dysfunction along the arteriolar-capillary continuum remain poorly understood. Using two-photon microscopy and laser speckle imaging in awake Acta2-GCaMP8 mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, we examined calcium signaling and contractile function of vascular smooth muscle cells, precapillary sphincters (PS), and contractile pericytes during stroke progression. During acute phase, PSs exhibited pronounced calcium elevations and strong constriction, amplifying downstream capillary constriction through spatially localized calcium signaling. Following reperfusion, excessive calcium elevations persisted without proportional diameter changes, indicating calcium signaling dysregulation and early uncoupling between mural cell calcium dynamics and vascular responses. In the chronic phase, ischemia induced PS-associated loss of contractile pericytes, leading to capillary dilation and sustained impairment of neurovascular coupling. Although pericyte coverage and calcium signaling partially recovered from second week post stroke, whisker-evoked vascular responses and calcium sensitivity remained compromised. At the network level, blood flow responses became spatially heterogeneous, with pericyte-lost regions exhibiting prolonged hyporesponsiveness during functional hyperemia. These findings identify PSs as key regulators of ischemia-induced microvascular dysfunction and highlight mural cell calcium dysregulation and pericyte loss as drivers of persistent neurovascular uncoupling after stroke.

">Whole-genome profiling of native 5-hydroxymethylation in human neurons with long-read sequencing</a></h4>

              
                The 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modification of DNA is particularly prevalent in neurons and thereby a hallmark of the brain's epigenetic landscape. While 5mC DNA methylation is a well-known player in genome stability and transcriptional regulation, the role of 5hmC remains largely unknown. Here, we used long-read Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) to profile whole-genome, native 5mC and 5hmC levels in sorted neuronal nuclei samples from human post-mortem brain tissue. We applied different models for DNA modification calling and compared with array-based 5mC and 5hmC levels derived from the same samples, demonstrating high sample-wise correlations. Annotation across genomic and regulatory features, as well as chromatin states, generated by the International Human Epigenome Consortium, revealed high levels of 5hmC in introns, actively transcribed genes and (distal) enhancers. Pathway analysis of genes with high levels of 5hmC (> 60%) were enriched in neuron-related terms, with functional variety when stratifying across chromatin states. Analysis of transcription factor motifs in highly methylated regions, demonstrated 5hmC- and 5mC-specific enrichment affecting downstream regulatory networks. Altogether, our study demonstrates the potential of ONT to characterize whole-genome, native 5hmC and 5mC DNA modifications in human neurons, specifically highlighting the enrichment of 5hmC in actively transcribed regions and enhancers in the human brain.

">Investigating cross-memory interactions of timing structures</a></h4>

              
                Motor and episodic memories are classically conceptualised as distinct memory domains. However, both memory sequences are characterised by order and timing of their elements. Generalisation has been previously documented between these different memories, with a shared ordinal structure facilitating learning. However, it is unclear whether this generalisation also applies to the timing structure of a sequence. In a between-subject design, healthy adults (N = 143) learned and reproduced motor and episodic memory sequences with either the same or different timing structures. Contrary to expectations, recall of an episodic timeline was poorer when preceded by learning a motor sequence with the same timing structure. Motor sequence reproduction was not affected by prior episodic encoding. The findings do not support the hypothesis of cross-domain generalisation of timing structure between episodic and motor memories. However, the observed interference may suggest some overlap in the mechanism encoding timing information between memory systems.

However, concurrent eye tracking is often unavailable in functional MRI (fMRI) studies due to technical and logistical constraints. Recent deep learning approaches have made it possible to estimate eye gaze directly from eyeball signals in fMRI data, offering a potential alternative to camera-based eye tracking. Here, we applied a pre-trained fMRI-based deep neural network model (DeepMReye) to estimate eye gaze during movie watching across three independent fMRI datasets. Model performance was evaluated by comparison with camera-based eye-tracking data when available, as well as by assessing inter-individual correlations, a commonly used benchmark in naturalistic fMRI research. At the individual level, predicted gaze showed modest correspondence with measured data (r ranged from 0.38 to 0.67). In contrast, group-averaged gaze predictions exhibited substantially higher correlations (r ranged from 0.7 to 0.8), indicating improved reliability at the group level. We further derived eye-movement-related time series from the predicted gaze signals and examined their associated brain activity. Consistent with differences in prediction accuracy, individual-level analyses yielded activation patterns largely restricted to visual cortex, whereas group-averaged predictions revealed more widespread activation, including established oculomotor control regions such as frontal and parietal eye fields. Exploratory analyses indicated age-related effects on gaze prediction accuracy and eye-movement-related brain activity, although these effects were not consistent across datasets. Together, these findings demonstrate that group-averaged fMRI-based gaze estimation can support the investigation of eye-movement-related brain activity in naturalistic paradigms, while highlighting current limitations for individual-level inference. The results provide a methodological assessment of fMRI-based gaze prediction and inform its appropriate use in future neuroimaging studies.

">Regular parental exercise before mating influences offspring lower adiposity associated to hypothalamic neurodevelopmental changes</a></h4>

              
                Physical inactivity is highly prevalent worldwide and affects not only individual health but also the health of future generations. However, the impact of parental physical activity, limited to the pre-mating period, on offspring body weight and composition remains poorly understood. Using a voluntary wheel running approach in mice, we uncovered that post-weaning offspring body weight and composition changes are modulated by the combined effects of pre-mating parental exercise and parental age. Notably, during lactation, pre-mating parental exercise reduced offspring visceral and subcutaneous adiposity, shortened tibia length in female offspring, and influenced offspring transcriptomic profiles of the hypothalamus, the central region regulating body weight and energy balance. These results highlight that regular pre-mating parental exercise may induce offspring neurodevelopmental changes. Although pre-mating exercise minimally impacted the expression of lactation-related genes in maternal subcutaneous fat, as well as breastmilk nutritional composition and miRNA content, these modest miRNA changes may nonetheless influence offspring hypothalamic regulation. Together, these data provide a comprehensive understanding of how parental age and pre-mating exercise impact post-weaning offspring body weight and composition and offer deeper insights into how regular pre-mating parental exercise influences offspring physiology during lactation.

">Glial vesicular transmitter release is not critical for courtship conditioning memory in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Glial cell function is believed to be critical for the regulation of cognitive processes such as learning and memory but the mechanisms by which glia regulate memory are still poorly elucidated. There is evidence that glial metabolic support and neurotransmitter synaptic clearance are essential for memory processes. But glial cells can also influence neuronal activity by the vesicular release of gliotransmitters in a calcium-dependent manner. Whether gliotransmission also is critical for memory process remains controversial. Here, we explored the role of gliotransmission in Drosophila courtship memory using the thermo-sensitive Shibirets mutant in combination with the UAS/Gal4 expression system, in which glial vesicular transmitter release can be rapid and reversibly impaired. We found that the formation, maintenance and decline of courtship memory were unaffected by the blockade of vesicular release of gliotransmitters. Therefore, our data support the view that the release of gliotransmitters is not an ubiquitously necessary regulatory mechanism of memory and forgetting processes.

">Semaglutide Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown promise in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, with emerging evidence suggesting these effects may be driven by modulation of neuroinflammation. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying GLP-1 RA effects on neuroinflammation remain poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation, we investigated how semaglutide coordinates cellular responses to resolve neuroinflammation. We find that semaglutide prevents brain infiltration of neutrophils, excessive cytokine release, and suppresses neuroinflammation-associated transcriptional signatures specifically in microglia, endothelial cells, and a subset of pericytes. Mechanistically, we identify a subset of Glp1r-expressing neurons in the dorsal vagal complex that, upon semaglutide treatment, regulate genes involved in anti-inflammatory signaling. Semaglutide-modulated pathways overlap with inflammatory signatures found in human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, suggesting broad relevance for conditions involving neuroinflammation. Together, these findings reveal how GLP-1R signaling orchestrates resolution of neuroinflammation through coordinated multi-cellular programs.

">Opposing Autonomic Pathways Link Childhood Trauma to Mental Imagery Deficits</a></h4>

              
                Although childhood trauma alters neurobiological systems supporting emotion regulation and autonomic function, mechanisms linking trauma to mental imagery deficits remain unexplored. Here we examined whether autonomic nervous system symptoms mediate trauma-imagery associations in a general population sample (n = 433). All trauma types showed associations with reduced imagery vividness (r = -.12 to -.23), with emotional neglect and emotional abuse demonstrating the strongest effects. Physical trauma types and emotional abuse correlated with increased autonomic symptoms (r = .35-.38). Parallel mediation analyses revealed that autonomic symptom burden (BPQ ANS subscale), but not anxiety, significantly mediated trauma-imagery relationships through opposing mechanisms. Physical trauma types and emotional abuse showed negative indirect effects through heightened autonomic reactivity, with complete mediation for emotional abuse and physical neglect. In contrast, emotional neglect showed a positive indirect effect through reduced autonomic reactivity (a pattern that emerged when controlling for other trauma types) alongside the strongest direct effect on imagery. These findings demonstrate that childhood trauma impacts mental imagery through distinct autonomic mechanisms--hyperreactive dysregulation for physical/emotional abuse versus hyporeactive blunting for emotional neglect--suggesting autonomic-targeted interventions should be tailored to trauma type.

">Mesenchymal stem cell-extracellular vesicles deliver microRNAs that prevent nerve growth factor-induced sensory neuron sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 600 million individuals globally, pain being a hallmark symptom. Emerging clinical evidence supports the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) for pain relief in knee OA. In mice, MSC-EVs ameliorate OA-induced pain and normalize knee-innervating neuron excitability. Moreover, it has been shown that overnight incubation of sensory neurons with MSC-EVs prevents the OA-associated mediator nerve growth factor (NGF) sensitizing sensory neurons. Here, we found that protease-mediated MSC-EV 'shaving' inhibited MSC-EV internalization into sensory neurons and the ability of MSC-EVs to prevent NGF-induced sensitization. In addition, acute, 10-minute, exposure of sensory neurons to MSC-EVs was also insufficient to counteract NGF. We hypothesized that MSC-EVs trigger transcriptional changes and found that inhibiting transcription prevented NGF-induced sensitization. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be delivered to cells by MSC-EVs, and certain miRNAs regulate transcription and pain; small RNA-sequencing of our MSC-EVs identified three candidate miRNAs, miR-21-5p, miR-148a-3p and miR-451a. Using gold nanoparticle delivery, each miRNA was able to prevent NGF sensitization of sensory neurons, a combination of all three showing the most pronounced effect. These findings demonstrate that MSC-EVs prevent NGF-induced sensory neuron sensitization via cellular uptake and transcriptional regulation that is mediated by miRNAs.

">Dynamical Interrogation of Serpentine Medulla Circuits in the Drosophila Optic Lobe</a></h4>

              
                Dense connectomes invite a tempting leap: if we can "wire up" a circuit, perhaps its dynamics (and even its function) will emerge. In practice, connectomic constraints leave large biophysical degrees of freedom (synapse signs/strengths, neuromodulation, gap junctions), so qualitative dynamical claims can be fragile. We present a simple forensic workflow for testing connectome-to-dynamics hypotheses that is deliberately hostile to wishful thinking: each stage is gated by sanity checks, run across multiple random seeds, and reported with effect sizes and negative controls. As a case study, we instantiate the Serpentine Medulla (Sm) interneuron family from FlyWire as a current-based adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) network and test a sharp narrative: whether strong recurrence supports a working-memory-style bistable attractor. Under strict attractor criteria (noise removed after the kick), we find no robust evidence for bistability (paired Wilcoxon p = 0.099, within-subject dz = -0.25). For oscillations, a corrected reproduction across 20 random seeds shows that recurrent coupling strongly amplifies integrated 30-80 Hz power when comparing the fully coupled condition (Full W) to an uncoupled control (W = 0) (paired Wilcoxon p = 1.9 x 10-6; dz = 5.96). We also observe a fast negative-coupling signature in input decomposition (mean peak correlation r {approx} -0.40 at ~ 4 ms lag), while stressing that these signatures are conditional on the chosen model class and operating point. Overall, the main contribution is methodological: an auditable template for falsifying attractive connectome-based stories rather than polishing them.

">Passage of time at the level of milliseconds: a new approach and a selective difficulty in individuals with schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with schizophrenia report that to them time sometimes feels discontinuous. Previous work has shown a link between the sense of self, and the ability to prepare to react to a target and to benefit from the passage of time, at the level of a few hundreds of milliseconds. However, the sense of time continuity requires a higher time resolution than examined in previous studies. Here we investigate to which extent individuals with schizophrenia and controls benefit from an increased delay when detecting asynchronies in the order of tens of milliseconds (stimulus onset asynchronies, i.e. SOA) between two successive visual stimuli. We re-analyzed three datasets and contrasted performance when the SOA increases, remains identical or decreases from trial t-1 to trial t. Performance of all participants improved with an increase in the SOA, as the task became easier, but for controls more so than individuals with schizophrenia. These results are replicated across datasets, and were specific to the condition when SOA increased from one trial to the next. There was no significant group difference when the SOA decreased or remained identical. This was true even when the latter condition was more frequent, and when SOA magnitude was equalized across the conditions. Importantly, the difference between the two groups was specific to temporal judgements, and was not observed in a control masking task. We suggest the results reveal a difficulty for individuals with schizophrenia to experience time at the level of milliseconds.

">Age-Related Upregulation and Strong Expression Correlation of the Proinflammatory Cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 Across Multiple Segments of the Mouse Eye</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that ocular inflammation increases with age and is associated with various disease states. That said, the majority of studies suffer from a significant limitation; they only focus on a single segment of the eye. This represents a limitation because age-related increases in neuroinflammatory markers are not necessarily uniform within an organ, and other age-related changes in the eye are known to occur in a segment-specific manner. The present study aims to address this gap by comparting/contrasting age-related changes in the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta; across multiple mouse ocular segments: the (i) anterior segment (i.e., cornea, ciliary body and muscle, and zonules), (ii) retina, and (iii) posterior segment (i.e., sclera, choroid, Bruchs membrane, retinal pigmented epithelium, and parts of the optic nerve). IL-6 and IL-1beta; were selected as targets since they exhibit differential regional patterns of age-related increases within the brain. Eyes were collected on postnatal days (P) P28, P56, P98, P200 and P500 and processed by Western blot. Both IL-6 and IL-1beta; protein levels increased across the lifespan in all three eye segments. Interestingly, correlational analyses revealed that IL-1beta; and IL-6 expression correlated with each other not only within individual eye segments, but also across segments. In old mice, IL-1beta; and IL-6 levels also correlated with expression of phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A), an enzyme known to regulate neuroinflammation. Together, these findings suggest that inflammaging in the eye is broadly controlled by a systemic governor, unlike the brain that shows region-specific changes in cytokines with age.

">Neuronal age drives β-sheet accumulation and, together with ApoE4, enhances synaptic Aβ localization in APPNL-F neurons</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation and aggregation are defining features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the earliest cellular events driving these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate A{beta} dynamics in primary neurons derived from APPNL-F knock-in mice, which express human APP and A{beta} at endogenous (non-overexpressed) levels. Using correlative optical photothermal infrared (OPTIR) spectromicroscopy and immunofluorescence, we show that physiological APPNL-F expression is sufficient to drive intraneuronal A{beta} accumulation at synapses. Modelling neuronal aging through prolonged culture reveals a marked increase in synaptic A{beta} burden accompanied by {beta}-sheet-rich structural transitions Supplementation with astrocyte-derived apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms demonstrates that ApoE4 markedly increases synaptic A{beta} accumulation while reducing {beta}-sheet content relative to untreated cultures, suggesting a potential shift toward less fibrillar species. Together, these findings establish APPNL-F neurons as a physiologically relevant system for dissecting early A{beta} pathology and show that both {beta} quantity (accumulation) and quality (structural maturation) are regulated by aging and ApoE genotype. This work provides mechanistic insight into the earliest molecular events that may underlie synaptic vulnerability in AD.

">Predictability of Sleep Slow Oscillation Emergence and Spatial Extent from Pre-Onset Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Slow oscillations (SOs; ~0.5-1.5 Hz) are a hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are known to support memory consolidation and large-scale cortical communication. Although their instantaneous dynamics are well characterized, the neural processes that precede SO initiation, and whether they predict the spatial extent of the upcoming event, remain largely unknown, despite their potential utility for anticipatory closed-loop intervention. Using high-density EEG from 29 healthy adults, we examined neural activity in the 2 s interval preceding the SO trough. Analyses focused on distinct SO subtypes defined by their spatiotemporal properties: Global, Frontal, and Local. We specifically focused on Global and Frontal events, both of which originate frontally but differ in their propagation. We quantified instantaneous spectral power, time-frequency dynamics, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), and amplitude-amplitude coupling. Across all analyses, theta-band power (4-8 Hz) emerged as the earliest and most robust predictor of SO initiation, remaining informative after restricting analyses to temporally isolated SOs to reduce potential residual aftereffect confounds from preceding SOs. Theta power exhibited a sustained rise beginning nearly two seconds before the SO trough (~1.6 s before onset). Theta power increases were absent in surrogate epochs and reliably differentiated Global from Frontal SOs with moderate-to-strong effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.45-0.77), demonstrating the robustness of theta power as a physiological signature. Mechanistically, Global SOs were preceded by enhanced delta-theta PAC and broad low-frequency synchronization, whereas Frontal SOs were preceded by elevated theta/alpha-to-beta/low-gamma coupling, reflecting a state of locally enhanced coupling at frequencies higher than the SO range, which appears to restrict propagation. A simple logistic regression classifier using only pre-onset theta power achieved >95% accuracy in distinguishing SOs from surrogate events and differentiated Global from Frontal SOs with ~83% multiclass accuracy, showing further sensitivity improvements when delta power was included. These findings demonstrate that isolated SOs are preceded by structured network dynamics that are tied to their spatial extent. Thus, theta activity can be used to predict SO occurrence and might be leveraged in closed-loop neuromodulation.

">Hypothalamic CYP46A1 cholesterol metabolism regulates diet-induced obesity</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is a growing global health challenge that affects over 38% of the population and increases the risk of developing metabolic disorders. Effective long-term treatment options remain limited and often lead to significant side effects. The hypothalamus plays a central role in metabolic regulation by integrating peripheral and central signals to maintain energy homeostasis. While the hypothalamus regulates peripheral lipid metabolism, the role of lipid metabolic pathways within the hypothalamus itself remains unclear. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms linking hypothalamic activity to the development of obesity remain poorly understood. Given that cholesterol is the most abundant brain lipid, we investigated molecular players involved in its local regulation. Here , we identify the rate-limiting enzyme for brain cholesterol degradation, Cyp46a1, as a critical regulator of diet-induced obesity. We show that Cyp46a1 expression is significantly reduced in the hypothalamus of C57BL/6J mice exposed to a high-fat diet, suggesting a role in metabolic dysregulation. We used recombinant Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAV) to modulate Cyp46a1 expression in the arcuate nucleus, a key hypothalamic region regulating energy balance. We evaluated longitudinal changes in body weight, adipocyte size, PPAR-{gamma} expression, and hepatic lipid accumulation and pancreatic histopathology in mice undergoing chow or high fat diets. These experiments demonstrated that hypothalamic Cyp46a1 regulates body weight, adipocyte size, and hepatic and pancreatic histopathology. Conversely, CYP46A1 overexpression protects against high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, likely via crosstalk with hepatic and pancreatic function. Moreover, we found that hypothalamic CYP46A1 expression selectively modulates gut microbiota composition, linking this enzyme to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Finally, we found that Cyp46a1 levels influence cognitive and motor performance, suggesting broader physiological relevance . Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of hypothalamic Cyp46a1 and cholesterol pathway control in obesity pathophysiology and metabolic homeostasis. These findings identify hypothalamic Cyp46a1 as a promising therapeutic target for obesity and its related comorbidities.

">Spatial transcriptomics reveals organizational properties of mouse spinal cord and alterations in neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                The spinal cord integrates diverse somatosensory inputs and executes motor outputs through anatomically and functionally distinct circuits. Here, we employed spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the adult mouse spinal cord to gain insights into the organizational logic of the spinal cord. Our results reveal distinct spatial and laminar distributions of neuronal subtypes, including axial level and sex-specific differences. Many neuronal subtypes exhibit close spatial proximity, implicating regionally specific patterns of connectivity and circuit functions. Additionally, neuronal subtypes within the dorsal horn exhibit a wide range of predicted cell-cell communication motifs, as assessed by the spatial distribution of neuropeptide- and other ligand-receptor pairs. Finally, we identified several neuronal subtypes with altered transcriptomic and predicted cell-cell communications in a model of neuropathic pain. This spatially resolved cellular and molecular map of the spinal cord will facilitate the decoding of circuit mechanisms underlying somatosensory and motor functions in health and disease.

">Cross-individual translation of spontaneous zebrafish brain activity through a shared latent representation</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous activity is a hallmark of brain function, reflecting the underlying circuit organization. Identifying conserved structure across individuals in this self-sustained activity has remained a longstanding challenge, especially in vertebrates where one-to-one neuron correspondence is inaccessible. Here, we introduce latent-aligned Restricted Boltzmann Machines (LaRBMs), an unsupervised generative approach that uncovers a common representational space from cell-resolved whole-brain recordings in larval zebrafish. This latent space consists of spatially localized co-activation motifs, or cell assemblies, that generalize across animals and form interpretable building blocks of population-wide activity. LaRBMs enable bidirectional mapping of brain states between individuals: activity patterns from one fish can be encoded into the latent space and decoded into another. The translated patterns are assigned high probability by the recipient model and retain the original spatial organization. These results show that spontaneous activity in the vertebrate brain is highly stereotyped at the level of functional cell assemblies and can be reliably captured through a common latent code. Because it provides an interpretable and quantitative framework for functional cross-individual alignment, LaRBM paves the way for comparative phenotyping of brain activity across developmental, genetic, and pathological variation.

">Slow breathing impacts inter-organ dynamics modulating brain function and risk behavior</a></h4>

              
                Successful decision-making requires that external information be interpreted in the context of the state of the body. Within the framework of body-brain interaction, deliberately modifying autonomic state can shape how we evaluate the world, ultimately influencing choices. Yet, it remains unclear whether and how intentional autonomic regulation affects human decision-making. In this study, we tested instructed prolonged exhalation, a slow-breathing technique designed to boost parasympathetic activity during risky decision-making. Participants followed distinct breathing protocols while making risky choices, with neural and physiological activity measured using fMRI and multi-channel monitoring. Prolonged exhalation increased risky choices by enhancing reward sensitivity and elevating cardiac parasympathetic activity. Importantly, individuals with greater parasympathetic upregulation also showed stronger reward-related responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Our work reveals a transformative role for breathing-based interventions, demonstrating that breathing-based autonomic regulation can shape value-based decision-making through neuro-cardiac pathways.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, with the timing of exposure critically shaping its neural and behavioral consequences. Here, we investigated how stress during adolescence or adulthood affects neuronal activity and oscillatory dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Animals were exposed to a combined footshock and restraint stress protocol during adolescence (postnatal days [PNDs] 31 to 40) or adulthood (PNDs 65 to 74). In vivo electrophysiological recordings of putative glutamate pyramidal neurons, Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) interneurons, and local field potentials were performed 1 to 2 and 5 to 6 wk post-stress to evaluate both short- and long-term effects. Adolescent stress induced increases in pyramidal neuron firing rates and sustained elevations in interneuron burst activity that persisted into adulthood, accompanied by long-lasting reductions in mPFC gamma oscillations. These alterations point to enduring disruptions in excitatory–inhibitory balance and impaired network coordination. In contrast, adult stress produced no persistent changes in pyramidal neuron activity but caused transient increases in interneuron excitability and selective reductions in theta oscillatory power, suggesting temporary inhibitory dysfunction. These findings highlight adolescence as a critical window during which stress triggers enduring, cell-type-specific changes in cortical circuitry, whereas changes induced by adult stress are transient, potentially reflecting recovery mechanisms. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of developmental timing in determining stress outcomes, providing mechanistic insight into how adolescent stress may contribute to long-lasting cortical dysfunction and psychiatric disease risk, and informing the timing of potential preventive or therapeutic interventions.</span>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal Area CA2, with some exceptions, had long been neglected in in vivo studies, due largely to its small size, and in in vitro studies because of its general similarity to CA3 and CA1. Increasing evidence showing that CA2 was molecularly distinct led to the increased appreciation of CA2 as a separate region, and as such, that it likely had functions that were dissimilar from its neighboring CA subfields that were worth studying. Indeed, it was the molecules that are enriched in CA2 that provided inspiration for many of the functional studies. In this article, I provide a personal account of how I got interested in CA2 and describe how I viewed our discoveries in the context of the others in the field. As it happened, much of my earlier work on synaptic plasticity in hippocampus and visual cortex had everything to do with why I felt compelled to ask the question, “are CA2 synapses resistant to long-term potentiation?.” In fact, we are a product of our training and our environment when we are considering research directions.</p>

     alt="The Mechanosensory Subgenual Organ Complex in the Stick Insect Bacillus rossius (Phasmatodea): Neuroanatomy and Functional Morphology"/>
<p>The subgenual organ complex in orthopteroid insects consists of few mechanosensory organs. In the stick insect <i>Bacillus rossius</i>, the subgenual organ and distal organ include ∼70 sensilla, and both organs are located in the hemolymph channel with several connections to the leg cuticle. The neuroanatomy and functional morphology of the sensory organs resemble that of other stick insects and support a shared vibrosensory function. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The subgenual organ complex is an elaborate mechanosensory complex in the insect leg containing chordotonal organs. In stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea), it includes the subgenual organ and the distal organ. This study documents the neuroanatomy and functional morphology of the subgenual organ complex in the stick insect <i>Bacillus rossius</i> (Bacillidae: Bacillinae) by axonal tracing and micro-computed tomography. It also considers the first report on the subgenual organ complex in stick insects that reported a relatively simple organization of the sensory organ and its nerves on the basis of histological sections. Our findings show the neuroanatomy and nerve pattern of the subgenual organ complex in <i>B. rossius</i> with a subgenual organ and a distal organ. The subgenual organ is placed in the hemolymph channel. The distal organ is also located in the hemolymph channel, and it has several attachment elements, linking it to the cuticle of the tibia, the tibial tracheae, and the subgenual organ. The connections to the tibia may form an input pathway for vibrations transmitted over the cuticle, whereas the position in the hemolymph channel and the connection to the subgenual organ indicate a mechanical activation by vibrations transmitted via the hemolymph. Overall, the axonal tracing preparations document neuroanatomical details for <i>B. rossius</i> and resolve the numbers of sensilla in the sensory organs, the length of the distal organ, and confirm a single nerve branch for the subgenual organ. The data provide support for a consistent organization of the subgenual organ complex within stick insects.</p>

     alt="Changes in Action Potential Properties in the Ferret Prefrontal Cortex During Adolescence"/>
<p>Ferrets have been used as a model and contributed to our scientific knowledge in multiple fields of neuroscience such as visual development, sensory processing, executive function and TBI. Here we describe the electrophysiological changes in neuronal intrinsic properties in the prefrontal cortex of the ferret during the adolescence. We described electrophysiological changes, particularly in spike frequency adaptation, in a span of 3 months.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Ferrets have a gyrencephalic brain with an organization that resembles more to humans than rodents. This animal model has been used in studies of visual cortex development and plasticity, sensory processing, multisensory integration, traumatic brain injury, and decision making. Surprisingly, there is no convention of what defines adulthood in the ferret. Studies have considered ferret adulthood as early as P90 and as late as 2 years. Adolescence is a period of development characterized by physical maturation, risk-taking behavior, and impulsivity. Although physical maturation, including puberty, co-occurs with adolescence, they do not indicate when adulthood is reached. For instance, although puberty in humans is completed by 16–17 years of age, the human brain continues to mature until approximately 23–25 years of age with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) maturing latest. Therefore, the functional maturation of the PFC is proposed to act as a marker of the conversion between adolescence and adulthood. We conducted whole-cell patch clamp of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in Layer 5 from acute slices from the prelimbic cortex portion of ferret medial PFC at three different ages after puberty (P120, P180, and P220). Injected current-firing curves indicate that the amount of current needed to elicit the same number of action potentials (APs) increases between P120 and P220. In addition, we observed an increase in sag amplitude that was accompanied by a reduction in rheobase. Our findings show that excitability of PNs in this region changes between the ages investigated, which suggests that ferret PFC does not mature before P220.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Naturally occurring autoantibodies are commonly considered to be causative of autoimmune diseases or epiphenomena with no known biological impact. Although clinically beneficial autoantibodies have been described, there have been no naturally occurring anti-neuronal antibodies that have been found to be neuroprotective. Here, we identify a recombinant human antibody (TGM-010) derived from a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) that binds human and mouse neurons, leading to beneficial effects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>TGM-010 was examined for its ability to be internalized by human and mouse neurons and protect neurons from death in vitro following a stress event. TGM-010 was also injected systemically into a relapsing–remitting model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to examine its ability to impact disease score, extent of demyelination, and neuron frequency.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TGM-010 demonstrates many novel characteristics including crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and internalizing into neurons. TGM-010 also protects primary mouse neurons from death in vitro. In a mouse model of MS, TGM-010 ameliorates disease severity and is associated with improved neuronal survival.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identified a patient-derived neuron-binding autoantibody that crosses the BBB in mice and reduces neuron loss in a mouse model of MS. These data suggest that the human derived anti-neuronal antibody, TGM-010, may potentially be used to ameliorate neurodegeneration that underlies disability in neurodegenerative conditions.

[version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background One billion people worldwide have preventable vision impairment. Ocular morbidities are a significant problem in the public health sector, especially among medical students. The study objectives were to identify the prevailing ocular morbidities and evaluate the risk factors and their impact on students’ lifestyles and academics. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among (Study sample 312) undergraduate medical students over 6 months. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analysed to identify the prevalence, associated risk factors, and consequences of ocular morbidities. Results 64.7% were suffering from ocular morbidities. Headache was a predominant symptom in students with (51.7%) and without (39.1%) ocular morbidities. The most common ocular morbidity was myopia (84.3%). 18.7% of students perceived that ocular morbidity had restricted them from participating in activities or applying for specific job posts. The evaluation of various risk factors inferred that ocular morbidity was associated with family history, early age onset of the condition, lighting, inappropriate posture while reading, screen time, and a vitamin A-rich diet. Conclusion The study concluded that the most prevalent ocular morbidity was refractive error, with myopia being the highest among medical students, and it has adversely impacted the students’ lifestyle and academics, underscoring the need for early detection, preventive strategies, and health education interventions.

                Background This article explored the chemical constituents of water and ethanol extracts from the whole body of A. m. jemenitica honeybee drones and workers, investigating their effects on glucose tolerance test (GTT) curves through feeding experiments conducted on Oryctolagus cuniculus male rabbits. Methods Chemical analysis of the extracts was performed using infrared (IR) spectroscopy alongside the spectral database of organic compounds. Results The water extract revealed a richer diversity of natural products (38 compounds) compared to the ethanol extract (12 compounds). Notably, the water extract comprised various bioactive molecules, including sugars and their derivatives, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, quinones, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, and organometallic compounds. In contrast, the ethanol extract primarily contained sugar derivatives, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and pesticides. The water extract decreased the blood glucose level and transformed the GTT curve from a convex to a concave shape. Conclusion The blood glucose-lowering effect of the water extract may be attributed to the anti-diabetic properties of its dipeptides, phenolic compounds and alkaloid contents.

                The development of smart cities through the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) has accelerated the growth of Southeast Asia’s capital and important cities. However, a growing concern has been how much the intentions of Southeast Asian cities to achieve ‘smart city status’ consider the basic elements of human rights and the provision of essential public services. The first policy recommendation is to acknowledge the vulnerability of the underprivileged, personal security, and social inclusion in governing smart cities to counter the possible derailment of democratic progress in the region. The second recommendation is to have fellow ASEAN member states assist in providing essential public services to avoid a ‘development’ model imposed by external funding stakeholders. The policy brief uses secondary data from 2018 to 2024 on the ASEAN Smart Cities Network projects and identifies civic and social concerns that arose during this period.

                Background Deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB) constitute an emerging category of bioherbicides with the capacity to inhibit weed germination through phytotoxic metabolites. Aim This study aimed to isolate and screen rhizobacteria for deleterious potentials. Bacterial isolation was carried out using the standard pour plating method. Methods Five agricultural crops (cucumber, soybean, sorghum, cowpea and maize) were assayed for phytotoxic screening against the DRB. In addition, antimicrobial potential of the DRB against test pathogens and indole acetic acid (IAA) were also investigated. Polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing of the isolates revealed three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one each of P. fluorescens and E. hormaechei. Results The antimicrobial outcomes of the test DRB revealed broad-spectrum inhibition against the test pathogens. In terms of culture age, younger cultures (≤48 h) mostly stimulated or matched control germination and vigor indices with toxicity increasing progressively with age beyond 120 h for most of the seeds. In the case of steeping duration, short steeping durations (1–2 h) typically maintained germination and vigor near control levels. Progressive extension of steeping time increased inhibition across all isolates. At different inoculum concentrations, higher inoculum concentrations produced stronger inhibitory effects than diluted suspensions. Full-strength inoculum (100%) suppressed vigor drastically, whereas 20–40% dilutions produced diminished or reversible effects. Also, all isolates produced measurable IAA in tryptophan-supplemented media with output increasing with incubation age, correlating with suppression of vigor at later time points. Conclusion The indigenous origin of the DRB evaluated in this study enhances environmental compatibility and reduces ecological disturbance risks.

                Background Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid-Schiff (AB/PAS), and Giemsa stains are routinely used in the histopathological evaluation of gastric biopsies. However, comparative data on their diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness in detecting Helicobacter pylori are limited. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using H&E and AB/PAS as alternatives to Giemsa. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 816 gastric biopsy cases collected between 2019 and 2021. Three slides (H&E, Giemsa, and AB/PAS) were previously prepared from each paraffin-embedded tissue sample and blindly evaluated by three independent examiners. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall diagnostic accuracy were calculated using 2×2 contingency tables. Results >H&E yielded a sensitivity of 51.6%, specificity of 74.4%, and diagnostic accuracy of 66.4% when compared to Giemsa as the reference standard. In comparison, AB/PAS exhibited a sensitivity of 45.9%, specificity of 73.2%, and an accuracy of 63.7%. When evaluating operational factors, H&E emerged as the most cost-effective and fastest method, while AB/PAS was associated with higher costs and longer processing times. Overall, Giemsa consistently demonstrated superior diagnostic performance across the assessed metrics, positioning it as the more reliable choice for H. pylori detection within this comparative framework. Conclusions H&E shows potential for initial screening but its limited sensitivity prevents definitive diagnosis. AB/PAS proved less effective and economical. Giemsa maintained superior diagnostic performance. This study provides a comparative methodological assessment, suggesting H&E and Giemsa combinations could enhance detection efficiency and accuracy. Further prospective validation is needed before clinical implementation.

                Background Areke is a popular traditional distilled beverage in semi-urban and rural areas in Ethiopia. Traditional areke distillation uses an open-fire system that consumes a lot of firewood and produces a large amount of indoor air pollution. Methods The areke distiller apparatus (heat exchanger, condenser, energy-efficient stoves, storage tanks, and local areke extraction apparatus) was manufactured by technicians (welders). Different types of grains (wheat, millet, lupine, barley, and maize) were purchased from a neighborhood market. The traditional method of areke fermentation was prepared by an experienced woman brewer using a combination of ingredients and appropriate steps and procedures. The efficacy of a traditional stove, modified stove, and a combination of modified stove and double-pipe were evaluated. The amount of ethanol was estimated by measuring its refractive index and specific gravity. The sensory evaluation of areke samples was conducted by 10 consumer sensory panelists. Result The highest ethanol concentration in areke (53.75 ± 0.01 (% v/v)) was obtained from millet E (dagusa E) in double-pipe distillation (E). The maize E (bekolo E) of overall acceptance had the greatest score (4.5 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. The alcoholic strength of lupine E ( gibeto E) was scored as excellent (5.0 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. All judges agreed that traditional and double-pipe areke consumption was acceptable. The combination of double-pipe distillation and modified stove resulted in a 50% ± 0.15 reduction in the average amount of firewood used. The traditional open fire stove consumed more firewood (5.1 kg ± 0.1) than the combination of double-pipe distillation and modified stove (2.5 kg ± 0.01). Conclusion These results indicate that the combination of double-pipe distillation with a modified stove had better performance than traditional areke distillation.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/13/1/ENEURO.0112-25.2025?rss=1">Different But Complementary Motor Functions Reveal an Asymmetric Recalibration of Upper Limb Bimanual Coordination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bimanual coordination, fundamental to human motor control, typically involves the execution of different functions by the two limbs (e.g., opening a jar). Previous research has largely investigated bimanual control through simple coordination tasks in which the limbs perform similar movements (e.g., finger tapping); however, few studies have specifically examined coordination when the two limbs perform different yet complementary functions. In the current study, participants performed point-to-point movements of a rectangular cursor, where one limb controlled cursor trajectory and the other rotated a knob to match a target orientation. Participants (<I>N</I> = 116, 76 female, 1 nonbinary; 92% right-handed) were divided into four groups and completed the task with a visual feedback gain perturbation (an increase or decrease) applied either to the cursor trajectory or orientation. Our results showed rapid adaptation to perturbations of visual feedback of the movement trajectory, affecting both the perturbed limb controlling the trajectory and the unperturbed limb controlling the orientation. Conversely, perturbation to the visual orientation feedback primarily only influenced the perturbed limb controlling orientation, with minimal impact on movement trajectory metrics. Importantly, these results were independent of reaching amplitude, duration, and limb dominance. In addition, we assessed the temporal coordination between the two limbs and found that perturbations in visual trajectory feedback led to significant changes in limb coordination, whereas no notable difference was observed for perturbations of orientation. These findings indicate asymmetries in bimanual motor recalibration dependent on the perturbed aspect of visual feedback (orientation vs trajectory), suggesting differences in underlying neural mechanisms and interhemispheric communication.</p>

                <p>Alpha peak frequency (APF) is defined as a prominent spectral peak within the 8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz frequency range. Typically, an individual's alpha frequency is regarded as a stable neurophysiological marker. A wealth of recent evidence, however, indicates that APF shifts within short timescales in relation to task demands and even spontaneously so. Further, brain stimulation studies often report shifts in APF both within and between experimental sessions, directly contradicting the idea of a stable APF. To characterize the nonstationarities in spectral parameters, we estimated APFs from 1&nbsp;s epochs of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from healthy adults of either sex. To enhance signal-to-noise ratio, without compromising on temporal resolution, we averaged power spectra within parcelled regions. Our findings indicate that variation in APFs exacerbates along the posterior-to-anterior cortical plane, i.e., from the occipital to the frontal cortices. Further, by comparisons with amplitude-matched simulated signals, we demonstrated that the observed gradient is not attributable to measurement noise. Across the cortex, APFs showed poor temporal reliability, raising the question of whether APFs are more like a transient state than a trait. In general, our study elucidates the dynamic characteristics of alpha oscillations and reveals systematic regional differences which are, in part, shaped by underlying signal-to-noise ratio inherent to MEG recordings.</p>

     alt="The Subcellular Localization of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator in the Chicken Retina Suggests Multiple Roles in Retinal Function"/>
<p>The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has widespread expression in the avian retina. Immuno-electron microscopy reveals its localization to synapses in the inner plexiform layer. In vitro pharmacological inhibition of CFTR increases spontaneous quantal event frequency. Thus, CFTR activity is linked to synaptic transmission in retinal neurons.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Protein function is influenced by multiple factors including cell type and subcellular localization. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is well investigated in epithelial tissues, where life threatening symptoms stem from its dysfunction. A postsynaptic neuronal role was previously established by the Gleason lab where CFTR regulation of cytosolic Cl<sup>–</sup> in retinal amacrine cells was shown. Other work from our lab showed that disruption of the synaptic vesicle cycle reduced action of CFTR, suggesting CFTR associates with synaptic vesicles. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that CFTR localizes to the synapse with possible presynaptic function. To address this, the cellular and subcellular CFTR localization in mature chicken retina was examined using fluorescence light microscopy and immunogold-labeled transmission electron microscopy. CFTR labeling was detected throughout the retina, including photoreceptor outer segments and in the mitochondria rich region of the photoreceptor inner segment termed the ellipsoid. Synaptic labeling was found in both synaptic plexiform layers, pre-and post-synaptically. A subset of amacrine cells were strongly labeled and labeling was also found in Müller cells and in axons of the nerve fiber layer. Addressing whether the activity of CFTR plays a role in presynaptic function, amacrine cells were recorded using the whole cell voltage clamp method. Spontaneous postsynaptic quantal currents were recorded and found to increase in frequency upon pharmacological inhibition of CFTR suggesting that under normal circumstances, CFTR serves to limit the rate of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion. This work provides evidence CFTR might have multiple functions in the retina including synaptic transmission regulation.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to compare clinical features and prognosis of late-onset neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (LO-NMOSD, onset age ≥60 years) with adult-onset NMOSD (AO-NMOSD, onset age 18–59 years), and to provide insights for individualized management in elderly patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 748 patients with NMOSD (diagnosed according to the 2015 International Panel for NMO Diagnosis criteria) in the China National Registry of Neuro-Inflammatory Diseases (CNRID) were analyzed. Patients were stratified into AO-NMOSD (18–59 years, n = 617) and LO-NMOSD (≥ 60 years, n = 131). Demographics, clinical manifestations, imaging, treatments, and outcomes were compared using appropriate statistical methods including Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LO-NMOSD showed distinct traits: a lower female predominance (76.34% vs 86.55%), higher transverse myelitis (TM) incidence at onset (57.36% vs 40.17%), elevated annualized relapse rate (ARR; 0.52 ± 0.03 vs 0.38 ± 0.01), and accelerated disability (median Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 4.75 vs 3.0). TM-predominant relapses (39 of 45, 86.67% in LO vs 96 of 148, 64.86% in AO) contributed significantly to disability. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed LO-NMOSD had a higher risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.932, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.427–2.615), disability (HR = 3.192, 95% CI = 1.932–5.274) and reaching visual acuity (VA) ≤20 of 30 (HR = 3.523, 95% CI = 1.585–7.828). Cox regression confirmed that onset age ≥60 years was an independent risk factor for relapse (HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.60–2.59), disability (HR = 3.16, 95% CI = 2.14–4.62), and reaching VA ≤20 of 30 (HR 3.26, 95% CI = 1.83–5.48).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>LO-NMOSD is characterized by myelitis-predominance with recurrent spinal cord involvement, high risk of relapses, and severe disability. It thus underscores the need for heightened clinical attention, with rigorous monitoring that balance safety and efficacy for elderly patients with NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>De novo mutations in the syntaxin-binding protein 1 (STXBP1), encoded by <i>STXBP1</i>, are among the most prevalent causes of variable neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, and movement disorders. Although STXBP1 has been proposed as a critical presynaptic protein controlling synaptic vesicle exocytosis, clinical phenotypes also suggest that its biological function could be more diverse.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The expression pattern of STXBP1 was studied using immunostaining <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Synaptosome isolation was performed to investigate the synaptic and non-synaptic localization of STXBP1 in the brain. STXBP1 immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (MS) was conducted to identify protein complexes interacting with STXBP1. Cre-in utero electroporation (IUE) was done on <i>Stxbp1</i>
<sup>F/F</sup> mice to generate an <i>in vivo</i> knockout (KO) cellular model for studying the <i>in vivo</i> function of STXBP1.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that STXBP1 expression in the cerebral cortex was developmentally regulated and was detected in neuronal soma and processes. STXBP1 was in both the synaptic and cytosolic fractions, interacting with neuronal cytoskeleton and membrane periodic structures. Interestingly, sparse <i>Stxbp1</i> KO in the mouse forebrain led to cell-autonomous cell death, which was rescued by either wild-type STXBP1 or pathogenic mutants. However, <i>Stxbp1</i> KO neurons rescued by pathogenic mutants exhibited impaired dendritic growth. Our results also showed that STXBP1 interacted with alpha II Spectrin and ARPC2 and is required for their localization on the neuronal membrane.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest that STXBP1 has diverse functions in the nervous system and regulates the trafficking of membrane cytoskeleton proteins in the brain. ANN NEUROL 2025 ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence linking modifiable risk factors to age-related brain diseases, such as dementia, stroke, and depression (DSD), is robust, yet limited regarding long-term change in modifiable risk factors in association with these conditions, particularly in real-world settings. This study aimed to assess whether longitudinal changes in modifiable brain health risk factors were associated with reduced risk of DSD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed UK Biobank data (2006–2019) from 155,469 participants with general practitioner-linked data. The Brain Care Score (BCS) assesses 12 modifiable risk factors across lifestyle, physical, and social–emotional domains. Longitudinal BCS measurements were derived from repeated general practitioner (GP)-recorded measurements. Changes in the BCS were modeled using linear mixed-effects models, and associations with DSD were evaluated using multivariable Cox models, adjusting for baseline BCS and genetic risk (polygenic risk scores for stroke and depression, and <i>APOE</i> genotype for dementia).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 155,469 participants (median age = 51 years, 54.3% women), the median annual BCS change was 0.14 (Q1–Q3 = 0.008–0.30) points over a median follow-up of 12.3 years (Q1–Q3 = 11.5–13.1 years). Over time, 82.1% improved their BCS, 12.9% remained stable, and 5.0% worsened over time. Each 1-point annual increase in the BCS was associated with 4% lower risk of incident age-related brain diseases (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–0.97).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this large real-world cohort, improvements in modifiable risk factor profiles were associated with lower incidence of DSD, regardless of genetic risk or baseline BCS. Our results provide important information for communicating with patients about the brain health benefits of improving risk factor profiles. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Background Academic integrity is presented as a complex, multidimensional concept that involves all members of an educational institution. However, non-teaching staff members are often excluded from research on academic integrity. I engaged in professional support alongside academic staff to explore how academic integrity is understood within the Mauritius branch of a UK higher education institution. Methods I adopted a qualitative approach to engage those tasked with implementing academic integrity to examine how they understood and practised it. Data were gathered through face-to-face focus-group interviews, which were translated into themes. Results This article identified the factors that make academic integrity challenging and presents recommendations for practitioners and researchers. Conclusions More energy should be invested in the processes that build cultures of integrity rather than focusing on the opposite, such as cheating, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic integrity is ultimately a positive values-driven approach to learning and a skill that can be developed and strengthened.

                Background The study of algebraic structures through graph-theoretic representations provides a powerful visual and combinatorial framework for analyzing ring-theoretic properties. The ideal-based non-zero divisor graph ∅ I ( Z n ) , constructed from the ring of integers modulo n with respect to a proper ideal I . This graph extends the classical zero-divisor graph framework and serves as a visual and structural invariant for analyzing ideal interactions in finite commutative rings. Methods Using combinatorial graph theory and modular arithmetic, we analyze fundamental properties of ∅ I ( Z n ) . Vertex degrees, connectivity, and cut-sets are characterized using divisibility conditions and the Euler totient function ϕ ( n ) . The analysis distinguishes cases based on the parity and primality of n , as well as the generator of I . Topological indices, including the Zagreb and Randić indices, are formulated to quantify structural complexity. Results We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the connectivity of ∅ I ( Z n ) , proving it is connected for all n ≥ 10 and any non-zero proper ideal I . For prime n ∉ { 2 , 3 } , the graph is shown to be complete. General formulas are provided for calculating vertex degrees based on gcd ( x , d ) where I = < d > . Furthermore, the structure and computation cut-sets are characterized for Z p 2 and composite n = xy . Moreover, the domination number γ ( ∅ I ( Z n ) )=1 and girth gr ( ∅ I ( Z n ) )=3 is established for n ≥ 10 . General expressions for Zagreb and Randić indices are derived, directly linking graph invariants to n and d . Conclusions The graph ∅ I ( Z n ) serves as an effective combinatorial invariant for studying the interplay between ideals and zero-divisor structure in Z n . These results establish systematic connections between ring-theoretic properties and graph parameters, enabling both qualitative and quantitative analysis through connectivity, degree distributions, cut-sets, and topological indices.

                Recognizing and appreciating the diversity of people around the world is a necessary step in achieving equality for all. The opening of equitable chances for society as a whole is one of the ways in which libraries contribute to the reduction of the exclusion gap. Despite their expanding relevance, institutions like libraries demonstrate inconsistent patterns of integration and research. This literature analysis aimed to examine the methods employed by public libraries to foster social inclusion across various populations from 2014 to 2024. A comprehensive literature review was performed, identifying n = 69 interventions that fulfilled the inclusion criteria according to PRISMA methodological principles. The findings indicate a necessity for collaboration between libraries and other organizations to enhance their effectiveness in promoting social inclusion. The findings underscore the necessity of adopting a comprehensive perspective on inclusion in libraries, which encompasses an examination of infrastructure and participation in physical spaces, as well as additional aspects and dimensions, integrating both physical and digital inclusion.

                Background Female teachers working in conflict and displacement settings are both crisis survivors and crisis responders, nurturing learning, stability, and hope and experiencing trauma, economic insecurity and systemic neglect. Their lived experiences and coping systems remain under-documented and undervalued. This review is a synthesis of multi-regional findings to shed light on the interaction of gender, precarity, and resilience on the development of professional and psychosocial pathways of women teachers during and after conflict. Methods This narrative systematic review was done using PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Thirty-four primary studies and several secondary sources in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Eastern Europe were reviewed. Results Female teachers were subjected to the greatest instability and trauma, with post-traumatic stress (22-35%), burnout (40-70%), and acute psychological distress (over 70% under active crises) being the most prominent. The chronic attrition and “brain waste” were caused by structural deprivation in the form of salary arrears, invalidation of credential, and exclusion to continuous professional development (CPD). Relational and spiritual resilience were found to be strong buffers despite these limitations. Burnout was reduced by peer networks, faith-based coping and community support and agency was restored. Online and physical CPD programs in Kakuma, Lebanon and Ukraine assisted displaced women to maintain teaching identity and re-credential after displacement. Teacher Stability Index (TSI) showed that there was universal low interdependence resilience (0.50). Conclusion Women educators in conflict and displacement situations represent paradox: they perpetuate the educational process and survive the trauma and structural marginalization. It would take systematic reform to identify them as professionals in humanitarian work, rather than as a fringe volunteer. Some of the priority interventions are listed as the stabilization of salaries, transnational credential recognition, survivor-focused protection against GBV, and the scaling of culturally grounded and peer-based resilience networks.

                Background Tuberculosis with co-morbid diabetes mellitus presents a substantial public health challenge, necessitating immediate and coordinated interventions. Such interventions should be sustainable and have a high acceptance rate in real-world settings. Applying the principles of implementation science is essential to enhance the existing system. This research study aims to assess the influence of innovation characteristics on the implementation of an Optimised TB-diabetes integrated care package. Objectives The main objectives of this study are to explore the perceptions and experiences of intervention developers; to understand the experiences of health professionals and patients regarding the Opt TBD integrated care package; assess the content validity of the innovation characteristics instrument; and evaluate the influence of intervention characteristics on the implementation process of the Opt TBD integrated care package. Methods The study will be conducted at thirteen selected TB healthcare facilities across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab over a period of 18 months, in three phases. Evaluation will involve qualitative exploration of intervention development, followed by feasibility testing, and finally the definitive implementation of the intervention. The participants will include key stakeholders: intervention developers, TB health professionals, and patients. Conclusion This study will generate critical insights for the Opt TBD integrated care package, focusing on enhancing contextual relevance and improving adoption rates in practical, real-world settings. Specifically, this research study seeks to identify key implementation challenges, evaluate the fidelity of the intervention, and validate the causal relationships between the characteristics of the innovation and its implementation success.

                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan-Meir survival analysis was applied to time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis, not survival outcomes. Results ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive potential prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients.

                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories/hostels, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Food habits at campus differ substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize a model and understand university students’ food choices, utilizing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students from technical and health science programs at a private university in Udupi, who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The model illustrated the duration of students’ campus residence, provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, recommendation to display nutritional information in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation offers valuable insights into the role of UDF in providing nutritionally balanced meals to students, which may contribute to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70067?af=R">Reelin in the Infant Hippocampus, and Relationship to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Dentate Gyrus Morphology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Morphological features within the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell layer (GCL) have been identified in some cases of sudden unexpected infant death (SUDI), including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein, is critical in neuronal migration and cell positioning. An altered reelin expression is hypothesized as a contributor to altered DG morphology. This study aimed to determine whether the number of reelin-expressing cells within the infant hippocampus is altered in (1) SIDS, and according to the presence of (2) SIDS risk factors (age, cigarette smoke exposure [CSE], sleep position, bed sharing, and upper respiratory tract infection [URTI]), and (3) DG morphology. Immunohistochemical staining of reelin was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) within the layers of the DG, CA4/Hilus, CA3-CA1, and subiculum in cases of explained SUDI (eSUDI, <i>n</i> = 12), SIDS I (<i>n</i> = 7), and SIDS II (<i>n</i> = 33). Reelin was highly correlated with age. After adjusting for age, SIDS II infants had a lower number of reelin immunopositive cells in the CA1, a finding that was more pronounced in bed sharers. Analysis of risk factors indicated lower reelin in the DG and CA3 of males, and in the DG of infants with URTI (when excluding bed sharers). The presence of the DG morphological feature of cluster ectopic cells was associated with a lower number of reelin cells across several hippocampal layers, whereas gaps were associated with higher numbers, with layers predominantly affected being the DG molecular layer and CA2 stratum radiatum.</p>

                Background The present study is an endeavor to explore the global focus on maternal malnutrition research across the globe. The study underscores the development of maternal malnutrition research across the globe and may give impetus to researchers, policy makers and entrepreneurs for further research in this domain. Methods The study is descriptive in nature and used a mixed method approach that includes bibliometrics and altmetrics techniques to explore maternal malnutrition research. The study initiated with systematic data extraction from SCOPUS Database with proper data extraction criteria. The bibliometrics techniques include quantitative and qualitative techniques. The initial part of the study explores the quantitative dimension, including authorship studies, growth rate of publications, country-wise productivity and citation impact across the studied period. The second part of the study is dedicated to trend analysis that reveals the focused areas in malnutrition research. The third part of this study delves into the social impact of the concerned set of literature by analyzing the social media attention score through Altmetrics. Results It is found that there is a relatively low rate of growth of publications, with publications published in 2016 being more impactful and a preference for multi-authored publications over single-authored publications. Regional distribution highlights disparities in the research focus. Thematic analysis identified key clusters, such as acute malnutrition and maternal-child health interdependencies, with emerging areas in public health nutrition and epigenetics. Altmetric analysis has shown an active but declining trend in discourse on academic and social media platforms. Conclusions Results underscore the need for holistic interventions addressing both nutritional and psychosocial factors during pregnancy to break the intergenerational cycle of poor health and promote better outcomes for mothers and their children.

                Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder frequently associated with male sexual and reproductive dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction (ED), reduced libido, and impaired spermatogenesis. Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) fruit extract has been reported to possess antidiabetic and reproductive benefits, yet its effect on DM-related ED remains underexplored. Objective To evaluate the effects of Piper nigrum fruit extract on erectile function, libido, sperm parameters, and testicular histology in alloxan-induced diabetic male rats. Methods Thirty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups: normal control, diabetic control, diabetic rats treated with black pepper extract (122.5 or 245 mg/kg BW), and diabetic rats treated with sildenafil citrate. Erectile function was assessed via penile reflexes, libido by mating behavior, sperm quality by concentration, motility, and morphology, and testicular histology by Leydig cell and spermatogonia counts. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with significance at p<0.05. Results Alloxan-induced diabetic rats showed significant impairment in erectile function, libido, sperm quality, and testicular histology (p<0.001 vs control). Black pepper extract at 122.5 mg/kg BW significantly improved total penile reflexes compared with diabetic controls (9.33±1.03 vs 6.00±1.26, p=0.02). Libido parameters including courtship latency (5.50±0.55 vs 21.00±9.47, p=0.013), mount latency (19.00±10.81 vs 37.17±6.31, p=0.009), and mount frequency (18.05±5.99 vs 7.17±1.83, p=0.002) were significantly improved. Sperm analysis revealed increases in sperm concentration (19.2±6.7 vs 12.6±1.3, though not significant, p=0.877), motility (31.8±23 vs 27±30, p=0.697), and normal morphology (40.9±7.8 vs 35±10.8, p=0.04). Testicular histology showed restoration of Leydig cell count (59.33±4.0 vs 30.50±3.86, p=0.035) and spermatogonia number (319.4±64.59 vs 491±37.0, p<0.001). The 245 mg/kg BW dose primarily improved sperm concentration (62.95±29.4 vs 12.6±1.3, p=0.01) and motility (36.6±23 vs 27±30, p=0.436). Sildenafil citrate significantly enhanced most parameters compared with diabetic controls (p<0.05). Conclusion Piper nigrum fruit extract ameliorates sexual dysfunction and reproductive impairment in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, particularly at 122.5 mg/kg BW, with significant improvements in erectile function, libido (p<0.05), sperm quality (p≤0.04), and testicular histology (p=0.035). These findings suggest its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for DM-related male reproductive dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-37/v1?src=rss">Assessing data management and compliance in large research collaborations via knowledge bases:  A semi-structured interview approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Large-scale research collaborations rely not only on robust research strategies but also on structured data management and systematic knowledge exchange. Ensuring compliance with ethical and legal requirements is essential from the beginning. This includes obtaining informed consent and adhering to data protection laws such as the GDPR (for Europe), as well as following Open Science and FAIR principles, particularly when working with personal data. Additionally, the systematic assessment and documentation of project objectives, data characteristics, and other project-specific features are essential for advancing the scientific contribution and long-term development of such collaborations. Methods In this paper, we introduce a methodology designed to identify commonalities across research projects and to enhance data governance within large research consortia. The approach consists of three components: (1) a semi-structured interview that served a dual purpose: first, to raise awareness among researchers regarding ethical obligations, data protection requirements, and open science principles; second, to systematically collect metadata on planned studies, data types, participant groups, and methodological procedures; (2) structured processing and organization of the collected information; and (3) visualization of project interrelations through knowledge graphs. The methodology was piloted within a collaborative research centre in linguistics. Results The collected metadata were systematically structured and used to construct knowledge graphs capturing interrelations among projects, data types, methodologies, and participant groups. These visualizations enable research consortia to make informed decisions about collaboration, infrastructure planning, and data reuse. Conclusions The proposed methodology offers a systematic way to assess data management practices, while also fostering a culture of compliance and transparency from the ground up. Knowledge graph visualizations provide a practical tool for identifying synergies, promoting data reuse, and strengthening transparency across projects. This approach can serve as a foundation for developing sustainable research infrastructures in consortia working with diverse empirical data.

                Background Breast metastasis from lung cancer is an extremely rare clinical event, particularly in men, and therefore remains poorly documented. Case presentation We report the case of a 45-year-old man with primary lung adenocarcinoma who subsequently developed a breast metastasis. He initially presented with spinal pain. Physical examination revealed cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary nodules with mediastinal, supraclavicular, and axillary lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the most accessible axillary lymph node confirmed adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin. Chemotherapy was initiated. Ten months later, the patient developed a painless ipsilateral breast mass. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the diagnosis of breast metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusion Distinguishing between primary and metastatic breast carcinoma is essential because their treatment and prognosis differ considerably. Accurate diagnosis is therefore crucial for optimal patient management.
