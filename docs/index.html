              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge and practice of community pharmacists towards SGLT2 inhibitors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs which improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by preventing the kidney from reabsorbing glucose back to blood. Community pharmacists have long-term relationships with most of their chronic patients, so they play a key role in care for people with diabetes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess pharmacists’ knowledge and practice towards SGLT2 inhibitors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to meet the study objectives. A convenience sample of 348 community pharmacists in Jordan was recruited. knowledge and practice were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire created for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 400 community pharmacists were reached, of whom 348 answered the survey (response rate 87%). The results indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors knowledge score among community pharmacists in Jordan was 6.61 (out of 12). Factors like age, gender, location of the pharmacy, years of pharmacists’ experience had no effect on knowledge score; however, pharmacists who attended training courses on diabetes had higher knowledge scores. Additionally, pharmacists’ dispensing practice toward SGLT2 inhibitors had insufficient knowledge, such as lack of knowledge about the superiority of SGLT2 inhibitors over other anti-diabetics and inability to give the best advice to patients. Conclusions: Our findings reflect a moderate knowledge among community pharmacists about SGLT2 inhibitors which may negatively affect the patients’ outcome; thus, continuous education for the pharmacists is essential.

                The crime of electromagnetic records under unauthorized instruction (Article 168-2 and 3 of the Penal Code) requires that the program or the instruction code in question is against the intention of the computer user (counterintentionality) and socially unacceptable (unauthorized), as the requirements of objectivity. The significance or factors to be considered in the requirements of “counterintentionality” and “unauthorized” have not been clarified in practice. This paper examines the requirements of “counterintentionality” and “unauthorized” intent in crimes related to electromagnetic records with the Coinhive case as material, by means of a literature survey and case study. In addition, the significance and scope of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Coinhive case will be clarified.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Risk factors for hippocampal cavities in a marginally housed population</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cavities in the hippocampus are morphological variants of uncertain significance. Aberrant neurodevelopment along with vascular and inflammatory etiologies have been proposed. We sought to characterize these cavities and their potential risk factors in a marginally housed population, with high rates of viral infection, addiction, and mental illness. (1) The volume of hippocampal cavities (HCavs) is greater in this highly multimorbid population compared to the general population. (2) Conventional vascular risk factors such as greater age and systolic blood pressure are associated with higher HCav volume. (3) Nonprescribed substance-related risk factors such as stimulant use or dependence, and smoking are associated with increased HCav volume independent of vascular risk factors. This is a retrospective analysis of an ongoing prospective study. We analyzed baseline data, including medical history, physical exam, psychiatric diagnosis, and MRI from a total of 375 participants. Hippocampal cavities were defined as spaces isointense to CSF on T1 MRI sequences, bounded on all sides by hippocampal tissue, with a volume of at least 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. Risk factors were evaluated using negative binomial multiple regression. Stimulant use was reported by 87.3% of participants, with stimulant dependence diagnosed in 83.3% of participants. Prevalence of cavities was 71.6%, with a mean total bilateral HCav volume of 13.89 mm<sup>3</sup>. On average, a 1 mmHg greater systolic blood pressure was associated with a 2.17% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [0.57%, 3.79%], p = .0076), while each cigarette smoked per day trended toward a 2.69% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [−0.87%, 5.54%], p = .058). A diagnosis of stimulant dependence was associated with a 95.6% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [5.39%, 263.19%], p = .0335). Hypertension and diagnosis of stimulant dependence were associated with a greater total volume of HCav.</p>

                Brain accumulation of soluble oligomers of the amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}Os) has been implicated in synapse failure and memory impairment in Alzheimers disease. Here, we show that treatment with NUsc1, a single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) that selectively targets A{beta}Os, prevents the inhibition of long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices and memory impairment induced by A{beta}Os in mice. As a therapeutic approach for intracerebral antibody delivery, we developed an adeno-associated virus vector to drive neuronal expression of NUsc1 (AAV-NUsc1) within the brain. Transduction by AAV-NUsc1 induced NUsc1 expression and secretion in adult human brain slices, and inhibited A{beta}O binding to neurons and A{beta}O-induced loss of dendritic spine loss in primary rat hippocampal cultures. Treatment of mice with AAV-NUsc1 prevented memory impairment induced by A{beta}Os and, importantly, reversed memory deficits in aged APPswe/PS1{Delta}E9 Alzheimers disease model mice. These results support the feasibility of gene-mediated immunotherapy using single-chain antibodies as a potential therapeutic approach in Alzheimers disease.

	<p>GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, depolarizes and excites immature neurons because of an initially higher intracellular chloride concentration [Cl&amp;amp;minus;]i due to the delayed expression of the chloride exporter KCC2 at birth. Depolarization-induced calcium rise via NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels is instrumental in shaping neuronal circuits and in controlling the excitatory (E)/inhibitory (I) balance in selective brain areas. An E/I imbalance accounts for cognitive impairment observed in several neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to summarize recent data on the mechanisms by which alterations of GABAergic signaling alter the E/I balance in cortical and hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and the role of cation-chloride co-transporters in this process. In particular, we discuss the NGF and AD relationship and how mice engineered to express recombinant neutralizing anti-NGF antibodies (AD11 mice), which develop a neurodegenerative pathology reminiscent of that observed in AD patients, exhibit a depolarizing action of GABA due to KCC2 impairment. Treating AD and other forms of dementia with bumetanide, a selective KCC2 antagonist, contributes to re-establishing a proper E/I balance in selective brain areas, leading to amelioration of AD symptoms and the slowing down of disease progression.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex in the brain of insects provides a neural network for sensorimotor processing that is essential for spatial navigation and locomotion and plays a role in sleep control. Studies on the neurochemical architecture of the central complex have been performed especially in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melangoaster</i> and the desert locust, <i>Schistocerca gregaria</i>. In several insect species, myoinhibitory peptides (MIPs) are involved in circadian control and sleep-wake regulation. To identify neurons that might underlie these functions, we investigated the distribution of MIPs in the central complex of the locust. <i>In silico</i> transcript analysis suggests the presence of eight different MIPs in the desert locust. Through immunolabeling, we identified five systems of central-complex neurons that express MIP-like peptides. Two systems constitute columnar neurons of the protocerebral bridge and the lower division of the central body, while the other three systems are columnar neurons (two systems) and tangential neurons (one system) of the upper division of the central body. The innervation pattern and cell count of two systems of columnar neurons revealed the existence of 18 instead of 16 columns of the protocerebral bridge. Immunostaining of preparations containing intracellularly stained single cells allowed us to further specify subtypes of labeled columnar neurons. Double-label experiments showed that three systems of MIP-immunostained columnar neurons are also locustatachykinin-immunoreactive. No colocalization was found with serotonin immunostaining. The data provide novel insights into the architecture of the locust central complex and suggest that MIPs play a prominent role within the central-complex network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Application of the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration framework in cognitively intact adults: the CABLE Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (AT[N]) framework has conceptualized Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum as a continuum of disease with evidences of amyloid-related pathologies independent of clinical manifestation. Based on this framework, it is necessary to reveal the distribution and risk factors of AD continuum in the cognitively intact population among different cohorts and races, including the northern Chinese Han population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study classified cognitively intact Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) participants through the AT(N) scheme. Gaussian mixture models were used to identity the cutoff values of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, which distinguished AD continuum (A + T-N-, A + T + N-, A + T-N+ and A + T + N+) from 1,005 participants (mean age: 61 years; 40% female). Multivariable logistic regressions and Cochran-Armitage trend tests were used to test neuropsychological performance and risk factors for AD continuum.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Approximately one-third of individuals (33.7%) belonged to AD continuum. Four potential modifiable risk factors, including hypertension, thyroid diseases, social isolation and minimal depression symptoms, were identified for AD continuum (odds ratio [OR] ranging from 1.68 to 6.90). A trend toward higher prevalence of AD continuum was associated with a larger number of risk factors (P for trend &lt;0.0001). The risk of AD continuum increased by about two times for each additional modifiable risk factor (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.65–2.24, P &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study revealed the distribution and potential risk factors of AD continuum in cognitively intact Han population in northern China, which filled the gap in the area about the performance of the AT(N) framework in the Asian population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">GGC repeat expansion of RILPL1 is associated with oculopharyngodistal myopathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed GGC repeat expansions in 5’-UTR of <i>LRP12</i>, <i>GIPC1</i>, and <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> are associated with OPDM. Despite these advances, around 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Herein, we aim to investigate genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in two unrelated Chinese Han families.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Parametric linkage analysis was performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction (AL-PCR) were used to determine the genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by qPCR, immunoblotting, RNA FISH, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> was identified in six OPDM patients from two families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4 (OPDM4). Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at <i>RILPL1</i> locus in unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples showed no significant differences in <i>RILPL1</i> mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative TSSs exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated <i>RILPL1</i> TSS. Strand-specific RNAseq data revealed bidirectional transcription from the <i>RILPL1</i> locus. Finally, FISH/IF indicated that both sense and antisense transcripts formed RNA foci and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the intranuclear inclusions of OPDM4 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> as a novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM4 pathogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence and characteristics of referred pain in patients diagnosed with temporomandibular disorders according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Referred pain often complicates and delays the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Elaborating the prevalence and characteristics of TMD-associated referred pain as well as the distribution of referred pain in different TMD classes will significantly improve the diagnostic process. The objectives of the present study were to assess the prevalence and to evaluate the characteristics of referred pain associated with TMD diagnosed according to the DC/TMD. Methods: A total of 252 patients were evaluated using the DC/TMD Axes-I and –II assessment tools. Different modalities were used to treat the diagnosed TMD. Referred pain was diagnosed when the location of the perceived pain in response to palpation extended beyond the boundary of the structure that was examined. For pain locations that were perceived as deep, patients were asked to locate the surface of the area of pain. The result of the assessment was identified as positive if the patient described his perceived pain during the clinical examination as being familiar pain that was experienced in the same location in the last 30 days.  Results: TMD-associated referred pain was recorded in 153 patients (60.7%). The most common referred pain location was the temporal area (45.2%), followed by the ear (42.1%). The referred pain was recorded in disc displacement with reduction with intermittent locking and myofascial pain with referral in all patients (100%). The proportion of patients with referred pain was significantly different between the different TMD diagnostic subgroups (P < 0.001).  The recorded percentage of improvement in the referred pain following the treatment was 50.41% after 3 months and 56.65% after 6 months. Conclusions: Referred pain is a prominent feature of TMD. More studies are required with longer follow-up periods and bigger sample sizes to support the findings of the present study.

                Middle-aged persons with multimorbidity have to take their illnesses into account in their daily work, family and leisure activities. The MuMiA project aims to identify early preventive measures that make it easier for those between 30 and 60 years of age with multiple chronic diseases to manage their illnesses in their everyday lives. An interdisciplinary workshop and interviews with multimorbid middle-aged adults and their principal healthcare providers will be used to collect information on the management of care in the contexts of patients’ daily work, family and leisure activities. Data obtained in the interviews will be coded inductively and analysed using content analysis. Workshop outputs will be transcribed and evaluated by the authors. This study has received ethical approval from the Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee of Goethe University (2021-47). The project will generate prevention recommendations that reflect the experiences of middle-aged persons living with multimorbidity and the views of their principal healthcare providers. The findings will be disseminated via conferences and peer-reviewed publications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Direct reciprocity between individuals that use different strategy spaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura Schmid, Christian Hilbe, Krishnendu Chatterjee, Martin A. Nowak</p>

In repeated interactions, players can use strategies that respond to the outcome of previous rounds. Much of the existing literature on direct reciprocity assumes that all competing individuals use the same strategy space. Here, we study both learning and evolutionary dynamics of players that differ in the strategy space they explore. We focus on the infinitely repeated donation game and compare three natural strategy spaces: memory-1 strategies, which consider the last moves of both players, reactive strategies, which respond to the last move of the co-player, and unconditional strategies. These three strategy spaces differ in the memory capacity that is needed. We compute the long term average payoff that is achieved in a pairwise learning process. We find that smaller strategy spaces can dominate larger ones. For weak selection, unconditional players dominate both reactive and memory-1 players. For intermediate selection, reactive players dominate memory-1 players. Only for strong selection and low cost-to-benefit ratio, memory-1 players dominate the others. We observe that the supergame between strategy spaces can be a social dilemma: maximum payoff is achieved if both players explore a larger strategy space, but smaller strategy spaces dominate.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pre- and postsynaptically expressed spike-timing-dependent plasticity contribute differentially to neuronal learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Beatriz Eymi Pimentel Mizusaki, Sally Si Ying Li, Rui Ponte Costa, Per Jesper Sjöström</p>

A plethora of experimental studies have shown that long-term synaptic plasticity can be expressed pre- or postsynaptically depending on a range of factors such as developmental stage, synapse type, and activity patterns. The functional consequences of this diversity are not clear, although it is understood that whereas postsynaptic expression of plasticity predominantly affects synaptic response amplitude, presynaptic expression alters both synaptic response amplitude and short-term dynamics. In most models of neuronal learning, long-term synaptic plasticity is implemented as changes in connective weights. The consideration of long-term plasticity as a fixed change in amplitude corresponds more closely to post- than to presynaptic expression, which means theoretical outcomes based on this choice of implementation may have a postsynaptic bias. To explore the functional implications of the diversity of expression of long-term synaptic plasticity, we adapted a model of long-term plasticity, more specifically spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), such that it was expressed either independently pre- or postsynaptically, or in a mixture of both ways. We compared pair-based standard STDP models and a biologically tuned triplet STDP model, and investigated the outcomes in a minimal setting, using two different learning schemes: in the first, inputs were triggered at different latencies, and in the second a subset of inputs were temporally correlated. We found that presynaptic changes adjusted the speed of learning, while postsynaptic expression was more efficient at regulating spike timing and frequency. When combining both expression loci, postsynaptic changes amplified the response range, while presynaptic plasticity allowed control over postsynaptic firing rates, potentially providing a form of activity homeostasis. Our findings highlight how the seemingly innocuous choice of implementing synaptic plasticity by single weight modification may unwittingly introduce a postsynaptic bias in modelling outcomes. We conclude that pre- and postsynaptically expressed plasticity are not interchangeable, but enable complimentary functions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Gamma oscillations in primate primary visual cortex are severely attenuated by small stimulus discontinuities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vinay Shirhatti, Poojya Ravishankar, Supratim Ray</p>

Gamma oscillations (30 to 80 Hz) have been hypothesized to play an important role in feature binding, based on the observation that continuous long bars induce stronger gamma in the visual cortex than bars with a small gap. Recently, many studies have shown that natural images, which have discontinuities in several low-level features, do not induce strong gamma oscillations, questioning their role in feature binding. However, the effect of different discontinuities on gamma has not been well studied. To address this, we recorded spikes and local field potential from 2 monkeys while they were shown gratings with discontinuities in 4 attributes: space, orientation, phase, or contrast. We found that while these discontinuities only had a modest effect on spiking activity, gamma power drastically reduced in all cases, suggesting that gamma could be a resonant phenomenon. An excitatory–inhibitory population model with stimulus-tuned recurrent inputs showed such resonant properties. Therefore, gamma could be a signature of excitation–inhibition balance, which gets disrupted due to discontinuities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Aberrant induction of p19Arf-mediated cellular senescence contributes to neurodevelopmental defects</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Muriel Rhinn, Irene Zapata-Bodalo, Annabelle Klein, Jean-Luc Plassat, Tania Knauer-Meyer, William M. Keyes</p>

Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely prescribed drug to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and migraine. If taken during pregnancy, however, exposure to the developing embryo can cause birth defects, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. How VPA causes these developmental defects remains unknown. We used embryonic mice and human organoids to model key features of VPA drug exposure, including exencephaly, microcephaly, and spinal defects. In the malformed tissues, in which neurogenesis is defective, we find pronounced induction of cellular senescence in the neuroepithelial (NE) cells. Critically, through genetic and functional studies, we identified p19<sup>Arf</sup> as the instrumental mediator of senescence and microcephaly, but, surprisingly, not exencephaly and spinal defects. Together, these findings demonstrate that misregulated senescence in NE cells can contribute to developmental defects.

                Background: Angiosarcoma is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma that can arise in any soft-tissue structure or viscera. Only individual case reports and small series of gastrointestinal angiosarcoma have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we report the first African case of small intestine epithelioid angiosarcoma. Case report: Here, we present the case of a 66-year-old man who presented with melena and anemia. Physical examination showed the presence of two subcutaneous masses on the right and left flanks. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, duodenoscopy and jejunoscopy revealed multiple purpuric and hemorrhagic nodules and masses, some of which were bleeding. Pathological study of the ampullary formation and of a subcutaneous nodule concluded to the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma. Blood transfusions and interventional endoscopy by argan plasma coagulation were required due to a continued drop in hemoglobin. A drop in hemoglobin persisted and the patient died within 10 days. Conclusions: Angiosarcoma has a very poor prognosis due to delayed prognosis and insufficient therapeutic management. Interventional endoscopy to control bleeding can be considered in localized forms. Chemotherapy may help to prolong survival in metastatic and disseminated angiosarcoma. Further studies should be conducted to improve the prognosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for the perioperative outcome risk assessment with computer learning enhancement (Periop ORACLE) randomized study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: More than four million people die each year in the month following surgery, and many more experience complications such as acute kidney injury. Some of these outcomes may be prevented through early identification of at-risk patients and through intraoperative risk mitigation. Telemedicine has revolutionized the way at-risk patients are identified in critical care, but intraoperative telemedicine services are not widely used in anesthesiology. Clinicians in telemedicine settings may assist with risk stratification and brainstorm risk mitigation strategies while clinicians in the operating room are busy performing other patient care tasks. Machine learning tools may help clinicians in telemedicine settings leverage the abundant electronic health data available in the perioperative period. The primary hypothesis for this study is that anesthesiology clinicians can predict postoperative complications more accurately with machine learning assistance than without machine learning assistance. Methods: This investigation is a sub-study nested within the TECTONICS randomized clinical trial (NCT03923699). As part of TECTONICS, study team members who are anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting are currently reviewing ongoing surgical cases and documenting how likely they feel the patient is to experience 30-day in-hospital death or acute kidney injury. For patients who are included in this sub-study, these case reviews will be randomized to be performed with access to a display showing machine learning predictions for the postoperative complications or without access to the display. The accuracy of the predictions will be compared across these two groups. Conclusion: Successful completion of this study will help define the role of machine learning not only for intraoperative telemedicine, but for other risk assessment tasks before, during, and after surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Lifestyle Affects Amyloid Burden and Cognition Differently in Men and Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence on associations of lifestyle factors with Alzheimer's pathology and cognition are ambiguous, potentially because they rarely addressed inter-relationships of factors and sex effects. While considering these aspects, we examined the relationships of lifestyle factors with brain amyloid burden and cognition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 178 cognitively normal individuals (women, 49%; 65.0 [7.6] years) and 54 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (women, 35%; 71.3 [8.3] years) enrolled in a prospective study of volunteers who completed <sup>18</sup>F-Flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography. Using structural equation modeling, we examined associations between latent constructs representing metabolic/vascular risk, physical activity, and cognitive activity with global amyloid burden and cognitive performance. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of sex in this model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, higher cognitive activity was associated with better cognitive performance and higher physical activity was associated with lower amyloid burden. The latter association was weakened to a nonsignificant level after excluding multivariate outliers. Examination of the moderating effect of sex in the model revealed an inverse association of metabolic/vascular risk with cognition in men, whereas in women metabolic/vascular risk trended toward increased amyloid burden. Furthermore, a significant inverse association between physical activity and amyloid burden was found only in men. Inheritance of an APOE4 allele was associated with higher amyloid burden only in women.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex modifies effects of certain lifestyle-related factors on amyloid burden and cognition. Notably, our results suggest that the negative impact of metabolic/vascular risk influences the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease through distinct paths in women and men.

                Cholesterol granuloma is a rare non-infectious disease. Currently, there are no established guidelines, leaving the clinician to decide the best practice for each patient. A 43-year-old woman presented to the Surgery Clinic at Siloam General Hospital, Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, with the primary complaint of a painful mass located in her left breast over the previous week before being admitted to the hospital. The mass was found abruptly and was accompanied by severe pain and fever. On inspection, peau d’orange, nipple retraction, tenderness, and warmth of the skin were observed. Ultrasonography suggested a malignant mass. The primary diagnosis was breast cancer, with a secondary differential diagnosis of breast abscess. An open biopsy was chosen because a breast abscess was the possible diagnosis. The biopsy results showed characteristics of cholesterol granuloma. Following the operation, the pain score was notably reduced as the operation showed a satisfactory result. The primary purpose of this case report was to illustrate a case of breast abscess caused by cholesterol granuloma, in which open excisional biopsy and drainage was superior for pain reduction and faster recovery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An evaluation of the three measurable cardinal objectives of the National Youth Service Corps programme: a survey dataset [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The National Youth Service Corps programme is, among other targets, aimed at promoting national inclusiveness and tolerance in a culturally heterogeneous society. Despite the importance of this programme, little has been done to evaluate its degree of success. Where evaluations are done, they are never made public. There is a need for the NYSC programme, just like all other public programmes, to be evaluated for transparency, accountability and decision-making. From an evaluation of the three measurable objectives of the NYSC programme, this dataset bridges this gap. Methods: This dataset was collected from Nigerian graduates that completed their national service between 2012 and 2021. The data was collected through an electronic survey posted to various online platforms hosting National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members of the various sets and batches. The data collection aimed to evaluate the three cardinal objectives of the programme. After three years of data collection (from 2019 to 2021), responses were obtained from 19,278 participants that met the eligibility criteria. The data is an Excel (.xlsx) document with 19,278 cases and 95 variables. Descriptive statistics such as frequency counts and simple percentages were used to summarise the data. However, charts are further used to illustrate the demographic attributes of the respondents. The dataset is broad and covers all the 36 states in Nigeria plus the Federal Capital Territory. Results: The data set has many reuse potentials because it contains information on camp activities (such as parades, military drills, redeployment, quality of food, and facilities, among others), primary assignments and community service engagements of corps members. Conclusions: The data can offer a complete evaluation of how the (NYSC) has attained three of its four cardinal objectives. A series of relationships can further be determined and tested using inferential statistics among the variables included in the dataset.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigating audible and ultrasonic noise in modern animal facilities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The environmental housing conditions of laboratory animals are important for both welfare and reliable, reproducible data. Guidelines currently exist for factors such as lighting cycles, temperature, humidity, and noise, however, for the latter the current guidelines may overlook important details. In the case of the most common laboratory species, the mouse, the range of frequencies they can hear is far higher than that of humans. The current guidelines briefly mention that ultrasonic (>20 kHz) frequencies can adversely affect mice, and that the acoustic environment should be checked, though no recommendations are provided relating to acceptable levels of ultrasonic noise. Methods: To investigate the ultrasonic environment in a large mouse breeding facility (the Mary Lyon Centre at MRC Harwell), we compared two systems, the Hottinger Bruel and Kjaer PULSE sound analyser, and an Avisoft Bioacoustics system. Potential noise sources were selected; we used the PULSE system to undertake real-time Fourier analysis of noise up to 100 kHz, and the Avisoft system to record noise up to 125 kHz for later analysis. The microphones from both systems were positioned consistently at the same distance from the source and environmental conditions were identical. In order to investigate our result further, a third system, the AudioMoth (Open Acoustic Devices), was also used for recording. We used DeepSqueak software for most of the recording analysis and, in some cases, we also undertook further spectral analysis using RX8 (iZotope, USA). Results: We found that both systems can detect a range of ultrasonic noise sources, and here discuss the benefits and limitations of each approach. Conclusions: We conclude that measuring the acoustic environment of animal facilities, including ultrasonic frequencies that may adversely affect the animals housed, will contribute to minimising disruption to animal welfare and perturbations in scientific research.

                Nausea is an unpleasant sensation of visceral malaise that remains poorly understood at a molecular and cellular level. Zhang et al. uncover brainstem inhibitory neurons that suppress nausea-related behaviors through selective blockade of nausea-promoting, GDF15 responsive-excitatory neurons. Nausea-suppressing neurons can be pharmacologically engaged by the gut hormone glucose insulinotropic peptide (GIP).

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Receptor editing constrains development of phosphatidyl choline-specific B cells in VH12-transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                Worth et al. show that impairing receptor editing by dnRAG1 transgene expression in HC VH12 transgenic mice enforces BCR reactivity to phosphatidyl choline (PtC). Sequencing suggests that, after positive selection based on HC pairing and PtC binding, receptor editing further reduces PtC+ B cells. Likely RAG-independent type 2 gene replacements are also identified.

                Kiani Shabestari et al. show that genetic absence of microglia in Alzheimer’s disease mice causes a shift from parenchymal amyloid plaques to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, brain calcification and hemorrhages, and premature lethality. Adult microglial transplantation rescues these pathological changes, demonstrating that microglia protect the brain against detrimental Alzheimer’s disease co-pathologies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">TRPV1 SUMOylation suppresses itch by inhibiting TRPV1 interaction with H1 receptors</a></h4>

              
                Using a multidisciplinary approach, Gao et al. define the mechanism of TRPV1 regulation of histaminergic itch. Histamine promotes a direct binding of H1R to TRPV1 via TRPV1 deSUMOylation, which enhances H1R-TRPV1 functional coupling in sensory neurons and itching behaviors. Disrupting the H1R-TRPV1 interaction with blocking peptides suppresses histaminergic itch in vivo.

                Hirano et al. show how the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) NANOS2 and DND1 regulate target mRNA selection. They find that NANOS2 helps DND1 form a ternary complex on the target mRNAs and that NANOS2 recruits the CNOT complex to mRNAs to suppress their expression, suggesting that NANOS2 works as a second-layer RBP.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Elevated brain-derived cell-free DNA among patients with first psychotic episode - a proof-of-concept study</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a common, severe and debilitating psychiatric disorder. Despite extensive research there is as yet no biological marker that can aid in its diagnosis and course prediction. This precludes early detection and intervention. Imaging studies suggest brain volume loss around the onset and over the first few years of schizophrenia, and apoptosis has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Cell-free DNA fragments (cfDNA) are released into the bloodstream following cell death. Tissue-specific methylation patterns allow the identification of the tissue origins of cfDNA. We developed a cocktail of brain specific DNA methylation markers, and used it to assess the presence of brain-derived cfDNA in the plasma of patients with a first psychotic episode. We detected significantly elevated neuron- (p=0.0013), astrocyte- (p=0.0016), oligodendrocyte- (p=0.0129) and whole brain-derived (p=0.0012) cfDNA in the plasma of patients during their first psychotic episode (n=29), compared with healthy controls (n=31). Increased cfDNA levels were not correlated with psychotropic medications use. Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.77, with 65% sensitivity at 90% specificity in patients with a psychotic episode. Potential interpretations of these findings include increased brain cell death, disruption of the blood-brain barrier or a defect in clearance of material from dying brain cells. Brain-specific cfDNA methylation markers can potentially assist early detection and monitoring of schizophrenia and thus allow early intervention and adequate therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decoding the activated stem cell phenotype of the neonatally maturing pituitary</a></h4>

              
                The pituitary represents the endocrine master regulator. In mouse, the gland undergoes active maturation immediately after birth. Here, we in detail portrayed the stem cell compartment of neonatal pituitary. Single-cell RNA-sequencing pictured an active gland, revealing proliferative stem as well as hormonal (progenitor) cell populations. The stem cell pool displayed a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype, characteristic of development-involved tissue stem cells. Organoid culturing recapitulated the stem cells’ phenotype, interestingly also reproducing their paracrine activity. The pituitary stem cell-activating interleukin-6 (IL-6) advanced organoid growth, although the neonatal stem cell compartment was not visibly affected in <i>Il6<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, likely due to cytokine family redundancy. Further transcriptomic analysis exposed a pronounced WNT pathway in the neonatal gland, shown to be involved in stem cell activation and to overlap with the (fetal) human pituitary transcriptome. Following local damage, the neonatal gland efficiently regenerates, despite absence of additional stem cell proliferation, or upregulated IL-6 or WNT expression, all in line with the already high stem cell activation status, thereby exposing striking differences with adult pituitary. Together, our study decodes the stem cell compartment of neonatal pituitary, exposing an activated state in the maturing gland. Understanding stem cell activation is key to potential pituitary regenerative prospects.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional abnormalities in the cerebello-thalamic pathways in a mouse model of DYT25 dystonia</a></h4>

              
                Dystonia is often associated with functional alterations in the cerebello-thalamic pathways, which have been proposed to contribute to the disorder by propagating pathological firing patterns to the forebrain. Here, we examined the function of the cerebello-thalamic pathways in a model of DYT25 dystonia. DYT25 (<i>Gnal<sup>+/−</sup></i>) mice carry a heterozygous knockout mutation of the <i>Gnal</i> gene, which notably disrupts striatal function, and systemic or striatal administration of oxotremorine to these mice triggers dystonic symptoms. Our results reveal an increased cerebello-thalamic excitability in the presymptomatic state. Following the first dystonic episode, <i>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice in the asymptomatic state exhibit a further increase of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical excitability, which is maintained after θ-burst stimulations of the cerebellum. When administered in the symptomatic state induced by a cholinergic activation, these stimulations decreased the cerebello-thalamic excitability and reduced dystonic symptoms. In agreement with dystonia being a multiregional circuit disorder, our results suggest that the increased cerebello-thalamic excitability constitutes an early endophenotype, and that the cerebellum is a gateway for corrective therapies via the depression of cerebello-thalamic pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analysis of combinatorial chemokine receptor expression dynamics using multi-receptor reporter mice</a></h4>

              
                Inflammatory chemokines and their receptors are central to the development of inflammatory/immune pathologies. The apparent complexity of this system, coupled with lack of appropriate in vivo models, has limited our understanding of how chemokines orchestrate inflammatory responses and has hampered attempts at targeting this system in inflammatory disease. Novel approaches are therefore needed to provide crucial biological, and therapeutic, insights into the chemokine-chemokine receptor family. Here, we report the generation of transgenic multi-chemokine receptor reporter mice in which spectrally-distinct fluorescent reporters mark expression of CCRs 1, 2, 3 and 5, key receptors for myeloid cell recruitment in inflammation. Analysis of these animals has allowed us to define, for the first time, individual and combinatorial receptor expression patterns on myeloid cells in resting and inflamed conditions. Our results demonstrate that chemokine receptor expression is highly specific, and more selective than previously anticipated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inferring characteristics of bacterial swimming in biofilm matrix from time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Biofilms are spatially organized communities of microorganisms embedded in a self-produced organic matrix, conferring to the population emerging properties such as an increased tolerance to the action of antimicrobials. It was shown that some bacilli were able to swim in the exogenous matrix of pathogenic biofilms and to counterbalance these properties. Swimming bacteria can deliver antimicrobial agents in situ, or potentiate the activity of antimicrobial by creating a transient vascularization network in the matrix. Hence, characterizing swimmer trajectories in the biofilm matrix is of particular interest to understand and optimize this new biocontrol strategy in particular, but also more generally to decipher ecological drivers of population spatial structure in natural biofilms ecosystems. In this study, a new methodology is developed to analyze time-lapse confocal laser scanning images to describe and compare the swimming trajectories of bacilli swimmers populations and their adaptations to the biofilm structure. The method is based on the inference of a kinetic model of swimmer populations including mechanistic interactions with the host biofilm. After validation on synthetic data, the methodology is implemented on images of three different species of motile bacillus species swimming in a Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. The fitted model allows to stratify the swimmer populations by their swimming behavior and provides insights into the mechanisms deployed by the micro-swimmers to adapt their swimming traits to the biofilm matrix.

                During severe infections, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> moves from its colonising sites to blood and tissues, and is exposed to new selective pressures, thus potentially driving adaptive evolution. Previous studies have shown the key role of the <i>agr</i> locus in <i>S. aureus</i> pathoadaptation, however a more comprehensive characterisation of genetic signatures of bacterial adaptation may enable prediction of clinical outcomes and reveal new targets for treatment and prevention of these infections. Here, we measured adaptation using within-host evolution analysis of 2,590 <i>S. aureus</i> genomes from 396 independent episodes of infection. By capturing a comprehensive repertoire of single-nucleotide and structural genome variations, we found evidence of a distinctive evolutionary pattern within the infecting populations compared to colonising bacteria. These invasive strains had up to 20-fold enrichments for genome degradation signatures and displayed significantly convergent mutations in a distinctive set of genes, linked to antibiotic response and pathogenesis. In addition to <i>agr</i>-mediated adaptation we identified non-canonical, genome-wide significant loci including <i>sucA</i>-<i>sucB</i> and <i>stp1</i>. The prevalence of adaptive changes increased with infection extent, emphasising the clinical significance of these signatures. These findings provide a high-resolution picture of the molecular changes when <i>S. aureus</i> transitions from colonisation to severe infection and may inform correlation of infection outcomes with adaptation signatures.

                Spermatogenesis is a highly specialised differentiation process driven by a dynamic gene expression program and ending with the production of mature spermatozoa. Whereas hundreds of genes are known to be essential for male germline proliferation and differentiation, the contribution of several genes remains uncharacterized. The predominant expression of the latest globin family member, androglobin (Adgb), in mammalian testis tissue prompted us to assess its physiological function in spermatogenesis. Adgb knockout mice display male infertility, reduced testis weight, impaired maturation of elongating spermatids, abnormal sperm shape and ultrastructural defects in microtubule and mitochondrial organisation. Epididymal sperm from Adgb knockout animals display multiple flagellar malformations including coiled, bifid or shortened flagella, and erratic acrosomal development. Following immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we could identify septin 10 (Sept10) as interactor of Adgb. The Sept10-Adgb interaction was confirmed both <i>in vivo</i> using testis lysates, and <i>in vitro</i> by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, absence of Adgb leads to mislocalisation of Sept10 in sperm, indicating defective manchette and sperm annulus formation. Finally, <i>in vitro</i> data suggest that Adgb contributes to Sept10 proteolysis in a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner. Collectively, our results provide evidence that Adgb is essential for murine spermatogenesis and further suggest that Adgb is required for sperm head shaping via the manchette and proper flagellum formation.

                Melanopsin signaling within ipRGC subtypes impacts a broad range of behaviors from circadian photoentrainment to conscious visual perception. Yet, how melanopsin phototransduction within M1-M6 ipRGC subtypes impacts cellular signaling to drive diverse behaviors is still largely unresolved. The identity of the phototransduction channels in each subtype is key to understanding this central question but has remained controversial. In this study, we resolve two opposing models of M4 phototransduction, demonstrating that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are dispensable for this process and providing support for a model involving melanopsin-dependent potassium channel closure and canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel opening. Surprisingly, we find that HCN channels are likewise dispensable for M2 phototransduction, contradicting the current model. We instead show that in M2 phototransduction, TRPC channels act in conjunction with T-type voltage-gated calcium channels, a novel melanopsin phototransduction target. Collectively, this work resolves key discrepancies in our understanding of ipRGC phototransduction pathways in multiple subtypes and adds to mounting evidence that ipRGC subtypes employ diverse phototransduction cascades to fine-tune cellular responses for downstream behaviors.

                The human temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a brain area crucial for processing social information. Although brain stimulation studies have started to explore the causal function of TPJ under social contexts, few have explicitly considered bilateral TPJ as target regions. Here, leveraging non-invasive continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) and hierarchical Bayesian computational modeling, we tested whether left or right TPJ (with vertex as control) is causally involved in how dissenting choices by others influence individuals' choice adjustments in goal-directed learning. In our social learning paradigm, participants (N = 31) first made their private decision, and then were allowed to re-adjust their choices after observing choices of four other players. Behaviorally, we show that disruption of the left, but not the right TPJ, weakened participants' choice adjustment and delayed their response speed when confronted with dissenting information from the other players. Computationally, disrupting activity in the left TPJ attenuated the degree of computing social influence during choice adjustment, whereas the extent to which how observational learning from others' choices was integrated into direct learning remained intact. Together, our results provide evidence for the causal role of left TPJ in social influence during goal-directed learning and shed light on the relational function (with respect to oneself) of the TPJ in social cognition.

                Silencing neurons acutely and specifically informs about their functional roles in circuits and behavior. Existing optogenetic silencers include ion pumps or channels, and tools that damage the neurotransmitter release machinery. While the former hyperpolarize the cell and can alter ionic gradients, the latter allow only slow recovery, requiring de novo synthesis. Thus, there is a need for other strategies combining fast activation and reversibility. Here, we use light-evoked homo-oligomerization of cryptochrome CRY2 to silence synaptic transmission, by clustering synaptic vesicles (SVs). We benchmark this tool, optoSynC, by electrophysiology and locomotion in Caenorhabditis elegans. optoSynC clusters SVs within 25 s, causing approximation, observable by electron microscopy. Locomotion silencing is rapid (tau on ~15 s) and recovers quickly (tau off ~10 min) after light-off. Further, optoSynC can inhibit exocytosis for several hours, at very low light intensities. optoSynC is a highly efficient, "non-ionic" optogenetic silencer that may further allow to manipulate different SV pools.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Running modulates primate and rodent visual cortex via common mechanism but quantitatively distinct implementation</a></h4>

              
                When mice actively locomote, visual signals in their primary visual cortex (V1) are strongly modulated[1]. This observation has fundamentally altered conceptions of a brain region previously assumed to be a passive image processor, and extensive work has followed, aimed at dissecting the sources, recipients, and functional consequences of running-correlated modulation [2-13]. However, it remains unclear whether visual processing in primates might similarly change during active locomotion. We therefore measured V1 activity in a nonhuman primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), while they alternated between running and stationary. In contrast to the often large increases in mouse V1 during running, conventional metrics of response in marmoset V1 were barely distinguishable during running versus not running, with some slight decreases evident. However, by leveraging large-scale recordings, analysis of the latent variables driving population activity revealed a common mechanism in both species: trial-to-trial fluctuations of shared gain modulations were present across V1 in mice and marmosets. These gain modulations were larger in mice and were often positively correlated with running; they were smaller and more likely to be weakly negatively correlated with running in marmosets. Thus, population-scale gain fluctuations of V1 reflect a common principle of mammalian visual cortical function, but there are important quantitative differences in their magnitudes and correlations with behavior that yield distinct consequences for the relation between vision and action in primates versus rodents.

                Key targets of both the therapeutic and abused properties of opioids are -opioid receptors (MORs). Despite years of research investigating the biochemistry and signal transduction pathways associated with MOR activation, we do not fully understand the cellular mechanisms underlying opioid addiction. Given that addictive opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, heroin, and fentanyl all activate MORs, and current therapies such as naloxone and buprenorphine block this activation, the availability of tools to mechanistically investigate opioid-mediated cellular and behavioral phenotypes are necessary. Therefore, we derived, validated, and applied a novel MOR-specific Cre mouse line, inserting the Cre coding sequence into the MOR 3UTR to generate a bicistronic gene. As intended, there were no differences in behavioral responses to morphine when compared to wild type mice, nor are there any alterations in Oprm1 gene expression or receptor density. To assess Cre recombinase activity, MOR-Cre mice were crossed with the floxed GFP-reporters, RosaLSLSun1-sfGFP or RosaLSL-GFP-L10a. The latter allowed for cell type specific RNA sequencing via TRAP (Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) of striatal MOR+ neurons following opioid withdrawal. This new tool will facilitate the study of opioid biology under varying conditions.

                Corticotrophs are intermediaries in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which plays a crucial role in vertebrates' stress response. The HPA axis displays an intricate mode of negative feedback regulation, whereby the peripheral effector, cortisol inhibits the secretion of its upstream regulator, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing cells in the pituitary. While the feedback regulation of the HPA axis is well characterized in the adult organism, the effect of feedback regulation on the development of corticotrophs is poorly understood. Here, we study the effect of glucocorticoids on the development of POMC-expressing cells in the zebrafish pituitary. The development of POMC cells displayed striking robustness in terms of their steady increase in numbers between 2-6 days post fertilization. Inhibition of endogenous glucocorticoid synthesis resulted in an increase in POMC cell number due to reduced developmental feedback inhibition of cortisol on POMC cells. Conversely, addition of exogenous dexamethasone at a critical developmental window led to a decrease in POMC cell number, mimicking greater feedback control. Finally, developmental dysregulation of ACTH levels resulted in impaired anxiety-like and stress-coping behaviours. Hence, we identified a sensitive developmental window for the effect of glucocorticoids on corticotrophs and demonstrate the downstream effect on stress-responsive behaviour.

                The human cerebral cortex underlies many of our unique strengths and vulnerabilities as a species - but efforts to understand its organization are challenged by reliance on incompatible measurement methods at different spatial scales. Macroscale features such as cortical folding or functional activation are accessed through spatially dense neuroimaging maps, whereas microscale cellular and molecular features are typically measured with sparse postmortem sampling. Here, we integrate these distinct windows on brain organization by building upon existing postmortem data to impute, validate and analyze a library of ~20,000 spatially dense neuroimaging-like maps of human cortical gene expression. These maps allow spatially unbiased discovery of cortical zones with extreme transcriptional profiles or unusually rapid transcriptional change indexing distinct microstructure. Comparison with neuroimaging shows these molecular transitions are aligned with cortical folding and functional specializations. Next, we define canonical cortex-wide gene co-expression patterns, and show that these integrate diverse spatial scales and temporal epochs of human brain organization - ranging from protein-protein interactions to large-scale systems for cognitive processing. These spatial modes of cortical gene expression are enriched for neuropsychiatric disorder risk genes, and - in the example of autism spectrum disorder - define a functionally enriched subset of risk genes that tags specific cyto-laminar features and predicts the location of altered cortical anatomy and gene expression in patients. Taken together, the methods, resources and findings described here advance our understanding of human cortical organization and offer flexible bridges to connect scientific fields operating at different spatial scales of human brain research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Juvenile Shank3 KO mice adopt distinct hunting strategies during prey capture learning</a></h4>

              
                Mice are opportunistic omnivores that readily learn to hunt and eat insects such as crickets. The details of how mice learn these behaviors and how these behaviors may differ in strains with altered neuroplasticity are unclear. We quantified the behavior of juvenile wild type and Shank3 knockout mice as they learned to hunt crickets during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. This stage involves heightened cortical plasticity including homeostatic synaptic scaling, which requires Shank3, a glutamatergic synaptic protein that, when mutated, produces Phelan-McDermid syndrome and is often comorbid with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both strains showed interest in examining live and dead crickets and learned to hunt. Shank 3 knockout mice took longer to become proficient, and, after 5 days, did not achieve the efficiency of wild type mice in either time-to-capture or distance-to-capture. Shank3 knockout mice also exhibited different characteristics when pursuing crickets that defied explanation as a simple motor deficit. Although both genotypes moved at the same average speed when approaching a cricket, Shank3 KO mice paused more often during approaches, did not begin final accelerations toward crickets as early, and did not close the distance gap to the cricket as quickly as wild type mice. These differences in Shank3 KO mice are reminiscent of some behavioral characteristics of individuals with ASD as they perform complex tasks, such as slower action initiation and completion. This paradigm will be useful for exploring the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie these learning and performance differences in monogenic ASD rodent models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Similar striatal activity exerts different control over automatic and flexible motor sequences</a></h4>

              
                The ability to sequence discrete movements in new ways enables rich and adaptive behavior. Such flexibility can be computationally costly and result in halting performances. Practicing the same motor sequence repeatedly, however, can render its execution precise, fast, and effortless, i.e., 'automatic'. The basal ganglia are thought to underlie both flexible and automatic motor sequences, yet how their contributions differ across these modes is unclear. We parse this in rats trained to perform the same motor sequence in both modes, focusing on the sensorimotor striatum. Neural recordings revealed a kinematic code independent of execution mode. While lesions affected the detailed kinematics across modes, they disrupted high-level sequential structure for automatic but not visually-guided flexible behaviors. These results suggest that while the basal ganglia contribute to learned movement kinematics and are essential for 'automatic' motor skills, they can be dispensable for the flexible sequencing of discrete motor elements.

	<p>Background: Recent evidence suggests that a higher body weight may be linked to cognitive impairment in different domains involving executive/frontal functioning. However, challenging results are also available. Accordingly, our study was designed to verify whether (i) poor executive functions are related to a higher body weight and (ii) executive functioning could contribute to weight loss in treatment-seeking overweight and obese patients. Methods: We examined general executive functioning, inhibitory control, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed in a sample including 104 overweight and obese patients. Forty-eight normal-weight subjects participated in the study as controls. Results: Univariate Analysis of Variance showed that obese patients obtained lower scores than overweight and normal-weight subjects in all executive measures, except for errors in the Stroop test. However, when sociodemographic variables entered the model as covariates, no between-group difference was detected. Furthermore, an adjusted multiple linear regression model highlighted no relationship between weight loss and executive scores at baseline. Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence for the lack of association between obesity and the executive domains investigated. Conflicting findings from previous literature may likely be due to the unchecked confounding effects exerted by sociodemographic variables and inclusion/exclusion criteria.</p>

	<p>Recent studies have shown promise for the use of probiotics in modulating behaviour through the microbiota&amp;amp;ndash;gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. In the present study, we assessed the impact of two probiotic strains in mitigating autism-related symptomology in the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Male juvenile BTBR mice were randomized into: (1) control, (2) Lr probiotic (1 &amp;amp;times; 109 CFU/mL Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HA-114), and (3) Ls probiotic groups (1 &amp;amp;times; 109 CFU/mL Ligilactobacillus salivarius HA-118) (n = 18&amp;amp;ndash;21/group), receiving treatments in drinking water for 4 weeks. Gut microbiota profiling by 16S rRNA showed Lr, but not Ls supplementation, to increase microbial richness and phylogenetic diversity, with a rise in potential anti-inflammatory and butyrate-producing taxa. Assessing serum and brain metabolites, Lr and Ls supplementation produced distinct metabolic profiles, with Lr treatment elevating concentrations of potentially beneficial neuroactive compounds, such as 5-aminovaleric acid and choline. As mitochondrial dysfunction is often observed in ASD, we assessed mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. No differences were observed for either treatment. Both Lr and Ls treatment reduced behavioural deficits in social novelty preference. However, no changes in hyperactivity, repetitive behaviour, and sociability were observed. Results show Lr to impart positive changes along the microbiota&amp;amp;ndash;gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis, exhibiting beneficial effects on selected behaviour, gut microbial diversity, and metabolism in BTBR mice.</p>

	<p>Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare and slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of eosinophilic neuronal intranuclear inclusions. The clinical manifestations of NIID are diverse, and the most common initial feature in cases of sporadic NIID is dementia. Herein, we report an adult female with keratitis as the initial presentation with subsequent bilateral limb tremor, gait disturbances, overemotional behavior, sweating and constipation. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed hyperintensity in the bilateral fronto-parieto-occipital corticomedullary junction. Skin biopsy specimens revealed eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in fibroblast cells, sweat gland cells and adipose cells. In vivo confocal microscopy of the cornea indicated the absence of corneal nerves in both affected eyes. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagnosis of NIID was based on the presence of intranuclear inclusions in biopsied skin and the characteristic high-intensity signal in the corticomedullary junction obtained with DWI. This case report emphasizes that the clinical heterogeneity of NIID and an examination of the corneal nerves may offer valuable clues to its early diagnosis in some patients.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Previous studies have found the neurodegeneration and atrophy of glaucomatous lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), but the mechanism is still unknown. Circular RNA (circRNA) plays some important roles in physiological and pathological progression of the disease. In this study, we focused on the differentially expressed circRNAs and the mechanism for circXPO5 in LGN degeneration in a macaque glaucoma model. Methods: Using RNA-seq, we analyzed the differentially expressed circRNAs in a macaque glaucoma model. An RT-QPCR was used to check the expression of selected differentially expressed circRNAs, candidate miRNAs and mRNAs. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network analysis was performed to examine the mechanism of circXPO5 action. Results: circXPO5 significantly decreased in the glaucoma model and a ceRNA network analysis revealed that circXPO5 can bind to miR-330-5p, which also binds to GRIN2A (ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A). QPCR detection showed a decrease in GRIN2A and an increase in miR-330-5p. Conclusions: Our earlier studies revealed that the GRIN2A gene regulates the calcium signal pathway. Decreasing of GRIN2A related with neuron apoptosis and neurodegeneration. These findings indicate that the reduction in circXPO5 may have a protective effect on neuronal apoptosis in the visual central system of glaucoma.</p>

	<p>The progressive degradation of the nigrostriatal system leads to the development of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). The synthesis of dopamine, the neurotransmitter of the nigrostriatal system, depends on the rate-limiting enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In this study, we evaluated the synthesis of dopamine during periods of neurodegradation and neuroplasticity in the nigrostriatal system on a model of the early clinical stage of PD. It was shown that the concentration of dopamine correlated with activity of TH, while TH activity did not depend on total protein content either in the SN or in the striatum. Both during the period of neurodegeneration and neuroplasticity, TH activity in SN was determined by the content of P19-TH, and in the striatum it was determined by P31-TH and P40-TH (to a lesser extent). The data obtained indicate a difference in the regulation of dopamine synthesis between DA-neuron bodies and their axons, which must be considered for the further development of symptomatic pharmacotherapy aimed at increasing TH activity.</p>

	<p>Alcohol dependence is a common mental disease worldwide. Excessive alcohol consumption may lead to alcoholism and many complications. In severe cases, it will lead to inhibition and paralysis of the centers of the respiratory and circulatory systems and even death. In addition, there is a lack of effective standard test procedures to detect alcoholism. EEG signals are data obtained by measuring brain changes in the cerebral cortex and can be used for the diagnosis of alcoholism. Existing diagnostic methods mainly employ machine learning techniques, which rely on human intervention to learn. In contrast, deep learning, as an end-to-end learning method, can automatically extract EEG signal features, which is more convenient. Nonetheless, there are few studies on the classification of alcohol&amp;amp;rsquo;s EEG signals using deep learning models. Therefore, in this paper, a new deep learning method is proposed to automatically extract and classify EEG&amp;amp;rsquo;s features. The method first adopts a multilayer discrete wavelet transform to denoise the input data. Then, the denoised data are used as input, and a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network are used for feature extraction. Finally, alcohol EEG signal classification is performed. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this study can be utilized to effectively diagnose patients with alcoholism, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 99.32%, which is better than most current algorithms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">TDP‐43 Pathology Exacerbates Cognitive Decline in Primary Age‐Related Tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary Age-Related Tauopathy (PART) refers to tau neurofibrillary tangles restricted largely to the medial temporal lobe in the absence of significant beta-amyloid plaques. PART has been associated with cognitive impairment, but contributions from concomitant Limbic Age-Related TDP-43 Encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) are underappreciated.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compare prevalence of LATE-NC and vascular co-pathologies in age- and Braak-matched patients with PART (n = 45, Braak I-IV, Thal phase 0–2) or early-stage Alzheimer's Disease neuropathologic change (ADNC, n = 51, Braak I-IV, Thal 3–5), and examine their influence on clinical and cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Concomitant LATE-NC and vascular pathology were equally common, and cognition was equally impaired, in PART (MMSE = 24.8 ± 6.9) and ADNC (MMSE = 24.2 ± 6.0). Patients with LATE-NC were more impaired than those without LATE-NC on the MMSE [by 5.8 points; 95%CI: 3.0–8.6], DRS [17.5 points; 7.1–27.9], CDR-sob [5.2 points; 2.1–8.2], Memory composite [0.8 standard deviations (SDs); 0.1–1.6] and Language composite [1.1 SDs; 0.2–2.0], and more likely to receive a dementia diagnosis [odds ratio 4.8; 1.5–18.0]. Those with vascular pathology performed worse than those without on the DRS [by 10.2 points; 0.1–20.3] and Executive composite [1.3 SDs; 0.3–2.3]. Cognition declined similarly in PART and ADNC over 5 years preceding death; however LATE-NC was associated with more rapid decline on the MMSE (β = 1.9 [0.9–3.0]), DRS (β = 7.8 [3.4–12.7), CDR-sob (β = 1.9 [0.4–3.7]), and Language composite (β = 0.5 SD [0.1–0.8]), and vascular pathology with more rapid decline on the DRS (β = 5.2 [0.6–10.2]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>LATE-NC, and to a lesser extent vascular co-pathology, exacerbates cognitive impairment and decline in PART and early-stage ADNC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Metabolic changes in chronic hepatitis C patients receiving direct acting antivirals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with direct acting antivirals (DAAS) improves the rates of sustained virological response (SVR). However, derangements with lipid profile and glycemic status have been observed. This study aimed to compare the effect of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DAC) versus sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LED) regimens on metabolic status of CHC patients. Methods: An observational prospective study was conducted on a total of 140 easy-to-treat treatment-naïve genotype-4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected Egyptian patients. Patients received either 400 mg SOF/60 mg DAC or SOF 400 mg/90 mg LED daily for 12 weeks. Patients were followed-up for 12 weeks after end-of-treatment. Total lipid profile, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured at baseline, four weeks (during treatment), and 12 weeks post-treatment (24 weeks). Clinical laboratory tests and treatment side effects during the treatment period were assessed to ensure safety. Complete blood picture, liver function tests, fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) were performed at baseline and week 12. Results: Both groups had 100% SVR. In both groups, no significant difference in body mass index was found after treatment. FIB-4 decreased significantly after treatment in the SOF/LED group. Regarding lipid profile, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were significantly increased then slightly decreased between week four and week 24 respectively in both groups with higher percentage change in the SOF/LED group. On the other hand, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) decreased throughout the follow-up period in both groups with no significant difference between two groups. Regarding glycemic status, HbA1c and FBS were significantly decreased in both groups throughout the study period with significant difference in the percentage change of HbA1c and FBS between two groups. Conclusions: SOF/LED regimen showed a significant change in lipid profile parameters more than the SOF/DAC regimen, while both regimens showed favorable outcomes in HbA1C and FBS levels.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in hypofunctional teeth during orthodontic tooth movement in rats [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: When moved orthodontically, hypofunctional teeth will have a decreased tooth movement rate compared to normal teeth. Hypofunctional teeth would have less VEGF expression and decreased heparan sulfate proteoglycan production during orthodontic tooth movement. This study aimed to determine the number of osteoblasts in the tension side and the number of osteoclasts in the pressure side of the hypofunctional teeth during orthodontic tooth movement. Method: 18 male Wistar rats were given a palatal coil spring application on the maxillary incisors. Rats were divided into two groups, the orthodontic group with normal occlusion (NO) and hypofunctional occlusion (HO). The number of osteoblasts on the tension side and osteoclasts on the pressure side on days zero (D0), five (D5), and 10 (D10) were tested with two-way ANOVA. Observations were made by hematoxylin eosin staining. Result: The results showed that the number of osteoblasts on the tension side of the HO group was the same at the NO group (p> 0.05). The number of osteoblasts on the tension side in the NO and HO groups at D5 was the same at D10 (p = 0.99), but significantly higher (p = 0.002), than D0. The number of osteoclasts on the pressure side in the HO group was significantly lower than the NO group (p <0.05). The number of osteoclasts in the NO D5 group was significantly higher than the other groups (p <0.05). Conclusions: The number of osteoblasts on the tension side was not affected by the hypofunctional state but decreased the number of osteoclasts on the pressure side during orthodontic tooth movement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of heavy metals in food and drug packaging materials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Food and drug packaging materials are an integral part of our everyday life.  Noxious elements can inadvertently be included in packaging materials in various stages of their production. Adulterants, adhesives, colorants and heavy metal interference are the common sources of contamination in food packaging materials. Heavy metal toxicity has far-reaching ill effects on living organisms. The present study aimed at qualitatively and quantitatively analysing heavy metal contamination of various materials that are used for food and drug packaging in India. Methods: The qualitative detection was done by rapid assay and heavy metals were quantified with the help of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). A total of 13 types of food and drug packaging materials were procured from local market and analysed for four heavy metals viz. arsenic (As), vanadium (V), mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd). The concentration of each heavy metal in the samples was compared with permitted values published by the European Council. Results: Of the 13 samples, heavy metals were qualitatively detected in 10 samples. ICP­-OES values for quantitative estimation showed presence of heavy metal above permissible range in 10 of the studied samples for vanadium, all samples for arsenic, two samples for mercury and one sample for cadmium. Arsenic was found to be the commonest heavy metal contaminant, present in 13 samples above permissible limit. Conclusions: The significantly higher concentration of heavy metal poses a potential health risk to the consumer and affects the quality of the food.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Consumers’ behavior in conversational commerce marketing based on messenger chatbots [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The increasing penetration of smartphones and the Internet in developing countries caused the rise of e-retail. Conversational commerce is highly increasing via interaction through messengers. To extract the benefits of both trends, companies have adopted messenger chatbots. These chatbots use Artificial intelligence and natural language processing to give live responses to the customer and assist online shopping on the messenger interface. This research aims to discover the factors that affect the use of messenger chatbots and their influence on attitude and behavior intention. Methods: The research methodology includes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the variables of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, consumer trust, and anthropomorphism. The authors used an online survey for collecting the responses from 192 respondents and analyzed structural equation modelling. Results: Customer trust has shown the most decisive influence on customer attitude followed by Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use. Also, the use of chatbots to make online shopping faster significantly affects the use of messenger chatbots for online shopping in the future. The authors explore various factors resulting in consumers’ favor of accepting chatbots as an interface for m-commerce. Conclusions: The findings indicate that organizations should design strategies to improve interaction with the customer by developing messenger chatbots for more trusting conversations. Further research could include a theoretical digital marketing approach to conversational commerce based on anthropomorphic digital technologies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling cell biological features of meiotic chromosome pairing to study interlock resolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik J. Navarro, Wallace F. Marshall, Jennifer C. Fung</p>

During meiosis, homologous chromosomes become associated side by side in a process known as homologous chromosome pairing. Pairing requires long range chromosome motion through a nucleus that is full of other chromosomes. It remains unclear how the cell manages to align each pair of chromosomes quickly while mitigating and resolving interlocks. Here, we use a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to investigate how specific features of meiosis, including motor-driven telomere motion, nuclear envelope interactions, and increased nuclear size, affect the rate of pairing and the mitigation/resolution of interlocks. By creating in silico versions of three yeast strains and comparing the results of our model to experimental data, we find that a more distributed placement of pairing sites along the chromosome is necessary to replicate experimental findings. Active motion of the telomeric ends speeds up pairing only if binding sites are spread along the chromosome length. Adding a meiotic bouquet significantly speeds up pairing but does not significantly change the number of interlocks. An increase in nuclear size slows down pairing while greatly reducing the number of interlocks. Interestingly, active forces increase the number of interlocks, which raises the question: How do these interlocks resolve? Our model gives us detailed movies of interlock resolution events which we then analyze to build a step-by-step recipe for interlock resolution. In our model, interlocks must first translocate to the ends, where they are held in a quasi-stable state by a large number of paired sites on one side. To completely resolve an interlock, the telomeres of the involved chromosomes must come in close proximity so that the cooperativity of pairing coupled with random motion causes the telomeres to unwind. Together our results indicate that computational modeling of homolog pairing provides insight into the specific cell biological changes that occur during meiosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Two types of critical cell density for mechanical elimination of abnormal cell clusters from epithelial tissue</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sang-Woo Lee, Yoshihiro Morishita</p>

Recent technological advances in high-resolution imaging and artificial modulation of genetic functions at different times and regions have enabled direct observations of the formation and elimination of abnormal cell populations. A recent trend in cell competition research is the incorporation of cell mechanics. In different tissues and species, abnormal cells developing in epithelial tissues are mechanically eliminated by cell contraction via actomyosin accumulation at the interface between normal and abnormal cells. This mechanical cell elimination process has attracted attention as a potential universal defense mechanism. Here, we theoretically examined the conditions for mechanical elimination of growing abnormal cell populations. Simulations and mathematical analyses using a vertex dynamics model revealed two types of critical cell density associated with mechanical elimination of abnormal cell clusters. One is a subtype of homeostatic density, in which the frequencies of spontaneous mechanical cell elimination and proliferation are balanced, even if no explicit dependence of proliferation or apoptosis on the cell density is assumed. This density is related to the mechanical stability of a single cell. The other is density related to mechanical stability as a cell population under external pressure. Both density types are determined by tissue mechanical properties. In solid tissues, the former type is reached first as the intensity of interfacial contraction increases, and it functions as a critical density. On the other hand, the latter type becomes critical when tissues are highly fluid. The derived analytical solution explicitly reveals the dependence of critical contractile force and density on different parameters. We also found a negative correlation between the proliferation rate of abnormal cells and the likelihood of the abnormal cell population expanding by escaping elimination. This is counterintuitive because in the context of cell competition, fast-growing cell populations generally win. These findings provide new insight into, and interpretation of, the results from experimental studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discrete modeling for integration and analysis of large-scale signaling networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pierre Vignet, Jean Coquet, Sébastien Auber, Matéo Boudet, Anne Siegel, Nathalie Théret</p>

Most biological processes are orchestrated by large-scale molecular networks which are described in large-scale model repositories and whose dynamics are extremely complex. An observed phenotype is a state of this system that results from control mechanisms whose identification is key to its understanding. The Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) format is widely used to standardize the biological information relative to regulatory processes. However, few modeling approaches developed so far enable for computing the events that control a phenotype in large-scale networks.
Here we developed an integrated approach to build large-scale dynamic networks from BioPAX knowledge databases in order to analyse trajectories and to identify sets of biological entities that control a phenotype. The Cadbiom approach relies on the guarded transitions formalism, a discrete modeling approach which models a system dynamics by taking into account competition and cooperation events in chains of reactions. The method can be applied to every BioPAX (large-scale) model thanks to a specific package which automatically generates Cadbiom models from BioPAX files.
The Cadbiom framework was applied to the BioPAX version of two resources (PID, KEGG) of the Pathway Commons database and to the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN). As a case-study, it was used to characterize sets of biological entities implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our results highlight the similarities between the PID and ACSN resources in terms of biological content, and underline the heterogeneity of usage of the BioPAX semantics limiting the fusion of models that require curation. Causality analyses demonstrate the smart complementarity of the databases in terms of combinatorics of controllers that explain a phenotype. From a biological perspective, our results show the specificity of controllers for epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes that are consistent with the literature and identify a novel signature for intermediate states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mechanism for punctuating equilibria during mammalian vocal development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thiago T. Varella, Yisi Zhang, Daniel Y. Takahashi, Asif A. Ghazanfar</p>

Evolution and development are typically characterized as the outcomes of gradual changes, but sometimes such changes are abrupt: States of equilibrium can be punctuated by sudden change. Here, we studied the early vocal development of three different mammals: common marmoset monkeys, Egyptian fruit bats, and humans. Consistent with the notion of punctuated equilibria, we found that all three species undergo at least one sudden transition in the acoustics of their developing vocalizations. To understand the mechanism, we modeled different developmental landscapes. We found that the transition was best described as a shift in the balance of two vocalization landscapes. We show that the natural dynamics of these two landscapes are consistent with the dynamics of energy expenditure and information transmission. By using them as constraints for each species, we predicted the differences in transition timing from immature to mature vocalizations. Using marmoset monkeys, we were able to manipulate both infant energy expenditure (vocalizing in an environment with lighter air) and information transmission (closed-loop contingent parental vocal playback). These experiments support the importance of energy and information in leading to punctuated equilibrium states of vocal development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Design and execution of a verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification plan for a numerical model of left ventricular flow after LVAD implantation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alfonso Santiago, Constantine Butakoff, Beatriz Eguzkitza, Richard A. Gray, Karen May-Newman, Pras Pathmanathan, Vi Vu, Mariano Vázquez</p>
Background <p>Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are implantable pumps that act as a life support therapy for patients with severe heart failure. Despite improving the survival rate, LVAD therapy can carry major complications. Particularly, the flow distortion introduced by the LVAD in the left ventricle (LV) may induce thrombus formation. While previous works have used numerical models to study the impact of multiple variables in the intra-LV stagnation regions, a comprehensive validation analysis has never been executed. The main goal of this work is to present a model of the LV-LVAD system and to design and follow a verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) plan based on the ASME V&V40 and V&V20 standards to ensure credible predictions.</p> Methods <p>The experiment used to validate the simulation is the SDSU cardiac simulator, a bench mock-up of the cardiovascular system that allows mimicking multiple operation conditions for the heart-LVAD system. The numerical model is based on Alya, the BSC’s in-house platform for numerical modelling. Alya solves the Navier-Stokes equation with an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation in a deformable ventricle and includes pressure-driven valves, a 0D Windkessel model for the arterial output and a LVAD boundary condition modeled through a dynamic pressure-flow performance curve. The designed VVUQ plan involves: <i>(a)</i> a risk analysis and the associated credibility goals; <i>(b)</i> a verification stage to ensure correctness in the numerical solution procedure; <i>(c)</i> a sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the inputs on the four quantities of interest (QoIs) (average aortic root flow Q A o a v g, maximum aortic root flow Q A o m a x, average LVAD flow Q V A D a v g, and maximum LVAD flow Q V A D m a x); <i>(d)</i> an uncertainty quantification using six validation experiments that include extreme operating conditions.</p> Results <p>Numerical code verification tests ensured correctness of the solution procedure and numerical calculation verification showed a grid convergence index (GCI)<sup>95%</sup> <3.3%. The total Sobol indices obtained during the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ejection fraction, the heart rate, and the pump performance curve coefficients are the most impactful inputs for the analysed QoIs. The Minkowski norm is used as validation metric for the uncertainty quantification. It shows that the midpoint cases have more accurate results when compared to the extreme cases. The total computational cost of the simulations was above 100 [core-years] executed in around three weeks time span in Marenostrum IV supercomputer.</p> Conclusions <p>This work details a novel numerical model for the LV-LVAD system, that is supported by the design and execution of a VVUQ plan created following recognised international standards. We present a methodology demonstrating that stringent VVUQ according to ASME standards is feasible but computationally expensive.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">HiCImpute: A Bayesian hierarchical model for identifying structural zeros and enhancing single cell Hi-C data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qing Xie, Chenggong Han, Victor Jin, Shili Lin</p>

Single cell Hi-C techniques enable one to study cell to cell variability in chromatin interactions. However, single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data suffer severely from sparsity, that is, the existence of excess zeros due to insufficient sequencing depth. Complicating the matter further is the fact that not all zeros are created equal: some are due to loci truly not interacting because of the underlying biological mechanism (structural zeros); others are indeed due to insufficient sequencing depth (sampling zeros or dropouts), especially for loci that interact infrequently. Differentiating between structural zeros and dropouts is important since correct inference would improve downstream analyses such as clustering and discovery of subtypes. Nevertheless, distinguishing between these two types of zeros has received little attention in the single cell Hi-C literature, where the issue of sparsity has been addressed mainly as a data quality improvement problem. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose HiCImpute, a Bayesian hierarchical model that goes beyond data quality improvement by also identifying observed zeros that are in fact structural zeros. HiCImpute takes spatial dependencies of scHi-C 2D data structure into account while also borrowing information from similar single cells and bulk data, when such are available. Through an extensive set of analyses of synthetic and real data, we demonstrate the ability of HiCImpute for identifying structural zeros with high sensitivity, and for accurate imputation of dropout values. Downstream analyses using data improved from HiCImpute yielded much more accurate clustering of cell types compared to using observed data or data improved by several comparison methods. Most significantly, HiCImpute-improved data have led to the identification of subtypes within each of the excitatory neuronal cells of L4 and L5 in the prefrontal cortex.

We introduce cytoNet, a cloud-based tool to characterize cell populations from microscopy images. cytoNet quantifies spatial topology and functional relationships in cell communities using principles of network science. Capturing multicellular dynamics through graph features, cytoNet also evaluates the effect of cell-cell interactions on individual cell phenotypes. We demonstrate cytoNet’s capabilities in four case studies: 1) characterizing the temporal dynamics of neural progenitor cell communities during neural differentiation, 2) identifying communities of pain-sensing neurons <i>in vivo</i>, 3) capturing the effect of cell community on endothelial cell morphology, and 4) investigating the effect of laminin α4 on perivascular niches in adipose tissue. The analytical framework introduced here can be used to study the dynamics of complex cell communities in a quantitative manner, leading to a deeper understanding of environmental effects on cellular behavior. The versatile, cloud-based format of cytoNet makes the image analysis framework accessible to researchers across domains.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational simulations and Ca2+ imaging reveal that slow synaptic depolarizations (slow EPSPs) inhibit fast EPSP evoked action potentials for most of their time course in enteric neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Parvin Zarei Eskikand, Katerina Koussoulas, Rachel M. Gwynne, Joel C. Bornstein</p>

Transmission between neurons in the extensive enteric neural networks of the gut involves synaptic potentials with vastly different time courses and underlying conductances. Most enteric neurons exhibit fast excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) lasting 20–50 ms, but many also exhibit slow EPSPs that last up to 100 s. When large enough, slow EPSPs excite action potentials at the start of the slow depolarization, but how they affect action potentials evoked by fast EPSPs is unknown. Furthermore, two other sources of synaptic depolarization probably occur in enteric circuits, activated via GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors; how these interact with other synaptic depolarizations is also unclear. We built a compartmental model of enteric neurons incorporating realistic voltage-dependent ion channels, then simulated fast EPSPs, slow EPSPs and GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>C</sub> ligand-gated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels to explore these interactions. Model predictions were tested by imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in myenteric neurons ex vivo as an indicator of their activity during synaptic interactions. The model could mimic firing of myenteric neurons in mouse colon evoked by depolarizing current during intracellular recording and the fast and slow EPSPs in these neurons. Subthreshold fast EPSPs evoked spikes during the rising phase of a slow EPSP, but suprathreshold fast EPSPs could not evoke spikes later in a slow EPSP. This predicted inhibition was confirmed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in which stimuli that evoke slow EPSPs suppressed activity evoked by fast EPSPs in many myenteric neurons. The model also predicted that synchronous activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and fast EPSPs potentiated firing evoked by the latter, while synchronous activation of GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors with fast EPSPs, potentiated firing and then suppressed it. The results reveal that so-called slow EPSPs have a biphasic effect being likely to suppress fast EPSP evoked firing over very long periods, perhaps accounting for prolonged quiescent periods seen in enteric motor patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Differential methods for assessing sensitivity in biological models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rachel Mester, Alfonso Landeros, Chris Rackauckas, Kenneth Lange</p>

Differential sensitivity analysis is indispensable in fitting parameters, understanding uncertainty, and forecasting the results of both thought and lab experiments. Although there are many methods currently available for performing differential sensitivity analysis of biological models, it can be difficult to determine which method is best suited for a particular model. In this paper, we explain a variety of differential sensitivity methods and assess their value in some typical biological models. First, we explain the mathematical basis for three numerical methods: adjoint sensitivity analysis, complex perturbation sensitivity analysis, and forward mode sensitivity analysis. We then carry out four instructive case studies. (a) The CARRGO model for tumor-immune interaction highlights the additional information that differential sensitivity analysis provides beyond traditional naive sensitivity methods, (b) the deterministic SIR model demonstrates the value of using second-order sensitivity in refining model predictions, (c) the stochastic SIR model shows how differential sensitivity can be attacked in stochastic modeling, and (d) a discrete birth-death-migration model illustrates how the complex perturbation method of differential sensitivity can be generalized to a broader range of biological models. Finally, we compare the speed, accuracy, and ease of use of these methods. We find that forward mode automatic differentiation has the quickest computational time, while the complex perturbation method is the simplest to implement and the most generalizable.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Context-dependent reversal of odorant preference is driven by inversion of the response in a single sensory neuron type</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Munzareen Khan, Anna H. Hartmann, Michael P. O’Donnell, Madeline Piccione, Anjali Pandey, Pin-Hao Chao, Noelle D. Dwyer, Cornelia I. Bargmann, Piali Sengupta</p>

The valence and salience of individual odorants are modulated by an animal’s innate preferences, learned associations, and internal state, as well as by the context of odorant presentation. The mechanisms underlying context-dependent flexibility in odor valence are not fully understood. Here, we show that the behavioral response of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to bacterially produced medium-chain alcohols switches from attraction to avoidance when presented in the background of a subset of additional attractive chemicals. This context-dependent reversal of odorant preference is driven by cell-autonomous inversion of the response to these alcohols in the single AWC olfactory neuron pair. We find that while medium-chain alcohols inhibit the AWC olfactory neurons to drive attraction, these alcohols instead activate AWC to promote avoidance when presented in the background of a second AWC-sensed odorant. We show that these opposing responses are driven via engagement of distinct odorant-directed signal transduction pathways within AWC. Our results indicate that context-dependent recruitment of alternative intracellular signaling pathways within a single sensory neuron type conveys opposite hedonic valences, thereby providing a robust mechanism for odorant encoding and discrimination at the periphery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">eXNVerify: coverage analysis for long and short-read sequencing data in clinical context [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Accurate identification of genetic variants to a large extent is based on the type of experimental technology, quality of the material and coverage of sequencing data obtained. The latter, coverage quality, highly influences variant calling accuracy and final diagnosis. Our motivation was to create a tool that will evaluate genome coverage and accelerate the introduction of long-read sequencing to medical diagnostics and clinical practice. The implementation was guided by the ease of use of the tool by users who are not proficient in using complex software. A Docker container is perfect for this purpose. Using Docker’s advantages (flexibility, mobility and ease of use of the proposed tools), we created eXNVerify. This is a tool for inspection of clinical data in the context of pathogenic variants search. The tool calculates clinical depth coverage (CDC) – a measure of coverage which we introduce to evaluate loci with pathogenic germline and somatic variants reported in ClinVar. The tool additionally provides visualization options for user-defined genes of interest. Finally, we present examples of BRCA1, TP53, CFTR application and results of a test conducted in the Extensive Sequence Dataset of Gold-Standard Samples for Benchmarking and Development. eXNVerify improves the diagnostic process of patients related to important genetic diseases and facilitates the assessment of genetic samples by diagnosticians. The use of Docker allows to run an analysis package and does not require any special technical preparation. Detailed examples are included in the GitHub project documentation  and the package can be downloaded directly from DockerHub using the command: docker pull porebskis/exnverify:1.0.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of pathogenic mutations of the GLUT1 glucose transporter on solute carrier dynamics using ComDYN enhanced sampling [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The solute carrier (SLC) family of membrane proteins is a large class of transporters for many small molecules that are vital for cellular function. Several pathogenic mutations are reported in the glucose transporter subfamily SLC2, causing Glut1-deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS1, GLUT1DS2), epilepsy (EIG2) and cryohydrocytosis with neurological defects (Dystonia-9). Understanding the link between these mutations and transporter dynamics is crucial to elucidate their role in the dysfunction of the underlying transport mechanism, which we investigate using molecular dynamics simulations. Methods: We studied pathogenic and non-pathogenic mutations, using a newly developed coarse-grained simulation approach ‘ComDYN’, which captures the ‘COMmon constraints DYNamics’ between both states of the solute carrier protein. To guarantee the sampling of large conformational changes, we only include common constraints of the elastic network introduced upon coarse-graining, which showed similar reference distances between both conformational states (≤1 Å difference). Results: ComDYN is computationally efficient and sufficiently sensitive to capture effects of different mutations. Our results clearly indicate that the pathogenic mutation in GLUT1, G91D, situated at the highly conserved RXGRR motif between helices 2 and 3, has a strong impact on transporter function, as it blocks the protein from sampling both conformational states. In comparison, predictions from SIFT and PolyPhen only provided an impression of the impact upon mutation in the highly conserved RXGRR motifs, but yielded no clear differentiation between pathogenic and non-pathogenic mutations.  Conclusions: Using our approach, we can explain the pathogenicity of the mutation G91D and some of the effects of other known pathogenic mutations, when we observe the configurations of the transmembrane helices, suggesting that their relative position is crucial for the correct functioning of the GLUT1 protein. To fully understand the impact of other mutations in the future, it is necessary to consider the effect of ligands, e.g., glucose, within the transport mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reporting characteristics of allergic rhinitis trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and in publications: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on Allergic rhinitis (AR) should be complete and consistent throughout multiple sources to ensure accurate evidence-based information. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are discrepancies in the reported data from AR trials. Methods: This cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzed completed RCTs on AR registered in ClinicalTrials.gov and last updated between 9/27/2009 and 10/4/2019 with results and corresponding publications. Completeness, informativeness and major changes to World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set items as well as completeness of results data in ClinicalTrials.gov and corresponding publications were analyzed. Results: Omitted items were present in 35 (46.1%) of the 76 trials at initial registration, 15 (19.7%) at last registration, and in 22 (56.4%) of the 39 publications. All 76 trials between first and last registration and all 39 publications had major changes in registration items. Uninformative reporting of analyzed items were present both in ClinicalTrials.gov and publications. Completeness of results in ClinicalTrials.gov was satisfactory. In contrast, publications reported fewer adverse events. Conclusions: Discrepancies in data elements of AR trials are common both in ClinicalTrials.gov and subsequent publications. To ensure transparent data reporting from AR trials, multiple stakeholders should control the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of AR trial data to notice discrepancies before publication.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Hydranencephaly in a female newborn with congenital cytomegalovirus infection [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hydranencephaly is a congenital abnormality of the central nervous system characterized by massive hemispheric necrosis and ventricular dilatation with most of the cerebral hemispheres being replaced by membranous sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can be one of the causes of hydranencephaly. The choice of therapy for hydranencephaly is a challenge because of poor prognosis, but now neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation may give new hope. Case report: We report a case of a female newborn born at term by cesarean section from a gravida 5, para 3, abortus 1 (G5P3A1) mother with suspected hydrocephalus. Head circumference was 35 cm at birth. The baby was born crying immediately, looked active, and did not appear cyanotic, but on the second day, the baby looked less active, moaned, showed acral cyanosis, and had a large fontanelle that was dilated and soft. Signs of hydrocephalus such as Macewen’s sign, setting sun phenomenon, and transillumination were found to be positive. Echocardiographic examination showed floppy interatrial septum and mild mitral regurgitation. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head showed hydranencephaly. The toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, and herpes simplex virus (TORCH) screening showed positive anti-CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG). The baby underwent a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt procedure with a head circumference of 36 cm before surgery. VP shunt was performed with an opening pressure of 15 cmH2O. Conclusions: After the VP shunt procedure, the baby's general condition improved with the head circumference within normal limits. The baby was discharged from the hospital after 16 days of treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The demographic effects and public health infrastructure dearth of COVID-19 in Ghana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over the last two years, the world has been experiencing a worldwide health catastrophe. The Corona Virus (COVID-19) struck at the heart of societies and is a major health-care infrastructure problem. Infrastructure has been characterised as the basic requirement for carrying out productive and relevant public health actions. Mortality has direct and indirect relationship, with the former causing short and long-term mortality, resulting in a short life expectancy. Reduced accessibility and quality of health care, isolation, loneliness, and poverty were some of the indirect repercussions. The outcomes were sad and deeply felt when the two collided with ageing and persons with co-morbidities. The fertility effect of COVID-19 in the short-term on contraception presented itself in increased difficulties in accessing services and disruptions in the supply chain. Migration was mainly affected due to travel bans and restriction of movements through stay-at-home instructions. Methods: This paper uses the qualitative paradigm of research that used corpus construction in the selection of material to represent a whole and this make it functionally equivalent to sampling but structurally different. It used secondary data to ascertain the demographic effects and the extent of health infrastructure deficit and ingenious ways to curb the challenges as exposed by the COVID -19. Results: The study underscores how demographic factors can be disrupted by pandemics to bring about high rates of mortality. Global health function is under-funded and under-produced, as a study by the World Health Organization suggests. Conclusions:  The study brings to bear that anthropogenic activities, air greenhouse gases, lifespan and hospital beds are key drivers of COVID-19 growth. The path forward to mitigate such pandemics is international harmony and alliances in the distribution of vaccines, strengthening of international health systems ability to hold back major infectious disease, addressing service quality and providing key financial injection.

<p>We performed intracerebroventricular administration of a new potent tricyclo-DNA antisense oligonucleotide (tcDNA-ASO) containing a full phosphodiester backbone conjugated to a palmitic acid moiety (tcDNA-ASO), designed to skip the mutated exon 23 of <i>mdx</i> mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We first show that the tcDNA-ASO rescues expression of brain dystrophin to 10–30% of wild-type levels and significantly reduces the abnormal unconditioned fear responses in <i>mdx</i> mice in a dose-dependent manner, 5 weeks post-injection. Exon skipping efficiency, ASO biodistribution, protein restoration and effect on the fear response were optimal with a dose of 400 μg at 6–7 weeks post-injection, with synaptic-like expression in brain tissues such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Furthermore, this dose of tcDNA-ASO restored long-term memory retention of <i>mdx</i> mice in an object recognition task, but only had minor effects on fear conditioning.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest for the first time that postnatal re-expression of brain dystrophin could reverse or at least alleviate some cognitive deficits associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, particularly critically ill patients. It poses a public health challenge in resource-constrained settings due to high administrative costs. AKI is commonly misdiagnosed due to its painless onset and late disruption of serum creatinine, which is the gold standard biomarker for AKI diagnosis. There is increasing research into the use of early biomarkers and the development of predictive models for early AKI diagnosis using clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. This field note provides insight into the challenges of using available AKI prediction models in resource-constrained environments, as well as perspectives that practitioners in these settings may find useful

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the past few decades, several studies have focused on potential sex-related differences in the trajectories of language development and functioning. From a behavioral point of view, the available literature shows controversial results: differences between males and females in language production tasks may not always be detectable and, even when they are, are potentially biased by sociological and educational confounding factors. The problem regarding potential sex-related differences in language production has also been investigated at the neural level, again with controversial results. The current minireview focuses on studies assessing sex-related differences in the neural networks of language production. After providing a theoretical framework of language production, it is shown that the few available investigations have provided mixed results. The major reasons for discrepant findings are discussed with theoretical and methodological implications for future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">GluN3A excitatory glycine receptors control adult cortical and amygdalar circuits</a></h4>

              
                Bossi et al. show that GluN3A subunits control the activity of selective neuronal populations in the adult mouse brain via the formation of excitatory glycine GluN1/GluN3A receptors (eGlyRs). Functional analysis reveals that eGlyRs regulate the recruitment of somatostatin-positive interneurons in the neocortex and participate in the stability of fear memories in the BLA.

                Paquelet et al. use miniaturized microscopy to visualize the activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of mice during emotional behaviors. Their results show that dorsal raphe serotonin neurons are modulated during emotionally salient behaviors using highly correlated ensembles with mixed selectivity and biases in downstream connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Dynamic task-belief is an integral part of decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Xue, Kramer, and Cohen studied decision-making when, as in real life, what needs to be decided is uncertain and changing. Interestingly, subjective beliefs about the task have inextricable neuronal links to perceptual decision-making. This suggests that task-switching and perceptual decision-making belong to a very integrated system in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RNA-binding proteins direct myogenic cell fate decisions</a></h4>

              
                RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), essential for skeletal muscle regeneration, cause muscle degeneration and neuromuscular disease when mutated. Why mutations in these ubiquitously expressed RBPs orchestrate complex tissue regeneration and direct cell fate decisions in skeletal muscle remains poorly understood. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of regenerating <i>Mus musculus</i> skeletal muscle reveals that RBP expression, including the expression of many neuromuscular disease-associated RBPs, is temporally regulated in skeletal muscle stem cells and correlates with specific stages of myogenic differentiation. By combining machine learning with RBP engagement scoring, we discovered that the neuromuscular disease-associated RBP Hnrnpa2b1 is a differentiation-specifying regulator of myogenesis that controls myogenic cell fate transitions during terminal differentiation in mice. The timing of RBP expression specifies cell fate transitions by providing post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNAs that coordinate stem cell fate decisions during tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systematic lncRNA mapping to genome-wide co-essential modules uncovers cancer dependency on uncharacterized lncRNAs</a></h4>

              
                Quantification of gene dependency across hundreds of cell lines using genome-scale CRISPR screens has revealed co-essential pathways/modules and critical functions of uncharacterized genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, robust CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens are lacking for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are key regulators of many cellular processes, leaving many essential lncRNAs unidentified and uninvestigated. Integrating copy number, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data of &gt;800 cancer cell lines with CRISPR-derived co-essential pathways, our method recapitulates known essential lncRNAs and predicts proliferation/growth dependency of 289 poorly characterized lncRNAs. Analyzing lncRNA dependencies across 10 cancer types and their expression alteration by diverse growth inhibitors across cell types, we prioritize 30 high-confidence pan-cancer proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs. Further evaluating two previously uncharacterized top <i>p</i>roliferation-<i>s</i>uppressive <i>l</i>nc<i>R</i>NAs (<i>PSLR</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>PSLR</i>-<i>2</i>) showed they are transcriptionally regulated by p53, induced by multiple cancer treatments, and significantly correlate to increased cancer patient survival. These lncRNAs modulate G2 cell cycle-regulating genes within the FOXM1 transcriptional network, inducing a G2 arrest and inhibiting proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, our results serve as a powerful resource for exploring lncRNA-mediated regulation of cellular fitness in cancer, circumventing current limitations in lncRNA research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative prediction of variant effects on alternative splicing in MAPT using endogenous pre-messenger RNA structure probing</a></h4>

              
                Splicing is highly regulated and is modulated by numerous factors. Quantitative predictions for how a mutation will affect precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) structure and downstream function is particularly challenging. Here we use a novel chemical probing strategy to visualize endogenous precursor and mature <i>MAPT</i> mRNA structures in cells. We used these data to estimate Boltzmann suboptimal structural ensembles, which were then analyzed to predict consequences of mutations on precursor mRNA structure. Further analysis of recent cryo-EM structures of the spliceosome at different stages of the splicing cycle revealed that the footprint of the B<sup>act</sup> complex with precursor mRNA best predicted alternative splicing outcomes for exon 10 inclusion of the alternatively spliced <i>MAPT</i> gene, achieving 74% accuracy. We further developed a b-regression weighting framework that incorporates splice site strength, RNA structure, and exonic/intronic splicing regulatory elements capable of predicting, with 90% accuracy, the effects of 47 known and six newly discovered mutations on inclusion of exon 10 of <i>MAPT</i>. This combined experimental and computational framework represents a path forward for accurate prediction of splicing-related disease-causing variants.

                A role for macronutrient metabolism in learning and memory is supported by numerous epidemiological studies. The Ppm1k gene encodes the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) phosphatase that promotes the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Here we show that nervous system deletion of Ppm1k in mice increases BCAA levels in brain tissue but not in plasma. These mice have significant impairments in working memory accompanied by a robust accumulation of DCX+/NeuroD1+ immature neurons within the dentate gyrus granule cell layer. Through single cell RNA sequencing and pathway analysis we identified substantial increases in transit-amplifying cells and immature neurons along with activated hedgehog signaling in Ppm1k deficient primary neural stem cells (NSCs). Inhibition of mTOR signaling reversed the effects of Ppm1k deletion on neuronal progenitor gene activation in primary NSCs. Together our findings uncover a new molecular link between BCAA metabolism, hippocampal neurogenesis, and cognitive performance.

                The spiking activity of mitral cells (MC) in the olfactory bulb is a key attribute in olfactory sensory information processing to downstream cortical areas. A more detailed understanding of the modulation of MC spike statistics could shed light on mechanistic studies of olfactory bulb circuits, and olfactory coding. We study the spike response of a recently developed single-compartment biophysical MC model containing 7 known ionic currents and calcium dynamics subject to constant current input with background white noise. We observe rich spiking dynamics even with constant current input, including multi-modal peaks in the interspike interval distribution (ISI). Although weak to moderate background noise for a fixed current input does not change the firing rate much, the spike dynamics can change dramatically, exhibiting non-monotonic spike variability not commonly observed in standard neuron models. We explain these dynamics with a phenomenological model of the ISI probability density function. Our study clarifies some of the complexities of MC spiking dynamics.

                Although we perceive the world in a continuous manner, our experience is partitioned into discrete events. However, to make sense of these events, they must be stitched together into an overarching narrative, a model of unfolding events. It has been proposed that such a stitching process happens in offline neural reactivations when rodents build models of spatial environments. Here we show that, whilst understanding a natural narrative, humans reactivate neural representations of past events. Similar to offline replay, these reactivations occur in hippocampus and default mode network, where reactivations are selective to relevant past events. However, these reactivations occur, not during prolonged offline periods, but at the boundaries between ongoing narrative events. These results, replicated across two datasets, suggest reactivations as a candidate mechanism for binding temporally distant information into a coherent understanding of ongoing experience.

                Synaptic spinules are thin, finger-like projections from one neuron that become fully embedded within the presynaptic or postsynaptic compartments of another neuron. While spinules are a conserved feature of synapses across the animal kingdom, their specific function(s) remain unknown. Recent focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) image volume analyses have demonstrated that spinules are embedded within ~ 25% of excitatory boutons in mammalian primary visual cortex, yet the diversity of spinule sizes, origins, and ultrastructural relationship to their boutons remained unclear. To begin to uncover the function of synaptic spinules, we sought to determine the abundance, origins, and 3D ultrastructure of spinules embedded within excitatory presynaptic spinule-bearing boutons (SBBs) in mammalian CA1 hippocampus and compare these boutons with presynaptic boutons bereft of spinules (non-SBBs). Accordingly, we performed a comprehensive 3D analysis of every excitatory presynaptic bouton, their embedded synaptic spinules, and postsynaptic densities, within a 5 nm isotropic FIB-SEM image volume from CA1 hippocampus of an adult male rat. Surprisingly, we found that ~74% of excitatory presynaptic boutons in this volume contained at least one spinule, suggesting that they are fundamental components of excitatory synapses in CA1. In addition, we found that SBBs are 2.5-times larger and have 60% larger PSDs than non-SBBs. Moreover, synaptic spinules within SBBs are clearly differentiated into two groups: small clathrin-coated spinules, and 29-times larger spinules without clathrin. Together, these findings suggest that the presence of a spinule is a marker for stronger and more stable presynaptic boutons in CA1, and that synaptic spinules serve at least two separable and distinct functions.

                All insects studied to date possess a centrally located group of neuropils, known collectively as the central complex, that has been implicated in sensory integration and motor action selection. Among the functions prescribed to the central complex, none is perhaps as intriguing as its role in orientation and navigation. Neurobiological correlates of both current and desired headings have been described in insect CXs. Despite the diversity of arthropods, understanding of the CX as a navigational center originates entirely from terrestrial insects. Stomatopod crustaceans, commonly referred to as mantis shrimps, form an order of predatory marine crustaceans with intricate and diverse visual systems that maintain the distinction of being the only fully aquatic animal known to utilize the navigational strategy of path integration. They utilize idiothetic, celestial, and landmark cues to orient in the benthos. Here, we investigate the neuroanatomy of adult and developing mantis shrimp central complexes and associated neuropils to begin understanding this brain region in a sensorially and behaviorally complex crustacean.

                Across species, the optokinetic reflex (OKR) stabilizes vision during self-motion. OKR occurs when ON direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (oDSGCs) detect slow, global image motion on the retina. How oDSGC activity is integrated centrally to generate behavior remains unknown. Here, we discover mechanisms that contribute to motion-encoding in vertically-tuned oDSGCs, and leverage these findings to empirically define signal transformation between retinal output and vertical OKR behavior. Specifically, we demonstrate that motion encoding in vertically-tuned oDSGCs is contrast-sensitive and asymmetric for oDSGC types that prefer opposite directions. These phenomena arise from the interplay between spike threshold nonlinearities and differences in synaptic input weights, including shifts in the balance of excitation and inhibition. In behaving mice, these neurophysiological observations, along with a central subtraction of oDSGC outputs, accurately predict the direction and magnitude of vertical OKR across stimulus conditions. Thus, asymmetric synaptic input across competing sensory input channels can critically shape behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mutation of the Drosophila serotonin transporter dSERT disrupts courtship and feeding and increases both daytime and nighttime sleep</a></h4>

              
                The Serotonin Transporter (SERT) regulates extracellular serotonin levels and is the target of most current drugs used to treat depression. The mechanisms by which inhibition of SERT activity influences behavior are poorly understood. To address this question in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we developed new loss of function mutations in Drosophila SERT (dSERT). Previous studies in both flies and mammals have implicated serotonin as an important neuromodulator of sleep, and our newly generated dSERT mutants show an increase in total sleep and altered sleep architecture. Differences in daytime vs. nighttime sleep architecture as well as genetic rescue experiments unexpectedly suggest that distinct serotonergic circuits may modulate daytime versus nighttime sleep. dSERT mutants also show defects in copulation and food intake, akin to the clinical side effects of SSRIs. Starvation did not overcome the sleep drive in the mutants. Additionally in males, but not female dSERT mutants, the drive to mate also failed to overcome sleep drive. dSERT may be used to further explore the mechanisms by which serotonin regulates sleep and its interplay with other complex behaviors.

                Traditionally, when conducting voxel- or vertex-wise analyses in neuroimaging studies, it seemed imperative that brain data are convoluted with a Gaussian kernel - a procedure known as "spatial smoothing". However, we argue that smoothing may be omitted entirely for the benefit of a dramatically enhanced regional specificity under certain conditions. We demonstrate the suitability of this omission by combining high-dimensional warping and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) in a sample of 754 brains. Our findings suggest that without the traditional smoothing step it is possible to dissociate neighboring brain areas with an accuracy of a single voxel, altogether taking the field of human brain mapping to a new level. Nevertheless, classic analyses based on smoothed data will continue to provide important insights, especially if parametric tests are required, if image data cannot be precisely aligned across individuals or time points, and/or if anticipated effect sizes are only small.

                We report the distinct contribution of multiple memory systems to retrieval of the temporal order of events. The neural dynamics related to retrieval of movie scenes revealed that recalling the temporal order of close events elevates hippocampal theta power, like that observed for recalling close spatial relationships. In contrast, recalling far events elevates beta power in the orbitofrontal cortex, reflecting recall based on the overall movie structure.

                All visual information in mammals is encoded in the aggregate pattern of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) firing. How this information is decoded to yield percepts remains incompletely understood. We have trained convolutional neural networks with multielectrode array-recorded murine RGC responses to projected images. The trained model accurately reconstructed novel facial images solely from RGC firing data. In this model, subpopulations of cells with faster firing rates are largely sufficient for accurate reconstruction, and ON- and OFF- cells contribute complementary and overlapping information to image reconstruction. Information content for reconstruction correlates with overall firing rate, and locality of information contributing to reconstruction varies substantially across the image and retina. This model demonstrates that artificial neural networks are capable of learning multicellular sensory neural encoding, and provides a viable model for understanding visual information encoding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning better by learning together: dyadic visual perceptual learning on orientation discrimination</a></h4>

              
                The belief that learning can be modulated by social context is mainly supported by high-level value-based learning studies. However, whether social context can even modulate low-level learning such as visual perceptual learning (VPL) is still unknown. Unlike traditional VPL studies in which participants were trained singly, here we developed a novel dyadic VPL paradigm in which paired participants were trained with the same orientation discrimination task and they could monitor each other's performance. We found that the social context (i.e., dyadic training) led to a greater behavioral performance improvement and a faster learning speed, compared with the single training. Interestingly, the facilitating effects could be modulated by the performance difference between paired participants. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results showed that, compared with the single training, social cognition areas including bilateral parietal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex displayed a different spatial activity pattern and enhanced functional connectivities to early visual cortex during the dyadic training. Furthermore, the dyadic training resulted in more refined orientation representation in primary visual cortex (V1), which was closely associated with the greater behavioral performance improvement. Taken together, we demonstrate that the social context, learning with a partner, can remarkably augment the plasticity of low-level visual information process by means of reshaping the neural activities in early visual cortex and social cognition areas, as well as their functional interplays.

                Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level. This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia. To address that question, we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and spike timing deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence spike timing to inform the biological data. We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior. This explains how NMDAR synaptic deficits, implicated by genetic evidence as causal in schizophrenia, could prevent the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking in prefrontal local circuits during behavior, potentially disconnecting those circuits via spike-timing dependent mechanisms in the human disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Machine Learning Approach Towards the Differentiation Between Interoceptive and Exteroceptive Attention</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the representation of the body's internal state, plays a central role in emotion, motivation, and wellbeing. Interoceptive attention is qualitatively different from attention to the external senses and may recruit a distinct neural system, but the neural separability of interoceptive and exteroceptive attention is unclear. We used a machine learning approach to classify neural correlates of interoceptive and exteroceptive attention in a randomized control trial of interoceptive training (MABT). Participants in the training and control groups attended fMRI assessment before and after an 8-week intervention period (N = 44 scans). The imaging paradigm manipulated attention targets (breath vs. visual stimulus) and reporting demands (active reporting vs. passive monitoring). Machine learning models achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between interoceptive and exteroceptive attention using both in-sample and more stringent out-of-sample tests. We then explored the potential of these classifiers in "reading out" mental states in a sustained interoceptive attention task. Participants were classified as maintaining an active reporting state for only ~90s of each 3-minute sustained attention period. Within this active period, interoceptive training enhanced participants' ability to sustain interoceptive attention. These findings demonstrate that interoceptive and exteroceptive attention engage reliable and distinct neural networks; machine learning classifiers trained on this distinction show promise for assessing the stability of interoceptive attention, with implications for the future assessment of mental health and treatment response.

                The dopamine system plays a significant role in drug reward and the pathogenesis of addiction. Psychostimulant drugs acutely increase dopamine levels, triggering receptor internalization. In vitro data suggest that dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) recycle, whereas D2 receptors (D2R) degrade in response to activation. Yet, receptor fates in vivo remain unclear. This study bridges in vitro mechanisms and in vivo measurements of stimulant-induced modulation of receptor states using longitudinal multi-modal imaging combined with neuropharmacology. We demonstrate how repeated amphetamine administration differentially modulates D1R vs. D2R signaling in nonhuman primates over 24 hours using simultaneous positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In contrast to predominantly inhibitory D2R signaling due to an initial amphetamine challenge, excitatory D1R functional signaling prevails three hours later, while D2Rs stay internalized. These results demonstrate differential externalization mechanisms of the D1R and D2R in vivo and a shift in receptor subtype activation after a dopamine surge.

                Cephalopods have a remarkable visual system, with a camera-type eye, high acuity vision, and a wide range of sophisticated visual behaviors. However, the cephalopod brain is organized dramatically differently from that of vertebrates, as well as other invertebrates, and little is known regarding the cell types and molecular determinants of their visual system organization beyond neuroanatomical descriptions. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell molecular atlas of the octopus optic lobe, which is the primary visual processing structure in the cephalopod brain. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing with RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization to both identify putative molecular cell types and determine their anatomical and spatial organization within the optic lobe. Our results reveal six major neuronal cell classes identified by neurotransmitter/neuropeptide usage, in addition to non-neuronal and immature neuronal populations. Moreover, we find that additional markers divide these neuronal classes into subtypes with distinct anatomical localizations, revealing cell type diversity and a detailed laminar organization within the optic lobe. We also delineate the immature neurons within this continuously growing tissue into subtypes defined by evolutionarily conserved fate specification genes as well as novel cephalopod- and octopus- specific genes. Together, these findings outline the organizational logic of the octopus visual system, based on functional determinants, laminar identity, and developmental markers/pathways. The resulting atlas presented here delineates the 'parts list' of the neural circuits used for vision in octopus, providing a platform for investigations into the development and function of the octopus visual system as well as the evolution of visual processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Can Deep Learning Provide a Generalizable Model for Dynamic Sound Encoding in Auditory Cortex?</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in machine learning have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can provide powerful and flexible models of neural sensory processing. In the auditory system, the standard linear-nonlinear (LN) model and related variants are unable to account for high-order cortical representations. Thus far, it is unclear what additional insights can be provided by CNNs. CNNs can be difficult to fit with relatively small datasets, such as those available from single neuron recordings. In the current study, we developed a population encoding model: a CNN that simultaneously predicts activity of several hundred neurons recorded during presentation of a large, fixed set of natural sounds. This approach defines a spectro-temporal space that is shared by all neurons in the model and pools statistical power across the neural population. We tested a range of CNN architectures on data from primary and non-primary auditory cortex, varying the number and size of convolutional layers at the input and dense layers at the output. The population models performed consistently better than LN models. Moreover, performance was highly generalizable. The output layer of a model pre-fit using one population of neurons could be fit to novel single units, with performance close to that of neurons in the original fit data. These results indicate that population encoding models capture a general set of computations performed by auditory cortex. In this case, the model itself can be analyzed to provide a general characterization of auditory cortical representation.

                Low-dimensional dynamics and movement-related activity are found throughout the brain. However, primary visual cortex contains high-dimensional sensory representations, raising the question of how low-dimensional dynamics and high-dimensional representations coexist. Here we approached this question by analyzing neuronal activity during slow-wave sleep, which provided reliable estimates of low-dimensional, internally-generated manifold structure. We found that movements and visual scenes were both encoded in the on-manifold subspace, which accounts for more variance than chance during sleep, but visual scenes were also encoded in the off-manifold subspace, which accounts for less variance than chance during sleep. This off-manifold subspace contains sparse activity in the neurons with the strongest low-dimensional modulation by movement, which paradoxically prevents movement-evoked activity from interfering with high-dimensional stimulus representations. These results reveal an unexpected link between low-dimensional dynamics and sparse coding, suggesting that these phenomena play a role in creating and accessing an off-manifold coding space for high- dimensional representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing the forest and the tree: Building representations of both individual and collective dynamics with transformers</a></h4>

              
                Complex time-varying systems are often studied by abstracting away from the dynamics of individual components to build a model of the population-level dynamics from the start. However, when building a population-level description, it can be easy to lose sight of each individual and how each contributes to the larger picture. In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture for learning from time-varying data that build descriptions of both the individual as well as the collective population dynamics. Rather than combining all of our data into our model at the onset, we develop a separable architecture that operates on individual time-series first before passing them forward; this induces a permutation-invariance property and can be used to transfer across systems of different size and order. After demonstrating that our model can be applied to successfully recover complex interactions and dynamics in many-body systems, we apply our approach to populations of neurons in the nervous system. On neural activity datasets, we show that our multi-scale transformer not only yields robust decoding performance, but also provides impressive performance in transfer. Our results show that it is possible to learn from neurons in one animal's brain and transfer the model on neurons in a different animal's brain, with interpretable neuron correspondence across sets and animals. This finding opens up a new path to decode from and represent large collections of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptation shapes local cortical reactivity: from bifurcation diagram and simulations to human physiological and pathological responses</a></h4>

              
                Human studies employing intracerebral and transcranial perturbations suggest that the input-output properties of cortical circuits are dramatically affected during sleep in healthy subjects as well as in awake patients with multifocal and focal brain injury. In all these conditions, cortical circuits react to direct stimulation with an initial activation followed by suppression of activity (Off-period) that disrupts the build-up of sustained causal interactions typically observed in healthy wakefulness. The transition to this stereotypical response is of clinical relevance, being associated with loss of consciousness or loss of function. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation of these findings by means of mean-field theory and simulations of a cortical-like module endowed with activity-dependent adaptation. First, we show that fundamental aspects of the local responses elicited in humans by direct cortical stimulation can be replicated by systematically varying the relationships between adaptation strength and excitation level in the network. Then, we reveal a region in the adaptation-excitation parameter space of key relevance for both physiological and pathological conditions, where spontaneous activity and responses to perturbation diverge in their ability to reveal Off-periods. Finally, we substantiate through simulations of connected cortical-like modules the role of adaptation mechanisms in preventing cortical neurons from engaging in reciprocal causal interactions, as suggested by empirical studies. These modeling results provide a general theoretical framework and a mechanistic interpretation for a body of neurophysiological measurements that bears key relevance for physiological states as well as for the assessment and rehabilitation of brain-injured patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CAT - A Computational Anatomy Toolbox for the Analysis of Structural MRI Data</a></h4>

              
                A large range of sophisticated brain image analysis tools have been developed by the neuroscience community, greatly advancing the field of human brain mapping. Here we introduce the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) - a powerful suite of tools for morphometric analyses with an intuitive graphical user interface, but also usable as a shell script. CAT is suitable for beginners, casual users, experts, and developers alike providing a comprehensive set of analysis options, workflows, and integrated pipelines. The available analysis streams - illustrated on an example dataset - allow for voxel-based, surface-based, as well as region-based morphometric analyses. Importantly, CAT includes various quality control options and covers the entire analysis workflow, from cross-sectional or longitudinal data processing, to the statistical analysis, and visualization of results. The overarching aim of this article is to provide a complete description of CAT, while, at the same time, offering a citable standard reference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stretchable mesh microelectronics for the biointegration and stimulation of neural organoids</a></h4>

              
                Advances in tridimensional (3D) culture approaches have led to the generation of organoids that recapitulate cellular and physiological features of domains of the human nervous system. Although microelectrodes have been developed for long-term electrophysiological interfaces with neural tissue, studies of long-term interfaces between microelectrodes and free-floating organoids remain limited. In this study, we report a stretchable, soft mesh electrode system that establishes an intimate in vitro electrical interface with human neurons in 3D organoids. Our mesh is constructed with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based electrically conductive hydrogel electrode arrays and an elastomeric poly(styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene) (SEBS) as the substrate and encapsulation materials. This mesh electrode can maintain stable electrochemical impedance in buffer solution under 50% compressive and 50% tensile strain. We have successfully cultured pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical organoids (hCO) on this polymeric mesh for more than 3 months and demonstrated that organoids readily integrate with the mesh. Using simultaneous stimulation and calcium imaging, we show that electrical stimulation through the mesh can elicit intensity-dependent calcium signals comparable to stimulation from a bipolar stereotrode. This platform may serve as a tool for monitoring and modulating the electrical activity of in vitro models of neuropsychiatric diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia shape the embryonic development of mammalian respiratory networks</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, brain-resident macrophages, play key roles during prenatal development in defining neural circuitry function, including ensuring proper synaptic wiring and maintaining homeostasis. Mammalian breathing rhythmogenesis arises from interacting brainstem neural networks that are assembled during embryonic development, but the specific role of microglia in this process remains unknown. Here, we investigated the anatomical and functional consequences of respiratory circuit formation in the absence of microglia. We first established the normal distribution of microglia within the wild-type (WT, Pu.1+/+) mouse brainstem at embryonic ages when the respiratory networks are known to emerge (embryonic day (E) 14.5 for the parafacial respiratory group (epF) and E16.5 for the preBotzinger complex (preBotC)). In transgenic mice depleted of microglia (Pu.1-/- mutant), we performed anatomical staining, calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activities in vitro to assess the status of these circuits at their respective times of functional emergence. Spontaneous respiratory-related activity recorded from reduced in vitro preparations showed an abnormally slow rhythm frequency expressed by the epF at E14.5, the preBotC at E16.5 and in the phrenic motor nerves from E16.5 onwards. These deficits were associated with a reduced number of active epF neurons, defects in commissural projections that couple the bilateral preBotC half-centers, and an accompanying decrease in their functional coordination. These abnormalities probably contribute to eventual neonatal death, since plethysmography revealed that E18.5 Pu.1-/- embryos are unable to sustain breathing activity ex utero. Our results thus point to a crucial contribution of microglia in the proper establishment of the central respiratory command during embryonic development.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and the mechanism of its occurrence is still not fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence has suggested that the gut acts as a potential origin of PD pathogenesis. Recent studies have identified that inflammatory bowel disease acts as a risk factor for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of this study was to further explore the molecular mechanism between PD and Crohn&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (CD). The gene expression profiles of PD (GSE6613) and CD (GSE119600) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and were identified as the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two diseases. Next, analyses were performed, including functional enrichment analysis, a protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction network, core genes identification, and clinical correlation analysis. As a result, 178 common DEGs (113 upregulated genes and 65 downregulated genes) were found between PD and CD. The functional analysis found that they were enriched in regulated exocytosis, immune response, and lipid binding. Twelve essential hub genes including BUB1B, BUB3, DLGAP5, AURKC, CBL, PCNA, RAF1, LYN, RPL39L, MRPL13, RSL24D1, and MRPS11 were identified from the PPI network by using cytoHubba. In addition, inflammatory and metabolic pathways were jointly involved in these two diseases. After verifying expression levels in an independent dataset (GSE99039), a correlation analysis with clinical features showed that LYN and RAF1 genes were associated with the severity of PD. In conclusion, our study revealed the common pathogenesis of PD and CD. These common pathways and hub genes may provide novel insights for mechanism research.</p>

	<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being used in patients with various advanced malignancies, and patient outcomes have improved considerably. Although ICIs can effectively treat tumors, 30&amp;amp;ndash;60% of patients experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a rare irAE that has become a novel topic in neuroimmunology and has received increasing attention in recent years. Herein, we report a rare case of GAD65-antibody&amp;amp;ndash;associated AE after metastatic small cell lung cancer treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient received IVIg therapy for AE and continuous pembrolizumab therapy without suspension of tumor treatment. At 1 year follow-up, both the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s AE symptoms and tumors were stable. We consider that the treatment of ICI-associated AE should be more individualized with prudent decision-making and should balance the tumor progression and AE treatment. In addition, we have also comprehensively reviewed the literature of ICI-associated AE, and summarized the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of AE caused by ICI, thus broadening our understanding of the neurological complications caused by ICI.</p>

	<p>Central venous catheters (CVCs) are increasingly used across specialties for invasive haemodynamic monitoring and for the delivery of fluids, medications, and nutritional support. Cerebral air embolism (CAE) is a rare but potentially fatal complication associated with the insertion, maintenance, and removal of CVCs. It can occur through different mechanisms, including the direct retrograde ascension of air into the cerebral veins and paradoxical embolism due to a right-to-left intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt. The &amp;amp;ldquo;hand-knob&amp;amp;rdquo; area is the cortical region within the primary motor cortex that contains the representation of the hand. It is located in the superior precentral gyrus and is the site of less than 1% of all ischaemic strokes. We report here the case of a patient who experienced an ischaemic stroke of the right &amp;amp;ldquo;hand-knob&amp;amp;rdquo; area, due to paradoxical CAE through a previously undiagnosed patent foramen ovale (PFO), after the insertion of a catheter in the right internal jugular vein. We also provide an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CAE. Suspecting CAE in the case of an acute neurological event occurring in close temporal relationship with central venous catheterization is paramount to allow the early recognition and treatment of this uncommon form of iatrogenic stroke.</p>

	<p>The use of landmarks for navigation develops throughout childhood. Here, we examined the developmental trajectory of egocentric and allocentric navigation based on landmark information in an on-screen virtual environment in 39 5&amp;amp;ndash;6-year-olds, 43 7&amp;amp;ndash;8-year-olds, and 41 9&amp;amp;ndash;10-year-olds. We assessed both categorical performance, indicating the notion of location changes based on the landmarks, as well as metrical performance relating to the precision of the representation of the environment. We investigated whether age, sex, spatial working memory, verbal working memory, and verbal production of left and right contributed to the development of navigation skills. In egocentric navigation, Categorical performance was already above chance at 5 years of age and was positively related to visuo-spatial working memory and the production of left/right, whereas metrical performance was only related to age. Allocentric navigation started to develop between 5 and 8 years of age and was related to sex, with boys outperforming girls. Both boys and girls seemed to rely more on directional landmark information as compared to positional landmark information. To our knowledge, this study is the first to give insight into the relative contribution of different cognitive abilities to navigation skills in school-aged children.</p>

However, given that ultrasound can operate over a wide range of parameters that can all be modulated, its applicability extends far beyond the bioimaging field. In fact, the modality has emerged as a hybrid technology that effectively assists drug delivery by transiently opening the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) when combined with intravenously injected microbubbles, and facilitates neuromodulation. Studies in aged mice contributed to an insight into how low-intensity ultrasound brings about its neuromodulatory effects, including increased synaptic plasticity and improved cognitive functions, with a potential role for neurogenesis and the modulation of NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal signalling. This work is complemented by studies in mouse models of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), a form of pathological ageing. Here, ultrasound was mainly employed as a BBB-opening tool that clears protein aggregates via microglial activation and neuronal autophagy, thereby restoring cognition. We discuss the currently available ultrasound approaches and how studies in senescent mice are relevant for AD and can accelerate the application of low-intensity ultrasound in the clinic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">COVID-19 vaccination elicits an evolving, cross-reactive antibody response to epitopes conserved with endemic coronavirus Spike proteins</a></h4>

              
                Elko et al. use a multiplexed assay to track epitope-specific antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination. They identify conserved sites where antibodies cross-recognize endemic coronaviruses, but with divergent kinetics compared to SARS-CoV-2. The evolving recognition of polymorphic residues within otherwise conserved sites may influence the formation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Antibodies targeting conserved non-canonical antigens and endemic coronaviruses associate with favorable outcomes in severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                Pedireddy et al perform deep molecular profiling of antibodies in severe Covid-19 patients and identify multivariate humoral signatures of outcome bifurcation involving canonical and non-canonical SARS-CoV-2 as well as endemic CoV antigenic specificities. Our results suggest the importance of Abs targeting non-canonical SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as those directed against endemic coronaviruses in favorable outcomes of severe COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Temporal associations of B and T cell immunity with robust vaccine responsiveness in a 16-week interval BNT162b2 regimen</a></h4>

              
                Nayrac et al., show that a 16-week interval BNT162b2 regimen elicits robust SARS-CoV-2-specific B and T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and previously-infected individuals. Immune response kinetics differ after the first dose between cohorts but converge after boosting, which elicits a multifaceted cellular recall response and functional memory.

                Tau and -synuclein are major players in neurodegenerative diseases, but their physiological role, particularly in dendrites, is poorly understood. Here we show that, surprisingly, lack of tau protein induces the development of a more elaborate dendritic arbor of hippocampal pyramidal cells in organotypic tissue. Using high-speed volumetric lattice light-sheet microscopy and single particle tracking, we found a more directional KIF1A-mediated transport in dendrites of Tau KO cells. Increased transport processivity correlated with longer and straighter dendritic microtubules as revealed by three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy of cultured hippocampal neurons. Unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of tissue showed highly increased expression of -synuclein in Tau KO hippocampi. Overexpression of -synuclein mimicked the transport characteristics observed in Tau KO cells. Our data indicate that tau and -synuclein shape microtubule-dependent transport in neuronal dendrites, thereby promoting dendritic arborization during maturation. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that transport efficiency and length and straightness of microtubules are correlated.

                Dravet syndrome (DS), an intractable childhood epileptic encephalopathy with a high fatality rate, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one allele of SCN1A, which encodes Nav1.1. In contrast to other epilepsies, pharmaceutical treatment for DS is limited. Here, we demonstrate that viral vector-mediated delivery of a codon-modified SCN1A cDNA improves DS comorbidities in juvenile and adolescent DS mice (Scn1aA1783V/WT). Notably, bilateral vector injections into the hippocampus or thalamus of DS mice improved the survival of the mice, reduced the occurrence of epileptic spikes, provided protection from thermally-induced seizures, and corrected background electrocorticography activity. Together, our results provide a proof-of-concept for the potential of SCN1A delivery as a therapeutic approach for infants and adolescents with DS-associated comorbidities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combinatorial encoding of odors in the mosquito antennal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Among the cues that a mosquito uses to find a host for blood-feeding, the smell of the host plays an important role. Previous studies have shown that host odors contain hundreds of chemical odorants, which are detected by different receptors on the peripheral sensory organs of mosquitoes. But how individual odorants are encoded by downstream neurons in the mosquito brain is not known. We developed an in vivo preparation for patch-clamp electrophysiology to record from projection neurons and local neurons in the antennal lobe of Aedes aegypti. Combining intracellular recordings with dye-fills, morphological reconstructions, and immunohistochemistry, we identify different sub-classes of antennal lobe neurons and their putative interactions. Our recordings show that an odorant can activate multiple neurons innervating different glomeruli, and that the stimulus identity and its behavioral preference are represented in the population activity of the projection neurons. Our results provide the first detailed description of olfactory neurons in the central nervous system of mosquitoes and lay a foundation for understanding the neural basis of their olfactory behaviors.
