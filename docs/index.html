<p>We develop a mathematical model of information transmission across the
biological neural network of the human brain. The overall function of the brain
consists of the emergent processes resulting from the spread of information
through the neural network. The capacity of the brain is therefore related to
the rate at which it can transmit information through the neural network. The
particular transmission model under consideration allows for information to be
transmitted along multiple paths between points of the cortex. The resulting
transmission rates are governed by potential theory. According to this theory,
the brain has preferred and quantized transmission modes that correspond to
eigenfunctions of the classical Steklov eigenvalue problem, with the reciprocal
eigenvalues quantifying the corresponding transmission rates. We take the model
as a basis for testing the hypothesis that the sulcus pattern of the human
brain has evolved to maximize the rate of transmission of information between
points in the cerebral cortex. We show that the introduction of sulci, or cuts,
in an otherwise smooth domain indeed increases the overall transmission rate.
We demonstrate this result by means of numerical experiments concerned with a
spherical domain with a varying number of slits on its surface.

<p>Permutation relative entropy is proposed to quantify time irreversibility in
our nonlinear dynamics analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG). Ordinal patterns
in multi-dimension phase space of time series are symbolized, and the
probabilistic divergences of all symmetric ordinal pairs are measured by
relative entropy as time irreversibility. Analyzing multi-channel EEG from 18
healthy volunteers and 18 epileptic patients (all in their seize-free
intervals), the derived relative entropy of symmetrical ordinal patterns shows
advantages to other time irreversible parameters and significantly distinguish
two kinds of brain electric signals (the epileptic have lower temporal
asymmetries than the healthy). Test results prove that it is effective to
quantity time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic divergence of
symmetrical ordinal patterns and validate our hypothesis that epilepsy has
lasting impacts on brain' nonlinear dynamics, leading to a decline in brain
signals directional asymmetry or time irreversibility, and the losing temporal
asymmetries stemming from our findings may contribute to the preclinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.

<p>by Christopher L. Buckley, Taro Toyoizumi</p>

During active behaviours like running, swimming, whisking or sniffing, motor actions shape sensory input and sensory percepts guide future motor commands. Ongoing cycles of sensory and motor processing constitute a closed-loop feedback system which is central to motor control and, it has been argued, for perceptual processes. This closed-loop feedback is mediated by brainwide neural circuits but how the presence of feedback signals impacts on the dynamics and function of neurons is not well understood. Here we present a simple theory suggesting that closed-loop feedback between the brain/body/environment can modulate neural gain and, consequently, change endogenous neural fluctuations and responses to sensory input. We support this theory with modeling and data analysis in two vertebrate systems. First, in a model of rodent whisking we show that negative feedback mediated by whisking vibrissa can suppress coherent neural fluctuations and neural responses to sensory input in the barrel cortex. We argue this suppression provides an appealing account of a <i>brain state transition</i> (a marked change in global brain activity) coincident with the onset of whisking in rodents. Moreover, this mechanism suggests a novel signal detection mechanism that selectively accentuates <i>active</i>, rather than <i>passive</i>, whisker touch signals. This mechanism is consistent with a predictive coding strategy that is sensitive to the consequences of motor actions rather than the difference between the predicted and actual sensory input. We further support the theory by re-analysing previously published two-photon data recorded in zebrafish larvae performing closed-loop optomotor behaviour in a virtual swim simulator. We show, as predicted by this theory, that the degree to which each cell contributes in linking sensory and motor signals well explains how much its neural fluctuations are suppressed by closed-loop optomotor behaviour. More generally we argue that our results demonstrate the dependence of neural fluctuations, across the brain, on closed-loop brain/body/environment interactions strongly supporting the idea that brain function cannot be fully understood through open-loop approaches alone.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rfk3vZoQIs4" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/755?rss=1">Alpha Oscillations Reduce Temporal Long-Range Dependence in Spontaneous Human Brain Activity</a></h4>

<p>Ongoing neural dynamics comprise both frequency-specific oscillations and broadband-features, such as long-range dependence (LRD). Despite both being behaviorally relevant, little is known about their potential interactions. In humans, 8–12 Hz α oscillations constitute the strongest deviation from 1/f power-law scaling, the signature of LRD. We postulated that α oscillations, believed to exert active inhibitory gating, downmodulate the temporal width of LRD in slower ongoing brain activity. In two independent "resting-state" datasets (electroencephalography surface recordings and magnetoencephalography source reconstructions), both across space and dynamically over time, power of α activity covaried with the power slope &lt;5 Hz (i.e., greater α activity shortened LRD). Causality of α activity dynamics was implied by its temporal precedence over changes of slope. A model where power-law fluctuations of the α envelope inhibit baseline activity closely replicated our results. Thus, α oscillations may provide an active control mechanism to adaptively regulate LRD of brain activity at slow temporal scales, thereby shaping internal states and cognitive processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The two prominent features of ongoing brain activity are oscillations and temporal long-range dependence. Both shape behavioral performance, but little is known about their interaction. Here, we demonstrate such an interaction in EEG and MEG recordings of task-free human brain activity. Specifically, we show that spontaneous dynamics in alpha activity explain ensuing variations of dependence in the low and ultra-low-frequency range. In modeling, two features of alpha oscillations are critical to account for the observed effects on long-range dependence, scale-free properties of alpha oscillations themselves, and a modulation of baseline levels, presumably inhibitory. Both these properties have been observed empirically, and our study hence establishes alpha oscillations as a regulatory mechanism governing long-range dependence or "memory" in slow ongoing brain activity.</p>

<p>The striatum is a central part of the dopaminergic mesolimbic system and contributes both to the encoding and retrieval of long-term memories. In this regard, the co-occurrence of striatal novelty and retrieval success effects in independent studies underlines the structure's double duty and suggests dynamic contextual adaptation. To test this hypothesis and further investigate the underlying mechanisms of encoding and retrieval dynamics, human subjects viewed pre-familiarized scene images intermixed with new scenes and classified them as indoor versus outdoor (encoding task) or old versus new (retrieval task), while fMRI and eye tracking data were recorded. Subsequently, subjects performed a final recognition task. As hypothesized, striatal activity and pupil size reflected task-conditional salience of old and new stimuli, but, unexpectedly, this effect was not reflected in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), medial temporal lobe, or subsequent memory performance. Instead, subsequent memory generally benefitted from retrieval, an effect possibly driven by task difficulty and activity in a network including different parts of the striatum and SN/VTA. Our findings extend memory models of encoding and retrieval dynamics by pinpointing a specific contextual factor that differentially modulates the functional properties of the mesolimbic system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mesolimbic system is involved in the encoding and retrieval of information but it is unclear how these two processes are achieved within the same network of brain regions. In particular, memory retrieval and novelty encoding were considered in independent studies, implying that novelty (new &gt; old) and retrieval success (old &gt; new) effects may co-occur in the striatum. Here, we used a common framework implicating the striatum, but not other parts of the mesolimbic system, in tracking context-dependent salience of old and new information. The current study, therefore, paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the functional properties of the mesolimbic system during memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

<p>The spontaneous tonic discharge activity of nigral dopamine neurons plays a fundamental role in dopaminergic signaling. To investigate the role of neuronal morphology and architecture with respect to spontaneous activity in this population, we visualized the 3D structure of the axon initial segment (AIS) along with the entire somatodendritic domain of adult male mouse dopaminergic neurons, previously recorded <i>in vivo</i>. We observed a positive correlation of the firing rate with both proximity and size of the AIS. Computational modeling showed that the size of the AIS, but not its position within the somatodendritic domain, is the major causal determinant of the tonic firing rate in the intact model, by virtue of the higher intrinsic frequency of the isolated AIS. Further mechanistic analysis of the relationship between neuronal morphology and firing rate showed that dopaminergic neurons function as a coupled oscillator whose frequency of discharge results from a compromise between AIS and somatodendritic oscillators. Thus, morphology plays a critical role in setting the basal tonic firing rate, which in turn could control striatal dopaminergic signaling that mediates motivation and movement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The frequency at which nigral dopamine neurons discharge action potentials sets baseline dopamine levels in the brain, which enables activity in motor, cognitive, and motivational systems. Here, we demonstrate that the size of the axon initial segment, a subcellular compartment responsible for initiating action potentials, is a key determinant of the firing rate in these neurons. The axon initial segment and all the molecular components that underlie its critical function may provide a novel target for the regulation of dopamine levels in the brain.</p>

<p>The vertebrate retina has the remarkable ability to support visual function under conditions of limited illumination, including the processing of signals evoked by single photons. Dim-light vision is regulated by several adaptive mechanisms. The mechanism explored in this study is responsible for increasing the light sensitivity and operational range of rod bipolar cells, the retinal neurons operating immediately downstream of rod photoreceptors. This sensitization is achieved through the sustained dopamine-dependent GABA release from other retinal neurons. Our goals were to identify the cell type responsible for the GABA release and the site of its modulation by dopamine. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of amacrine and/or horizontal cells. We now demonstrate, using mice of both sexes, that horizontal cells do not participate in this mechanism. Instead, sustained GABA input is provided by a subpopulation of wide-field amacrine cells, which stimulate the GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors at rod bipolar cell axons. We also found that dopamine does not act directly on either of these cells. Rather, it suppresses inhibition imposed on these wide-field cells by another subpopulation of upstream GABAergic amacrine cells, thereby sustaining the GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor activation required for rod bipolar cell sensitization.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The vertebrate retina has an exquisite ability to adjust information processing to ever-changing conditions of ambient illumination, from bright sunlight to single-photon counting under dim starlight. Operation under each of these functional regimes requires an engagement of specific adaptation mechanisms. Here, we describe a mechanism optimizing the performance of the dim-light channel of vision, which consists of sensitizing rod bipolar cells by a sustained GABAergic input originating from a population of wide-field amacrine cells. Wide-field amacrine cells span large segments of the retina, making them uniquely equipped to normalize and optimize response sensitivity across distant receptive fields and preclude any bias toward local light-intensity fluctuations.</p>

<p>Speech comprehension is preserved up to a threefold acceleration, but deteriorates rapidly at higher speeds. Current models posit that perceptual resilience to accelerated speech is limited by the brain's ability to parse speech into syllabic units using / oscillations. Here, we investigated whether the involvement of neuronal oscillations in processing accelerated speech also relates to their scale-free amplitude modulation as indexed by the strength of long-range temporal correlations (LRTC). We recorded MEG while 24 human subjects (12 females) listened to radio news uttered at different comprehensible rates, at a mostly unintelligible rate and at this same speed interleaved with silence gaps. , , and low- oscillations followed the nonlinear variation of comprehension, with LRTC rising only at the highest speed. In contrast, increasing the rate was associated with a monotonic increase in LRTC in high- activity. When intelligibility was restored with the insertion of silence gaps, LRTC in the , , and low- oscillations resumed the low levels observed for intelligible speech. Remarkably, the lower the individual subject scaling exponents of / oscillations, the greater the comprehension of the fastest speech rate. Moreover, the strength of LRTC of the speech envelope decreased at the maximal rate, suggesting an inverse relationship with the LRTC of brain dynamics when comprehension halts. Our findings show that scale-free amplitude modulation of cortical oscillations and speech signals are tightly coupled to speech uptake capacity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One may read this statement in 20–30 s, but reading it in less than five leaves us clueless. Our minds limit how much information we grasp in an instant. Understanding the neural constraints on our capacity for sensory uptake is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Here, MEG was used to investigate neuronal activity while subjects listened to radio news played faster and faster until becoming unintelligible. We found that speech comprehension is related to the scale-free dynamics of  and  bands, whereas this property in high- fluctuations mirrors speech rate. We propose that successful speech processing imposes constraints on the self-organization of synchronous cell assemblies and their scale-free dynamics adjusts to the temporal properties of spoken language.</p>

<p>Combining sensory inputs over space and time is fundamental to vision. Population receptive field models have been successful in characterizing spatial encoding throughout the human visual pathways. A parallel question, how visual areas in the human brain process information distributed over time, has received less attention. One challenge is that the most widely used neuroimaging method, fMRI, has coarse temporal resolution compared with the time-scale of neural dynamics. Here, via carefully controlled temporally modulated stimuli, we show that information about temporal processing can be readily derived from fMRI signal amplitudes in male and female subjects. We find that all visual areas exhibit subadditive summation, whereby responses to longer stimuli are less than the linear prediction from briefer stimuli. We also find fMRI evidence that the neural response to two stimuli is reduced for brief interstimulus intervals (indicating adaptation). These effects are more pronounced in visual areas anterior to V1-V3. Finally, we develop a general model that shows how these effects can be captured with two simple operations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. This model operates for arbitrary temporal stimulation patterns and provides a simple and interpretable set of computations that can be used to characterize neural response properties across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, compressive temporal summation directly parallels earlier findings of compressive spatial summation in visual cortex describing responses to stimuli distributed across space. This indicates that, for space and time, cortex uses a similar processing strategy to achieve higher-level and increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Combining sensory inputs over time is fundamental to seeing. Two important temporal phenomena are summation, the accumulation of sensory inputs over time, and adaptation, a response reduction for repeated or sustained stimuli. We investigated these phenomena in the human visual system using fMRI. We built predictive models that operate on arbitrary temporal patterns of stimulation using two simple computations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. Our new temporal compressive summation model captures (1) subadditive temporal summation, and (2) adaptation. We show that the model accounts for systematic differences in these phenomena across visual areas. Finally, we show that for space and time, the visual system uses a similar strategy to achieve increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.</p>

<p>The MAPK/ERK pathway has a critical role in PNS development. It is required for Schwann cell (SC) differentiation and myelination; sustained embryonic MAPK/ERK activation in SCs enhances myelin growth overcoming signals that normally end myelination. Excess activation of this pathway can be maladaptive as in adulthood acute strong activation of MAPK/ERK has been shown to cause SC dedifferentiation and demyelination. We used a mouse model (including male and female animals) in which the gain-of-function <i>MEK1DD</i> allele produces sustained MAPK/ERK activation in adult SCs, and we determined the impact of such activation on nerve repair. In the uninjured nerve, MAPK/ERK activation neither impaired myelin nor reactivated myelination. However, in the injured nerve it was detrimental and resulted in delayed repair and functional recovery. In the early phase of injury, the rate of myelin clearance was faster. Four weeks following injury, when nerve repair is normally advanced, myelinated axons of <i>MEK1DD</i> mutants demonstrated higher rates of myelin decompaction, a reduced number of Cajal bands. and decreased internodal length. We noted the presence of abnormal Remak bundles with long SCs processes and reduced numbers of C-fibers/Remak bundle. Both the total number of regenerating axons and the intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the skin were reduced. Sustained activation of MAPK/ERK in adult SCs is therefore deleterious to successful nerve repair, emphasizing the differences in the signaling processes coordinating nerve development and repair. Our results also underline the key role of SCs in axon regeneration and successful target reinnervation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The MAPK/ERK pathway promotes developmental myelination and its sustained activation in SCs induced continuous myelin growth, compensating for the absence of essential myelination signals. However, the strength of activation is fundamental because acute strong induction of MAPK/ERK in adulthood induces demyelination. What has been unknown is the effect of a mild but sustained MAPK/ERK activation in SCs on nerve repair in adulthood. This promoted myelin clearance but led to abnormalities in nonmyelinating and myelinating SCs in the later phases of nerve repair, resulting in slowed axon regeneration, cutaneous reinnervation, and functional recovery. Our results emphasize the distinct role of the MAPK/ERK pathway in developmental myelination versus remyelination and the importance of signaling between SCs and axons for successful axon regeneration.</p>

<p>We typically recognize visual objects using the spatial layout of their parts, which are present simultaneously on the retina. Therefore, shape extraction is based on integration of the relevant retinal information over space. The lateral occipital complex (LOC) can represent shape faithfully in such conditions. However, integration over time is sometimes required to determine object shape. To study shape extraction through temporal integration of successive partial shape views, we presented human participants (both men and women) with artificial shapes that moved behind a narrow vertical or horizontal slit. Only a tiny fraction of the shape was visible at any instant at the same retinal location. However, observers perceived a coherent whole shape instead of a jumbled pattern. Using fMRI and multivoxel pattern analysis, we searched for brain regions that encode temporally integrated shape identity. We further required that the representation of shape should be invariant to changes in the slit orientation. We show that slit-invariant shape information is most accurate in the LOC. Importantly, the slit-invariant shape representations matched the conventional whole-shape representations assessed during full-image runs. Moreover, when the same slit-dependent shape slivers were shuffled, thereby preventing their spatiotemporal integration, slit-invariant shape information was reduced dramatically. The slit-invariant representation of the various shapes also mirrored the structure of shape perceptual space as assessed by perceptual similarity judgment tests. Therefore, the LOC is likely to mediate temporal integration of slit-dependent shape views, generating a slit-invariant whole-shape percept. These findings provide strong evidence for a global encoding of shape in the LOC regardless of integration processes required to generate the shape percept.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual objects are recognized through spatial integration of features available simultaneously on the retina. The lateral occipital complex (LOC) represents shape faithfully in such conditions even if the object is partially occluded. However, shape must sometimes be reconstructed over both space and time. Such is the case in anorthoscopic perception, when an object is moving behind a narrow slit. In this scenario, spatial information is limited at any moment so the whole-shape percept can only be inferred by integration of successive shape views over time. We find that LOC carries shape-specific information recovered using such temporal integration processes. The shape representation is invariant to slit orientation and is similar to that evoked by a fully viewed image. Existing models of object recognition lack such capabilities.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/648?rss=1">Local Inhibition of PERK Enhances Memory and Reverses Age-Related Deterioration of Cognitive and Neuronal Properties</a></h4>

<p>Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is one of four known kinases that respond to cellular stress by deactivating the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α) or other signal transduction cascades. Recently, both eIF2α and its kinases were found to play a role in normal and pathological brain function. Here, we show that reduction of either the amount or the activity of PERK, specifically in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in young adult male mice, enhances neuronal excitability and improves cognitive function. In addition, this manipulation rescues the age-dependent cellular phenotype of reduced excitability and memory decline. Specifically, the reduction of PERK expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of middle-aged male mice using a viral vector rejuvenates hippocampal function and improves hippocampal-dependent learning. These results delineate a mechanism for behavior and neuronal aging and position PERK as a promising therapeutic target for age-dependent brain malfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found that local reduced protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) expression or activity in the hippocampus enhances neuronal excitability and cognitive function in young normal mice, that old CA1 pyramidal cells have reduced excitability and increased PERK expression that can be rescued by reducing PERK expression in the hippocampus, and that reducing PERK expression in the hippocampus of middle-aged mice enhances hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and restores it to normal performance levels of young mice. These findings uncover an entirely new biological link among PERK, neuronal intrinsic properties, aging, and cognitive function. Moreover, our findings propose a new way to fight mild cognitive impairment and aging-related cognitive deterioration.</p>

<p>New dentate granule cells (DGCs) are continuously generated, and integrate into the preexisting hippocampal network in the adult brain. How an adult-born neuron with initially simple spindle-like morphology develops into a DGC, consisting of a single apical dendrite with further branches, remains largely unknown. Here, using retroviruses to birth date and manipulate newborn neurons, we examined initial dendritic formation and possible underlying mechanisms. We found that GFP-expressing newborn cells began to establish a DGC-like morphology at ~7 d after birth, with a primary dendrite pointing to the molecular layer, but at this stage, with several neurites in the neurogenic zone. Interestingly, the Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle for neurite growth and maintenance, was dynamically repositioning in the soma of newborn cells during this initial integration stage. Two weeks after birth, by which time most neurites in the neurogenic zone were eliminated, a compact Golgi apparatus was positioned exclusively at the base of the primary dendrite. We analyzed the presence of Golgi-associated genes using single-cell transcriptomes of newborn DGCs, and among Golgi-related genes, found the presence of <i>STK25</i> and <i>STRAD</i>, regulators of embryonic neuronal development. When we knocked down either of these two proteins, we found Golgi mislocalization and extensive aberrant dendrite formation. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutated form of STRAD, underlying the disorder polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy, characterized by abnormal brain development and intractable epilepsy, caused similar defects in Golgi localization and dendrite formation in adult-born neurons. Together, our findings reveal a role for Golgi repositioning in regulating the initial integration of adult-born DGCs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Since the discovery of the continuous generation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, extensive effort was directed toward understanding the functional contribution of these newborn neurons to the existing hippocampal circuit and associated behaviors, while the molecular mechanisms controlling their early morphological integration are less well understood. Dentate granule cells (DGCs) have a single, complex, apical dendrite. The events leading adult-born DGCs' to transition from simple spindle-like morphology to mature dendrite morphology are largely unknown. We studied establishment of newborn DGCs dendritic pattern and found it was mediated by a signaling pathway regulating precise localization of the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, this Golgi-associated mechanism for dendrite establishment might be impaired in a human genetic epilepsy syndrome, polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy.</p>

<p>During embryonic development, axons extend over long distances to establish functional connections. In contrast, axon regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS is limited in part by a reduced intrinsic capacity for axon growth. Therefore, insight into the intrinsic control of axon growth may provide new avenues for enhancing CNS regeneration. Here, we performed one of the first miRNome-wide functional miRNA screens to identify miRNAs with robust effects on axon growth. High-content screening identified miR-135a and miR-135b as potent stimulators of axon growth and cortical neuron migration <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in male and female mice. Intriguingly, both of these developmental effects of miR-135s relied in part on silencing of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a well known intrinsic inhibitor of axon growth and regeneration. These results prompted us to test the effect of miR-135s on axon regeneration after injury. Our results show that intravitreal application of miR-135s facilitates retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon regeneration after optic nerve injury in adult mice in part by repressing KLF4. In contrast, depletion of miR-135s further reduced RGC axon regeneration. Together, these data identify a novel neuronal role for miR-135s and the miR-135–KLF4 pathway and highlight the potential of miRNAs as tools for enhancing CNS axon regeneration.</p>

<p>Inhibition in thalamorecipient layer 4 simple cells of primary visual cortex is believed to play important roles in establishing visual response properties and integrating visual inputs across their receptive fields (RFs). Simple cell RFs are characterized by nonoverlapping, spatially restricted subregions in which visual stimuli can either increase or decrease the firing rate of the cell, depending on contrast. Inhibition is believed to be triggered exclusively from visual stimulation of individual RF subregions. However, this view is at odds with the known anatomy of layer 4 interneurons in visual cortex and differs from recent findings in mouse visual cortex. Here we show with <i>in vivo</i> intracellular recordings in cats that while excitation is restricted to RF subregions, inhibition spans the width of simple cell RFs. Consequently, excitatory stimuli within a subregion concomitantly drive excitation and inhibition. Furthermore, we found that the distribution of inhibition across the RF is stronger toward OFF subregions. This inhibitory OFF-subregion bias has a functional consequence on spatial integration of inputs across the RF. A model based on the known anatomy of layer 4 demonstrates that the known proportion and connectivity of inhibitory neurons in layer 4 of primary visual cortex is sufficient to explain broad inhibition with an OFF-subregion bias while generating a variety of phase relations, including antiphase, between excitation and inhibition in response to drifting gratings.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The wiring of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortical circuits is key to determining the response properties in sensory cortex. In the visual cortex, the first cells that receive visual input are simple cells in layer 4. The underlying circuitry responsible for the response properties of simple cells is not yet known. In this study, we challenge a long-held view concerning the pattern of inhibitory input and provide results that agree with current known anatomy. We show here that inhibition is evoked broadly across the receptive fields of simple cells, and we identify a surprising bias in inhibition within the receptive field. Our findings represent a step toward a unified view of inhibition across different species and sensory systems.</p>

<p>In this paper, we pose the following working hypothesis: in humans, transcranial electric stimulation (tES) with a time course that mimics the endogenous activity of its target is capable of altering the target's excitability. In our case, the target was the primary motor cortex (M1). We identified the endogenous neurodynamics of hand M1's subgroups of pyramidal neuronal pools in each of our subjects by applying Functional Source Separation (FSS) to their EEG recordings. We then tested whether the corticospinal excitability of the hand representation under the above described stimulation, which we named transcranial individual neurodynamics stimulation (tIDS), was higher than in the absence of stimulation (baseline). As a check, we compared tIDS with the most efficient noninvasive facilitatory corticospinal tES known so far, which is 20 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). The control conditions were as follows: (1) sham, (2) transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) in the same frequency range as tIDS (1–250 Hz), and (3) a low current tIDS (tIDS<sub>low</sub>). Corticospinal excitability was measured with motor-evoked potentials under transcranial magnetic stimulation. The mean motor-evoked potential amplitude increase was 31% of the baseline during tIDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and it was 15% during tACS (<i>p</i> = 0.096). tRNS, tIDS<sub>low</sub>, and sham induced no effects. Whereas tACS did not produce an enhancement in any subject at the individual level, tIDS was successful in producing an enhancement in 8 of the 16 subjects. The results of the present proof-of-principle study showed that proper exploitation of local neurodynamics can enhance the efficacy of personalized tES.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study demonstrated that, in humans, transcranial individual neurodynamics stimulation (tIDS), which mimics the endogenous dynamics of the target neuronal pools, effectively changes the excitability of these pools. tIDS holds promise for high-efficacy personalized neuromodulations based on individual local neurodynamics.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/575?rss=1">Inactivation of NMDA Receptors in the Ventral Tegmental Area during Cocaine Self-Administration Prevents GluA1 Upregulation but with Paradoxical Increases in Cocaine-Seeking Behavior</a></h4>

<p>Cocaine self-administration increases expression of GluA1 subunits in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, which subsequently enhance the motivation for cocaine. This increase in GluA1 may be dependent on concomitant NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation during self-administration, similar to cocaine-induced long-term potentiation in the VTA. In this study, we used viral-mediated expression of a dominant-negative GluN1 subunit (HSV-dnGluN1) in VTA neurons to study the effect of transient NMDAR inactivation on the GluA1 increases induced by chronic cocaine self-administration in male rats. We found that dnGluN1 expression in the VTA limited to the 3 weeks of cocaine self-administration prevents the subsequent increase in tissue GluA1 levels when compared with control infusions of HSV-LacZ. Surprisingly, dnGluN1 expression led to an enhancement in the motivation to self-administer cocaine as measured using a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule and to enhanced cocaine seeking measured in extinction/reinstatement tests following an extended 3 week withdrawal period. Despite blocking tissue GluA1 increases in cocaine self-administering animals, the HSV-dnGluN1 treatment resulted in increased membrane levels of GluA1 and GluN2B, along with markedly higher locomotor responses to intra-VTA infusions of AMPA, suggesting a paradoxical increase in VTA AMPA receptor responsiveness. Together, these data suggest that NMDARs mediate cocaine-induced increases in VTA GluA1 expression, but such transient NMDAR inactivation also leads to compensatory scaling of synaptic AMPA receptors that enhance the motivational for cocaine.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are critical substrates of drug rewards. Animal models indicate that chronic cocaine use enhances excitatory glutamatergic input to these neurons, making them more susceptible to environmental stimuli that trigger drug craving and relapse. We previously found that self-administration of cocaine increases AMPA glutamate receptors in the VTA, and this effect enhances motivation for cocaine. Here we report that the mechanism for this upregulation involves NMDA receptor activity during cocaine use. While interference with NMDA receptor function blocks AMPA receptor upregulation, it also produces a paradoxical enhancement in membrane AMPA receptor subunits, AMPA responsiveness, and the motivation for cocaine. Thus, pharmacotherapy targeting NMDA receptors may inadvertently produce substantial adverse consequences for cocaine addiction.</p>

<p>Chronic pain is increasingly recognized as an important comorbidity of HIV-infected patients, however, the exact molecular mechanisms of HIV-related pain are still elusive. CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) are expressed in various tissues, including the CNS. C/EBPβ, one of the C/EBPs, is involved in the progression of HIV/AIDS, but the exact role of C/EBPβ and its upstream factors are not clear in HIV pain state. Here, we used a neuropathic pain model of perineural HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 application onto the rat sciatic nerve to test the role of phosphorylated C/EBPβ (pC/EBPβ) and its upstream pathway in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH). HIV gp120 induced overexpression of pC/EBPβ in the ipsilateral SCDH compared with contralateral SCDH. Inhibition of C/EBPβ using siRNA against C/EBPβ reduced mechanical allodynia. HIV gp120 also increased TNFα, TNFRI, mitochondrial superoxide (mtO<sub>2</sub><sup>·–</sup>), and pCREB in the ipsilateral SCDH. ChIP-qPCR assay showed that pCREB enrichment on the C/EBPβ gene promoter regions in rats with gp120 was higher than that in sham rats. Intrathecal TNF soluble receptor I (functionally blocking TNFα bioactivity) or knockdown of TNFRI using antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against TNFRI reduced mechanical allodynia, and decreased mtO<sub>2</sub><sup>·–</sup>, pCREB and pC/EBPβ. Intrathecal Mito-tempol (a mitochondria-targeted O<sub>2</sub><sup>·–</sup>scavenger) reduced mechanical allodynia and decreased pCREB and pC/EBPβ. Knockdown of CREB with antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against CREB reduced mechanical allodynia and lowered pC/EBPβ. These results suggested that the pathway of TNFα/TNFRI–mtO<sub>2</sub><sup>·–</sup>–pCREB triggers pC/EBPβ in the HIV gp120-induced neuropathic pain state. Furthermore, we confirmed the pathway using both cultured neurons treated with recombinant TNFα <i>in vitro</i> and repeated intrathecal injection of recombinant TNFα in naive rats. This finding provides new insights in the understanding of the HIV neuropathic pain mechanisms and treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Painful HIV-associated sensory neuropathy is a neurological complication of HIV infection. Phosphorylated C/EBPβ (pC/EBPβ) influences AIDS progression, but it is still not clear about the exact role of pC/EBPβ and the detailed upstream factors of pC/EBPβ in HIV-related pain. In a neuropathic pain model of perineural HIV gp120 application onto the sciatic nerve, we found that pC/EBPβ was triggered by TNFα/TNFRI–mtO<sub>2</sub><sup>·–</sup>–pCREB signaling pathway. The pathway was confirmed by using cultured neurons treated with recombinant TNFα <i>in vitro</i>, and by repeated intrathecal injection of recombinant TNFα in naive rats. The present results revealed the functional significance of TNFα/TNFRI–mtO<sub>2</sub><sup>·–</sup>–pCREB–pC/EBPβ signaling in HIV neuropathic pain, and should help in the development of more specific treatments for neuropathic pain.</p>

<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease affecting predominantly striatum and cortex that results in motor and cognitive disorders. Before a motor phenotype, animal models of HD show aberrant cortical-striatal glutamate signaling. Here, we tested synaptic plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses onto striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) early in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. High-frequency stimulation-induced long-term depression, mediated by the endocannabinoid anandamide and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), was significantly attenuated in male and female YAC128 SPNs. Indirect pathway SPNs, which are more vulnerable in HD, were most affected. Our experiments show metabotropic glutamate receptor and endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol-dependent plasticity, as well as direct CB1 activation by agonists, was similar in YAC128 and FVB/N wild-type SPNs suggesting that presynaptic CB1 is functioning normally. These results are consistent with a specific impairment in postsynaptic anandamide synthesis in YAC128 SPN. Strikingly, although suppression of degradation of anandamide was not effective, elevating 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels restored long-term depression in YAC128 striatal neurons. Together, these results have potential implications for neuroprotection and ameliorating early cognitive and motor deficits in HD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Recent studies find impairment of the endocannabinoid system in animal models but the functional implication for synaptic plasticity in HD remains unclear. Sepers et al. show a selective deficit in synaptic plasticity mediated by the endocannabinoid anandamide, but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol in a mouse model of HD. The deficit is rescued by selectively elevating levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol produced on-demand. This mechanism could be targeted in the development of future therapeutics for HD.</p>

<p>The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is an early site of tau accumulation and MTL dysfunction may underlie episodic-memory decline in aging and dementia. Postmortem data indicate that tau pathology in the transentorhinal cortex is common by age 60, whereas spread to neocortical regions and worsening of cognition is associated with β-amyloid (Aβ). We used [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 and [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB positron emission tomography, structural MRI, and neuropsychological assessment to investigate how <i>in vivo</i> tau accumulation in temporal lobe regions, Aβ, and MTL atrophy contribute to episodic memory in cognitively normal older adults (<i>n</i> = 83; age, 77 ± 6 years; 58% female). Stepwise regressions identified tau in MTL regions known to be affected in old age as the best predictor of episodic-memory performance independent of Aβ status. There was no interactive effect of MTL tau with Aβ on memory. Higher MTL tau was related to higher age in the subjects without evidence of Aβ. Among temporal lobe subregions, episodic memory was most strongly related to tau-tracer uptake in the parahippocampal gyrus, particularly the posterior entorhinal cortex, which in our parcellation includes the transentorhinal cortex. In subjects with longitudinal MRI and cognitive data (<i>n</i> = 57), entorhinal atrophy mirrored patterns of tau pathology and their relationship with memory decline. Our data are consistent with neuropathological studies and further suggest that entorhinal tau pathology underlies memory decline in old age even without Aβ.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tau tangles and β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques are key lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but both pathologies also occur in cognitively normal older people. Neuropathological data indicate that tau tangles in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) underlie episodic-memory impairments in AD dementia. However, it remains unclear whether MTL tau pathology also accounts for memory impairments often seen in elderly people and how Aβ affects this relationship. Using tau-specific and Aβ-specific positron emission tomography tracers, we show that <i>in vivo</i> MTL tau pathology is associated with episodic-memory performance and MTL atrophy in cognitively normal adults, independent of Aβ. Our data point to MTL tau pathology, particularly in the entorhinal cortex, as a substrate of age-related episodic-memory loss.</p>

<p>Cell-surface molecules are dynamically regulated at the synapse to assemble and disassemble adhesive contacts that are important for synaptogenesis and for tuning synaptic transmission. Metalloproteinases dynamically regulate cellular behaviors through the processing of cell surface molecules. In the present study, we evaluated the role of membrane-type metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) in excitatory synaptogenesis. We find that MT3-MMP and MT5-MMP are broadly expressed in the mouse cerebral cortex and that MT3-MMP loss-of-function interferes with excitatory synapse development in dissociated cortical neurons and in <i>vivo</i>. We identify Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1) as an MT3-MMP substrate that is required for MT3-MMP-dependent synapse formation. Introduction of the shed ectodomain of NgR1 is sufficient to accelerate excitatory synapse formation in dissociated cortical neurons and in <i>vivo</i>. Together, our findings support a role for MT3-MMP-dependent shedding of NgR1 in regulating excitatory synapse development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we identify MT3-MMP, a membrane-bound zinc protease, to be necessary for the development of excitatory synapses in cortical neurons. We identify Nogo-66 receptors (NgR1) as a downstream target of MT3-MMP proteolytic activity. Furthermore, processing of surface NgR1 by MT3-MMP generates a soluble ectodomain fragment that accelerates the formation of excitatory synapses. We propose that MT3-MMP activity and NgR1 shedding could stimulate circuitry remodeling in the adult brain and enhance functional connectivity after brain injury.</p>

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu<br />  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini<br /> The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Jian   Ma, Zhongfu   Shen, Yong-Chun   Yu, Song-Hai   Shi<br /> Delineating the lineage of neural cells that captures the progressive steps in their specification is fundamental to understanding brain development, organization, and function. Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng<br /> Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Francesco   Petrelli, Paola   Bezzi<br /> Astrocytes, the largest glial population in human and murine brains, are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity. During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Le   Xiao, Peter   Scheiffele<br /> The view of cerebellar functions has been extended from controlling sensorimotor processes to processing ‘contextual’ information and generating predictions for a diverse range of behaviors. These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Carla EM   Golden, Joseph D   Buxbaum, Silvia   De Rubeis<br /> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are caused by a wide range of genetic mutations, a significant fraction of which reside in genes important for synaptic function. Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Yishi   Jin, Yingchuan B   Qi<br /> The ability of neurons to modify or remodel their synaptic connectivity is critical for the function of neural circuitry throughout the life of an animal. Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell<br /> When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. <br /><br />

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Elena   Marcello, Monica   Di Luca, Fabrizio   Gardoni<br /> In the last decade several synaptonuclear protein messengers including Jacob, CRTC1, AIDA-1, ProSaP2/Shank3 and RNF10 have been identified and characterized as key players for modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Mümine   Şentürk, Hugo J   Bellen<br />  Drosophila melanogaster is a genetic model organism that has contributed to the discovery of numerous genes whose human homologues are associated with diseases. The development of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate its genome accelerates the discovery of the genetic basis of undiagnosed human diseases and the elucidation of molecular pathogenic events of known and novel diseases. Here, we discuss various approaches used in flies to assess the function of the fly homologues of disease-associated genes. We highlight how systematic and combinatorial approaches based on recently established methods provide us with integrated tool sets that can be applied to the study of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. <br /><br />

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05219">Eligibility Traces and Plasticity on Behavioral Time Scales: Experimental Support of neoHebbian Three-Factor Learning Rules. (arXiv:1801.05219v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Most elementary behaviors such as moving the arm to grasp an object or
walking into the next room to explore a museum evolve on the time scale of
seconds; in contrast, neuronal action potentials occur on the time scale of a
few milliseconds. Learning rules of the brain must therefore bridge the gap
between these two different time scales.
</p>
<p>Modern theories of synaptic plasticity have postulated that the co-activation
of pre- and postsynaptic neurons sets a flag at the synapse, called an
eligibility trace, that leads to a weight change only if an additional factor
is present while the flag is set. This third factor, signaling reward,
punishment, surprise, or novelty, could be implemented by the phasic activity
of neuromodulators or specific neuronal inputs signaling special events. While
the theoretical framework has been developed over the last decades,
experimental evidence in support of eligibility traces on the time scale of
seconds has been collected only during the last few years.
</p>
<p>Here we review, in the context of three-factor rules of synaptic plasticity,
four key experiments that support the role of synaptic eligibility traces in
combination with a third factor as a biological implementation of neoHebbian
three-factor learning rules.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05151">Constraint-free Natural Image Reconstruction from fMRI Signals Based on Convolutional Neural Network. (arXiv:1801.05151v1 [cs.CV])</a></h4>

<p>In recent years, research on decoding brain activity based on functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has made remarkable achievements. However,
constraint-free natural image reconstruction from brain activity is still a
challenge. The existing methods simplified the problem by using semantic prior
information or just reconstructing simple images such as letters and digitals.
Without semantic prior information, we present a novel method to reconstruct
nature images from fMRI signals of human visual cortex based on the computation
model of convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, we extracted the units
output of viewed natural images in each layer of a pre-trained CNN as CNN
features. Secondly, we transformed image reconstruction from fMRI signals into
the problem of CNN feature visualizations by training a sparse linear
regression to map from the fMRI patterns to CNN features. By iteratively
optimization to find the matched image, whose CNN unit features become most
similar to those predicted from the brain activity, we finally achieved the
promising results for the challenging constraint-free natural image
reconstruction. As there was no use of semantic prior information of the
stimuli when training decoding model, any category of images (not constraint by
the training set) could be reconstructed theoretically. We found that the
reconstructed images resembled the natural stimuli, especially in position and
shape. The experimental results suggest that hierarchical visual features can
effectively express the visual perception process of human brain.

<p>Neurostimulation is a promising therapy for abating epileptic seizures.
However, it is extremely difficult to identify optimal stimulation patterns
experimentally. In this study human recordings are used to develop a functional
24 neuron network statistical model of hippocampal connectivity and dynamics.
Spontaneous seizure-like activity is induced in-silico in this reconstructed
neuronal network. The network is then used as a testbed to design and validate
a wide range of neurostimulation patterns. Commonly used periodic trains were
not able to permanently abate seizures at any frequency. A simulated annealing
global optimization algorithm was then used to identify an optimal stimulation
pattern which successfully abated 92% of seizures. Finally, in a fully
responsive, or "closed-loop" neurostimulation paradigm, the optimal stimulation
successfully prevented the network from entering the seizure state. We propose
that the framework presented here for algorithmically identifying
patient-specific neurostimulation patterns can greatly increase the efficacy of
neurostimulation devices for seizures.

<p>Functional subnetwork extraction is commonly used to explore the brain's
modular structure. However, reliable subnetwork extraction from functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains challenging due to the
pronounced noise in neuroimaging data. In this paper, we proposed a high order
relation informed approach based on hypergraph to combine the information from
multi-task data and resting state data to improve subnetwork extraction. Our
assumption is that task data can be beneficial for the subnetwork extraction
process, since the repeatedly activated nodes involved in diverse tasks might
be the canonical network components which comprise pre-existing repertoires of
resting state subnetworks. Our proposed high order relation informed subnetwork
extraction based on a strength information embedded hypergraph, (1) facilitates
the multisource integration for subnetwork extraction, (2) utilizes information
on relationships and changes between the nodes across different tasks, and (3)
enables the study on higher order relations among brain network nodes. On real
data, we demonstrated that fusing task activation, task-induced connectivity
and resting state functional connectivity based on hypergraphs improves
subnetwork extraction compared to employing a single source from either rest or
task data in terms of subnetwork modularity measure, inter-subject
reproducibility, along with more biologically meaningful subnetwork
assignments.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The presence and degree of specialization between the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) is a key issue in debates about the neural architecture of semantic memory. Here, we comprehensively assessed multiple aspects of semantic cognition in a large group of postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with left versus right anterior temporal lobectomy (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 40). Both subgroups showed deficits in expressive and receptive verbal semantic tasks, word and object recognition, naming and recognition of famous faces and perception of faces and emotions. Graded differences in performance between the left and right groups were secondary to the overall mild semantic impairment; primarily, left resected TLE patients showed weaker performance on tasks that required naming or accessing semantic information from a written word. Right resected TLE patients were relatively more impaired at recognizing famous faces as familiar, although this effect was observed less consistently. These findings unify previous partial, inconsistent results and also align directly with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation results in neurologically intact participants. Taken together, these data support a model in which the 2 ATLs act as a coupled bilateral system for the representation of semantic knowledge, and in which graded hemispheric specializations emerge as a consequence of differential connectivity to lateralized speech production and face perception regions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>During differentiation, neurons progressively restrict their fate repressing the expression of specific genes. Here we describe the involvement in such developmental steps of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), an epigenetic factor that participates to chromatin folding and transcriptional regulation. We previously reported that, due to transcriptional impairments, the maturation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span> null neurons is delayed. To evaluate whether this could stem from altered progenitors proliferation and differentiation, we investigated whether lack of Mecp2 affects these features both in vitro and in vivo. We show that in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span> null embryonic cortexes the expression of genes defining the identity of proliferating neuroprogenitors is enriched and that their permanence in the G1 phase is prolonged. Moreover, the number of cells transitioning from a stage of maturation to a more mature one is increased in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span> null embryonic cortices, in line with the central role of G1 for cell identity refinement. We thus suggest that, possibly due to the lack of proper transcriptional control normally exerted by Mecp2, fate refinement is impaired in developing null cells. We propose that the maturation delay affecting the developing <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span> null cortex originates, at least in part, from deranged mechanisms of cell fate refinement.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are more resilient than those in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in aging, schizophrenia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The current study compared glutamate and neuromodulatory actions in macaque V1 to those in dlPFC, and found striking regional differences. V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depended on AMPA receptors, with subtle NMDA receptor contributions, while dlPFC depends primarily on NMDA receptors. Neuromodulatory actions also differed between regions. In V1, cAMP signaling increased neuronal firing, and the phosphodiesterase PDE4A was positioned to regulate cAMP effects on glutamate release from axons. HCN channels in V1 were classically located on distal dendrites, and enhanced cell firing. These data contrast with dlPFC, where PDE4A and HCN channels are concentrated in thin spines, and cAMP-HCN signaling gates inputs and weakens firing. These regional differences may explain why V1 neurons are more resilient than dlPFC neurons to the challenges of age and disease.</span>

Using electrophysiology and optogenetics, Chiu et al. show that activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors selectively potentiates inhibition from somatostatin-expressing interneurons onto cortical pyramidal cells. This work suggests a mechanism for regulating the balance of excitation and inhibition in neuronal dendrites.

Plasticity of cortical responses involves activity-dependent changes at synapses, but the manner in which different forms of synaptic plasticity act together to create functional changes in neuronal responses remains unknown. Here we show that spike-timing induced receptive field plasticity of individual visual cortex neurons in vivo is anchored by increases in synaptic strength of identified spines, and is accompanied by a novel decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene Arc. Similar changes accompany recovery of eye-specific responses following monocular deprivation. These findings demonstrate that Hebbian strengthening of activated synapses and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent synapses, in dendrites with heterogeneous synaptic inputs, co-operatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional neuronal responses.

Background: The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders is biased towards males with male:female ratios of 2:1 in intellectual disability (ID) and 4:1 in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the molecular mechanisms of such bias remain unknown. While characterizing a mouse model for loss of the signaling scaffold coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1A (CC2D1A), which is mutated in ID and ASD, we identified biochemical and behavioral differences between males and females, and explored whether CC2D1A controls male-specific intracellular signaling. Methods: CC2D1A is known to regulate phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). We tested for activation PDE4D and downstream signaling molecules such as CREB in the hippocampus of Cc2d1a-deficient mice. We then performed behavioral studies in females to analyze learning and memory, social interactions, anxiety and hyperactivity. Finally, we targeted PDE4D activation with a PDE4D inhibitor to define how changes in PDE4D and CREB activity affect behavior in males and females. Results: We found that in Cc2d1a-deficient males PDE4D is hyperactive leading to a reduction in CREB signaling, but this molecular deficit is not present in females. Cc2d1a-deficient females only show impairment in novel object recognition, and no other cognitive and social deficits that have been found in males. Restoring PDE4D activity using an inhibitor rescues male-specific cognitive deficits, but has no effect on females. Conclusions: Our findings show that CC2D1A regulates intracellular signaling in a male-specific manner in the hippocampus leading to male-specific behavioral deficits. We propose that male-specific signaling mechanisms are involved in establishing sex bias in neurodevelopmental disorders.

The heart and pyloric rhythms of crustaceans have been studied extensively over many years. Local and hormonal neuromodulation and sensory inputs onto these central pattern generating circuits play a significant role in the animals' responses to perturbations, but are usually lost or removed during in vitro studies. To examine simultaneously the in vivo motor output of the heart and pyloric rhythms, we developed a technique using photoplethysmography (PPG). In the population tested (n = 53), heart rhythm frequencies were bimodal (peaks at ~ 0.7 Hz and ~ 1.1 Hz). The pyloric rhythms were normally distributed with a mean frequency of 0.8 Hz. Over 24 hour recordings, animals held at baseline conditions cycled in frequency. We calculated the correlations between the two rhythms at baseline conditions and found that in some animals the rhythms were highly correlated while in others they were not. To investigate how these rhythms behave in response to perturbation, we applied temperature ramps to animals by heating or cooling the saline bath while recording both the heart and pyloric muscle movements. Q10s, cirtical temperatures (temperatures at which function is compromised), and changes in frequency were calculated for each of the rhythms tested. Changes in frequency and Q10 values were not significantly different between the two rhythms while critical temperatures were significantly different, and the correlations between the two rhythms during these times were high.

A major challenge in neuroscience is to longitudinally monitor whole brain activity across multiple spatial scales in the same animal. Functional UltraSound (fUS) is an emerging technology that offers images of cerebral blood volume over large brain portions. Here we show for the first time its capability to resolve the functional organization of sensory systems at multiple scales in awake animals, both within structures by precisely mapping sensory responses, and between structures by elucidating the connectivity scheme of top-down projections. We demonstrate that fUS provides stable (over days), yet rapid, highly-resolved 3D tonotopic maps in the auditory pathway of awake ferrets, with unprecedented sharp functional resolution (100 micrometers). This was performed in four different brain regions, including small (1-2 mm3 size), subcortical (8 mm deep) and previously undescribed structures in the ferret. Furthermore, we used fUS to map long-distance projections from frontal cortex, a key source of sensory response modulation, to auditory cortex.

During threat assessment, the early detection of danger is highly adaptive, yet the fast orientation towards safety is also key to survival. The present study aimed to explore how the human brain searches for safety by manipulating subjects' attentional set to cues associated with shock probability. Subjects were asked to judge random dots motion (RDM) direction and could be shocked for incorrect responses (RDM task) while keeping alert in detecting the shock probability cues (cue detection task). In contrast to the safe condition, where subjects searched for cues associated with no shock probability, incorrect responses to 'dangerous+' (D+) cues would increase the shock probability and correct responses to 'dangerous-' (D-) cues would decrease shock probability. In the RDM task, results showed that relative to the D+, the safe attentional set resulted in stronger activation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a core region involved in flexible threat assessment and safety signalling. The vmPFC was also recruited by the D- compared to the D+ attentional set. In the cue detection task, shorter response times and greater accuracy were observed for D+ compared to D- and safe cues. Correspondingly, at the neural level D+ cues induced increased activity in the frontoparietal attention network including the inferior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus. Overall, our findings demonstrate that attentional set for searching safety recruits the vmPFC, while detection of threat elicits activity in the frontoparietal attention network, suggesting a new role for these regions in human defensive survival circuitry.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/249045v1?rss=1">Adaptation decorrelates shape representations</a></h4>

Perception and neural responses are modulated by sensory history. Visual adaptation, an example of such an effect, has been hypothesized to improve stimulus discrimination by decorrelating responses across a set of neural units. While a central theoretical model, behavioral and neural evidence for this theory is limited and inconclusive. Here, we use a parametric 3D shape-space to test whether adaptation decorrelates shape representations in humans. In a behavioral experiment with 20 participants, we find that adaptation to a shape class improves discrimination of subsequently presented stimuli with similar features. In a BOLD fMRI experiment with 10 participants we observe that adaptation to a shape class decorrelates the multivariate representations of subsequently presented stimuli with similar features in object-selective cortex. These results support the long-standing proposal that adaptation improves perceptual discrimination and decorrelates neural representations, offering insights into potential underlying mechanisms.

Differentiation of brain signal variability across different cognitive states has been hypothesized to facilitate adaptation to changing task demands, but why signal variability should be higher or lower on a given task remains unknown. We hypothesized that the level of brain signal variability should mirror the feature density of sensory input, especially in high performers. To test these hypotheses, we had 46 healthy older adults passively view face and house stimuli during fMRI. We first used a computational model of the ventral visual stream (HMAX) to decode the feature content of all face and house images seen by participants; model results revealed that house images were much more feature-rich than faces, particularly for V1- and V2-like model layers. Using fMRI, we then found that participants whose V1/V2 brain signal variability increased the most in response to more feature-rich visual input (houses vs. faces) also exhibited faster and more stable behavioral performance on a comprehensive battery of offline visual tasks. We conclude that the ability to align visuocortical signal variability to the density of visual input may mark heightened trait-level behavioral performance in older adults.

Birdsong is a complex vocalization that bears important similarities to human speech. Critical to recognizing speech or birdsong is the ability to discriminate between similar sequences of sound that may carry different meanings. The caudal mesopallium (CM) is a secondary area in the auditory system of songbirds that is a potential site for song identification, displaying both between-category selectivity and within-category tolerance to conspecific song. Electrophysiological studies of CM have identified a population of neurons with intrinsically phasic firing patterns in addition to the more typical tonic and fast-spiking neurons. The function of these phasic neurons in processing spectrotemporally complex conspecific vocalizations is not known. We investigated the auditory response properties of phasic and tonic neurons using computational modeling with particular focus on the selectivity and entropy of the simulated responses to birdsong. When biophysical models of phasic and tonic neurons were presented with identical inputs, the phasic models were more selective among syllables and more robust to noise-induced variability, potentially providing an advantage for song identification. Additionally, the overall responsiveness of a model to the stimulus set determined which decoding metric better captured the coding strategy of the model's response. The relationships between measures of decodability found in the model simulations are consistent with extracellular data from zebra finch CM.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248989v1?rss=1">Astrocyte networks and intercellular calcium propagation</a></h4>

Astrocytes organize in complex networks through connections by gap junction channels that are regulated by extra- and intracellular signals. Calcium signals generated in individual cells, can propagate across these networks in the form of intercellular calcium waves, mediated by diffusion of second messengers molecules such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The mechanisms underpinning the large variety of spatiotemporal patterns of propagation of astrocytic calcium waves however remain a matter of investigation. In the last decade, awareness has grown on the morphological diversity of astrocytes as well as their connections in networks, which seem dependent on the brain area, developmental stage, and the ultrastructure of the associated neuropile. It is speculated that this diversity underpins an equal functional variety but the current experimental techniques are limited in supporting this hypothesis because they do not allow to resolve the exact connectivity of astrocyte networks in the brain. With this aim we present a general framework to model intercellular calcium wave propagation in astrocyte networks and use it to specifically investigate how different network topologies could influence shape, frequency and propagation of these waves.

Some evidence suggests that there may be a limited "window of opportunity" for beneficial effects of hormone therapy on physiology after menopause in women. We tested, in aged, surgically menopausal (ovariectomized) rhesus monkeys, whether the timing of cyclic estradiol (E2) treatment impacted its effect on cognitive function. Monkeys were assigned to one of four treatment conditions after ovariectomy: either vehicle or E2 treatment for the duration of the protocol, vehicle for the first 2 years of the protocol followed by E2 for the remainder (delayed treatment), or E2 for the first year of the protocol followed by vehicle for the remainder (withdrawn treatment). Delayed treatment addressed the hypothesis that E2 treatment initiated more than 2 years after ovariectomy would have a reduced effect on cognitive function. Withdrawn treatment mirrors current clinical advice to women to use hormone therapy in the initial post-menopausal period then discontinue it. Two periods of cognitive testing assessed treatment effects on cognition over time. E2 treatment predominantly affected a prefrontal cortex-dependent test of spatiotemporal working memory (delayed response). Monkeys with delayed E2 treatment improved in delayed response performance over time, whereas vehicle-treated monkeys declined. Monkeys with withdrawn E2 treatment maintained their performance across assessments, as did monkeys treated with E2 across the entire protocol. These findings suggest that a "window of opportunity" for hormone treatment after cessation of ovarian function, if present in nonhuman primates, lasts longer than 2 years. It also supports the notion that beneficial effects of hormone therapy may persist after discontinuation of treatment.

The steroid hormone testosterone (T) has been suggested to influence reactive aggression upon its action on the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a key brain region for threat detection. However, it is unclear whether T modulates resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the BLA, and whether this predicts subsequent aggressive behavior. Aggressive interactions themselves, which often induce changes in T concentrations, could further alter BLA rsFC, but this too remains untested. Here we investigated the effect of endogenous T on rsFC of the BLA at baseline as well as after an aggressive encounter, and whether this related to behavioral aggression in healthy young women (n=39). Pre-scan T was negatively correlated with basal rsFC between BLA and left superior temporal gyrus (STG), which in turn predicted increased aggression. BLA-STG coupling at rest might thus underlie hostile readiness in low-T women. In addition, coupling between the BLA and the right superior parietal lobule (SPL), a brain region involved in higher-order perceptual processes, was reduced in aggressive participants. On the other hand, post-task increases in rsFC between BLA and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) were linked to reduced aggression, consistent with the established notion that the mOFC regulates amygdala activity in order to curb aggressive impulses. Finally, competition-induced changes in T were associated with increased coupling between the BLA and the right lateral OFC, but this effect was unrelated to aggression. We thus identified connectivity patterns that prospectively predict aggression in women, and showed how aggressive interactions in turn impact these neural systems.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248864v1?rss=1">Spike sorting with Gaussian mixture models</a></h4>

The shape of extracellularly recorded action potentials is a product of several variables, such as the biophysical and anatomical properties of the neuron and the relative position of the electrode. This allows for isolating spikes of different neurons recorded in the same channel into clusters based on waveform features. However, correctly classifying spike waveforms into their underlying neuronal sources remains a main challenge. This process, called spike sorting, typically consists of two steps: (1) extracting relevant waveform features (e.g., height, width), and (2) clustering them into non-overlapping groups believed to correspond to different neurons. In this study, we explored the performance of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in these two steps. We extracted relevant waveform features using a combination of common techniques (e.g., principal components and wavelets) and GMM fitting parameters (e.g., standard deviations and peak distances). Then, we developed an approach to perform unsupervised clustering using GMMs, which estimates cluster properties in a data-driven way. Our results show that the proposed GMM-based framework outperforms previously established methods when using realistic simulations of extracellular spikes and actual extracellular recordings to evaluate sorting performance. We also discuss potentially better techniques for feature extraction than the widely used principal components. Finally, we provide a friendly graphical user interface in MATLAB to run our algorithm, which allows for manual adjustment of the automatic results.

Organisms use environmental cues for directed navigation. Depending on the sensory modality and complexity of the involved sensory organs, different types of information may be processed. Understanding the basic logic behind navigational decisions critically depends on the complexity of the nervous system. Due to the comparably simple organization of the nervous system the fruit fly larva, it stands as a powerful model to study decision-making processes that underlie directed navigation. Here, we formulate a stochastic method based on biased Markov chains to model the behavioral basis of negative phototaxis. In our model, larvae aim to minimize their exposure to light intensity and at the same time maximize their distance to the source of light. In addition, we quantitatively measure phototaxis in response to defined sensory input. Larvae make navigational decisions by taking into account both light intensities and its spatial gradients. This non-linear response to the light field saturates above an intensity threshold. The mathematical model allows to simulate and predict larval behavioral dynamics by using only light intensity and directionality as input parameters. Moreover, it allows us to evaluate the relative importance of these two factors governing visual navigation. The model has been validated with experimental biological data yielding insight into the internal strategy that larvae use to achieve their goal with respect to the navigational cue of light, paving the way for future work to study the role of the different neuronal components in this mechanism.

Haploid cells are increasingly used for screening of complex pathways in animal genomes. Hemizygous mutations introduced through viral insertional mutagenesis can be directly selected for phenotypic changes. Here we present HaSAPPy a tool for analysing sequencing datasets of screens using insertional mutations in large pools of haploid cells. Candidate gene prediction is implemented through identification of enrichment of insertional mutations after selection by simultaneously evaluating several parameters. We have developed HaSAPPy for analysis of genetic screens for silencing factors of X chromosome inactivation in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells. To benchmark the performance, we further analyse several datasets of genetic screens in human haploid cells for which candidates have been validated. Our results support the effective candidate prediction strategy of HaSAPPy. HaSAPPy is implemented in Python, licensed under the MIT license, and is available from https://github.com/gdiminin/HaSAPPy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3K4LRTS9Xj4" width="1" />

The dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R) are important targets for antipsychotics and for the treatment of drug abuse. SB269652, a bitopic ligand that simultaneously binds both the orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in both D2R and D3R, was found to be a negative allosteric modulator. Previous studies identified Glu<sup>2.65</sup> in the SBP to be a key determinant of both the affinity of SB269652 and the magnitude of its cooperativity with orthosteric ligands, as the E<sup>2.65</sup>A mutation decreased both of these parameters. However, the proposed hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Glu<sup>2.65</sup> and the indole moiety of SB269652 is not a strong interaction, and a structure activity relationship study of SB269652 indicates that this H-bond may not be the only element that determines its allosteric properties. To understand the structural basis of the observed phenotype of E<sup>2.65</sup>A, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with a cumulative length of ~77 μs of D2R and D3R wild-type and their E<sup>2.65</sup>A mutants bound to SB269652. In combination with Markov state model analysis and by characterizing the equilibria of ligand binding modes in different conditions, we found that in both D2R and D3R, whereas the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety of SB269652 is stably bound in the OBS, the indole-2-carboxamide moiety is dynamic and only intermittently forms H-bonds with Glu<sup>2.65</sup>. Our results also indicate that the E<sup>2.65</sup>A mutation significantly affects the overall shape and size of the SBP, as well as the conformation of the N terminus. Thus, our findings suggest that the key role of Glu<sup>2.65</sup> in mediating the allosteric properties of SB269652 extends beyond a direct interaction with SB269652, and provide structural insights for rational design of SB269652 derivatives that may retain its allosteric properties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vUXB3FyjueQ" width="1" />

<p>by Rajita Menon, Vivek Ramanan, Kirill S. Korolev</p>

Microbiota contribute to many dimensions of host phenotype, including disease. To link specific microbes to specific phenotypes, microbiome-wide association studies compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples. Abundance differences, however, reflect not only direct associations with the phenotype, but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. We found that microbial interactions could easily generate a large number of spurious associations that provide no mechanistic insight. Using techniques from statistical physics, we developed a method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Our method corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in the inflammatory bowel disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ghtaTpcnfg4" width="1" />

Synchronization of neural oscillations as a mechanism of brain function is attracting increasing attention. Neural oscillation is a rhythmic neural activity that can be easily observed by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). Neural oscillations show the same frequency and cross-frequency synchronization for various cognitive and perceptual functions. However, it is unclear how this neural synchronization is achieved by a dynamical system. If neural oscillations are weakly coupled oscillators, the dynamics of neural synchronization can be described theoretically using a phase oscillator model. We propose an estimation method to identify the phase oscillator model from real data of cross-frequency synchronized activities. The proposed method can estimate the coupling function governing the properties of synchronization. Furthermore, we examine the reliability of the proposed method using time-series data obtained from numerical simulation and an electronic circuit experiment, and show that our method can estimate the coupling function correctly. Finally, we estimate the coupling function between EEG oscillation and the speech sound envelope, and discuss the validity of these results.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2Kx1kMq3n-k" width="1" />

<p>by Jacob C. Kimmel, Amy Y. Chang, Andrew S. Brack, Wallace F. Marshall</p>

Cell populations display heterogeneous and dynamic phenotypic states at multiple scales. Similar to molecular features commonly used to explore cell heterogeneity, cell behavior is a rich phenotypic space that may allow for identification of relevant cell states. Inference of cell state from cell behavior across a time course may enable the investigation of dynamics of transitions between heterogeneous cell states, a task difficult to perform with destructive molecular observations. Cell motility is one such easily observed cell behavior with known biomedical relevance. To investigate heterogenous cell states and their dynamics through the lens of cell behavior, we developed Heteromotility, a software tool to extract quantitative motility features from timelapse cell images. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), myoblasts, and muscle stem cells (MuSCs), Heteromotility analysis identifies multiple motility phenotypes within the population. In all three systems, the motility state identity of individual cells is dynamic. Quantification of state transitions reveals that MuSCs undergoing activation transition through progressive motility states toward the myoblast phenotype. Transition rates during MuSC activation suggest non-linear kinetics. By probability flux analysis, we find that this MuSC motility state system breaks detailed balance, while the MEF and myoblast systems do not. Balanced behavior state transitions can be captured by equilibrium formalisms, while unbalanced switching between states violates equilibrium conditions and would require an external driving force. Our data indicate that the system regulating cell behavior can be decomposed into a set of attractor states which depend on the identity of the cell, together with a set of transitions between states. These results support a conceptual view of a cell populations as dynamical systems, responding to inputs from signaling pathways and generating outputs in the form of state transitions and observable motile behaviors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zgpmnQO7N_w" width="1" />

Ideal decision-makers should constantly assess all sources of information about opportunities and threats, and be able to redetermine their choices promptly in the face of change. However, perpetual monitoring and reassessment impose inordinate sensing and computational costs, making them impractical for animals and machines alike. The obvious alternative of committing for extended periods of time to limited sensory strategies associated with particular courses of action can be dangerous and wasteful. Here, we explore the intermediate possibility of making provisional temporal commitments whilst admitting interruption based on limited broader observation. We simulate foraging under threat of predation to elucidate the benefits of such a scheme. We relate our results to diseases of distractibility and roving attention, and consider mechanistic substrates such as noradrenergic neuromodulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k-qhdPPb-R0" width="1" />

<p>by Daisuke Sato, Rose E. Dixon, Luis F. Santana, Manuel F. Navedo</p>

In ventricular myocytes, membrane depolarization during the action potential (AP) causes synchronous activation of multiple L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (LTCCs), which trigger the release of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This results in an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>i</sub>) that initiates contraction. During <i>pulsus alternans</i>, cardiac contraction is unstable, going from weak to strong in successive beats despite a constant heart rate. These cardiac alternans can be caused by the instability of membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) due to steep AP duration (APD) restitution (V<sub>m</sub>-driven alternans), instability of Ca<sub>i</sub> cycling (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven alternans), or both, and may be modulated by functional coupling between clustered Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (e.g. cooperative gating). Here, mathematical analysis and computational models were used to determine how changes in the strength of cooperative gating between LTCCs may impact membrane voltage and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the heart. We found that increasing the degree of coupling between LTCCs increases the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (I<sub>CaL</sub>) and prolongs AP duration (APD). Increased AP duration is known to promote cardiac alternans, a potentially arrhythmogenic substrate. In addition, our analysis shows that increasing the strength of cooperative activation of LTCCs makes the coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the membrane voltage (Ca<sub>i</sub>→V<sub>m</sub> coupling) more positive and destabilizes the V<sub>m</sub>-Ca<sub>i</sub> dynamics for V<sub>m</sub>-driven alternans and Ca<sub>i</sub>-driven alternans, but not for quasiperiodic oscillation. These results suggest that cooperative gating of LTCCs may have a major impact on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, not only by prolonging APD, but also by altering Ca<sub>i</sub>→V<sub>m</sub> coupling and potentially promoting cardiac arrhythmias.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bxIzGj3eW-A" width="1" />

Transcriptome-wide time series expression profiling is used to characterize the cellular response to environmental perturbations. The first step to analyzing transcriptional response data is often to cluster genes with similar responses. Here, we present a nonparametric model-based method, Dirichlet process Gaussian process mixture model (DPGP), which jointly models cluster number with a Dirichlet process and temporal dependencies with Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the accuracy of DPGP in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches using hundreds of simulated data sets. To further test our method, we apply DPGP to published microarray data from a microbial model organism exposed to stress and to novel RNA-seq data from a human cell line exposed to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We validate our clusters by examining local transcription factor binding and histone modifications. Our results demonstrate that jointly modeling cluster number and temporal dependencies can reveal shared regulatory mechanisms.

<p>A large body of compelling evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that
embodiment - the agent's physical setup, including its shape, materials,
sensors and actuators - is constitutive for any form of cognition and as a
consequence, models of cognition need to be embodied. In contrast to methods
from empirical sciences to study cognition, robots can be freely manipulated
and virtually all key variables of their embodiment and control programs can be
systematically varied. As such, they provide an extremely powerful tool of
investigation. We present a robotic bottom-up or developmental approach,
focusing on three stages: (a) low-level behaviors like walking and reflexes,
(b) learning regularities in sensorimotor spaces, and (c) human-like cognition.
We also show that robotic based research is not only a productive path to
deepening our understanding of cognition, but that robots can strongly benefit
from human-like cognition in order to become more autonomous, robust,
resilient, and safe.

<p>Time series measured from real spatially extended systems are generally
noisy, complex and display statistical properties that evolve continuously over
time. Here, we present a method that combines wavelet analysis and
non-stationary surrogates to detect spatial coherent patterns in non-
stationary multivariate time-series. In contrast with classical methods, the
surrogate data used here are realisations of a non-stationary linear stochastic
process, preserving both the amplitude and time-frequency distributions of
original data. These surrogate data are used in combination with an extension
of the wavelet coherence to multivariate signals to detect short-lived coherent
spatial patterns. We evaluate this framework on synthetic and real-world time
series, and we show that it can provide useful insights into the time-resolved
structure of spatially extended systems.

<p>The formation of pattern in biological systems may be modeled by a set of
reaction-diffusion equations. A diffusion-type coupling operator biologically
significant in neuroscience is a difference of Gaussian functions (Mexican Hat
operator) used as a spatial-convolution kernel. We are interested in the
difference among behaviors of \emph{stochastic} neural field equations, namely
space-time stochastic differential-integral equations, and similar
deterministic ones. We explore, quantitatively, how the parameters of our model
that measure the shape of the coupling kernel, coupling strength, and aspects
of the spatially-smoothed space-time noise, control the pattern in the
resulting evolving random field. We find that a spatial pattern that is damped
in time in a deterministic system may be sustained and amplified by
stochasticity, most strikingly at an optimal spatio-temporal noise level. In
addition, we find that spatially-smoothed noise alone causes pattern formation
even without spatial coupling.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04623">Sex differences in network controllability as a predictor of executive function in youth. (arXiv:1801.04623v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Executive function emerges late in development and displays different
developmental trends in males and females. Sex differences in executive
function in youth have been linked to vulnerability to psychopathology as well
as to behaviors that impinge on health. Yet, the neurobiological basis of these
differences is not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that sex
differences in executive function in youth stem from sex differences in the
controllability of structural brain networks as they rewire over development.
Combining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we
characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks
estimated from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample
of 882 youth aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these
networks by estimating average and modal controllability, two statistics that
probe the ease with which brain areas can drive the network towards easy-
versus difficult-to-reach states. We find that females have higher modal
controllability in frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions while males have
higher average controllability in frontal and subcortical regions. Furthermore,
average controllability values in the medial frontal cortex and subcortex, both
higher in males, are negatively related to executive function. Finally, we find
that average controllability predicts sex-dependent individual differences in
activation during an n-back working memory task. Taken together, our findings
support the notion that sex differences in the controllability of structural
brain networks can partially explain sex differences in executive function.
Controllability of structural brain networks also predicts features of
task-relevant activation, suggesting the potential for controllability to
represent context-specific constraints on network state more generally.

<p>Finding actions that satisfy the constraints imposed by both external inputs
and internal representations is central to decision making. We demonstrate that
some important classes of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can be solved
by networks composed of homogeneous cooperative-competitive modules that have
connectivity similar to motifs observed in the superficial layers of neocortex.
The winner-take-all modules are sparsely coupled by programming neurons that
embed the constraints onto the otherwise homogeneous modular computational
substrate. We show rules that embed any instance of the CSPs planar four-color
graph coloring, maximum independent set, and Sudoku on this substrate, and
provide mathematical proofs that guarantee these graph coloring problems will
convergence to a solution. The network is composed of non-saturating linear
threshold neurons. Their lack of right saturation allows the overall network to
explore the problem space driven through the unstable dynamics generated by
recurrent excitation. The direction of exploration is steered by the constraint
neurons. While many problems can be solved using only linear inhibitory
constraints, network performance on hard problems benefits significantly when
these negative constraints are implemented by non-linear multiplicative
inhibition. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of instability
rather than stability in network computation, and also offer insight into the
computational role of dual inhibitory mechanisms in neural circuits.

<p>Brain Electroencephalography (EEG) classification is widely applied to
analyze cerebral diseases in recent years. Unfortunately, invalid/noisy EEGs
degrade the diagnosis performance and most previously developed methods ignore
the necessity of EEG selection for classification. To this end, this paper
proposes a novel maximum weight clique-based EEG selection approach, named
mwcEEGs, to map EEG selection to searching maximum similarity-weighted cliques
from an improved Fr\'{e}chet distance-weighted undirected EEG graph
simultaneously considering edge weights and vertex weights. Our mwcEEGs
improves the classification performance by selecting intra-clique pairwise
similar and inter-clique discriminative EEGs with similarity threshold
$\delta$. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm effectiveness compared
with the state-of-the-art time series selection algorithms on real-world EEG
datasets.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248583v1?rss=1">Finding decodable information that is read out in behaviour</a></h4>

Multivariate decoding methods applied to neuroimaging data have become the standard in cognitive neuroscience for unravelling statistical dependencies between brain activation patterns and experimental conditions. The current challenge is to demonstrate that information decoded as such by the experimenter is in fact used by the brain itself to guide behaviour. Here we demonstrate a promising approach to do so in the context of neural activation during object perception and categorisation behaviour. We first localised decodable information about visual objects in the human brain using a spatially-unbiased multivariate decoding analysis. We then related brain activation patterns to behaviour using a machine-learning based extension of signal detection theory. We show that while there is decodable information about visual category throughout the visual brain, only a subset of those representations predicted categorisation behaviour, located mainly in anterior ventral temporal cortex. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of neuroimaging studies, highlight the importance of relating decoding results to behaviour, and suggest a suitable methodology towards this aim.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248518v1?rss=1">Predicting age from cortical structure across the lifespan</a></h4>

Despite inter-individual differences in cortical structure, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated a large degree of population-level consistency in age-related differences in brain morphology. The present study assessed how accurately an individual's age could be predicted by estimates of cortical morphology, comparing a variety of structural measures, including thickness, gyrification, and fractal dimensionality. Structural measures were calculated across up to seven different parcellation approaches, ranging from 1 region to 1000 regions. The age-prediction framework was trained using morphological measures obtained from T1-weighted MRI volumes collected from multiple sites, yielding a training dataset of 1056 healthy adults, aged 18-97. Age predictions were calculated using a machine-learning approach that incorporated non-linear differences over the lifespan. In two independent, held-out test samples, age predictions had a median error of 6-7 years. Age predictions were best when using a combination of cortical metrics, both thickness and fractal dimensionality. Overall, the results reveal that age-related differences in brain structure are systematic enough to enable reliable age prediction based on metrics of cortical morphology.

Treatment of medically intractable focal epilepsy (MIFE) by surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is often effective provided the EZ can be reliably identified. Even with the use of invasive recordings, the clinical differentiation between the EZ and normal brain areas can be quite challenging, mainly in patients without MRI detectable lesions. Consequently, despite relatively large brain regions being removed, surgical success rates barely reach 60-65%. Such variable and unfavorable outcomes associated with high morbidity rates are often caused by imprecise and/or inaccurate EZ localization. We developed a localization algorithm that uses network-based data analytics to process invasive EEG recordings. This network algorithm analyzes the centrality signatures of every contact electrode within the recording network and characterizes contacts into susceptible EZ based on the centrality trends over time. The algorithm was tested in a retrospective study that included 42 patients from four epilepsy centers. Our algorithm had higher agreement with EZ regions identified by clinicians for patients with successful surgical outcomes and less agreement for patients with failed outcomes. These findings suggest that network analytics and a network systems perspective of epilepsy may be useful in assisting clinicians in more accurately localizing the EZ.

Methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (Mbd2) binds methylated DNA and was shown to play an important role in cancer and immunity but its role in brain function is mostly unknown. Here we show that MBD2 deficiency in mice results in deficits in cognitive, social and emotional functions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) revealed that Mbd2 binds to regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in the hippocampus. Loss of Mbd2 alters the expression of hundreds of genes with a robust down-regulation of neuronal gene pathways. Genes down-regulated by loss of Mbd2 are highly enriched for ortholog ASD risk genes Further, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found an altered DNA methylation pattern in regulatory DNA regions of neuronal specific genes in Mbd2 deficient mice. Taken together, our data suggest Mbd2 regulates hippocampal DNA methylation landscape to control neuronal gene expression and behavior.

Background: Amplitude modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS) has been recently proposed as a possible solution to overcome the pronounced stimulation artifact encountered when recording brain activity during tACS. In theory, AM-tACS does not entail power at its modulating frequency, thus avoiding the problem of spectral overlap between brain signal of interest and stimulation artifact. However, the current study demonstrates how weak non-linear transfer characteristics inherent in stimulation and recording hardware can reintroduce spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency. Method: The input-output transfer functions (TFs) of different stimulation setups were measured. The setups included basic recordings of signal-generator and stimulator outputs as well as M/EEG phantom measurements. 6th-degree polynomial regression models were fitted to model the input-output TFs of each setup. The resulting TF models were applied to digitally generated AM-tACS signals to predict the location of spurious artifacts in the spectrum. Results: All four setups measured for the study exhibited low-frequency artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics when recording AM-tACS. Fitted TF models showed non-linear contributions significantly different from zero (all p &lt; .05) and successfully predicted the frequency of artifacts observed in AM-signal recordings. Conclusions: Our results suggest that even weak non-linearities of stimulation and recording hardware can lead to spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics. Thus, findings emphasize the need for more linear stimulation devices for AM-tACS and careful analysis procedures taking into account these low-frequency artifacts.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245530v1?rss=1">Analysis of functional connectivity and oscillatory power using DICS: from raw MEG data to group-level statistics in Python</a></h4>

Communication between brain regions is thought to be facilitated by the synchronization of oscillatory activity. Hence, large-scale functional networks within the brain may be estimated by measuring synchronicity between regions. Neurophysiological recordings, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), provide a direct measure of oscillatory neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution. In this paper, we describe a full data analysis pipeline for functional connectivity analysis based on dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) of MEG data. DICS is a beamforming technique in the frequency-domain that allows the study of the cortical sources of oscillatory activity and synchronization between brain regions. All the analysis steps, starting from the raw MEG data up to publication-ready group-level statistics and visualization, are discussed in depth, including methodological considerations, rules of thumb and tradeoffs. We start by computing cross-spectral density (CSD) matrices using a wavelet approach in several frequency bands (alpha, theta, beta, gamma). We then provide a way to create comparable source spaces across subjects and discuss the cortical mapping of spectral power. For connectivity analysis, we present a canonical computation of coherence that facilitates a stable estimation of all-to-all connectivity. Finally, we use group-level statistics to limit the network to cortical regions for which significant differences between experimental conditions are detected and produce vertex- and parcel-level visualizations of the different brain networks. Code examples using the MNE-Python package are provided at each step, guiding the reader through a complete analysis of the freely available openfMRI ds000117 "familiar vs. unfamiliar vs. scrambled faces" dataset. The goal is to educate both novice and experienced data analysts with the "tricks of the trade" necessary to successfully perform this type of analysis on their own data.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03984">A Brain-Inspired Trust Management Model to Assure Security in a Cloud based IoT Framework for Neuroscience Applications. (arXiv:1801.03984v1 [cs.CR])</a></h4>

<p>Rapid popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing permits
neuroscientists to collect multilevel and multichannel brain data to better
understand brain functions, diagnose diseases, and devise treatments. To ensure
secure and reliable data communication between end-to-end (E2E) devices
supported by current IoT and cloud infrastructure, trust management is needed
at the IoT and user ends. This paper introduces a Neuro-Fuzzy based
Brain-inspired trust management model (TMM) to secure IoT devices and relay
nodes, and to ensure data reliability. The proposed TMM utilizes node
behavioral trust and data trust estimated using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
System and weighted-additive methods respectively to assess the nodes
trustworthiness. In contrast to the existing fuzzy based TMMs, the NS2
simulation results confirm the robustness and accuracy of the proposed TMM in
identifying malicious nodes in the communication network. With the growing
usage of cloud based IoT frameworks in Neuroscience research, integrating the
proposed TMM into the existing infrastructure will assure secure and reliable
data communication among the E2E devices.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248385v1?rss=1">Sampling Neuron Morphologies</a></h4>

The intricate morphology of neurons has fascinated since the dawn of neuroscience, and yet, it is hard to synthesize them. Current algorithms typically define a growth process with parameters that allow matching aspects of the morphologies. However, such algorithmic growth processes are far simpler than the biological ones. What is needed is an algorithm that, given a database of morphologies, produces more of those. Here, we introduce a generator for neuron morphologies that is based on a statistical sampling process. Our Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method starts with a trivial neuron and iteratively perturbs the morphology bringing the features close to those of the database. By quantifying the statistics of the generated neurons, we find that it outperforms growth-based models for many features. Good generative models for neuron morphologies promise to be important both for neural simulations and for morphology reconstructions from imaging data.

Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target the murine <em>Gfap</em> transcript, and screened using primary mouse cortical cultures. Lead oligonucleotides were then tested for their ability to reduce GFAP transcripts and protein, first in wild-type mice with normal levels of GFAP, and then in adult mutant mice with established pathology and elevated levels of GFAP.</p></div></div>

Finally, treatment led to improved body condition and rescue of hippocampal neurogenesis.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25128-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, are a prominent component of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrates during multiple sclerosis (MS) and the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although myeloid cells are generally thought to be proinflammatory, alternatively polarized subsets can serve noninflammatory and/or reparative functions. Here we investigate the heterogeneity and biological properties of myeloid cells during central nervous system autoimmunity.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25128-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Myeloid cell phenotypes in chronic active MS lesions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, immune cells were isolated from the CNS during exacerbations and remissions of EAE and characterized by flow cytometric, genetic, and functional assays.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25128-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Myeloid cells expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicative of a proinflammatory phenotype, were detected in the actively demyelinating rim of chronic active MS lesions, whereas macrophages expressing mannose receptor (CD206), a marker of alternatively polarized human myeloid cells, were enriched in the quiescent lesion core. During EAE, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells, as well as microglia, shifted from expression of proinflammatory markers to expression of noninflammatory markers immediately prior to clinical remissions. Murine CNS myeloid cells expressing the alternative lineage marker arginase-1 (Arg1) were partially derived from iNOS<sup>+</sup> precursors and were deficient in activating encephalitogenic T cells compared with their Arg1<sup>−</sup> counterparts.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25128-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>These observations demonstrate the heterogeneity of CNS myeloid cells, their evolution during the course of autoimmune demyelinating disease, and their plasticity on the single cell level.

<div class="section" id="ana25125-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Reversible myelin vacuolization is associated with variable conditions including mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS), which is characterized by mildly impaired consciousness and transient splenial lesion. Familial and/or recurrent cases with a clinical diagnosis of MERS suggest the presence of genetic factors.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25125-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We examined a family in which the proband presented with a history of recurrent encephalopathy with extensive but reversible cerebral myelin vacuolization and neurological symptoms similar to those of MERS spanning 3 generations. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in family members.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25125-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Eight rare nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants shared by all patients were identified. By filtering genes expressed in the corpus callosum, we identified a heterozygous c.1208A&gt;G predicting p.Gln403Arg in the highly conserved DNA-binding domain in the myelin regulatory factor (<em>MYRF</em>) gene. We subsequently screened the coding regions of <em>MYRF</em> by Sanger sequencing in our cohort comprised of 33 sporadic cases with MERS and 3 cases in another family with extensive myelin vacuolization, and identified the same heterozygous c.1208A&gt;G in all affected members in the second family. Luciferase assay revealed that transcriptional activity of the N-terminal region of <em>MYRF</em> was significantly diminished by introducing the c.1208A&gt;G variant.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25125-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>MYRF is a transcriptional regulator that is necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin maintenance.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Grey matter (GM) atrophy occurs in all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes. We investigated whether there is a spatiotemporal pattern of GM atrophy that is associated with faster disability accumulation in MS.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We analysed 3,604 brain high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans from 1,417 participants: 1,214 MS patients (253 clinically-isolated syndrome[CIS], 708 relapsing-remitting[RRMS], 128 secondary-progressive[SPMS], 125 primary-progressive[PPMS]), over an average follow-up of 2.41 years (standard deviation[SD]=1.97), and 203 healthy controls (HCs) [average follow-up=1.83 year, SD=1.77], attending 7 European centres. Disability was assessed with the Expanded-Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed-models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: SPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio=0.73, 95% CIs 0.65, 0.82; <em>p</em>&lt;0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (-1.45%), PPMS (-1.66%), and RRMS (-1.34%) than CIS (-0.88%) and HCs (-0.94%)[<em>p</em>&lt;0.01]. The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (-0.76%), CIS (-0.75%), and HCs (-0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.24-%) was faster than CIS (-0.63%) and HCs (-0.23%) (all p values &lt;0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta=0.04, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: This large multi-centre and longitudinal study shows that DGM volume loss drives disability accumulation in MS, and that temporal cortical GM shows accelerated atrophy in SPMS than RRMS. The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic epilepsy syndrome defined by seizures and progressive neurological disabilities, including cognitive impairments, anxiety and depression. Here, human TLE specimens were investigated focusing on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) Complex 1 (mTORC1) and Complex 2 (mTORC2) activities in the brain, as both pathways may represent unique targets for treatment.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Surgically resected hippocampal and temporal lobe samples from therapy-resistant TLE patients were analyzed by Western blotting to quantify the expression of established mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity markers and upstream or downstream signaling pathways involving the two complexes. Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to assess hippocampal and neocortical structural abnormalities and cell-specific expression of individual biomarkers. Samples from patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II served as positive controls.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: We found significantly increased expression of phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), phospho-S6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-Akt (Ser473) in TLE samples compared to controls, consistent with activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Our work identified the PI3K and Ras/ERK signaling pathways as potential mTORC1 and mTORC2 upstream activators. In addition, we found that overactive mTORC2 signaling was accompanied by induction of two Akt-dependent pro-survival pathways, as evidenced by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of FoxO3a (Ser253) and GSK-β (Ser9).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Our data demonstrate that mTOR signaling is significantly dysregulated in human TLE, offering new targets for pharmacologic interventions. Specifically, clinically available drugs that suppress mTORC1 without compromising mTOR2 signaling, such as rapamycin and its analogs, may represent a new group of antiepileptogenic agents in TLE patients.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome involving multiple molecular pathways. The development of biomarkers for use in therapeutic trials is a priority. We sought to use a high-throughput proteomic method to identify novel biomarkers in individual cerebrospinal fluid samples.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with label-free quantification was used to identify cerebrospinal fluid proteins using samples from a well-characterised longitudinal cohort comprising patients with ALS (n=43), the upper motor neuron variant primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, n=6), cross-sectional healthy (n=20) and disease controls (Parkinsons's n=20, ALS mimic disorders n=12).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Three macrophage-derived chitinases showed increased abundance in ALS: chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) and chitinase-3-like protein 2 (CHI3L2). Elevated CHI3L1 was common to ALS and PLS, whereas CHIT1 and CHI3L2 levels differed. Chitinase levels correlated with disease progression rate (CHIT1 r=0.56, p&lt;0.001; CHI3L1 r=0.31, p=0.028; CHI3L2 r=0.29, p=0.044). CHIT1, CHI3L1 and CHI3L2 levels correlated with phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH; r=0.62, p&lt;0.001; r=0.49, p&lt;0.001; r=0.41, p&lt;0.001). CHI3L1 levels, but not CHIT1 or CHI3L2, increased over time in those with low initial levels (gradient=0.005 log abundance units/month, p=0.001). High CHIT1 was associated with shortened survival (HR 2.84, p=0.009). Inclusion of pNFH in survival models left only an association of pNFH and survival (HR 1.26, p=0.019).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been consistently implicated through various experimental paradigms. These results support a key role for macrophage activity in ALS pathogenesis, offering novel target engagement and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for neuroinflammation-focused ALS therapy.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Restoring the circulation is the primary goal in emergency treatment of cerebral ischemia. However, better understanding of how the brain responds to energy depletion could inform the time available for resuscitation until irreversible damage and advance development of interventions that prolong this span. Experimentally, injury to central neurons begins only with anoxic depolarization. This potentially reversible, spreading wave typically starts 2-5 min after the onset of severe ischemia, marking the onset of a toxic intraneuronal change that eventually results in irreversible injury.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: To investigate this in the human brain, we performed recordings with either subdural electrode strips (n=4) or intraparenchymal electrode arrays (n=5) in patients with devastating brain injury that resulted in activation of a Do Not Resuscitate-Comfort Care order followed by terminal extubation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies produced a decline in brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen (p<sub>ti</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and circulatory arrest. Silencing of spontaneous electrical activity developed simultaneously across regional electrode arrays in eight patients. This silencing, termed ‘nonspreading depression', developed during the steep falling phase of p<sub>ti</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (intraparenchymal sensor, n=6) at 11 (7, 14) mmHg. Terminal spreading depolarizations started to propagate between electrodes 3.9 (2.6, 6.3) min after onset of the final drop in perfusion and 13 to 266s after nonspreading depression.

Protein-protein interactions are the cornerstone of numerous biological processes. Although an increasing number of protein complex structures have been determined using experimental methods, relatively fewer studies have been performed to determine the assembly order of complexes. In addition to the insights into the molecular mechanisms of biological function provided by the structure of a complex, knowing the assembly order is important for understanding the process of complex formation. Assembly order is also practically useful for constructing subcomplexes as a step toward solving the entire complex experimentally, designing artificial protein complexes, and developing drugs that interrupt a critical step in the complex assembly. There are several experimental methods for determining the assembly order of complexes; however, these techniques are resource-intensive. Here, we present a computational method that predicts the assembly order of protein complexes by building the complex structure. The method, named Path-LzerD, uses a multimeric protein docking algorithm that assembles a protein complex structure from individual subunit structures and predicts assembly order by observing the simulated assembly process of the complex. Benchmarked on a dataset of complexes with experimental evidence of assembly order, Path-LZerD was successful in predicting the assembly pathway for the majority of the cases. Moreover, when compared with a simple approach that infers the assembly path from the buried surface area of subunits in the native complex, Path-LZerD has the strong advantage that it can be used for cases where the complex structure is not known. The path prediction accuracy decreased when starting from unbound monomers, particularly for larger complexes of five or more subunits, for which only a part of the assembly path was correctly identified. As the first method of its kind, Path-LZerD opens a new area of computational protein structure modeling and will be an indispensable approach for studying protein complexes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mNJcOk2YMNo" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hpnuF0uxAAo/article">A direct interaction of cholesterol with the dopamine transporter prevents its out-to-inward transition</a></h4>

<p>by Talia Zeppelin, Lucy Kate Ladefoged, Steffen Sinning, Xavier Periole, Birgit Schiøtt</p>

Monoamine transporters (MATs) carry out neurotransmitter reuptake from the synaptic cleft, a key step in neurotransmission, which is targeted in the treatment of neurological disorders. Cholesterol (CHOL), a major component of the synaptic plasma membrane, has been shown to exhibit a modulatory effect on MATs. Recent crystal structures of the dopamine transporter (DAT) revealed the presence of two conserved CHOL-like molecules, suggesting a functional protein-CHOL direct interaction. Here, we present extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of DAT in an outward-facing conformation. In the absence of bound CHOL, DAT undergoes structural changes reflecting early events of dopamine transport: transition to an inward-facing conformation. In contrast, in the presence of bound CHOL, these conformational changes are inhibited, seemingly by an immobilization of the intracellular interface of TM1a and TM5 by CHOL. We also provide evidence, from coarse grain MD simulations that the CHOL sites observed in the DAT crystal structures are preserved in all human transporters (dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine), suggesting that our findings might extend to the entire family.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hpnuF0uxAAo" width="1" />

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objectives</b>. In multiple sclerosis (MS), MRI is a sensitive tool for detecting white matter lesions, but its diagnostic specificity is still suboptimal; ambiguous cases are frequent in clinical practice. Detection of perivenular lesions in the brain (the “central vein sign”) improves the pathological specificity of MS diagnosis, but comprehensive evaluation of this MRI biomarker in MS-mimicking inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, such as CNS inflammatory vasculopathies, is missing. In a multicenter study, we assessed the frequency of perivenular lesions in MS <em>vs</em>. systemic autoimmune diseases with CNS involvement and primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods.</b> In 31 patients with inflammatory CNS vasculopathies and 52 with relapsing-remitting MS, 3D-T2*-weighted and T2-FLAIR images were obtained during a single MRI acquisition after gadolinium injection. For each lesion, the “central vein sign” was evaluated according to consensus guidelines. For each patient, lesion count, volume, and brain location, as well as fulfillment of dissemination in space MRI criteria, were assessed.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results.</b> MS showed higher frequency of perivenular lesions (median 88%) than did inflammatory CNS vasculopathies (14%), without overlap between groups or differences between 3T and 1.5T MRI. Among inflammatory vasculopathies, Behçet disease showed the highest median frequency of perivenular lesions (34%), followed by PACNS (14%), antiphospholipid syndromes (12%), Sjögren's syndrome (11%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (0%). When a threshold of 50% perivenular lesions was applied, CVS discriminated MS from inflammatory vasculopathies with diagnostic accuracy of 100%.</p></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>OBJECTIVE</b>: Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital non-dystrophic myopathies and is characterized by muscle weakness, often from birth. Mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> are a frequent cause of NM (i.e. NEM3). <em>ACTA1</em> encodes alpha-actin 1, the main constituent of the sarcomeric thin filament. The mechanisms by which mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> contribute to muscle weakness in NEM3 are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that sarcomeric dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness in NEM3 patients.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>METHODS</b>: To test this hypothesis, we performed contractility measurements in individual muscle fibers and myofibrils obtained from muscle biopsies of fourteen NEM3 patients with different <em>ACTA1</em> mutations. To identify the structural basis for impaired contractility, low angle x-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy were applied.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>RESULTS</b>: Our findings reveal that muscle fibers of NEM3 patients display a reduced maximal force generating capacity, which is caused by dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in the majority of patients, as revealed by contractility measurements in myofibrils. Low angle x-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy indicate that dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in NEM3 patients involves a lower number of myosin heads binding to actin during muscle activation. This lower number is not the result of reduced thin filament length. Interestingly, the calcium sensitivity of force is unaffected in some patients, but decreased in others.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>INTERPRETATION</b>: Thus, dysfunctional sarcomere contractility is an important contributor to muscle weakness in the majority of NEM3 patients, information which is crucial for patient stratification in future clinical trials.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Objective</span>: Thalamic volume is a candidate MRI-based marker associated with neurodegeneration to hasten development of neuroprotective treatments. Our objective is to describe the longitudinal evolution of thalamic atrophy in MS and normal aging, and to estimate sample sizes for study design.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Methods</span>: 601 subjects (2632 MRI scans) were analyzed. 520 subjects with relapse-onset MS [CIS(90); RR(392); SP(38)] underwent annual standardized 3T MRI scans for an average of 4.1 years, including a 1mm<sup>3</sup> 3D T1-weighted sequence (3DT1; 2485 MRI scans). 81 healthy controls (HC) were scanned longitudinally on the same scanner using the same protocol (147 MRI scans). 3DT1s were processed using FreeSurfer's longitudinal pipeline after lesion inpainting. Rates of normalized thalamic volume loss in MS and HC were compared in linear mixed effects models. Simulation-based sample size calculations were performed incorporating the rate of atrophy in HC.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Results</span>: Thalamic volume declined significantly faster in MS subjects compared to HC, with an estimated decline of -0.71% per year (95% CI -0.77%, -0.64%) in MS subjects and -0.28% per year (95% CI -0.58%, 0.02%) in HC (p-value for difference=0.007). The rate of decline was consistent throughout the MS disease duration and across MS clinical subtypes. 80 or 100 subjects per arm (α=0.1 or 0.05, respectively) would be needed to detect the ‘maximal effect size' with 80% power in a 24-month study.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Interpretation</span>: Thalamic atrophy occurs early and consistently throughout MS. Preliminary sample size calculations appear feasible, adding to its appeal as an MRI marker associated with neurodegeneration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<p>The quest for a scientific description of consciousness has given rise to new
theoretical and empirical paradigms for the investigation of phenomenological
contents as well as clinical disorders of consciousness. An outstanding
challenge in the field is to develop measures that uniquely quantify global
brain states tied to consciousness. In particular, information-theoretic
complexity measures such as integrated information have recently been proposed
as measures of conscious awareness. This suggests a new framework to
quantitatively classify states of consciousness. However, it has proven
increasingly difficult to apply these complexity measures to realistic brain
networks. In part, this is due to high computational costs incurred when
implementing these measures on realistically large network dimensions.
Nonetheless, complexity measures for quantifying states of consciousness are
important for assisting clinical diagnosis and therapy. This article is meant
to serve as a lookup table of measures of consciousness, with particular
emphasis on clinical applicability of these measures. We consider both,
principle-based complexity measures as well as empirical measures tested on
patients. We address challenges facing these measures with regard to realistic
brain networks, and where necessary, suggest possible resolutions.

<p>Electrophysiological observation plays a major role in epilepsy evaluation.
However, human interpretation of brain signals is subjective and prone to
misdiagnosis. Automating this process, especially seizure detection relying on
scalp-based Electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, has been the
focus of research over recent decades. Nevertheless, its numerous challenges
have inhibited a definitive solution. Inspired by recent advances in deep
learning, we propose a new classification approach for EEG time series based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) via the use of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
networks. The proposed deep network effectively learns and models
discriminative temporal patterns from EEG sequential data. Especially, the
features are automatically discovered from the raw EEG data without any
pre-processing step, eliminating humans from laborious feature design task. We
also show that, in the epilepsy scenario, simple architectures can achieve
competitive performance. Using simple architectures significantly benefits in
the practical scenario considering their low computation complexity and reduced
requirement for large training datasets. Using a public dataset, a multi-fold
cross-validation scheme exhibited an average validation accuracy of 95.54\% and
an average AUC of 0.9582 of the ROC curve among all sets defined in the
experiment. This work reinforces the benefits of deep learning to be further
attended in clinical applications and neuroscientific research.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primary cilium in neural stem cells plays distinct roles in different stages during cortical development. Ciliary dysfunctions in human (i.e., ciliopathy) cause developmental defects in multiple organs, including brain developmental delays, which lead to intellectual disabilities and cognitive deficits. However, effective treatment to this devastating developmental disorder is still lacking. Here, we first investigated the effects of ciliopathy on neural stem cells by knocking down Kif3a, a kinesin II motor required for ciliogenesis, in the neurogenic stage of cortical development by in utero electroporation of mouse embryos. Brains electroporated with Kif3a shRNA showed defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, delays in neural stem cell cycle progression, and failures in interkinetic nuclear migration. Interestingly, introduction of Gli1 and Gli2 both can restore the cell cycle progression by elevating cyclin D1 in neural stem cells. Remarkably, enforced Gli2 expression, but not Gli1, partially restored the ability of Kif3a-knockdown neurons to differentiate and move from the germinal ventricular zone to the cortical plate. Moreover, Cyclin D1 knockdown abolished Gli2’s rescue effect. These findings suggest Gli2 may rescue neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and migration through Cyclin D1 pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for human ciliopathy syndromes through modulating the progression of neural stem cell cycle.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sensory gating is a neurophysiological process whereby the response to a second stimulus in a pair of identical stimuli is attenuated, and it is thought to reflect the capacity of the CNS to preserve neural resources for behaviorally relevant stimuli. Such gating is observed across multiple sensory modalities and is modulated by age, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. In this study, we examined somatosensory gating in 68 healthy adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and advanced oscillatory and time-domain analysis methods. MEG data underwent source reconstruction and peak voxel time series data were extracted to evaluate the dynamics of somatosensory gating, and the impact of spontaneous neural activity immediately preceding the stimulation. We found that gating declined with increasing age and that older adults had significantly reduced gating relative to younger adults, suggesting impaired local inhibitory function. Most importantly, older adults had significantly elevated spontaneous activity preceding the stimulation, and this effect fully mediated the impact of aging on sensory gating. In conclusion, gating in the somatosensory system declines with advancing age and this effect is directly tied to increased spontaneous neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortices, which is likely secondary to age-related declines in local GABA inhibitory function.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous studies have shown insular activations involving sensory, motor, and affective processing. However, the functional roles of subdivisions within the human insula are still not well understood. In the present study, we used intracranial electroencephalography and electrical cortical stimulation to investigate the causal roles of subdivisions of the insula in auditory emotion perception in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in this brain region. The posterior and the anterior subdivisions of the human insula, identified based on structural and functional analyses, showed distinct response properties to auditory emotional stimuli. The posterior insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl’s gyrus, whereas the anterior insula (AI) responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli in a similar way as observed in the amygdala. Furthermore, the degree of the differentiation between various emotion types increased from the posterior to the AI. Our findings suggest different roles played by the two regions of the human insula and a transformation from sensory to affective representations in auditory modality along the posterior-to-anterior axis in the human insula.</span>

<p>by Cristina Izquierdo, José C. Gómez-Tamayo, Jean-Christophe Nebel, Leonardo Pardo, Angel Gonzalez</p>

Pungent chemical compounds originating from decaying tissue are strong drivers of animal behavior. Two of the best-characterized death smell components are putrescine (PUT) and cadaverine (CAD), foul-smelling molecules produced by decarboxylation of amino acids during decomposition. These volatile polyamines act as ‘necromones’, triggering avoidance or attractive responses, which are fundamental for the survival of a wide range of species. The few studies that have attempted to identify the cognate receptors for these molecules have suggested the involvement of the seven-helix trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), localized in the olfactory epithelium. However, very little is known about the precise chemosensory receptors that sense these compounds in the majority of organisms and the molecular basis of their interactions. In this work, we have used computational strategies to characterize the binding between PUT and CAD with the TAAR6 and TAAR8 human receptors. Sequence analysis, homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics studies suggest a tandem of negatively charged aspartates in the binding pocket of these receptors which are likely to be involved in the recognition of these small biogenic diamines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACfXAu-7iOM" width="1" />

The development of tracking methods for automatically quantifying individual behavior and social interactions in animal groups has open up new perspectives for building quantitative and predictive models of collective behavior. In this work, we combine extensive data analyses with a modeling approach to measure, disentangle, and reconstruct the actual functional form of interactions involved in the coordination of swimming in Rummy-nose tetra (<i>Hemigrammus rhodostomus</i>). This species of fish performs burst-and-coast swimming behavior that consists of sudden heading changes combined with brief accelerations followed by quasi-passive, straight decelerations. We quantify the spontaneous stochastic behavior of a fish and the interactions that govern wall avoidance and the reaction to a neighboring fish, the latter by exploiting general symmetry constraints for the interactions. In contrast with previous experimental works, we find that both attraction and alignment behaviors control the reaction of fish to a neighbor. We then exploit these results to build a model of spontaneous burst-and-coast swimming and interactions of fish, with all parameters being estimated or directly measured from experiments. This model quantitatively reproduces the key features of the motion and spatial distributions observed in experiments with a single fish and with two fish. This demonstrates the power of our method that exploits large amounts of data for disentangling and fully characterizing the interactions that govern collective behaviors in animals groups.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FrGkfbLqiNY" width="1" />

<p>by Andreas Madlung</p>

Applied bioinformatics skills are becoming ever more indispensable for biologists, yet incorporation of these skills into the undergraduate biology curriculum is lagging behind, in part due to a lack of instructors willing and able to teach basic bioinformatics in classes that don’t specifically focus on quantitative skill development, such as statistics or computer sciences. To help undergraduate course instructors who themselves did not learn bioinformatics as part of their own education and are hesitant to plunge into teaching big data analysis, a module was developed that is written in plain-enough language, using publicly available computing tools and data, to allow novice instructors to teach next-generation sequence analysis to upper-level undergraduate students. To determine if the module allowed students to develop a better understanding of and appreciation for applied bioinformatics, various tools were developed and employed to assess the impact of the module. This article describes both the module and its assessment. Students found the activity valuable for their education and, in focus group discussions, emphasized that they saw a need for more and earlier instruction of big data analysis as part of the undergraduate biology curriculum.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EoH1CnNvgc" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: To assess the diagnostic value of extended sleep duration on a controlled 32-hour bed-rest protocol in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: 116 patients with high suspicion of IH (37 clear-cut-IH according to multiple sleep latency test criteria and 79 probable-IH), 32 with hypersomnolence associated with a comorbid disorder (non-IH) and 21 controls underwent a polysomnography, modified-sleep latency tests and a 32-h bed-rest protocol. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to find optimal total sleep time (TST) cut-off values on various periods that discriminate patients to controls.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: TST was longer in patients with clear-cut-IH than other groups (probable-IH, non-IH and controls) and in patients with probable-IH than non-IH and controls. TST cut-off best discriminating clear-cut-IH and controls was 19h for the 32-h recording (sensitivity 91.9%, specificity 85.7%) and 12h (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24h. The 19-h cut-off displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between IH and non-IH patients. Patients with IH above the 19h cut-off were overweight, had more sleep inertia and higher TST on all periods compared to patients below 19h, while no differences were found for the 12h cut-off. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and TST during 32-h recording in IH patients.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation: In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cut-off best discriminating patients to controls was 19h over 32-h that allows a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes. Sleepier patients on MSLT were also the more severe in terms of extended sleep. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: To use a cluster analysis of [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 tau-PET data to determine how subjects with Alzheimer's disease vary in the relative involvement of the entorhinal cortex and neocortex, and determine whether relative involvement of these two regions can help explain variability in age and clinical phenotype in Alzheimer's disease.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>METHODS: We calculated [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 uptake in entorhinal cortex and neocortex in 62 amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease patients (39 typical and 23 atypical presentation). Tau-PET values were normalized to the cerebellum to create SUVRs. Tau-PET SUVRs were log-transformed and clustered blinded to clinical information into three groups using K-median cluster analysis. Demographics, clinical phenotype, cognitive performance, and apolipoprotein e4 frequency were compared across clusters.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified a cluster with low entorhinal and cortical uptake (E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Lo</sup>), one with low entorhinal but high cortical uptake (E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup>), and one with high cortical and entorhinal uptake (E<sup>Hi</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup>). Clinical phenotype differed across clusters, with typical AD most commonly observed in the E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Lo</sup> and E<sup>Hi</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> clusters, and atypical AD most commonly observed in the E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> cluster. The E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Lo</sup> cluster had an older age at PET and onset than the other clusters. The apolipoprotein e4 frequency was lower in the E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> cluster. The E<sup>Hi</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> cluster had the worst memory impairment, while the E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> cluster had the worst impairment in non-memory domains.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates considerable variability in [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake in AD, but shows that a straight-forward clustering based on entorhinal and cortical uptake maps well onto age and clinical presentation in AD.

<p>Disorders of consciousness are a heterogeneous mixture of different diseases
or injuries. Although some indicators and models have been proposed for
prognostication, any single method when used alone carries a high risk of false
prediction. This study aimed to investigate whether a multivariable paradigm
that combined resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical
characteristics could predict the outcome at an individual level and identify
the patient who would later recover consciousness. Three datasets comprising a
total of 112 patients with disorders of consciousness from two medical centers
in China were involved in the study. Of the three datasets, one was used as the
training dataset to establish a prediction model, and the other two were used
only for validation. Combining the features extracted from the resting state
functional magnetic resonance imaging and three clinical characteristics, i.e.
etiology, incidence age and duration of unconsciousness, we built a regression
model to predict the prognosis of the patients at the individual level. Each
patient was then classified based on whether or not they were expected to
recover consciousness. The classification accuracy was assessed by comparing
these results with the actual outcome during at least 12 months follow-up. The
model discriminated between patients who would later recover consciousness and
those who would not with an accuracy of around 90%. Notably, our method could
accurately identify the patients who were initially diagnosed as being in a
vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome but subsequently recovered
consciousness. The presented model was also able to identify the prognostic
importance of different predictors, including brain functions and clinical
characteristics. We therefore suggest that this novel multivariable prognostic
model is accurate, robust, and interpretable.

<p>by Jiafan Zhu, Dingqiao Wen, Yun Yu, Heidi M. Meudt, Luay Nakhleh</p>

Phylogenetic networks are rooted, directed, acyclic graphs that model reticulate evolutionary histories. Recently, statistical methods were devised for inferring such networks from either gene tree estimates or the sequence alignments of multiple unlinked loci. Bi-allelic markers, most notably single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), provide a powerful source of genome-wide data. In a recent paper, a method called SNAPP was introduced for statistical inference of species trees from unlinked bi-allelic markers. The generative process assumed by the method combined both a model of evolution for the bi-allelic markers, as well as the multispecies coalescent. A novel component of the method was a polynomial-time algorithm for exact computation of the likelihood of a fixed species tree via integration over all possible gene trees for a given marker. Here we report on a method for Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from bi-allelic markers. Our method significantly extends the algorithm for exact computation of phylogenetic network likelihood via integration over all possible gene trees. Unlike the case of species trees, the algorithm is no longer polynomial-time on all instances of phylogenetic networks. Furthermore, the method utilizes a reversible-jump MCMC technique to sample the posterior of phylogenetic networks given bi-allelic marker data. Our method has a very good performance in terms of accuracy and robustness as we demonstrate on simulated data, as well as a data set of multiple New Zealand species of the plant genus <i>Ourisia</i> (Plantaginaceae). We implemented the method in the publicly available, open-source PhyloNet software package.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7jukor-zhbs" width="1" />

<div class="section" id="ana25120-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Caspr2-positive samples were confirmed using a cell-based assay, and their IgG subtypes were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell-based assay. A solid phase binding assay quantified the binding of Caspr2 to contactin-2 in the presence of Caspr2 autoantibodies. Living cultures of primary rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control sera, and the distribution of Caspr2-positive immunofluorescent puncta and total surface Caspr2 was quantified. HEK cells transfected to express Caspr2 were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control samples, and cell-surface biotinylation and Western blot were used to assess total, internalized, and surface levels of Caspr2.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25120-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>We confirmed 6 samples with strong Caspr2 reactivity. IgG4 Caspr2 antibodies were present in all 6 cases. Caspr2 interacted with another cell adhesion molecule, contactin-2, with nanomolar affinity in the solid phase assay, and Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibited this interaction. Caspr2 autoantibodies did not affect the surface expression of Caspr2 in rat primary hippocampal neurons or transfected HEK cells.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25120-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibit the interaction of Caspr2 with contactin-2 but do not cause internalization of Caspr2.

<div class="section" id="ana25121-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Dystonia is a movement disorder that has been associated with impaired motor learning and sequence recognition. However, despite evidence that patients with dystonia have a reduced sense of agency, it is unclear whether dystonia is specifically associated with impaired recognition of a movement sequence. We have shown previously that performance consistency in the temporal and kinematic domains predicts awareness of underlying motor patterns in a finger-tapping task. Since movements in dystonia are characterized by high variability, we predicted that subjects with dystonia would have decreased motor sequence awareness.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25121-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Subjects with dystonia (n = 20) and healthy control adults (n = 30) performed finger-tapping sequences with a common motor pattern and changing stimulus-to-response mappings. Subjects were said to be “aware” of the motor pattern if they recognized that their fingers moved in the same order during each stimulus-to-response remapping.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25121-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Subjects with dystonia had decreased motor pattern awareness, but those differences were not due to greater performance variability. Subjects with dystonia tapped sequences as series of discrete movements, rather than as a combined series.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25121-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Dystonia is associated with impaired recognition of a repeating movement pattern. This difference may result from a strategy of separating sequential elements and attending to them individually. Ann Neurol 2017</p></div></div>

<p>On image data, data augmentation is becoming less relevant due to the large
amount of available training data and regularization techniques. Common
approaches are moving windows (cropping), scaling, affine distortions, random
noise, and elastic deformations. For electroencephalographic data, the lack of
sufficient training data is still a major issue. We suggest and evaluate
different approaches to generate augmented data using temporal and
spatial/rotational distortions. Our results on the perception of rare stimuli
(P300 data) and movement prediction (MRCP data) show that these approaches are
feasible and can significantly increase the performance of signal processing
chains for brain-computer interfaces by 1% to 6%.

<p>We do not yet understand how the vertebrate visual system provides for
recognition of ob- jects. Countless experiments have been performed to examine
the contribution of cues such as color, texture, and shadowing, but the most
important cues are the con- tours of the outer boundary. Most objects that we
can name can be identified as a silhouette, or equally well as a line drawing
of the boundary. This has long been ap- preciated, so it is somewhat surprising
that after more than a century of experimental research, we have not yet
established how our visual system encodes this shape in- formation.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02645">Personalizing deep learning models for automatic sleep staging. (arXiv:1801.02645v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Despite continued advancement in machine learning algorithms and increasing
availability of large data sets, there is still no universally acceptable
solution for automatic sleep staging of human sleep recordings. One reason is
that a skilled neurophysiologist scoring brain recordings of a sleeping person
implicitly adapts his/her staging to the individual characteristics present in
the brain recordings. Trying to incorporate this adaptation step in an
automatic scoring algorithm, we introduce in this paper a method for
personalizing a general sleep scoring model. Starting from a general
convolutional neural network architecture, we allow the model to learn
individual characteristics of the first night of sleep in order to quantify
sleep stages of the second night. While the original neural network allows to
sleep stage on a public database with a state of the art accuracy,
personalizing the model further increases performance (on the order of two
percentage points on average, but more for difficult subjects). This
improvement is particularly present in subjects where the original algorithm
did not perform well (typically subjects with accuracy less than $80\%$).
Looking deeper, we find that optimal classification can be achieved when broad
knowledge of sleep staging in general (at least 20 separate nights) is combined
with subject-specific knowledge. We hypothesize that this method will be very
valuable for improving scoring of lower quality sleep recordings, such as those
from wearable devices.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>GABAergic interneurons are notorious for their heterogeneity, despite constituting a small fraction of the neuronal population in the neocortex. Classification of interneurons is crucial for understanding their widespread cortical functions as they provide a complex and dynamic network, balancing excitation and inhibition. Here, we investigated different types of non-fast-spiking (nFS) interneurons in Layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with biocytin-filling. Based on a quantitative analysis on a combination of morphological and electrophysiological parameters, we identified 5 distinct types of L4 nFS interneurons: 1) <span style="font-style: italic;">trans-columnar projecting interneurons,</span>2) <span style="font-style: italic;">locally projecting non-Martinotti-like interneurons,</span> 3) <span style="font-style: italic;">supra-granular projecting Martinotti-like interneurons,</span>4) <span style="font-style: italic;">intra-columnar projecting VIP-like interneurons</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>5) <span style="font-style: italic;">locally projecting neurogliaform-like interneurons.</span> Trans-columnar projecting interneurons are one of the most striking interneuron types, which have not been described so far in Layer 4. They feature extensive axonal collateralization not only in their home barrel but also in adjacent barrels. Furthermore, we identified that most of the L4 nFS interneurons express somatostatin, while few are positive for the transcription factor Prox1. The morphological and electrophysiological characterization of different L4 nFS interneuron types presented here provides insights into their synaptic connectivity and functional role in cortical information processing.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In 2004, two landmark studies described the discovery of brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography) signals that increase with the number of items held in visual working memory (WM). These studies claimed that the signals leveled off (plateaued) once the number of memoranda reached the capacity of WM, as estimated by the prevailing model of the time. However, alternative models were not considered, and changing concepts of WM in the more than a decade since these studies were published necessitate a re-evaluation of their findings; newer models that provide the most accurate account of behavioral data do not incorporate a fixed limit on the number of items stored. Furthermore, an important claim made about the original studies, that signals plateau at each individual’s estimated capacity, has never been tested. Here, we pit the plateau model of signal strength against an alternative, saturation model, a biophysically plausible account in which signals increase continuously without plateau. We show that the saturation model provides a better description of the original data, challenging the assumption that imaging results provide evidence for a fixed item limit in WM.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Binocular disparity information is an important source of 3D perception. Neurons sensitive to binocular disparity are found in almost all major visual areas in nonhuman primates. In area V4, disparity processes are suggested for the purposes of 3D-shape representation and fine disparity perception. However, whether neurons in V4 are sensitive to disparity-defined edges used in shape representation is not clear. Additionally, a functional organization for disparity edges has not been demonstrated so far. With intrinsic signal optical imaging, we studied functional organization for disparity edges in the monkey visual areas V1, V2, and V4. We found that there is an orientation map in V4 activated by edges purely defined by binocular disparity. This map is consistent with the orientation map obtained with regular luminance-defined edges, indicating a cue-invariant edge representation in this area. In contrast, such a map is much weaker in V2 and totally absent in V1. These findings reveal a hierarchical processing of 3D shape along the ventral pathway and the important role that V4 plays in shape-from-disparity detection.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the past decade, several studies have investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on episodic memory abilities. However, the specific conditions under which tDCS affects memory remain largely unclear. Here, we report data from 4 experiments aimed at investigating the effects of anodal tDCS over the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) on verbal episodic memory. We evaluated tDCS-induced effects as a function of time of administration, nature of the memory encoding task, and age of the participants. A robust enhancement of memory performance was only found when anodal tDCS was delivered during intentional memorization. This enhancement was evident in young and older adults. tDCS applied during incidental memorization or during retrieval did not induce any modulation of memory performance, and memory was unaffected by offline administration before encoding or retrieval. These results show that the modulation of episodic memory functions by anodal tDCS over the left VLPFC is dependent upon the time of administration and the nature of the memory task. The findings may help profile the optimal stimulation protocols for neurorehabilitation interventions on individuals with memory decline.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The inferior temporal cortex (ITC) contains neurons selective to multiple levels of visual categories. However, the mechanisms by which these neurons collectively construct hierarchical category percepts remain unclear. By comparing decoding accuracy with simultaneously acquired electrocorticogram (ECoG), local field potentials (LFPs), and multi-unit activity in the macaque ITC, we show that low-frequency LFPs/ECoG in the early evoked visual response phase contain sufficient coarse category (e.g., face) information, which is homogeneous and enhanced by spatial summation of up to several millimeters. Late-induced high-frequency LFPs additionally carry spike-coupled finer category (e.g., species, view, and identity of the face) information, which is heterogeneous and reduced by spatial summation. Face-encoding neural activity forms a cluster in similar cortical locations regardless of whether it is defined by early evoked low-frequency signals or late-induced high-gamma signals. By contrast, facial subcategory-encoding activity is distributed, not confined to the face cluster, and dynamically increases its heterogeneity from the early evoked to late-induced phases. These findings support a view that, in contrast to the homogeneous and static coarse category-encoding neural cluster, finer category-encoding clusters are heterogeneously distributed even outside their parent category cluster and dynamically increase heterogeneity along with the local cortical processing in the ITC.</span>

Depressed individuals typically show poor memory for positive events, potentiated memory for negative events, and impaired recollection. These phenomena are clinically important but poorly understood. Compelling links between stress and depression suggest promising candidate mechanisms. Stress can suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibit dopamine neurons, and sensitize the amygdala. We argue that these phenomena may impair pattern separation, disrupt the encoding of positive experiences, and bias retrieval toward negative events, respectively, thus recapitulating core aspects of memory disruption in depression.

Unlike in most pathogens, multiple-strain (polygenomic) infections of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> are frequently composed of genetic siblings. These genetic siblings are the result of sexual reproduction and can coinfect the same host when cotransmitted by the same mosquito. The degree with which coinfecting strains are related varies among infections and populations. Because sexual recombination occurs within the mosquito, the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could depend on transmission dynamics, but little is actually known of the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. Part of the uncertainty stems from an incomplete understanding of how within-host and within-vector dynamics affect cotransmission. Cotransmission is difficult to examine experimentally but can be explored using a computational model. We developed a malaria transmission model that simulates sexual reproduction in order to understand what determines the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. This study highlights how the relatedness of cotransmitted strains depends on both within-host and within-vector dynamics including the complexity of infection. We also used our transmission model to analyze the genetic relatedness of polygenomic infections following a series of multiple transmission events and examined the effects of superinfection. Understanding the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could lead to a better understanding of the population-genetic correlates of transmission and therefore be important for public health.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DIdV_Uzv1uY" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02549">Electroencephalography source connectivity: toward high time/space resolution brain networks. (arXiv:1801.02549v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The human brain is a large-scale network which function depends on dynamic
interactions between spatially-distributed regions. In the rapidly-evolving
field of network neuroscience, two yet unresolved challenges are potential
breakthroughs. First, functional brain networks should be estimated from
noninvasive and easy to use neuroimaging techniques. Second, the time/space
resolution of these techniques should be high enough to assess the dynamics of
identified networks. Emerging evidence suggests that Electroencephalography
(EEG) source connectivity method may offer solutions to both issues provided
that scalp EEG signals are appropriately processed. Therefore, the performance
of EEG source connectivity method strongly depends on signal processing (SP)
that involves various methods such as preprocessing techniques, inverse
solutions, statistical couplings between signals and network science. The main
objective of this tutorial-like review is to provide an overview on EEG source
connectivity. We describe the major contributions that the SP community brought
to this research field. We emphasize the methodological issues that need to be
carefully addressed to obtain relevant results and we stress the current
limitations that need further investigation. We also report results obtained in
concrete applications, in both normal and pathological brain states. Future
directions in term of signal processing methods and applications are eventually
provided

<p>by Zixuan Cang, Lin Mu, Guo-Wei Wei</p>

This work introduces a number of algebraic topology approaches, including multi-component persistent homology, multi-level persistent homology, and electrostatic persistence for the representation, characterization, and description of small molecules and biomolecular complexes. In contrast to the conventional persistent homology, multi-component persistent homology retains critical chemical and biological information during the topological simplification of biomolecular geometric complexity. Multi-level persistent homology enables a tailored topological description of inter- and/or intra-molecular interactions of interest. Electrostatic persistence incorporates partial charge information into topological invariants. These topological methods are paired with Wasserstein distance to characterize similarities between molecules and are further integrated with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors, ensemble of trees, and deep convolutional neural networks, to manifest their descriptive and predictive powers for protein-ligand binding analysis and virtual screening of small molecules. Extensive numerical experiments involving more than 4,414 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBBind database (a non-redundant collection of PDBBind refined sets 2007, 2013, 2015, and 2016) and 128,374 ligand-target and decoy-target pairs in the DUD database are performed to test respectively the scoring power and the discriminatory power of the proposed topological learning strategies. It is demonstrated that the present topological learning outperforms other existing methods in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction and ligand-decoy discrimination.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hyJPg5SR-GY" width="1" />

<p>by Lajos Vágó, Balázs B. Ujfalussy</p>

The neuronal code arising from the coordinated activity of grid cells in the rodent entorhinal cortex can uniquely represent space across a large range of distances, but the precise conditions for optimal coding capacity are known only for environments with finite size. Here we consider a coding scheme that is suitable for unbounded environments, and present a novel, number theoretic approach to derive the grid parameters that maximise the coding range in the presence of noise. We derive an analytic upper bound on the coding range and provide examples for grid scales that achieve this bound and hence are optimal for encoding in unbounded environments. We show that in the absence of neuronal noise, the capacity of the system is extremely sensitive to the choice of the grid periods. However, when the accuracy of the representation is limited by neuronal noise, the capacity quickly becomes more robust against the choice of grid scales as the number of modules increases. Importantly, we found that the capacity of the system is near optimal even for random scale choices already for a realistic number of grid modules. Our study demonstrates that robust and efficient coding can be achieved without parameter tuning in the case of grid cell representation and provides a solid theoretical explanation for the large diversity of the grid scales observed in experimental studies. Moreover, we suggest that having multiple grid modules in the entorhinal cortex is not only required for the exponentially large coding capacity, but is also a prerequisite for the robustness of the system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IHOSyQSZuSI" width="1" />

<p>by Mathias Engel, James Longden, Jesper Ferkinghoff-Borg, Xavier Robin, Gaye Sağınç, Rune Linding</p>

Cell migration is a central biological process that requires fine coordination of molecular events in time and space. A deregulation of the migratory phenotype is also associated with pathological conditions including cancer where cell motility has a causal role in tumor spreading and metastasis formation. Thus cell migration is of critical and strategic importance across the complex disease spectrum as well as for the basic understanding of cell phenotype. Experimental studies of the migration of cells in monolayers are often conducted with ‘wound healing’ assays. Analysis of these assays has traditionally relied on how the wound area changes over time. However this method does not take into account the shape of the wound. Given the many options for creating a wound healing assay and the fact that wound shape invariably changes as cells migrate this is a significant flaw. Here we present a novel software package for analyzing concerted cell velocity in wound healing assays. Our method encompasses a wound detection algorithm based on cell confluency thresholding and employs a Bayesian approach in order to estimate concerted cell velocity with an associated likelihood. We have applied this method to study the effect of siRNA knockdown on the migration of a breast cancer cell line and demonstrate that cell velocity can track wound healing independently of wound shape and provides a more robust quantification with significantly higher signal to noise ratios than conventional analyses of wound area. The software presented here will enable other researchers in any field of cell biology to quantitatively analyze and track live cell migratory processes and is therefore expected to have a significant impact on the study of cell migration, including cancer relevant processes.

<p>by Akira Nagamori, Christopher M. Laine, Francisco J. Valero-Cuevas</p>

Involuntary force variability below 15 Hz arises from, and is influenced by, many factors including descending neural drive, proprioceptive feedback, and mechanical properties of muscles and tendons. However, their potential interactions that give rise to the well-structured spectrum of involuntary force variability are not well understood due to a lack of experimental techniques. Here, we investigated the generation, modulation, and interactions among different sources of force variability using a physiologically-grounded closed-loop simulation of an afferented muscle model. The closed-loop simulation included a musculotendon model, muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organ (GTO), and a tracking controller which enabled target-guided force tracking. We demonstrate that closed-loop control of an afferented musculotendon suffices to replicate and explain surprisingly many cardinal features of involuntary force variability. Specifically, we present 1) a potential origin of low-frequency force variability associated with co-modulation of motor unit firing rates (i.e.,‘common drive’), 2) an in-depth characterization of how proprioceptive feedback pathways suffice to generate 5-12 Hz physiological tremor, and 3) evidence that modulation of those feedback pathways (i.e., presynaptic inhibition of Ia and Ib afferents, and spindle sensitivity via fusimotor drive) influence the full spectrum of force variability. These results highlight the previously underestimated importance of closed-loop neuromechanical interactions in explaining involuntary force variability during voluntary ‘isometric’ force control. Furthermore, these results provide the basis for a unifying theory that relates spinal circuitry to various manifestations of altered involuntary force variability in fatigue, aging and neurological disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3BwWexls06A" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Axons in the mature mammalian central nervous system have only a limited capacity to grow/regenerate after injury, and spontaneous recovery of motor functions is therefore not greatly expected in spinal cord injury (SCI). To promote functional recovery after SCI, it is critical that corticospinal tract (CST) fibers reconnect properly with target spinal neurons through enhanced axonal growth/regeneration. Here, we applied antibody treatment against repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) to a monkey model of SCI. We found that inhibition of upregulated RGMa around the lesioned site in the cervical cord resulted in recovery from impaired manual dexterity by accentuated penetration of CST fibers into laminae VII and IX, where spinal interneurons and motoneurons are located, respectively. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation following intracortical microstimulation revealed that the contralesional, but not the ipsilesional, primary motor cortex was crucially involved in functional recovery at a late stage in our SCI model. The present data indicate that treatment with the neutralizing antibody against RGMa after SCI is a potential target for achieving restored manual dexterity in primates.</span>

Sweeney et al. show that the diversity of spinal inhibitory interneurons, defined by combinatorial transcription factor expression, differs along the body axis in correspondence with limb and thoracic motor output. Hox genes, not motor neurons, specify segmental differences in inhibitory interneuron identity.

Neurons encoding sleep need and sleep-inducing neurons are recurrently connected. A crucial link in the circuit is necessary for visually guided movements but inhibited during sleep. A unified mechanism can thus account for sensory, motor, and homeostatic aspects of sleep.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: We aimed to characterize the association between pretreatment lesional volume measured on diffusion-weighted images and functional outcome, and estimate the impact on thrombectomy efficacy for ischemic stroke with anterior proximal intracranial arterial occlusion.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: Anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients who had pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging in the THRACE study were included. Lesional volume was semi-automatically segmented. Logistic regression was applied to model clinical outcome as a function of lesional volume. Outcomes included functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-2), degree of disability (ordinal mRS 0-6), and mortality at 3 months.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Of 298 included patients, with median lesional volume 17.2 mL (interquartile range [IQR] 9.2-51.8) and median mRS 2 (IQR 1-4), 51.0% achieved functional independence. Increased lesional volume was an independent predictor for a lower probability of functional independence (odds ratio [OR] 0.90 [95% CI 0.81-0.99] per 10 mL, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001), a less favorable degree of disability (common OR [cOR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.81-0.90] per 10 mL, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001), and a higher mortality rate (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.08-1.37] per 10 mL, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001). For additional thrombectomy, the number of patients needed to treat to achieve functional independence in 1 patient increased with lesional volume (10 for a volume of 80 mL; 15 for 135 mL). No significant treatment-by-dichotomized volume interaction for functional independence and mortality was observed.</p></div>

Human lateral PPC demonstrates rich, functional heterogeneity across its subregions, including during mnemonic and numerical decision tasks. In this issue of Neuron, Rutishauser et al. (2018) report striking local heterogeneity within a small patch of anterior IPS at the neuronal level during memory-based decisions.

Synaptic plasticity – the directed modulation of synaptic connections by specific activity histories or physiological signals – is believed to be a major mechanism for the modification of neuronal network function. This belief, however, has a ‘flip side’: the supposition that synapses do not change spontaneously in manners unrelated to such signals. Contrary to this supposition, recent studies reveal that synapses do change spontaneously, and to a fairly large extent. Here we review experimental results on spontaneous synaptic remodeling, its relative contributions to total synaptic remodeling, its statistical characteristics, and its physiological importance.
