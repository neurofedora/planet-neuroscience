              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Coordinated Regulation of CB1 Cannabinoid Receptors and Anandamide Metabolism Stabilizes Network Activity during Homeostatic Downscaling</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurons express overlapping homeostatic mechanisms to regulate synaptic function and network properties in response to perturbations of neuronal activity. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are bioactive lipids synthesized in the postsynaptic compartments to regulate synaptic transmission, plasticity, and neuronal excitability primarily through retrograde activation of presynaptic cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). The eCB system is well situated to regulate neuronal network properties and coordinate presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. However, the role of the eCB system in homeostatic adaptations to neuronal hyperactivity is unknown. To address this issue, we used Western blotting and targeted lipidomics to measure adaptations in eCB system to bicuculline (BCC)-induced chronic hyperexcitation in mature cultured rat cortical neurons, and used multielectrode array (MEA) recording and live-cell imaging of glutamate dynamics to test the effects of pharmacological manipulations of eCB on network activities. We show that BCC-induced chronic hyperexcitation triggers homeostatic downscaling and a coordinated adaptation to enhance tonic eCB signaling. Hyperexcitation triggers first the downregulation of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the lipase that degrades the eCB anandamide, then an accumulation of anandamide and related metabolites, and finally a delayed upregulation of surface and total CB1. Additionally, we show that BCC-induced downregulation of surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and upregulation of CB1 occur through independent mechanisms. Finally, we show that endocannabinoids support baseline network activities before and after downscaling and is engaged to suppress network activity during adaptation to hyperexcitation. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of downscaling and homeostatic regulation of <I>in vitro</I> oscillatory network activities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Cortico-Subthalamic Field Potentials Support Classification of the Natural Gait Cycle in Parkinsons Disease and Reveal Individualized Spectral Signatures</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability of humans to coordinate stereotyped, alternating movements between the two legs during bipedal walking is a complex motor behavior that requires precisely timed activities across multiple nodes of the supraspinal network. Understanding of the neural network dynamics that underlie natural walking in humans is limited. We investigated cortical and subthalamic neural activities during overground walking and evaluated spectral biomarkers to decode the gait cycle in three patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease without gait disturbances. Patients were implanted with chronic bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and electrocorticography paddles overlaying the primary motor and somatosensory cortices. Local field potentials were recorded from these areas while the participants performed overground walking and synchronized to external gait kinematic sensors. We found that the STN displays increased low-frequency (4&ndash;12 Hz) spectral power during the period before contralateral leg swing. Furthermore, STN shows increased theta frequency (4&ndash;8 Hz) coherence with the primary motor through the initiation and early phase of contralateral leg swing. Additional analysis revealed that each patient had specific frequency bands that could detect a significant difference between left and right initial leg swing. Our findings indicate that there are alternating spectral changes between the two hemispheres in accordance with the gait cycle. In addition, we identified patient-specific, gait-related biomarkers in both the STN and cortical areas at discrete frequency bands that may be used to drive adaptive DBS to improve gait dysfunction in patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Two-year consequences of barium sulfate aspiration [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aspiration of barium contrast is a rare, but well-known, event occurring during examinations of the upper gastrointestinal system using contrast media. We present a case of large-volume high-concentration barium sulfate aspiration in an 88-year-old male diagnosed with dysphagia, during the swallowing study. He rapidly developed difficulty in breathing, hypoxemia and chemical pneumonitis. The chest radiograph showed the infiltration of barium contrast at both sides with left lower lung predominance. His lowest oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 91%. His condition improved with supportive care including oxygen therapy. The patient was finally discharged a few days later with normal oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. The follow-up chest radiograph at 2 years after the aspiration showed considerable interval clearing of the aspirated contrast material. The plasma and urine barium concentrations at 2 years after the aspiration were <0.5 μg/L and 13.6 μg/L, respectively. Currently, there is no reference urine barium level in the Thai population. These finding may be partially explained by our patient’s exposure of barium from food or water or might be gradually absorbed systemically from the residual barium in lungs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Health literacy on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Health literacy on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects people’s capability to ascertain their health and health care quality during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of health literacy about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccinations (Vaccines and Vaccinations literacy-VL) in the Indonesian adult general population, assessing the perceptions of the respondents about current adult immunization and beliefs about vaccinations in general, and analyzing correlations of these variables with the VL levels. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a rapid survey was administered via the Internet. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics; the internal consistency of the VL scales was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient; the inter-correlation between the functional and interactive-critical VL questions, the underlying components (factors) and each question’s load on the components were identified using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). An alpha level lesser than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Responses to functional- and interactive/ critical- VL questions were acceptable and showed internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.817 and 0.699, respectively), lowest values observed were 0.806 for functional scale and 0.640 for the interactive-critical scale. The PCA demonstrated that there were two components accounting for 52.45% of the total variability. Approximately 60% of respondents were females (n=686). Almost all respondents used the internet to seek information regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations. Many used at least one social media actively with 74.4% of respondents sometimes believing the validity of this information. Conclusions: High scores were observed in both functional- and interactive/ critical-VL, and were quite in a balance between sexes in the prior VL and higher in females for the latter; these were also closely related to the educational level and age group. It is crucial to increase public health literacy in managing the pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development of phase change materials for low-temperature thermal energy storage application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Energy storage is very critical for reducing the mismatch between demand and supply thus offering better management capabilities. It reduces the peak energy demand and increases efficiency, security, and reliability. There is unavailability of low-cost phase change materials (PCMs) in the lower temperature range. Methods: This study discusses the creation of eutectic from capric acid and paraffin wax. A series of blending of capric acid/paraffin wax (CA/PW) were prepared, having variable weight-composition. The thermophysical properties were obtained using differential scanning calorimetry, Further, thermal cycle testing was done to understand the thermal stability and reliability of the prepared eutectics. Results: The area underneath the peak is used to calculate the latent heat of fusion, and the tangent of the steepest slope at the peak of the crest is used to calculate the melting temperature (Tm). Differential scanning calorimetry results showed the developed eutectic had an appropriate melting temperature and adequate latent heat of fusion of 29.86 °C - 30.60 °C and 154.15–198.62 kJ/kg respectively, and can be used for various thermal energy storage applications in buildings, solar absorption chillers, surgical dress/clinical bed, and photovoltaic systems. Conclusions: The accelerated thermal cycle of the same confirmed its thermal stability up to 500 heating and cooling cycles. It was discovered that variable heating and cooling speeds had no significant influence on the melting temperature and latent heat of fusion of PW/CA eutectics. Further, the economic study revealed that the created PCM is inexpensive and readily available in the Indian market.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessing the potential relevance of CEACAM6 as a blood transcriptional biomarker [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Changes in blood transcript abundance levels have been associated with pathogenesis in a wide range of diseases. While next generation sequencing technology can measure transcript abundance on a genome-wide scale, downstream clinical applications often require small sets of genes to be selected for inclusion in targeted panels. Here we set out to gather information from the literature and transcriptome datasets that would help researchers determine whether to include the gene CEACAM6 in such panels. Methods We employed a workflow to systematically retrieve, structure, and aggregate information derived from both the literature and public transcriptome datasets. It consisted of profiling the CEACAM6 literature to identify major diseases associated with this candidate gene and establish its relevance as a biomarker. Accessing blood transcriptome datasets identified additional instances where CEACAM6 transcript levels differ in cases vs controls. Finally, the information retrieved throughout this process was captured in a structured format and aggregated in interactive circle packing plots. Results Although it is not routinely used clinically, the relevance of CEACAM6 as a biomarker has already been well-established in the cancer field, where it has invariably been found to be associated with poor prognosis. Focusing on the blood transcriptome literature, we found studies reporting elevated levels of CEACAM6 abundance across a wide range of pathologies, especially diseases where inflammation plays a dominant role, such as asthma, psoriasis, or Parkinson’s disease. The screening of public blood transcriptome datasets completed this picture, showing higher abundance levels in patients with infectious diseases caused by viral and bacterial pathogens. Conclusions Targeted assays measuring CEACAM6 transcript abundance in blood may be of potential utility for the management of patients with diseases presenting with systemic inflammation and for the management of patients with cancer, where the assay could potentially be run both on blood and tumor tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical spectrum and short-term outcome of post-COVID multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children after the 2019 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background As a post-COVID complication in children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is important because of its varied and life-threatening manifestations. With this background, this study attempts to focus on MIS-C cases in an underprivileged rural setting in north-eastern India, with most patients being treated with methylprednisolone rather than intravenous immunoglobulin due to financial constraints. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study at MGM Medical College, 27 MIS-C cases diagnosed following WHO criteria were included. Laboratory and radiological investigations, including echocardiography, were performed as required for diagnosis and to assess prognosis. Most patients were treated with methylprednisolone. A follow-up assessment was done six weeks after discharge for any residual impairment. Results The most frequently affected age group was 5–10 years (59.28%), while respiratory (48.14%) and cardiac (40.74%) were the most commonly involved systems. Logistic regression studies established a significant association between serum ferritin level and prolonged hospital stay (coefficient 0.0674, p=0.0041), possibly due to greater complications in cases with high ferritin levels. Organ impairment was found to increase the need for inotrope use (coefficient 3.8797, p=0.00584). Most cases were treated with methylprednisolone alone (85.18%) with a favourable response and no death occurred. Conclusion The favourable response in cases treated with methylprednisolone only affirms the effectiveness of the drug as a cheaper alternative in a resource-poor setting. The study highlights that higher ferritin levels in complicated cases leads to prolonged hospitalisation and the increased need for inotropes in cases with organ impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of energy storage materials for developments in solar cookers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Solar energy is accessible freely and can be utilized for many household and industrial applications. The consumption of solar energy for cooking applications has found significant success. Various innovations have been employed in facilitating cooking during off-sunshine hours. Thermal energy storage helps in overcoming the fluctuations in the supply of energy required for cooking during different time periods of the day. This study focuses on the different types of thermal energy storage mediums that are currently utilized in solar cooking. Primarily, oils and pebbles are most commonly used as sensible heat storage (SHS) while organic phase change materials (PCMs) are used as latent heat thermal energy storage materials (LHTES). The properties and performances of various SHS and latent heat storage (LHS) mediums have been compared for their suitable utilization. SHS materials are cost-effective but have lower thermal gradient compared to LHTES materials. The energy storage capability of LHTES is high while degradation with the increasing number of charging and discharging cycles is also considerable. The melting point should be close to the utilization temperature for being used as LHTES as thermal diffusivity of the materials greatly influences the performance of solar cookers. The cooking time is lower for solar cooking systems equipped with energy storage compared to non-equipped cooking systems. It is recognized that the use of energy storage has been proved as a huge advantage to solar cooking systems, however, the design, and heat transfer characteristics of the cooking vessel along with the storage material type and volume must be optimized in order to make this technology more influential.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleus accumbens dopamine tracks aversive stimulus duration and prediction but not value or prediction error</a></h4>

              
                There is active debate on the role of dopamine in processing aversive stimuli, where inferred roles range from no involvement at all, to signaling an aversive prediction error (APE). Here, we systematically investigate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAC), which is closely linked to reward prediction errors, in rats exposed to white noise (WN, a versatile, underutilized, aversive stimulus) and its predictive cues. Both induced a negative dopamine ramp, followed by slow signal recovery upon stimulus cessation. In contrast to reward conditioning, this dopamine signal was unaffected by WN value, context valence, or probabilistic contingencies, and the WN dopamine response shifted only partially toward its predictive cue. However, unpredicted WN provoked slower post-stimulus signal recovery than predicted WN. Despite differing signal qualities, dopamine responses to simultaneous presentation of rewarding and aversive stimuli were additive. Together, our findings demonstrate that instead of an APE, NAC dopamine primarily tracks prediction and duration of aversive events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nucleus accumbens dopamine release reflects the selective nature of pair bonds</a></h4>

              
                In monogamous species, prosocial behaviors directed towards partners are dramatically different from those directed towards unknown individuals and potential threats. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens plays an important role in guiding social behavior, however, its role in real time social decision making in a monogamous species remains largely unknown. We used monogamous prairie voles to investigate how dopamine release differs in voles when seeking and interacting with a pair bonded partner or a novel vole. Employing the sub-second temporal resolution of the fluorescent biosensor, GRABDA, during a social operant task, we found that partner seeking, anticipation, and interaction resulted in more dopamine release than the same events directed towards a novel vole. Furthermore, partner-elicited dopamine release decreases after prolonged partner separation. Thus, differences in partner- and novel-elicited dopamine release reflect the selective nature of pair bonds and may drive the social behaviors that reinforce and cement bonds over time, eroding after partner loss to facilitate new bond formation.

                Emotional responses arise from limbic circuits including the hippocampus and amygdala. In the human brain, beta-frequency communication between these structures correlates with self-reported mood and anxiety. However, both the mechanism and significance of this biomarker as a readout vs. driver of emotional state remain unknown. Here we show that beta-frequency communication between the ventral hippocampus and basolateral amygdala also predicts anxiety-related behavior in mice on both long timescales (~30 min) and immediately preceding behavioral choices. Genetically encoded voltage indicators reveal that this biomarker reflects synchronization between somatostatin interneurons across both structures. Indeed, synchrony between these neurons dynamically predicts approach vs. avoidance, and optogenetically shifting this synchronization by just 25 msec is sufficient to bidirectionally modulate anxiety-related behaviors. Thus, back-translation establishes a human biomarker as a causal determinant (not just predictor) of emotional state, revealing a novel mechanism whereby interregional synchronization that is frequency-, phase- and cell type-specific controls anxiety processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory cortex encodes lipreading information through spatially distributed activity</a></h4>

              
                Face-to-face communication improves the quality and accuracy of heard speech, particularly in noisy environments. Silent lipreading modulates activity in auditory regions, which has been hypothesized to reflect the transformation and encoding of multiple forms of visual speech information used to support hearing processes. Evidence suggests visual timing information as one such signal encoded in auditory areas: seeing when a speaker's lips come together between words can help listeners parse word-level boundaries. However, it remains unclear how lipreading alters activity in the auditory system to improve speech perception at the single word-level. Using fMRI and intracranial electrodes in patients, here we show that silently lipread words can be classified from neural activity in auditory areas based on distributed spatial information. Lipread words evoked similar representations to the corresponding heard words, consistent with the prediction that automatic lipreading refines the tuning of auditory representations. Similar to heard words, lipread words varied in the distinctiveness of their neural representations in auditory cortex: e.g., the lipread words DIG and GIG evoked more similar neural activity in auditory cortex relative to the more perceptually distinct word FIG, suggesting that lipreading activity reflects probabilistic distributions as opposed to the unique identity of the lipread word. Notably, while visual speech has both excitatory and suppressive effects on auditory firing rates, classification was observed in both neural populations, consistent with the prediction that lipreading contributes to phoneme population tuning by both activating the corresponding representation and suppressing incorrect phonemic representations. These results support a model in which the auditory system combines the joint neural distributions evoked by heard and lipread words to generate a more precise estimate of what was said, particularly during noisy speech.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine facilitates the response to glutamatergic inputs in a computational model of astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are active cells that respond to neurotransmitters with elevations in their intracellular calcium concentration (calcium signals). In a tripartite synapse involving two neurons coupled by a glutamatergic synapse and one astrocyte, glutamate released by the presynaptic neuron can generate calcium signals in the astrocyte, which in turn trigger the release of neuroactive molecules (gliotransmitters) by the astrocyte that bind to receptors in the pre- and postsynaptic neuron membranes and modulate synaptic transmission. Astrocytic calcium signals can also be evoked by dopamine released in distant sites. Little is known about how dopamine modulates glutamatergic-evoked astrocyte activity. To investigate this question, we constructed compartmental astrocyte models with three different morphologies: linear (soma plus a single branch); branched (soma plus two branches); and bifurcated (soma plus a single branch that bifurcates into two branchlets). Compartments were modeled by conductance-based equations for membrane voltage and transport of ions, glutamate and dopamine between extra- and intracellular spaces. Glutamatergic and dopaminergic stimuli were modeled as Poisson processes with variable frequencies, and astrocyte responses were measured by number and location of evoked calcium signals. For cells with linear morphology, whole-cell dopaminergic stimulation reduced the glutamatergic stimulation frequency of distal compartments needed to generate calcium signals. For both the branched and bifurcated morphologies, whole-cell dopaminergic stimulation together with glutamatergic stimulation of one of the processes reduced the glutamatergic stimulation frequency necessary to trigger a calcium signal in the other process. The same glutamatergic stimulation protocols without dopamine stimulation required higher glutamatergic input frequencies to evoke calcium signals. Our results suggest that dopamine facilitates the occurrence of glutamatergic-evoked calcium signals, and that dopamine-glutamate interaction can control the distribution of calcium signals along the astrocyte extension.

	<p>Proactive inhibition is divided into two components: action postponing (AP), which refers to slowing the onset of response, and action restraint (AR), which refers to preventing the response. To date, several studies have reported alterations in proactive inhibition and its associated neural processing among sensory modalities; however, this remains inconclusive owing to several methodological issues. This study aimed to clarify the differences in AP and AR and their neural processing among visual, auditory, and somatosensory modalities using an appropriate experimental paradigm that can assess AP and AR separately. The postponing time calculated by subtracting simple reaction time from Go signal reaction time was shorter in the visual modality than in the other modalities. This was explained by faster neural processing for conflict monitoring induced by anticipating the presence of the No-go signal, supported by the shorter latency of AP-related N2. Furthermore, the percentage of false alarms, which is the reaction to No-go signals, was lower in the visual modality than in the auditory modality. This was attributed to higher neural resources for conflict monitoring induced by the presence of No-go signals, supported by the larger amplitudes of AR-related N2. Our findings revealed the differences in AP and AR and their neural processing among sensory modalities.</p>

	<p>Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is an autoimmune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Patients with MOGAD may develop any combination of optic neuritis (ON), myelitis, brainstem syndrome and encephalitis. Reports of MOGAD with cranial nerve involvement are rare. Herein, we report a MOGAD patient with cranial neuropathies. In addition, we summarized the clinical features of the previously reported six MOG-IgG-positive cases with cranial nerve involvement and discussed the underlying mechanisms of MOGAD involving cranial nerves. Cranial neuropathy is an emerging phenotype in MOGAD, which has characteristics of both central and peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement, with the trigeminal nerve being the most commonly affected nerve. MOG antibody testing in patients with cranial neuropathies is warranted, and immunotherapy is advocated when the risk of relapse is high. Although higher antibody titers and persistently positive serological test results are predictive of disease recurrence, the long-term outcomes of MOG-IgG-positive patients with cranial neuropathies remain largely unknown.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Management of evidence and conflict of interest in guidelines on early childhood allergy prevention and child nutrition: study protocol of a systematic synthesis of guidelines and explorative network analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: With the rising prevalence of allergic diseases in children, prevention of childhood allergies becomes an important public health issue. Recently, a paradigm shift is taking place in the approach to preventing allergies, and clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) play an important role in providing practitioners with the latest evidence and reliable guidance. However, concern about the methodological quality of the development of FBDGs and CPGs, including limitations in the systematic reviews, lack of transparency and unmanaged conflicts of interest (COI), reduce the trust in these guidelines. Methods: We aim to synthesize the available guidance on early childhood allergy prevention (ECAP) through a systematic search for national and international CPGs and FBDGs concerning ECAP and child nutrition (CN) and to assess the quality of the guidelines and management of COI. Additionally, we will analyse the content and the evidence base of the recommendation statements. We aim to quantify the COI in guideline panellists and explore possible associations between COI and recommendations. Through a social network analysis, we expect to elucidate ties between panellists, researchers, institutions, industry and other sponsors. Guidelines are an important tool to inform healthcare practitioners with the newest evidence, but quality and reliability have to be high. This study will help identify potential for further improvement in the development of guidelines and the management of COI. If the social network analysis proves feasible and reveals more information on COI in comparison to disclosed COI from the previous analyses, the methodology can be developed further to identify undisclosed COIs in panellists. Ethics and dissemination: This research does not require ethical approval because no human subjects are involved. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed open access journals and via presentations at scientific conferences.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Visual Deprivation on Remodeling of Nodes of Ranvier in Optic Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, promote rapid action potential conduction along axons. Changes in the geometry of gaps between myelin segments, known as nodes of Ranvier, affect the conduction speed of neuronal impulses and can ultimately alter neural synchronization and circuit function. In contrast to synaptic plasticity, much less is known about how neural activity may affect node of Ranvier structure. Recently, perinodal astrocytes have been shown to remodel nodes of Ranvier by regulating thrombin proteolysis, but it is not known whether neural activity influences this process. To test this hypothesis, we used transgenic mice with astrocytic expression of a dominant-negative vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 ([gfap]dnVAMP2) to reduce exocytosis of thrombin inhibitors, modulating astrocytic regulation of paranodal loop attachment to induce nodal remodeling, under normal conditions and in adult mice maintained in darkness from postnatal day 40 (P40) to P70. This mechanism of nodal lengthening proceeded normally following binocular visual deprivation (BVD). The effect of BVD on nodal plasticity in animals with unimpaired astrocyte function has not been previously investigated. We find that when exocytosis from astrocytes was unimpaired, nodal gap length was not altered by BVD in adult mice. We conclude that if perinodal astrocytes participate in activity-dependent myelin remodeling through exocytosis, then, as with synaptic plasticity in the visual system, the process must be driven by alterations in neuronal firing other than those produced by BVD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Allocation of Visuospatial Attention Indexes Evidence Accumulation for Reach Decisions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visuospatial attention is a prerequisite for the performance of visually guided movements: perceptual discrimination is regularly enhanced at target locations before movement initiation. It is known that this attentional prioritization evolves over the time of movement preparation; however, it is not clear whether this build-up simply reflects a time requirement of attention formation or whether, instead, attention build-up reflects the emergence of the movement decision. To address this question, we combined behavioral experiments, psychophysics, and computational decision-making models to characterize the time course of attention build-up during motor preparation. Participants (<I>n</I> = 46, 29 female) executed center-out reaches to one of two potential target locations and reported the identity of a visual discrimination target (DT) that occurred concurrently at one of various time-points during movement preparation and execution. Visual discrimination increased simultaneously at the two potential target locations but was modulated by the experiment-wide probability that a given location would become the final goal. Attention increased further for the location that was then designated as the final goal location, with a time course closely related to movement initiation. A sequential sampling model of decision-making faithfully predicted key temporal characteristics of attentional allocation. Together, these findings provide evidence that visuospatial attentional prioritization during motor preparation does not simply reflect that a spatial location has been selected as movement goal, but rather indexes the time-extended, cumulative decision that leads to the selection, hence constituting a link between perceptual and motor aspects of sensorimotor decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors common to leading eye health conditions and major non-communicable diseases: a rapid review and commentary [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To gain an understanding of the intersection of risk factors between the most prevalent eye health conditions that are associated with vision impairment and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Methods: A series of rapid reviews of reviews reporting on non-modifiable risk factors, age and sex, and modifiable risk factors, including social determinants, were conducted for five common eye health conditions that are the leading causes of vision impairment globally (refractive error including uncorrected refractive error, cataract, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy) and five prevalent NCDs (cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, dementia, and depressive disorders). Articles published within approximately 5 years to the end of 2019 were identified through expert recommendation, PubMED, Ovid Medline, the Lancet Global Burden of Disease series, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and World Cancer Research Fund.    Results: Of 9,213 records identified, 320 records were eligible. Eye health conditions and NCDs share many risk factors. Increased age was found to be the most common shared risk factor, associated with increased risks of AMD, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, refractive error, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia. Other shared risk factors included smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption (mixed results), and physical activity was protective, though limited evidence was found for eye conditions. Social determinants are well documented as risk factors for NCDs. Conclusion: There is substantial overlap in common established risk factors for the most frequent vision impairing eye conditions and leading NCDs. Increasing efforts should be made to integrate preventative and risk reduction interventions to improve health, with greatest shared benefits for initiatives which aim to reduce smoking, improve diet, and promote physical activity.

     alt="Human cortical amygdala dendrites and spines morphology under open-source three-dimensional reconstruction procedures"/>
<p>Golgi-impregnated human neurons and dendritic spines were 3D reconstructed using opensource software. A pyramidal-like neuron from the human cortical amygdaloid complex with various spiny dendritic segments can be observed at different angles of rotation. Spines in a <i>continuum</i> of shapes and sizes were reconstructed using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm for image segmentation. They were classified as stubby (s), wide (w), thin (t), mushroom-like (m), ramified (r), or “atypical”/transitional ones (a).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visualizing nerve cells has been fundamental for the systematic description of brain structure and function in humans and other species. Different approaches aimed to unravel the morphological features of neuron types and diversity. The inherent complexity of the human nervous tissue and the need for proper histological processing have made studying human dendrites and spines challenging in postmortem samples. In this study, we used Golgi data and open-source software for 3D image reconstruction of human neurons from the cortical amygdaloid nucleus to show different dendrites and pleomorphic spines at different angles. Procedures required minimal equipment and generated high-quality images for differently shaped cells. We used the “single-section” Golgi method adapted for the human brain to engender 3D reconstructed images of the neuronal cell body and the dendritic ramification by adopting a neuronal tracing procedure. In addition, we elaborated 3D reconstructions to visualize heterogeneous dendritic spines using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm for image segmentation. These tools provided an additional upgrade and enhanced visual display of information related to the spatial orientation of dendritic branches and for dendritic spines of varied sizes and shapes in these human subcortical neurons. This same approach can be adapted for other techniques, areas of the central or peripheral nervous system, and comparative analysis between species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine as emergency antihypertension in severe preeclampsia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Preeclampsia is a highly prevalent disease among pregnant women. In the event of hypertensive emergency, nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine are assigned as first-line therapies in preeclampsia. Further studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of these drugs to find the most cost-effective drug with minimal side effects. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these drugs in lowering blood pressure during hypertensive emergencies in severe preeclampsia. Methods: 60 pregnant women with severe preeclampsia were recruited in this multiple centre double-blind randomized clinical trial from May 2021 to April 2022 in Indonesia. The patients were divided equally into three groups and treated with three doses of nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine, respectively within one hour with 20 minutes interval. The effectiveness was measured based on systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The observation was carried out until five hours post-third dose administration.   Results: The blood pressure was reduced significantly after the administration of the first to the third dose of each antihypertensive (p<0.05). A single dose administration, four, one, and three patients had 20% MAP reduction in nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine group. Three, seven, and one patient had a failure of reaching 20% MAP reduction even after receiving the third dose. The effectiveness of the drugs to achieve 20% reduction of MAP could be ranked as follows: nifedipine>labetalol>hydralazine (57.49%, 42.13%, and 40.87%, respectively) for single dose and hydralazine>nifedipine>labetalol (111.3%, 85.12%, and 90.04%, respectively) for triple dose. Conclusions: Nifedipine is the most effective drug to reduce the blood pressure when single dose administration is used, but requires more doses to further reduce the blood pressure. Hydralazine is the most effective when the drug administration is maxed up to three doses within 60 minutes with 20 minutes interval.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cost effectiveness of Electronic Gate Keeping (EGK) system on laboratory tests demand at a rural academic hospital in Eastern Cape, South Africa: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Monitoring laboratory expenditure is crucial to ensure that laboratory services remain sustainable and affordable. In South Africa, the National Department of Health (NDoH) and its partner, the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) collaborated to introduce Electronic Gate Keeping (EGK) systems across the country. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of EGK on laboratory tests requested at a rural academic hospital in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Methods: The methodological approach involved the use of a cross-sectional study design. For 24 months (June 2015 to May 2017), data on the number and types of laboratory tests initially requested along with those rejected because there were unnecessary was obtained. Data management and cost effectiveness analysis to estimate cost savings due to EGK on laboratory test demands were carried out using MS Excel and Stata software. There were 28 types of tests requested, of which 22 were chemical tests, two were haematological tests, and four were serological tests. Results: Out of 448 028 tests requested, 17,480 (3.9%) were rejected after being identified as unnecessary through the EGK system. This rejection rate of 3.9% generated cost savings of USD 51,967.07. The top three tests that generated the most savings were the c-reactive protein (USD 6,077.68), free thyroxine (USD 5,199.92) and hepatitis A IgM (USD 3,813.61). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that the introduction of EGK has positive spinoffs; it reduced costs, strengthened the dialogue between clinicians and pathologists allowing a platform for continuous education, teaching and learning.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of IL-6, ferritin, and coagulopathy in COVID-19 clinical progression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In COVID-19, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in the cytokine storm, primarily interleukin-6 (IL-6), has been hypothesized to induce pulmonary intravascular coagulation. However, the relationship between IL-6 and coagulopathy remains unclear in COVID-19 progression. We aimed to investigate the correlation of IL-6 with D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), and ferritin. Furthermore, we also analyzed the effect of those parameters on the worsening of COVID-19 patients. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients from June 2020 to January 2021. A serial evaluation of IL-6, D-dimer, fibrinogen, ferritin, and PT was performed and correlated with the patient's condition at admission and on the 14th day. The outcomes (improvement, worsening, or discharged patients) were recorded during the study. Results Of 374 patients, 73 study subjects (61 severe and 12 moderate COVID-19) were included in this study. A total of 35 out of 61 severe and one out of 12 moderate illness subjects had experienced worsening. Spearman-rank correlation of IL-6 with with ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PT was 0.08 (p=0.5), −0.13 (p=0.27), 0.01 (p=0.91), and 0.03 (p=0.77), respectively. In ROC analysis, D-dimer (74,77%) and IL-6 (71,32%) were the highest among other variables (>60%). Conclusions In COVID-19 patients, there was a correlation between elevated IL-6 and D-dimer levels with disease deterioration. There was no correlation between elevated IL-6 levels with ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PT levels. Therefore, changes in IL-6 and D-dimer can predict worsening in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evidence of mitochondria origin of SARS-CoV-2 double-membrane vesicles: a review. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than 600 million people and killed more than 6 million people worldwide. This infection affects mainly certain groups of people that have high susceptibility to present severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises their health. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting health, economy, and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of viral replication cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several findings have unexpectedly discovered that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV). In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, discovered almost 15 years ago, comprise a subpopulation characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress, and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome and other findings link SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria and support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the morphological, biochemical, molecular, and cellular evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. In this scheme, some relevant questions are raised as pending topics for research that would help in the near future to test this hypothesis. The intention of this work is to provide a novel framework that could open new possibilities to tackle SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through mitochondria and DMV targeted therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 5; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products, mostly as food supplements. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to hydrolytic conversion of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 293 food products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 28 products (10%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC, with the safety of CBD itself currently being unclear with significant uncertainties regarding possible liver and reproductive toxicity. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

                Background   The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD.  Methods   This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60–90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions.  Results   FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001).  Conclusions   The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.

<p>Photomicrograph of orexinergic neurons forming the main orexinergic neuronal cluster in the hypothalamus of a Southeast African cheetah. While showing the standard features of the orexinergic system, the Southeast African cheetah, along with an Asiatic and an African lion, also exhibits specializations in the organization of this system. This has implications for sleep and arousal in these large carnivores.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Employing orexin-A immunohistochemistry, we describe the distribution, morphology, and nuclear parcellation of orexinergic neurons within the hypothalami of an Asiatic lion (<i>Panthera leo</i> subsp. <i>persica</i>), an African lion (<i>Panthera leo</i> subsp. <i>melanochaita</i>), and a Southeast African cheetah (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i> subsp. <i>jubatus</i>). In all three felids, the clustering of large, bipolar, and multipolar hypothalamic orexinergic neurons primarily follows the pattern observed in other mammals. The orexinergic neurons were found, primarily, to form three distinct clusters—the main, zona incerta, and optic tract clusters. In addition, large orexinergic neurons were observed in the ventromedial supraoptic region of the hypothalamus, where they are not typically observed in other species. As has been observed in cetartiodactyls and the African elephant, a cluster of small, multipolar orexinergic neurons, the parvocellular cluster, was observed in the medial zone of the hypothalamus in all three felids, although this parvocellular cluster has not been reported in other carnivores. In both subspecies of lions, but not the cheetah, potential orexin-immunopositive neurons were observed in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, the lateral part of the retrochiasmatic area, and the inner layer of the median eminence. The distribution and parcellation of orexinergic neurons in the hypothalami of the three felids studied appear to be more complex than observed in many other mammals and for the two subspecies of lion may be even more complex. These findings are discussed in terms of potential technical concerns, phylogenetic variations of this system, and potentially associated functional aspects of the orexinergic system.</p>

                Background: Dengue fever is still a public health issue in Indonesia, and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, integrated digital technology will be required for its control. This study aimed to identify the factors that influence attitudes toward dengue control concerning the potential application of digital technology. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey, with 515 people willing to fill out an online questionnaire. The analysis was conducted using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). There were 46 indicators used to assess attitudes toward dengue control, which are organized into six variables: the need for digital information systems, perceptions of being threatened with dengue, the benefits of dengue control programs, program constraints, environmental factors and attitudes in dengue control. Results:  The source of information needed for dengue control was mainly through social media. There was a positive relationship between perception of environmental factors to perception of dengue threat, perception of program constraints, perception of program benefits, and perception of digital technology needs. Perception of program benefits and threatened perception of dengue have a positive relationship with perception of digital technology needs. Conclusions: This model showed the variables perception of digital technology and perception of benefits had a positive association with attitude towards dengue control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Protein prediction models support widespread post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance by interacting partners</a></h4>

Protein and mRNA levels correlate only moderately. The availability of proteogenomics data sets with protein and transcript measurements from matching samples is providing new opportunities to assess the degree to which protein levels in a system can be predicted from mRNA information. Here we examined the contributions of input features in protein abundance prediction models. Using large proteogenomics data from 8 cancer types within the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) data set, we trained models to predict the abundance of over 13,000 proteins using matching transcriptome data from up to 958 tumor or normal adjacent tissue samples each, and compared predictive performances across algorithms, data set sizes, and input features. Over one-third of proteins (4,648) showed relatively poor predictability (elastic net r ≤ 0.3) from their cognate transcripts. Moreover, we found widespread occurrences where the abundance of a protein is considerably less well explained by its own cognate transcript level than that of one or more trans locus transcripts. The incorporation of additional trans-locus transcript abundance data as input features increasingly improved the ability to predict sample protein abundance. Transcripts that contribute to non-cognate protein abundance primarily involve those encoding known or predicted interaction partners of the protein of interest, including not only large multi-protein complexes as previously shown, but also small stable complexes in the proteome with only one or few stable interacting partners. Network analysis further shows a complex proteome-wide interdependency of protein abundance on the transcript levels of multiple interacting partners. The predictive model analysis here therefore supports that protein-protein interaction including in small protein complexes exert post-transcriptional influence on proteome compositions more broadly than previously recognized. Moreover, the results suggest mRNA and protein co-expression analysis may have utility for finding gene interactions and predicting expression changes in biological systems.

BIPS (Build Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing library) is a software that converts a list of proteins into a custom DNA oligonucleotide library for the PhIP-Seq system. The tool creates constant-length oligonucleotides with internal barcodes, while maintaining the original length of the peptide. This allows using large libraries, of hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotides, while saving on the costs of sequencing and maintaining the accuracy of oligonucleotide reads identification. BIPS is available under GNU public license from: https://github.com/kalkairis/BuildPhIPSeqLibrary.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Reproducibility efforts as a teaching tool: A pilot study</a></h4>

The “replication crisis” is a methodological problem in which many scientific research findings have been difficult or impossible to replicate. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential aspect of the scientific method, such failures endanger the credibility of theories based on them and possibly significant portions of scientific knowledge. An instance of the replication crisis, analytic replication, pertains to reproducing published results through computational reanalysis of the authors’ original data. However, direct replications are costly, time-consuming, and unrewarded in today’s publishing standards. We propose that bioinformatics and computational biology students replicate recent discoveries as part of their curriculum. Considering the above, we performed a pilot study in one of the graduate-level courses we developed and taught at our University. The course is entitled Intro to R Programming and is meant for students in our Master’s and PhD programs who have little to no programming skills. As the course emphasized real-world data analysis, we thought it would be an appropriate setting to carry out this study. The primary objective was to expose the students to real biological data analysis problems. These include locating and downloading the needed datasets, understanding any underlying conventions and annotations, understanding the analytical methods, and regenerating multiple graphs from their assigned article. The secondary goal was to determine whether the assigned articles contained sufficient information for a graduate-level student to replicate its figures. Overall, the students successfully reproduced 39% of the figures. The main obstacles were the need for more advanced programming skills and the incomplete documentation of the applied methods. Students were engaged, enthusiastic, and focused throughout the semester. We believe that this teaching approach will allow students to make fundamental scientific contributions under appropriate supervision. It will teach them about the scientific process, the importance of reporting standards, and the importance of openness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel statistical method for long-term coronavirus modelling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Novel coronavirus disease has been recently a concern for worldwide public health. To determine epidemic rate probability at any time in any region of interest, one needs efficient bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-regional environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of novel coronavirus infection rate. Traditional statistical methods dealing with temporal observations of multi-regional processes do not have the multi-dimensionality advantage, that suggested methodology offers, namely dealing efficiently with multiple regions at the same time and accounting for cross-correlations between different regional observations. Methods: Modern multi-dimensional novel statistical method was directly applied to raw clinical data, able to deal with territorial mapping. Novel reliability method based on statistical extreme value theory has been suggested to deal with challenging epidemic forecast. Authors used MATLAB optimization software. Results: This paper described a novel bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-country environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of extreme novel coronavirus death rate probability.  Namely, accurate maximum recorded patient numbers are predicted for the years to come for the analyzed provinces. Conclusions:  The suggested method performed well by supplying not only an estimate but 95% confidence interval as well.  Note that suggested methodology is not limited to any specific epidemics or any specific terrain, namely its truly general. The only assumption and limitation is bio-system stationarity, alternatively trend analysis should be performed first.  The suggested methodology can be used in various public health applications, based on their clinical survey data.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent research has shown that sex/gender (s/g) influences on cognitive functions and related brain anatomy, functional responses, and connectivity are less clear than previously assumed, and most studies investigated adult population. In this mini-review, we summarize research progress in the study of s/g differences in the human brain function as investigated by neuroimaging methods adopting a developmental perspective. In particular, we review original studies published from 2000 to 2021 investigating s/g differences in task-related brain functional activation and connectivity in healthy children and adolescents. We summarize results about studies in the domains of language, visuospatial ability, social cognition, and executive functions. Overall, a clear relation between cognition and brain activation or connectivity pattern is far from being established and the few coherent results should be considered exploratory, despite in some cases, brain function seems to present specific patterns in comparison with what reported in adults. Moreover, future studies should address methodological limitations, such as fragmentation of tasks, lack of control for confounding variables, and lack of longitudinal designs to study developmental trajectories.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, viewed with transcranial ultrasound, is a risk marker for Parkinson's disease. We hypothesized that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy adults aged 50–70 years is associated with reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition in primary motor cortex, and that the reduced intracortical inhibition is associated with neurochemical markers of activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation in primary motor cortex was assessed with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in 23 healthy adults with normal (<i>n</i> = 14; 61 ± 7 yrs) or abnormally enlarged (hyperechogenic; <i>n</i> = 9; 60 ± 6 yrs) area of SN echogenicity. Thirteen of these participants (7 SN− and 6 SN+) also underwent brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate pre-SMA neurochemistry. There was no relationship between area of SN echogenicity and short-interval intracortical inhibition in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. There was a significant positive relationship, however, between area of echogenicity in the right SN and the magnitude of intracortical facilitation in the right (ipsilateral) primary motor cortex (<i>p</i> = .005; multivariate regression), evidenced by the amplitude of the conditioned motor evoked potential (MEP) at the 10–12 ms interstimulus interval. This relationship was not present on the left side. Pre-SMA glutamate did not predict primary motor cortex inhibition or facilitation. The results suggest that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy older adults may be associated with changes in excitability of motor cortical circuitry. The results advance understanding of brain changes in healthy older adults at risk of Parkinson's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systematic analysis of membrane contact sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae uncovers modulators of cellular lipid distribution</a></h4>

              
                Actively maintained close appositions between organelle membranes, also known as contact sites, enable the efficient transfer of biomolecules between cellular compartments. Several such sites have been described as well as their tethering machineries. Despite these advances we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of the function and regulation of most contact sites. To systematically characterize contact site proteomes, we established a high-throughput screening approach in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> based on co-localization imaging. We imaged split fluorescence reporters for six different contact sites, several of which are poorly characterized, on the background of 1165 strains expressing a mCherry-tagged yeast protein that has a cellular punctate distribution (a hallmark of contact sites), under regulation of the strong <i>TEF2</i> promoter. By scoring both co-localization events and effects on reporter size and abundance, we discovered over 100 new potential contact site residents and effectors in yeast. Focusing on several of the newly identified residents, we identified three homologs of Vps13 and Atg2 that are residents of multiple contact sites. These proteins share their lipid transport domain, thus expanding this family of lipid transporters. Analysis of another candidate, Ypr097w, which we now call Lec1 (<span class="underline">L</span>ipid-droplet <span class="underline">E</span>rgosterol <span class="underline">C</span>ortex 1), revealed that this previously uncharacterized protein dynamically shifts between lipid droplets and the cell cortex, and plays a role in regulation of ergosterol distribution in the cell. Overall, our analysis expands the universe of contact site residents and effectors and creates a rich database to mine for new functions, tethers, and regulators.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mcm2 promotes stem cell differentiation via its ability to bind H3-H4</a></h4>

              
                Mcm2, a subunit of the Mcm2-7 helicase best known for its role in DNA replication, contains a histone binding motif that facilitates the transfer of parental histones following DNA replication. Here we show that Mcm2 is important for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Mcm2-2A mutation defective in histone binding shows defects in silencing of pluripotent genes and the induction of lineage specific genes. The defects in the induction of lineage specific genes in the mutant cells are likely, at least in part, due to reduced binding to Asf1a, a histone chaperone that binds Mcm2 and is important for nucleosome disassembly at bivalent chromatin domains containing repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 modifications during differentiation. Mcm2 localizes at transcription starting sites and the binding of Mcm2 at gene promoters is disrupted in both Mcm2-2A ES cells and neuro-precursor cells (NPCs). Reduced Mcm2 binding at bivalent chromatin domains in Mcm2-2A ES cells correlates with decreased chromatin accessibility at corresponding sites in NPCs. Together, our studies reveal a novel function of Mcm2 in ES cell differentiation, likely through manipulating chromatin landscapes at bivalent chromatin domains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endosymbiotic selective pressure at the origin of eukaryotic cell biology</a></h4>

              
                The dichotomy that separates prokaryotic from eukaryotic cells runs deep. The transition from pro- to eukaryote evolution is poorly understood due to a lack of reliable intermediate forms and definitions regarding the nature of the first host that could no longer be considered a prokaryote, the first eukaryotic common ancestor, FECA. The last eukaryotic common ancestor, LECA, was a complex cell that united all traits characterising eukaryotic biology including a mitochondrion. The role of the endosymbiotic organelle in this radical transition towards complex life forms is, however, sometimes questioned. In particular the discovery of the asgard archaea has stimulated discussions regarding the pre-endosymbiotic complexity of FECA. Here we review differences and similarities among models that view eukaryotic traits as isolated coincidental events in asgard archaeal evolution or, on the contrary, as a result of and in response to endosymbiosis. Inspecting eukaryotic traits from the perspective of the endosymbiont uncovers that eukaryotic cell biology can be explained as having evolved as a solution to housing a semi-autonomous organelle and why the addition of another endosymbiont, the plastid, added no extra compartments. Mitochondria provided the selective pressures for the origin (and continued maintenance) of eukaryotic cell complexity. Moreover, they also provided the energetic benefit throughout eukaryogenesis for evolving thousands of gene families unique to eukaryotes. Hence, a synthesis of the current data lets us conclude that traits such as the Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, autophagosomes, and meiosis and sex evolved as a response to the selective pressures an endosymbiont imposes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robotic multi-probe single-actuator inchworm neural microdrive</a></h4>

              
                A wide range of techniques in neuroscience involve placing individual probes at precise locations in the brain. However, large-scale measurement and manipulation of the brain using such methods have been severely limited by the inability to miniaturize systems for probe positioning. Here, we present a fundamentally new, remote-controlled micropositioning approach composed of novel phase-change material-filled resistive heater micro-grippers arranged in an inchworm motor configuration. The microscopic dimensions, stability, gentle gripping action, individual electronic control, and high packing density of the grippers allow micrometer-precision independent positioning of many arbitrarily shaped probes using a single piezo actuator. This multi-probe single-actuator design significantly reduces the size and weight and allows for potential automation of microdrives. We demonstrate accurate placement of multiple electrodes into the rat hippocampus in vivo in acute and chronic preparations. Our robotic microdrive technology should therefore enable the scaling up of many types of multi-probe applications in neuroscience and other fields.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SRSF10 is essential for progenitor spermatogonia expansion by regulating alternative splicing</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing expands the transcriptome and proteome complexity and plays essential roles in tissue development and human diseases. However, how alternative splicing regulates spermatogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, using a germ cell-specific knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that the splicing factor <i>Srsf10</i> is essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility. In the absence of SRSF10, spermatogonial stem cells can be formed, but the expansion of Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger (PLZF)-positive undifferentiated progenitors was impaired, followed by the failure of spermatogonia differentiation (marked by KIT expression) and meiosis initiation. This was further evidenced by the decreased expression of progenitor cell markers in bulk RNA-seq, and much less progenitor and differentiating spermatogonia in single-cell RNA-seq data. Notably, SRSF10 directly binds thousands of genes in isolated THY<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia, and <i>Srsf10</i> depletion disturbed the alternative splicing of genes that are preferentially associated with germ cell development, cell cycle, and chromosome segregation, including <i>Nasp</i>, <i>Bclaf1</i>, <i>Rif1</i>, <i>Dazl</i>, <i>Kit</i>, <i>Ret,</i> and <i>Sycp1</i>. These data suggest that SRSF10 is critical for the expansion of undifferentiated progenitors by regulating alternative splicing, expanding our understanding of the mechanism underlying spermatogenesis.

                A major limitation of current reports on insect declines is the lack of standardized, long-term, and taxonomically broad time series. Here, we demonstrate the utility of environmental DNA from archived leaf material to characterize plant-associated arthropod communities. We base our work on several multi-decadal leaf time series from tree canopies in four land use types, which were sampled as part of a long-term environmental monitoring program across Germany. Using these highly standardized and well-preserved samples, we analyze temporal changes in communities of several thousand arthropod species belonging to 23 orders using metabarcoding and quantitative PCR. Our data do not support widespread declines of <i>α</i>-diversity or genetic variation within sites. Instead, we find a gradual community turnover, which results in temporal and spatial biotic homogenization, across all land use types and all arthropod orders. Our results suggest that insect decline is more complex than mere <i>α</i>-diversity loss, but can be driven by <i>β</i>-diversity decay across space and time.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An automated feeding system for the African killifish reveals effects of dietary restriction on lifespan and allows scalable assessment of associative learning</a></h4>

              
                The African turquoise killifish is an exciting new vertebrate model for aging studies. A significant challenge for any model organism is the control over its diet in space and time. To address this challenge, we created an automated and networked fish feeding system. Our automated feeder is designed to be open-source, easily transferable, and built from widely available components. Compared to manual feeding, our automated system is highly precise and flexible. As a proof-of-concept for the feeding flexibility of these automated feeders, we define a favorable regimen for growth and fertility for the African killifish and a dietary restriction regimen where both feeding time and quantity are reduced. We show that this dietary restriction regimen extends lifespan in males (but not in females) and impacts the transcriptomes of killifish livers in a sex-specific manner. Moreover, combining our automated feeding system with a video camera, we establish a quantitative associative learning assay to provide an integrative measure of cognitive performance for the killifish. The ability to precisely control food delivery in the killifish opens new areas to assess lifespan and cognitive behavior dynamics and to screen for dietary interventions and drugs in a scalable manner previously impossible with traditional vertebrate model organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal masking and rollover in the neural code for speech with and without hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Natural sounds, such as speech, are complex time-varying waveforms containing information critical to how we communicate with each other and navigate the external world. Hearing loss results in a breakdown of this information and causes distortions in the neural code. As a result, perception of complex sounds such as speech is compromised. This problem is further complicated by the fact that sound intensity varies in natural settings, both in quiet and in noisy backgrounds. Somewhat paradoxically, despite increased audibility at high sound intensities, perception and discrimination of speech is actually diminished, especially in the presence of background noise. This phenomenon is known as rollover of speech and its neural basis is poorly understood in both normal-hearing listeners and hearing-impaired listeners. Here we performed in-vivo electrophysiology in awake and anaesthetized Mongolian gerbils (Meriones Unguiculatus) to investigate how hearing loss affects the neural encoding of speech. We presented 22 Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV) syllables to the gerbil and recorded neural responses from the inferior colliculus (IC). We used a k-nearest neighbor neural classifier to investigate whether IC neurons could discriminate between different consonants in normal hearing (NH) and noise-exposed hearing-loss (HL) animals. We found that neural correlates of perceptual rollover were present in the IC and that performance in discrimination decreased when VCVs were presented in background noise when compared to in quiet. Furthermore, we found that forward masking played a prominent role in shaping neural responses and discrimination between various consonants in NH and HL animals. These results suggest there is a critical trade-off in listening between audibility and rollover mediated by temporal masking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time as a supervisor: temporal regularity and auditory object learning</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems appear to learn to transform incoming sensory information into perceptual representations that can inform and guide behavior, or objects, with minimal explicit supervision. Here, we propose that the auditory system can achieve this goal by using time as a supervisor, i.e., by learning features of a stimulus that are temporally regular. We will show that this procedure generates a feature space sufficient to support fundamental computations of auditory perception. In detail, we consider the problem of discriminating between instances of a prototypical class of natural auditory objects, i.e., rhesus macaque vocalizations. We test discrimination in two ethologically relevant tasks: discrimination in a cluttered acoustic background, and generalization to discriminate between novel exemplars. We show that an algorithm that learns these temporally regular features affords better or equivalent discrimination and generalization than a conventional feature-selection algorithm, i.e., principal component analysis. Our findings suggest that the slow temporal features of auditory stimuli may be sufficient for parsing auditory scenes, and that the auditory brain should utilize these slowly changing temporal features.

                In expert readers, a brain region known as the visual word form area (VWFA) is highly sensitive to written words, exhibiting a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasing sensitivity to orthographic stimuli whose statistics match those of real words. Using high-resolution 7T fMRI, we ask whether, in bilingual readers, distinct cortical patches specialize for different languages. In 21 English-French bilinguals, unsmoothed 1.2 mm fMRI revealed that the VWFA is actually composed of several small cortical patches highly selective for reading, with a posterior-to-anterior word similarity gradient, but with near-complete overlap between the two languages. In 10 English-Chinese bilinguals, however, while most word-specific patches exhibited similar reading specificity and word-similarity gradients for reading in Chinese and English, additional patches responded specifically to Chinese writing and, surprisingly, to faces. Our results show that the acquisition of multiple writing systems can indeed tune the visual cortex differently in bilinguals, sometimes leading to the emergence of cortical patches specialized for a single language.

                Encoding of visual information is a necessary requirement for most types of episodic memories. In search for a neural signature of memory formation, amplitude modulation of neural activity has been repeatedly shown to correlate with and suggested to be functionally involved in successful memory encoding. We here report a complementary view on why and how brain activity relates to memory, indicating a functional role of cortico-ocular interactions for episodic memory formation. Recording simultaneous magnetoencephalography and eye tracking in 35 human participants, we demonstrate that gaze variability and amplitude modulations of alpha/beta oscillations (10-20 Hz) in visual cortex covary and predict subsequent memory performance between and within participants. Amplitude variation during pre-stimulus baseline was associated with gaze direction variability, echoing the co-variation observed during scene encoding. We conclude that encoding of visual information engages unison coupling between oculomotor and visual areas in the service of memory formation.

                Chimeric RNAs have been found in both cancer and healthy human cells. They have regulatory effects on human stem/progenitor cell differentiation, stemness maintenance and central nervous system (CNS) development. However, their physiological functions in the retinal development remain unknown. Based on the human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-derived retinal organoids (ROs) spanning from day 0 to day 120, we present the expression atlas of chimeric RNAs throughout the developing ROs. We confirmed the existence of some common chimeric RNAs and also discovered many novel chimeric RNAs during retinal development. We focused on CTNNBIP1-CLSTN1 (CTCL) whose downregulation causes precocious neuronal differentiation and a marked reduction of neural progenitors in human cerebral organoids. Our study found that CTCL also plays a key role in human retinogenesis, CTCL loss-of-function obstructed RO differentiation but prompted the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) differentiation. Together, this work provides a landscape of chimeric RNAs and reveals evidence for their crucial roles in human retina development.

                A significant proportion of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients experience drug-resistant seizures associated with mesial temporal sclerosis, in which there is extensive cell loss in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields, with a relative sparing of dentate gyrus granule cells and the CA2 pyramidal neurons. A role for CA2 in seizure generation was suggested based on findings of a reduction in synaptic inhibition (Williamson & Spencer, 1994) and the presence of interictal-like spike activity in resected hippocampal tissue from TLE patients (Wittner et al., 2009). We recently found that in the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus mouse model of TLE there was an increase in CA2 intrinsic excitability associated with a loss of CA2 synaptic inhibition. Furthermore, chemogenetic silencing of CA2 significantly reduced seizure frequency, consistent with a role of CA2 in promoting seizure generation and/or propagation (Whitebirch et al., 2022). In the present study we explored the basis of this inhibitory deficit using immunohistochemical and electrophysiological approaches. We report a widespread decrease in the density of pro-cholecystokinin-immunopositive interneurons and a functional impairment of cholecystokinin-expressing interneuron-mediated inhibition of CA2 pyramidal neurons. We also found a decrease in the density of CA2 parvalbumin-immunopositive interneurons and disruption to the pyramidal neuron-associated perisomatic perineuronal net in the CA2 subfield. These data reveal a set of pathological alterations that may disrupt inhibition of CA2 pyramidal neurons and their downstream targets in epileptic mice.

                Postsynaptic plasticity is not accessible as a selection criterion for molecular identification of neurons by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). The currently available methods to find specific connection plasticity ex vivo have inherently low throughput. To overcome these limitations and pre-select neurons based on short-term postsynaptic plasticity for soma harvesting and subsequent scRNA-seq we created Voltage-Seq. First, we established all-optical voltage imaging and recorded the short-term postsynaptic plasticity of 6911 periaqueductal gray (PAG) neurons evoked by optogenetic activation of the ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) input. Postsynaptic response-types were classified and spatially resolved in the entire innervated PAG. Next, to browse and identify all-optical responses, we built a quick on-site analysis named VoltView which incorporated the a priori VMH-PAG connectome database as a classifier. VoltView targetedly identifies postsynaptic neurons for somatic harvesting. We demonstrated the agility of Voltage-Seq in locating GABAergic PAG neurons, guided by an all-optical connectivity map and on-site classification in VoltView.

                The human brain contains an extraordinarily diverse set of neuronal and glial cell types. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics have begun to delineate the cellular heterogeneity in different brain regions, but the transcriptional regulatory programs responsible for the identity and function of each brain cell type remain to be defined. Here, we carried out single nucleus ATAC-seq analysis to probe the open chromatin landscape from over 1.1 million cells in 42 brain regions of three neurotypical adult donors. Integrative analysis of the resulting data identified 107 distinct cell types and revealed the cell-type-specific usage of 544,735 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the human genome. Nearly 1/3 of them displayed sequence conservation as well as chromatin accessibility in the mouse brain. On the other hand, nearly 40% cCREs were human specific, with chromatin accessibility associated with species-restricted gene expression. Interestingly, these human specific cCREs were enriched for distinct families of retrotransposable elements, which displayed cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility. We uncovered strong associations between specific brain cell types and neuropsychiatric disorders. We futher developed deep learning models to predict regulatory function of non-coding disease risk variants.

                The electrophysiological technology having a high spatio-temporal resolution at the single-cell level, and noninvasive measurements of large areas provides insights on underlying neuronal function. Here, we used a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-microelectrode array (MEA) that uses 236,880 electrodes each with an electrode size of 11.22 x 11.22 {micro}m and 236,880 covering a wide area of 5.5 x 5.7 mm in presenting a detailed and single-cell-level neural activity analysis platform for brain slices, human iPS cell-derived cortical networks, peripheral neurons, and human brain organoids. Propagation pattern characteristics between brain regions changes the synaptic strength into compounds based on single-cell time-series patterns, classification based on single DRG neuron firing patterns and compound responses, axonal conduction characteristics and changes to anticancer drugs, and network activities and transition to compounds in brain organoids were extracted. This detailed analysis of neural activity at the single-cell level using our CMOS-MEA provides a new understanding the basic mechanisms of brain circuits in vitro and ex vivo, on human neurological diseases for drug discovery, and compound toxicity assessment.

                Our brain employs mechanisms to adapt to changing visual conditions. In addition to natural changes in our physiology and those in the environment, our brain is also capable of adapting to unnatural changes, such as inverted visual-inputs generated by inverting prisms. In this study, we examined the brains capability to adapt to hyperspaces. We generated four spatial-dimensional stimuli in virtual reality and tested the ability to distinguish between rigid and non-rigid motion. We found that observers are able to differentiate rigid and non-rigid motion of tesseracts (4D) with a performance comparable to that obtained using cubes (3D). Moreover, observers performance improved when they were provided with more immersive 3D experience but remained robust against increasing shape variations. At this juncture, we characterize our findings as 3[1/2]D perception since, while we show the ability to extract and use 4D information, we do not have yet evidence of a complete phenomenal 4D experience.

                N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors are essential for many brain functions. These receptors are heterotetramers typically comprising two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 subunits. The latter could alternate among four subtypes (N2A-N2D) and determine the functional diversity of NMDA receptors. For example, receptors containing N2C or N2D exhibit 50-fold lower channel open probability (Po) than those containing N2A. Structures of N2A- and N2B-containing receptors have been extensively characterized, providing molecular basis for understanding NMDA receptor function. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of N1-N2D and N1-N2C di-heterotetramers (di-receptors), and N1-N2A-N2C tri-heterotetramer (tri-receptor) at a resolution up to 3.0 angstroms. Structural analysis showed that the bilobate N-terminal domain (NTD) in N2D adopted an intrinsic closed conformation, leading to a compact NTD tetramer in N1-N2D receptor. Functional studies further demonstrated that, in di-receptors containing N2D but not N2A or N2B, crosslinking NTD at the tetrameric interface had no effect on channel activity, while crosslinking ligand-binding domain (LBD) of two N1 protomers significantly elevated Po. Surprisingly, we found that the N1-N2C di-receptors spontaneously oscillated between symmetric and asymmetric conformation. The later one occupied a predominant population, whereby two N2C protomers exhibited distinct conformation. This asymmetry, which was also found to a lesser extent in N1-N2A di-receptor, was further locked by the binding of an N2C-specific allosteric potentiator PYD-106 to a unique binding pocket between NTD and LBD in only one N2C protomer. Finally, N2A and N2C in the N1-N2A-N2C tri-receptor displayed the conformation close to that found in one protomer of N1-N2A and N1-N2C di-receptors, respectively. These findings provide a comprehensive structural understanding of diverse functional properties of major NMDA receptor subtypes.

	<p>Objective: Drug dependence has become a major global public health problem. This study aimed to investigate the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and neurological damage in methamphetamine (MA)-dependent individuals. Methods: MA-dependent individuals (all males) were recruited and randomly divided into MA exercise group (MAE) and MA control group (MAC) by using random number table method. The MAE group underwent 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, and the MAC group underwent conventional detoxification. The Neurofilament light chain (NfL), S100 calcium binding protein b (S100b), and Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) levels in the blood of MA-dependent individuals were measured before and after the exercise intervention. Results: After the exercise intervention was implemented, the amount of change in NfL in the plasma of the MAE (1.75 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.40) group was significantly different from that of the MAC (0.60 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.21) group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01); the amount of change in NSE in the serum of the MAE [&amp;amp;minus;1.51 (&amp;amp;minus;3.99~0.31)] group was significantly different from that of the MAC [0.03 (&amp;amp;minus;1.18~1.16)] group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); and the amount of change in S100b in the serum of the MAE [0.66 (0.40~0.95)] group was not significantly different from that of the MAC (0.60 (0.21~1.04)) group (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed that 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise treatment significantly promoted the recovery of blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and neurological damage in MA-dependent patients compared with conventional withdrawal.</p>

	<p>White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are commonly observed in older adults and are associated with cognitive impairment. Although previous studies have found abnormal functional connectivities in patients with WMHs based on static functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the topological properties in the context of brain dynamics remain relatively unexplored. Herein, we explored disrupted dynamic topological properties of functional network connectivity in patients with WMHs and its relationship with cognitive impairment. We included 36 healthy controls (HC) and 104 patients with mild WMHs (n = 39), moderate WMHs (n = 37), and severe (n = 28) WMHs. The fMRI data of all participants were analyzed using Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) and a sliding-window approach to generate dynamic functional connectivity matrics. Then, graph theory methods were applied to calculate the topological properties. Comprehensive neuropsychological scales were used to assess cognitive functions. Relationships between cognitive functions and abnormal dynamic topological properties were evaluated by Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation. We found that the patients with WMHs had higher temporal variability in regional properties, including betweenness centrality, nodal efficiencies, and nodal clustering coefficient. Furthermore, we found that the degree of centrality was related to executive function and memory, and the local coefficient correlated to executive function. Our results indicate that patients with WMHs have higher temporal variabilities in regional properties and are associated with executive and memory function.</p>

	<p>The clothing industry is one of the biggest polluters impacting the environment. Set in a sustainable environment, this study addresses whether certain ambient odors can influence the purchase of second-hand clothing. This study fulfilled three aims, increasing methodological, statistical, and theoretical rigor. First, replicating the finding that fresh laundry odor can boost purchasing behavior in a second-hand store&amp;amp;mdash;this time in a larger sample, using a fully counterbalanced design, in a pre-registered study. Second, assessing the effectiveness of another cleanliness priming control condition (citrus odor) unrelated to the products at hand, to test hypotheses from a hedonic vs. utilitarian model. Third, combining questionnaire data tapping into psychological processes with registered sales. The results (316 questionnaires, 6781 registered transactions) showed that fresh laundry odor significantly increased the amount of money spent by customers compared to the no smell condition, (replication) and compared to citrus odor (extension). Arguably, fresh laundry odor boosts the utilitarian value of the product at (second) hand by making it smell like non-used clothing, ultimately causing customers to purchase far greater amounts in this sustainable setting.</p>

	<p>Sleep and mental health can affect cognition and academic performance. The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between sleep, mental health, working memory, and academic performance. We collected demographic data from university students during the non-academic summer period and the academic term. We also measured academic performance (GPA), sleep (PSQI), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and disordered social media use (SMDS). Working memory was assessed by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). We assessed 83 students (42.2% male) with a mean age of 21 years. Compared to the non-academic summer period, students had significantly worse sleep and distress scores in the academic term. Anxiety, depression, and distress scores were significantly correlated with worse sleep quality. Despite worse mental health and sleep in the academic term, working memory improved compared to the non-academic summer period and was also correlated with a higher GPA. However, a higher GPA was significantly associated with longer sleep latency, increased sleep disturbances, and increased use of sleep medication. Students experiencing poor sleep suffered from poor mental health, although they maintained high GPA and working memory scores. Cognitive resilience, including higher working memory, may mask poor sleep quality and mental health among university students.</p>

	<p>Background: In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and the safety of flow diverter devices (FDD) in anterior communicating artery (ACoA) region aneurysms, focusing on anatomical factors that could affect the outcome, such as the location of the aneurysm along the ACoA (centered on ACoA or decentered on the A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction) and the anatomy of the ACoA region. Methods: Clinical, procedural and follow-up data were analyzed. Aneurysms were classified according to the location along the ACoA (centered or decentered on the A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction) and on the basis of the anatomical configuration of the ACoA region. Safety was assessed by recording intraprocedural, periprocedural and delayed complications to determine the morbidity and mortality rates. The functional outcome was evaluated with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) prior to and after the endovascular procedure. To assess the efficacy, midterm and long-term clinical, angiographic and cross-sectional imaging follow-ups were recorded. Subgroup analysis according to the different ACoA regional anatomical configurations and the ACoA aneurysm locations were performed. Results: 33 patients (17 males; 16 females) with ACoA region aneurysms were treated with FDDs. 27 aneurysms were located at the A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction (82%) while the remaining six aneurysms were centered on the ACoA. No mortality was recorded. The overall morbidity rate was 6% (2/33 procedures). Major complications occurred in 33% (2/6) of ACoA aneurysms and in the 0% of A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction aneurysms. Mid-term and long-term neuroimaging follow-ups showed the occlusion of the aneurysm in 28/33 cases (85%). Complete occlusion rates were 93% in the A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction aneurysms and 50% in ACoA aneurysms. Conclusions: The FDD is a safe and effective tool that can be used in the treatment of selected cases of ACoA region aneurysms. The location of the aneurysm along the ACoA and the regional anatomy of the ACoA complex could affect the efficacy and safety.</p>

	<p>Background: Locked-In Syndrome (LIS) is a rare neurological condition in which patients&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to move, interact, and communicate is impaired despite their being conscious and awake. After assessing the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s needs, we developed a customized device for an LIS patient, as the commercial augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices could not be used. Methods: A 51-year-old woman with incomplete LIS for 15 years came to our laboratory seeking a communication tool. After excluding the available AAC devices, a careful evaluation led to the creation of a customized device (hardware + software). Two years later, we assessed the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s satisfaction with the device. Results: A switch-operated voice-scanning communicator, which the patient could control by residual movement of her thumb without seeing the computer screen, was implemented, together with postural strategies. The user and her family were generally satisfied with the customized device, with a top rating for its effectiveness: it fit well the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s communication needs. Conclusions: Using customized AAC and strategies provides greater opportunities for patients with LIS to resolve their communication problems. Moreover, listening to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s and family&amp;amp;rsquo;s needs can help increase the AAC&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential. The presented switch-operated voice-scanning communicator is available for free on request to the authors.</p>

	<p>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data can be used to develop computer-assisted diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases such as aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) and other lysosomal storage disorders. MR images contain features that are suitable for the classification and differentiation of affected individuals from healthy persons. Here, comparisons were made between MRI features extracted from different types of magnetic resonance images. Random forest classifiers were trained to classify AGU patients (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 24) using volumetric features extracted from T1-weighted MR images, the zone variance of gray level size zone matrix (GLSZM) calculated from magnitude susceptibility-weighted MR images, and the caudate&amp;amp;ndash;thalamus intensity ratio computed from T2-weighted MR images. The leave-one-out cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to compare different models. The left&amp;amp;ndash;right-averaged, normalized volumes of the 25 nuclei of the thalamus and the zone variance of the thalamus demonstrated equal and excellent performance as classifier features for binary organization between AGU patients and healthy controls. Our findings show that texture-based features of susceptibility-weighted images and thalamic volumes can differentiate AGU patients from healthy controls with a very low error rate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PD-L1 expression as predictor of immunotherapy eligibility in penile squamous cell carcinoma patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Penile cancer is a rare malignancy and potentially lethal disease with an incidence of 0,6-2,1 per 100.000. Squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) is the most commonly found penile malignancy. PD-L1 is a tumor marker that co-stimulates the receptor PD-1 to suppress T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study with a total sampling method. The slides taken from the biopsies of seventy-six male patients from Haji Adam Malik Hospital diagnosed with penile squamous cell carcinoma who have already undergone penile biopsy were re-examined for this study, and PD-L1 levels were measured accordingly. Statistical methods were used to assess the association between PD-L1 levels and with SqCC stage. Results: A total of 76 male patients are the subjects of this study. PD-L1 positivity is identified in 25 patients with +1 intensity in 10 patients (13,2%), +2 in 7 patients (9,2) and +3 intensity in 8 patients (10,5%). There are 36 patients (47,4%) diagnosed with stage T3 SqCC, 35 patients (46,1%) with stage N2 SqCC, and 10 patients (13,2%) with stage M1 SqCC. There is significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and metastasis (p=0,022). However, there is no significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and stage N tumor (p=0,167). Conclusions: PD-L1 highly expressed in advanced stage penile SqCC (32.9%), which is associated with the high-risk clinicopathologic features and poor clinical outcomes. These findings showed a potential usage of immunotherapy in advanced penile SqCC treatment.

                Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models are regarded as gold standard preclinical models in leukaemia research, especially in testing new drug combinations where typically 45-50 mice are used per assay. 9000 animal experiments are performed annually in the UK in leukaemia research with these expensive procedures being classed as moderate severity, meaning they cause significant pain, suffering and visible distress to animal’s state. Furthermore, not all clinical leukaemia samples engraft and when they do data turnaround time can be between 6-12 months. Heavy dependence on animal models is because clinical leukaemia samples do not proliferate in vitro. Alternative cell line models though popular for drug testing are not biomimetic – they are not dependent on the microenvironment for survival, growth and treatment response and being derived from relapse samples they do not capture the molecular complexity observed at disease presentation. Here we have developed an in vitro platform to rapidly establish co-cultures of patient-derived leukaemia cells with 3D bone marrow mesenchyme spheroids, BM-MSC-spheroids.  We optimise protocols for developing MSC-spheroid leukaemia co-culture using clinical samples and deliver drug response data within a week. Using three patient samples representing distinct cytogenetics we show that patient-derived-leukaemia cells show enhanced proliferation when co-cultured with MSC-spheroids. In addition, MSC-spheroids provided improved protection against treatment. This makes our spheroids suitable to model treatment resistance – a major hurdle in current day cancer management Given this 3Rs approach is 12 months faster (in delivering clinical data), is a human cell-based biomimetic model and uses 45-50 fewer animals/drug-response assay the anticipated target end-users would include academia and pharmaceutical industry. This animal replacement prototype would facilitate clinically translatable research to be performed with greater ethical, social and financial sustainability.

                Introduction This study examines how the Covid-19 economic impact and parental stress are moderated by family resilience to relate to the family quality of life (FQOL). Methods We modify the measure of FQOL, developed by Beach Center on Disability, by including only four domains (i.e., family interaction, parenting, emotional well-being, and material well-being) to adjust to our research context. Results Based on 169 participants, our CFA displays that all employed measures in the study are valid and reliable. Our regression analysis shows that there are significant direct relations of parental stress & family resilience with family quality of life. However, we find that family resilience only positively moderates the relation between the Covid-19 economic impact and family quality of life. Discussion This study presents a view on how the Covid-19 pandemic affects the way families live and hence, their quality of life.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms of Axon Growth and Regeneration: Moving between Development and Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Axons differ in their growth potential: whereas during development, axons rapidly grow to their targets, in the adult mammalian, CNS axons have lost their ability to grow and therefore fail to regenerate. Recent progress has enabled a better understanding of how developmental mechanisms direct axon regeneration. Focusing on neuronal polarization, where one neurite is singled out to become the axon, has uncovered the mechanisms initiating axon growth and growth restraint. This has helped to define the processes that need to be reactivated to induce axon regeneration: microtubule stabilization and actin dynamics. The molecular machinery underlying axon growth and axon regeneration is remarkably similar and includes the Rho-GTPases Cdc42, Rac-1, and RhoA, as well as the actin regulators cofilin and Myosin II. Importantly, neuron-intrinsic growth inhibitors in the adult nervous system, including the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit &alpha;22 and the presynaptic active zone protein Munc13, restrain dynamics while the components driving axon growth remain largely present. The identified molecules suggest that synaptic transmission and axon growth may be processes that exclude each other. As a result, axon regeneration may be hampered by synaptic transmission and, thus, by the maturation of the CNS. This research has led to several translational avenues to induce axon regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury and stroke; these include the drugs epothilones, gabapentinoids, and baclofen. Thus, the investigation of axon growth and regeneration side by side has been instrumental to coax the regenerative potential of the CNS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cerebellar Contributions to the Basal Ganglia Influence Motor Coordination, Reward Processing, and Movement Vigor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are known for their roles in motor control and motivated behavior. These two systems have been classically considered as independent structures that coordinate their contributions to behavior via separate cortico-thalamic loops. However, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of a rich set of direct connections between these two regions. Although there is strong evidence for connections in both directions, for brevity we limit our discussion to the better-characterized connections from the cerebellum to the basal ganglia. We review two sets of such connections: disynaptic projections through the thalamus and direct monosynaptic projections to the midbrain dopaminergic nuclei, the VTA and the SNc. In each case, we review the evidence for these pathways from anatomic tracing and physiological recordings, and discuss their potential functional roles. We present evidence that the disynaptic pathway through the thalamus is involved in motor coordination, and that its dysfunction contributes to motor deficits, such as dystonia. We then discuss how cerebellar projections to the VTA and SNc influence dopamine release in the respective targets of these nuclei: the NAc and the dorsal striatum. We argue that the cerebellar projections to the VTA may play a role in reward-based learning and therefore contribute to addictive behavior, whereas the projection to the SNc may contribute to movement vigor. Finally, we speculate how these projections may explain many of the observations that indicate a role for the cerebellum in mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Neurosurgical Functional Dissection of the Middle Precentral Gyrus during Speech Production</a></h4>

              
                <p>Classical models have traditionally focused on the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) as a key region for motor planning of speech production. However, converging evidence suggests that it is not critical for either speech motor planning or execution. Alternative cortical areas supporting high-level speech motor planning have yet to be defined. In this review, we focus on the precentral gyrus, whose role in speech production is often thought to be limited to lower-level articulatory muscle control. In particular, we highlight neurosurgical investigations that have shed light on a cortical region anatomically located near the midpoint of the precentral gyrus, hence called the middle precentral gyrus (midPrCG). The midPrCG is functionally located between dorsal hand and ventral orofacial cortical representations and exhibits unique sensorimotor and multisensory functions relevant for speech processing. This includes motor control of the larynx, auditory processing, as well as a role in reading and writing. Furthermore, direct electrical stimulation of midPrCG can evoke complex movements, such as vocalization, and selective injury can cause deficits in verbal fluency, such as pure apraxia of speech. Based on these findings, we propose that midPrCG is essential to phonological-motoric aspects of speech production, especially syllabic-level speech sequencing, a role traditionally ascribed to Broca's area. The midPrCG is a cortical brain area that should be included in contemporary models of speech production with a unique role in speech motor planning and execution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Better Inference in Neuroscience: Test Less, Estimate More</a></h4>

              
                <p>Null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has become the main tool of inference in neuroscience, and yet evidence suggests we do not use this tool well: tests are often planned poorly, conducted unfairly, and interpreted invalidly. This editorial makes the case that in addition to reforms to increase rigor we should test less, reserving NHST for clearly confirmatory contexts in which the researcher has derived a quantitative prediction, can provide the inputs needed to plan a quality test, and can specify the criteria not only for confirming their hypothesis but also for rejecting it. A reduction in testing would be accompanied by an expansion of the use of estimation [effect sizes and confidence intervals (CIs)]. Estimation is more suitable for exploratory research, provides the inputs needed to plan strong tests, and provides important contexts for properly interpreting tests.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroscience Needs to Test Both Statistical and Scientific Hypotheses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experimental neuroscience typically uses "<I>p</I>-valued" statistical testing procedures (null hypothesis significance testing; NHST) in evaluating its results. The rote, often misguided, application of NHST (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B13">Gigerenzer, 2008</cross-ref>) has led to errors and "questionable research practices." Although the problems could be avoided with better statistics training (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B23">Lakens, 2021</cross-ref>), there have been calls to abandon NHST altogether. One suggestion is to replace NHST with "estimation statistics" (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B10">Calin-Jageman and Cumming, 2019</cross-ref>). Estimation statistics emphasizes the uncertainty inherent in scientific investigations and uses metrics, e.g., confidence intervals (CIs), that draw attention to uncertainty. Besides procedural steps and methods, the Estimation Approach prefers expressing "quantitative," rather than "qualitative" conclusions and making generalizations, rather than testing scientific hypotheses. The Estimation Approach embodies a philosophy of science&mdash;its ultimate goals, experimental mindset, and specific aims&mdash;that diverges unhelpfully from what laboratory-based neuroscience needs. The Estimation Approach meshes naturally with, e.g., clinical neuroscience, drug development, human psychology, and social sciences. It fits less well with much of the neuroscience published in the <I>Journal of Neuroscience</I>, for example. In contrast, the philosophy behind NHST fits naturally with traditional, evaluative testing of scientific hypotheses. Finally, some Estimation Approach remedies, e.g., replication, ideally with "preregistration," are incompatible with much experimental neuroscience. This Dual Perspective essay argues that, while neuroscience can benefit from practical aspects of estimation statistics, entirely replacing conventional methods with the Estimation Approach would be a mistake. NHST testing should be retained and improved.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Experimental neuroscience relies on statistical procedures to assess the meaning and importance of its research findings. Optimal scientific communication demands a common set of assumptions for expressing and evaluating results. Problems arising from misuse of conventional significance testing methods have led to a proposal to replace significance testing with an Estimation Statistics Approach. Practical elements of the Estimation Approach can usefully be incorporated into conventional methods. However, the prevailing philosophy of the Estimation Approach does not address certain important needs of much experimental neuroscience. Neuroscience should adopt beneficial elements of the Estimation Approach without giving up the advantages of significance testing.</p>

                <p>Psychedelic drugs have reemerged as tools to treat several brain disorders. Cultural attitudes toward them are changing, and scientists are once again investigating the neural mechanisms through which these drugs impact brain function. The significance of this research direction is reflected by recent work, including work presented by these authors at the 2022 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. As of 2022, there were hundreds of clinical trials recruiting participants for testing the therapeutic effects of psychedelics. Emerging evidence suggests that psychedelic drugs may exert some of their long-lasting therapeutic effects by inducing structural and functional neural plasticity. Herein, basic and clinical research attempting to elucidate the mechanisms of these compounds is showcased. Topics covered include psychedelic receptor binding sites, effects of psychedelics on gene expression, and on dendrites, and psychedelic effects on microcircuitry and brain-wide circuits. We describe unmet clinical needs and the current state of translation to the clinic for psychedelics, as well as other unanswered basic neuroscience questions addressable with future studies.</p>

                <p>Since the discovery of conspicuously spatially tuned neurons in the hippocampal formation over 50 years ago, characterizing which, where, and how neurons encode navigationally relevant variables has been a major thrust of navigational neuroscience. While much of this effort has centered on the hippocampal formation and functionally-adjacent structures, recent work suggests that spatial codes, in some form or another, can be found throughout the brain, even in areas traditionally associated with sensation, movement, and executive function. In this review, we highlight these unexpected results, draw insights from comparison of these codes across contexts, regions, and species, and finally suggest an avenue for future work to make sense of these diverse and dynamic navigational codes.</p>

                <p>Dendrites receive the vast majority of a single neuron's inputs, and coordinate the transformation of these signals into neuronal output. <I>Ex vivo</I> and theoretical evidence has shown that dendrites possess powerful processing capabilities, yet little is known about how these mechanisms are engaged in the intact brain or how they influence circuit dynamics. New experimental and computational technologies have led to a surge in interest to unravel and harness their computational potential. This review highlights recent and emerging work that combines established and cutting-edge technologies to identify the role of dendrites in brain function. We discuss active dendritic mediation of sensory perception and learning in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Complementing these physiological findings, we present theoretical work that provides new insights into the underlying computations of single neurons and networks by using biologically plausible implementations of dendritic processes. Finally, we present a novel brain&ndash;computer interface task, which assays somatodendritic coupling to study the mechanisms of biological credit assignment. Together, these findings present exciting progress in understanding how dendrites are critical for <I>in vivo</I> learning and behavior, and highlight how subcellular processes can contribute to our understanding of both biological and artificial neural computation.</p>

Accordingly, perturbations of PFC inhibitory microcircuits are thought to underlie dysregulated cognition and behavior in numerous psychiatric diseases and relevant animal models. This review, based on a Mini-Symposium presented at the 2022 Society for Neuroscience Meeting, highlights recent studies providing novel insights into: (1) discrete medial PFC (mPFC) interneuron populations in the mouse brain; (2) mPFC interneuron connections with, and regulation of, long-range mPFC afferents; and (3) circuit-specific plasticity of mPFC interneurons. The contributions of such populations, pathways, and plasticity to rodent cognition are discussed in the context of stress, reward, motivational conflict, and genetic mutations relevant to psychiatric disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Mechanisms Mediating Sex Differences in Motivation for Reward: Cognitive Bias, Food, Gambling, and Drugs of Abuse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sex differences in motivation for food rewards, gambling, and drugs of abuse are modulated by multiple factors, including sensory stimuli, gonadal hormones, and cognitive bias. Cues, drugs of abuse, and a high-fat diet can significantly impact neural signaling in the reward system and functioning of neural systems that regulate executive functions differentially in males and females. Additionally, sex differences in risky decision-making, cognitive bias, and motivation for food and drugs of abuse are mediated by gonadal hormones in both sexes. As neuroscientists analyze data from both sexes, it is becoming apparent that these differences are not simply mediated by hormones in females, but involve sex differences in the specific neural responses to stimuli, including both external stimuli and internal hormonal signals. Understanding sex differences in the mechanisms underlying reward-seeking behaviors and the development of substance use disorders will help uncover potential therapies and treatments that will benefit both men and women. Based on these observations, it is essential that females are included in neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Super-Resolution Microscopy Opens New Doors to Life at the Nanoscale</a></h4>

              
                <p>Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy holds tremendous potential for discovery in neuroscience. Much of the molecular machinery and anatomic specializations that give rise to the unique and bewildering electrochemical activity of neurons are nanoscale by design, ranging somewhere between 1 nm and 1 &mu;m. It is at this scale where most of the unknown and exciting action is and where cell biologists flock to in their dreams, but it was off limits for light microscopy until recently. While the optical principles of super-resolution microscopy are firmly established by now, the technology continues to advance rapidly in many crucial areas, enhancing its performance and reliability, and making it more accessible and user-friendly, which is sorely needed. Indeed, super-resolution microscopy techniques are nowadays widely used for visualizing immunolabeled protein distributions in fixed or living cells. However, a great potential of super-resolution microscopy for neuroscience lies in shining light on the nanoscale structures and biochemical activities in live-tissue settings, which should be developed and harnessed much more fully. In this review, we will present several vivid examples based on STED and RESOLFT super-resolution microscopy, illustrating the possibilities and challenges of nano-imaging <I>in vivo</I> to pique the interest of tech-developers and neurobiologists alike. We will cover recent technical progress that is facilitating <I>in vivo</I> applications, and share new biological insights into the nanoscale mechanisms of cellular communication between neurons and glia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Music and Brain Circuitry: Strategies for Strengthening Evidence-Based Research for Music-Based Interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neuroscience of music and music-based interventions (MBIs) is a fascinating but challenging research field. While music is a ubiquitous component of every human society, MBIs may encompass listening to music, performing music, music-based movement, undergoing music education and training, or receiving treatment from music therapists. Unraveling the brain circuits activated and influenced by MBIs may help us gain better understanding of the therapeutic and educational values of MBIs by gathering strong research evidence. However, the complexity and variety of MBIs impose unique research challenges. This article reviews the recent endeavor led by the National Institutes of Health to support evidence-based research of MBIs and their impact on health and diseases. It also highlights fundamental challenges and strategies of MBI research with emphases on the utilization of animal models, human brain imaging and stimulation technologies, behavior and motion capturing tools, and computational approaches. It concludes with suggestions of basic requirements when studying MBIs and promising future directions to further strengthen evidence-based research on MBIs in connections with brain circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Music and music-based interventions (MBI) engage a wide range of brain circuits and hold promising therapeutic potentials for a variety of health conditions. Comparative studies using animal models have helped in uncovering brain circuit activities involved in rhythm perception, while human imaging, brain stimulation, and motion capture technologies have enabled neural circuit analysis underlying the effects of MBIs on motor, affective/reward, and cognitive function. Combining computational analysis, such as prediction method, with mechanistic studies in animal models and humans may unravel the complexity of MBIs and their effects on health and disease.</p>

                <p>Understanding the unique functions of different subregions of primate prefrontal cortex has been a longstanding goal in cognitive neuroscience. Yet, the anatomy and function of one of its largest subregions (the frontopolar cortex) remain enigmatic and underspecified. Our Society for Neuroscience minisymposium <I>Primate Frontopolar Cortex: From Circuits to Complex Behaviors</I> will comprise a range of new anatomic and functional approaches that have helped to clarify the basic circuit anatomy of the frontal pole, its functional involvement during performance of cognitively demanding behavioral paradigms in monkeys and humans, and its clinical potential as a target for noninvasive brain stimulation in patients with brain disorders. This review consolidates knowledge about the anatomy and connectivity of frontopolar cortex and provides an integrative summary of its function in primates. We aim to answer the question: what, if anything, does frontopolar cortex contribute to goal-directed cognition and action?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retrograde Axonal Autophagy and Endocytic Pathways Are Parallel and Separate in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Autophagy and endocytic trafficking are two key pathways that regulate the composition and integrity of the neuronal proteome. Alterations in these pathways are sufficient to cause neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, defining how autophagy and endocytic pathways are organized in neurons remains a key area of investigation. These pathways share many features and converge on lysosomes for cargo degradation, but what remains unclear is the degree to which the identity of each pathway is preserved in each compartment of the neuron. Here, we elucidate the degree of intersection between autophagic and endocytic pathways in axons of primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Using microfluidic chambers, we labeled newly-generated bulk endosomes and signaling endosomes in the distal axon, and systematically tracked their trajectories, molecular composition, and functional characteristics relative to autophagosomes. We find that newly-formed endosomes and autophagosomes both undergo retrograde transport in the axon, but as distinct organelle populations. Moreover, these pathways differ in their degree of acidification and association with molecular determinants of organelle maturation. These results suggest that the identity of autophagic and newly endocytosed organelles is preserved for the length of the axon. Lastly, we find that expression of a pathogenic form of &alpha;-synuclein, a protein enriched in presynaptic terminals, increases merging between autophagic and endocytic pathways. Thus, aberrant merging of these pathways may represent a mechanism contributing to neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related &alpha;-synucleinopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autophagy and endocytic trafficking are retrograde pathways in neuronal axons that fulfill critical degradative and signaling functions. These pathways share many features and converge on lysosomes for cargo degradation, but the extent to which the identity of each pathway is preserved in axons is unclear. We find that autophagosomes and endosomes formed in the distal axon undergo retrograde transport to the soma in parallel and separate pathways. These pathways also have distinct maturation profiles along the mid-axon, further highlighting differences in the potential fate of transported cargo. Strikingly, expression of a pathogenic variant of &alpha;-synuclein increases merging between autophagic and endocytic pathways, suggesting that mis-sorting of axonal cargo may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related &alpha;-synucleinopathies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Olig2 Ablation in Immature Oligodendrocytes Does Not Enhance CNS Myelination and Remyelination</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage transcription factor Olig2 is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is essential for oligodendroglial progenitor specification and differentiation. It was previously reported that deletion of <I>Olig2</I> enhanced the maturation and myelination of immature OLs and accelerated the remyelination process. However, by analyzing multiple <I>Olig2</I> conditional KO mouse lines (male and female), we conclude that Olig2 has the opposite effect and is required for OL maturation and remyelination. We found that deletion of <I>Olig2</I> in immature OLs driven by an immature OL-expressing <I>Plp1</I> promoter resulted in defects in OL maturation and myelination, and did not enhance remyelination after demyelination. Similarly, <I>Olig2</I> deletion during premyelinating stages in immature OLs using <I>Mobp</I> or <I>Mog</I> promoter-driven Cre lines also did not enhance OL maturation in the CNS. Further, we found that Olig2 was not required for myelin maintenance in mature OLs but was critical for remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelinating injury. Analysis of genomic occupancy in immature and mature OLs revealed that Olig2 targets the enhancers of key myelination-related genes for OL maturation from immature OLs. Together, by leveraging multiple immature OL-expressing Cre lines, these studies indicate that Olig2 is essential for differentiation and myelination of immature OLs and myelin repair. Our findings raise fundamental questions about the previously proposed role of Olig2 in opposing OL myelination and highlight the importance of using Cre-dependent reporter(s) for lineage tracing in studying cell state progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identification of the regulators that promote oligodendrocyte (OL) myelination and remyelination is important for promoting myelin repair in devastating demyelinating diseases. Olig2 is expressed throughout OL lineage development. Ablation of <I>Olig2</I> was reported to induce maturation, myelination, and remyelination from immature OLs. However, lineage-mapping analysis of <I>Olig2</I>-ablated cells was not conducted. Here, by leveraging multiple immature OL-expressing Cre lines, we observed no evidence that <I>Olig2</I> ablation promotes maturation or remyelination of immature OLs. Instead, we find that Olig2 is required for immature OL maturation, myelination, and myelin repair. These data raise fundamental questions about the proposed inhibitory role of Olig2 against OL maturation and remyelination. Our findings highlight the importance of validating genetic manipulation with cell lineage tracing in studying myelination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrating Visual Information into the Auditory Cortex Promotes Sound Discrimination through Choice-Related Multisensory Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>An increasing number of studies have shown that cross-modal interaction can occur in early sensory cortices. Yet, how neurons in sensory cortices integrate multisensory cues in perceptual tasks and to what extent this influences behavior is largely unclear. To investigate, we examined visual modulation of auditory responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in a two-alternative forced-choice task. During the task, male rats were required to make a behavioral choice based on the pure tone frequency (low vs high) of the self-triggered stimulus to get a water reward. The result showed that the presence of a noninformative visual cue did not uniformly influence auditory response, with frequently enhancing just one of them. Closely correlated with behavioral choice, the visual cue mainly enhanced responsiveness to the auditory cue indicating a movement direction contralateral to A1 being recorded. Operating in this fashion provided A1 neurons a superior capability to discriminate sound during multisensory trials. Concomitantly, behavioral data and decoding analysis revealed that visual cue presence could speed the process of sound discrimination. We also observed this differential multisensory integration effect in well-trained rats when tested with passive stimulation and under anesthesia, albeit to a much lesser extent. We did not see this differentially integrative effect while recording in A1 in another similar group of rats performing a free-choice task. These data suggest that auditory cortex can engage in meaningful audiovisual processing, and perceptual learning can modify its multisensory integration mechanism to meet task requirements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the natural environment, visual stimuli are frequently accompanied by auditory cues. Although multisensory integration has traditionally been seen as a feature of associational cortices, recent studies have shown that cross-modal inputs can also influence neuronal activity in primary sensory cortices. However, exactly how neurons in sensory cortices integrate multisensory cues to guide behavioral choice is still unclear. Here, we describe a novel model of multisensory integration used by A1 neurons to shape auditory representations when rats performed a cue-guided task. We found that a task-irrelevant visual cue could specifically enhance the response of neurons in sound guiding to the contralateral choice. This differentially integrative model facilitated sound discrimination and behavioral choice. This result indicates that task engagement can modulate multisensory integration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Theta Paradox: 4-8 Hz EEG Oscillations Reflect Both Sleep Pressure and Cognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations characterize specific behavioral and vigilance states. The frequency of these oscillations is typically sufficient to distinguish a given state; however, theta oscillations (4&ndash;8 Hz) have instead been found in near-opposite conditions of drowsiness during sleep deprivation and alert cognitive control. While the latter has been extensively studied and is often referred to as "frontal midline theta," (fmTheta) the former has been investigated far less but is considered a marker for sleep pressure during wake. In this study we investigated to what extent theta oscillations differed during cognitive tasks and sleep deprivation. We measured high-density EEG in 18 young healthy adults (nine female) performing six tasks under three levels of sleep deprivation. We found both cognitive load and sleep deprivation increased theta power in medial prefrontal cortical areas; however, sleep deprivation caused additional increases in theta in many other, predominantly frontal, areas. The sources of sleep deprivation theta (sdTheta) were task dependent, with a visual-spatial task and short-term memory (STM) task showing the most widespread effects. Notably, theta was highest in supplementary motor areas during passive music listening, and highest in the inferior temporal cortex (responsible for object recognition) during a spatial game. Furthermore, while changes in task performance were correlated with increases in theta during sleep deprivation, this relationship was not specific to the EEG of the same task and did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Altogether, these results suggest that both during sleep deprivation and cognition theta oscillations may preferentially occur in cortical areas not involved in ongoing behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Electroencephalographic (EEG) research in sleep has often remained separate from research in cognition. This has led to two incompatible interpretations of the function of theta brain oscillations (4&ndash;8 Hz): that they reflect local sleep events during sleep deprivation, or that they reflect cognitive processing during tasks. With this study, we found no fundamental differences between theta oscillations during cognition and theta during sleep deprivation that would suggest different functions. Instead, our results indicate that in both cases, theta oscillations are generated by cortical areas not required for ongoing behavior. Therefore, at least in humans, theta may reflect either cortical disengagement or inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrity of Neuronal Size in the Entorhinal Cortex Is a Biological Substrate of Exceptional Cognitive Aging</a></h4>

              
                <p>Average aging is associated with a gradual decline of memory capacity. SuperAgers are humans &ge;80 years of age who show exceptional episodic memory at least as good as individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior. This study investigated whether neuronal integrity in the entorhinal cortex (ERC), an area critical for memory and selectively vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration, differentiated SuperAgers from cognitively healthy younger individuals, cognitively average peers ("Normal Elderly"), and individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Postmortem sections of the ERC were stained with cresyl violet to visualize neurons and immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibody PHF-1 to visualize neurofibrillary tangles. The cross-sectional area (i.e., size) of layer II and layer III/V ERC neurons were quantified. Two-thirds of total participants were female. Unbiased stereology was used to quantitate tangles in a subgroup of SuperAgers and Normal Elderly. Linear mixed-effect models were used to determine differences across groups. Quantitative measurements found that the soma size of layer II ERC neurons in postmortem brain specimens were significantly larger in SuperAgers compared with all groups (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05)&mdash;including younger individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.005). SuperAgers had significantly fewer stereologically quantified Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary tangles in layer II ERC than Normal Elderly (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). This difference in tangle burden in layer II between SuperAgers and Normal Elderly suggests that tangle-bearing neurons may be prone to shrinkage during aging. The finding that SuperAgers show ERC layer II neurons that are substantially larger even compared with individuals 20&ndash;30 years younger is remarkable, suggesting that layer II ERC integrity is a biological substrate of exceptional memory in old age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Average aging is associated with a gradual decline of memory. Previous research shows that an area critical for memory, the entorhinal cortex (ERC), is susceptible to the early formation of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, even during average (or typical) trajectories of aging. The Northwestern University SuperAging Research Program studies unique individuals known as SuperAgers, individuals &ge;80 years old who show exceptional memory that is at least as good as individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior. In this study, we show that SuperAgers harbor larger, healthier neurons in the ERC compared with their cognitively average same-aged peers, those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and &ndash; remarkably &ndash; even compared with individuals 20&ndash;30 years younger. We conclude that larger ERC neurons are a biological signature of the SuperAging trajectory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Distribution Features and Potential Effects of Serotonin in the Cerebrum of SOD1 G93A Transgenic Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Serotonin (5-HT) participates in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but its effects have not been completely clarified. Therefore, we observed the distribution features and potential effects of 5-HT in the cerebrum of G93A SOD1 transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice by fluorescence immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, ELISA, as well as motor function measurements. Both 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) were mainly present in the limbic systems of the cerebrum, such as the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, cingulate, fimbria of the hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus, lateral hypothalamus area, dorsal raphe nucleus, and piriform cortex. TPH2 and 5-HT were expressed in cell bodies in the dorsal raphe nucleus and piriform cortex, while in other regions they were distributed as filaments and clump shapes in axons. The TPH2 distribution in the cerebrum of TG was significantly lower than that in WT in preset, onset, and progression stages. TPH2 expression in the fimbria of the hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus and lateral hypothalamus area was increased in the onset stage and decreased in the progression stage, gradually decreased in the cingulate with disease progression and significantly decreased in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and nucleus accumbens in the onset stage in TG. The number of mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 in the subventricular zone (SVZ) in TG was significantly lower than that in WT, which was correlated with the TPH2 distribution. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that TPH2, mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 and 5-HT were mainly expressed in neurons but rarely expressed in microglia or astrocytes in the piriform cortex. The relative fluorescence density of TPH2 in the cingulate region was negatively correlated with the disease severity. Our findings suggest that 5-HT plays a protective role in ALS, likely by regulating neural stem cells in the subventricular zone that might be involved in neuron development in the piriform cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Context Binding in Visual Working Memory Is Reflected in Bilateral Event-Related Potentials, But Not in Contralateral Delay Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Successful retrieval of a specific item from visual working memory (VWM) depends on the binding of that item to its unique context. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of VWM manipulating memory set homogeneity have identified an important role for the intraparietal sulcus in context binding, independent of any role in representing stimulus identity. The current study explored whether the contralateral delay activity (CDA), which is an event-related potential (ERP) component derived from posterior electrodes that tracks the amount of information held in VWM, might also be sensitive to context-binding demands. In experiment 1, human participants performed lateralized delayed recognition with memory sets containing one, three, or five items that were drawn from the same category (orientations: "homogeneous") or from different categories (orientation, color, and luminance: "heterogeneous"). Because the location and identity of the memory probe indicated the item to be retrieved, homogeneous trials placed higher context-binding demands. VWM capacity was higher in heterogeneous trials. ERPs contralateral (contra) and ipsilateral (ipsi) to the remembered stimuli were higher for homogeneous trials, but these differences were removed in the contra &ndash; ipsi subtraction that produced the CDA. In experiment 2, human participants performed lateralized delayed recall with memory sets of one or three items (homogeneous or heterogeneous). Behavior was superior for three-item heterogeneous trials than for homogeneous trials, with modeling revealing context-binding errors in the latter. Bilateral ERPs and CDA results replicated experiment 1. These results support that the CDA tracks the number of object files engaged by VWM and establish that it is not sensitive to context-binding demands.</p>

                Background: The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is used for diagnosis in inflammatory processes, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affecting our population. To determine the values of ESR in the evolution of patients with COVID-19 undergoing treatment at the CLAS Health Center in Nuevo Lurín. Methods: Our research applied a quantitative-observational, descriptive, and longitudinal approach. The sample consisted of 26 male and 19 female patients treated at the study site between February and June 2021, none of whom were in critical condition. To collect all the necessary information, the Capillary or Wintrobe method was used to determine the values of ESR in the evolution of the COVID-19 patients, obtaining different values for the 45 patients seen at the study site. The normal ESR value was 0 - 15mm/h for males and 0 - 20mm/h for females.  Results: The initial ESR test in patients positive for COVID-19 showed that only two cases (0.04%) had slightly elevated ESR ranges, while in the rest of the values (95.56%) remained within the normal range. Conclusions:  From the results of the capillary velocity of sedimentation method, it can be concluded that patients with COVID-19 in Peru showed no signs of inflammation within their bodies due to the virus.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AvP: A software package for automatic phylogenetic detection of candidate horizontal gene transfers</a></h4>

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the transfer of genes between species outside the transmission from parent to offspring. Due to their impact on the genome and biology of various species, HGTs have gained broader attention, but high-throughput methods to robustly identify them are lacking. One rapid method to identify HGT candidates is to calculate the difference in similarity between the most similar gene in closely related species and the most similar gene in distantly related species. Although metrics on similarity associated with taxonomic information can rapidly detect putative HGTs, these methods are hampered by false positives that are difficult to track. Furthermore, they do not inform on the evolutionary trajectory and events such as duplications. Hence, phylogenetic analysis is necessary to confirm HGT candidates and provide a more comprehensive view of their origin and evolutionary history. However, phylogenetic reconstruction requires several time-consuming manual steps to retrieve the homologous sequences, produce a multiple alignment, construct the phylogeny and analyze the topology to assess whether it supports the HGT hypothesis. Here, we present <i>AvP</i> which automatically performs all these steps and detects candidate HGTs within a phylogenetic framework.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">OrganoID: A versatile deep learning platform for tracking and analysis of single-organoid dynamics</a></h4>

Organoids have immense potential as <i>ex vivo</i> disease models for drug discovery and personalized drug screening. Dynamic changes in individual organoid morphology, number, and size can indicate important drug responses. However, these metrics are difficult and labor-intensive to obtain for high-throughput image datasets. Here, we present OrganoID, a robust image analysis platform that automatically recognizes, labels, and tracks single organoids, pixel-by-pixel, in brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy experiments. The platform was trained on images of pancreatic cancer organoids and validated on separate images of pancreatic, lung, colon, and adenoid cystic carcinoma organoids, which showed excellent agreement with manual measurements of organoid count (95%) and size (97%) without any parameter adjustments. Single-organoid tracking accuracy remained above 89% over a four-day time-lapse microscopy study. Automated single-organoid morphology analysis of a chemotherapy dose-response experiment identified strong dose effect sizes on organoid circularity, solidity, and eccentricity. OrganoID enables straightforward, detailed, and accurate image analysis to accelerate the use of organoids in high-throughput, data-intensive biomedical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Host circadian behaviors exert only weak selective pressure on the gut microbiome under stable conditions but are critical for recovery from antibiotic treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chi Zhao, Kevin Kelly, Maria Luísa Jabbur, Marcell Paguaga, Megan Behringer, Carl Hirschie Johnson</p>

The circadian rhythms of hosts dictate an approximately 24 h transformation in the environment experienced by their gut microbiome. The consequences of this cyclic environment on the intestinal microbiota are barely understood and are likely to have medical ramifications. Can daily rhythmicity in the gut act as a selective pressure that shapes the microbial community? Moreover, given that several bacterial species have been reported to exhibit circadian rhythms themselves, we test here whether a rhythmic environment is a selective pressure that favors clock-harboring bacteria that can anticipate and prepare for consistent daily changes in the environment. We observed that the daily rhythmicity of the mouse gut environment is a stabilizing influence that facilitates microbiotal recovery from antibiotic perturbation. The composition of the microbiome recovers to pretreatment conditions when exposed to consistent daily rhythmicity, whereas in hosts whose feeding and activity patterns are temporally disrupted, microbiotal recovery is incomplete and allows potentially unhealthy opportunists to exploit the temporal disarray. Unexpectedly, we found that in the absence of antibiotic perturbation, the gut microbiome is stable to rhythmic versus disrupted feeding and activity patterns. Comparison of our results with those of other studies reveals an intriguing correlation that a stable microbiome may be resilient to one perturbation alone (e.g., disruption of the daily timing of host behavior and feeding), but not to multiple perturbations in combination. However, after a perturbation of the stable microbiome, a regular daily pattern of host behavior/feeding appears to be essential for the microbiome to recover to the original steady state. Given the inconsistency of daily rhythms in modern human life (e.g., shiftwork, social jet-lag, irregular eating habits), these results emphasize the importance of consistent daily rhythmicity to optimal health not only directly to the host, but also indirectly by preserving the host’s microbiome in the face of perturbations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Horizontal gene transfer and ecological interactions jointly control microbiome stability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katharine Z. Coyte, Cagla Stevenson, Christopher G. Knight, Ellie Harrison, James P. J. Hall, Michael A. Brockhurst</p>

Genes encoding resistance to stressors, such as antibiotics or environmental pollutants, are widespread across microbiomes, often encoded on mobile genetic elements. Yet, despite their prevalence, the impact of resistance genes and their mobility upon the dynamics of microbial communities remains largely unknown. Here we develop eco-evolutionary theory to explore how resistance genes alter the stability of diverse microbiomes in response to stressors. We show that adding resistance genes to a microbiome typically increases its overall stability, particularly for genes on mobile genetic elements with high transfer rates that efficiently spread resistance throughout the community. However, the impact of resistance genes upon the stability of individual taxa varies dramatically depending upon the identity of individual taxa, the mobility of the resistance gene, and the network of ecological interactions within the community. Nonmobile resistance genes can benefit susceptible taxa in cooperative communities yet damage those in competitive communities. Moreover, while the transfer of mobile resistance genes generally increases the stability of previously susceptible recipient taxa to perturbation, it can decrease the stability of the originally resistant donor taxon. We confirmed key theoretical predictions experimentally using competitive soil microcosm communities. Here the stability of a susceptible microbial community to perturbation was increased by adding mobile resistance genes encoded on conjugative plasmids but was decreased when these same genes were encoded on the chromosome. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the interplay between ecological interactions and horizontal gene transfer in driving the eco-evolutionary dynamics of diverse microbiomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany – cross-sectional  lecturer-side evaluation for the application of digital teaching concepts [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant restrictions on dental teaching. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the attitudes of faculty members towards digital teaching formats and the effort creating digital lectures. We hypothesized that on the lecturer side there is no difference between the various digital teaching concepts in terms of workload and effort and that there is no increase in workload and effort when switching to digital teaching concepts. Methods: All German dental faculties were invited to the online survey by an anonymous voluntary questionnaire from January to April 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions that could be answered with a visual analog scale, free text answers, or with fixed answer options. Data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and an exploratory data analysis (α=0.05). Results: Before the pandemic, 24.8% of the participating lecturers were using digital teaching and 64.4% had no previous experience. After the outbreak of the pandemic 100% of the dental teaching was initially held online. More than 80% of the lecturers stated that they offer online lectures (86.1%), online seminars (81.2%), and/or online bedside teaching (33.7%). 88.1% see face-to-face teaching as the preferred teaching format. The lecturers also see the greatest opportunities for interaction in the area of analog teaching and significantly worse in synchronous and asynchronous digital teaching. In the course of the pandemic, respondents' attitudes towards online teaching improved in the median of 24.0 to a median of 50.0. Conclusions: Faculty members have positively changed their attitudes towards online teaching formats over the course of the pandemic. Although they see the greatest learning success in conventional face-to-face teaching formats and the creation of digital lectures is associated with a higher effort, they want more online lessons in the future.

                Background: In the past 30–40 years, conflicts over limited conventional energy sources and the negative climate change caused by them have attracted researchers and analysts to new, clean, and green energy technologies. Thereby reducing the consumption of conventional fuel and the negative impact on the climate. The production of alternative energy in the form of thermal energy storage using phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the techniques that not only reduces the gap between the supply and demand of energy but also increases the stability of the energy supply. The tendency of PCMs to melt and solidify over a wide temperature range makes them more attractive for use in many applications. The effective and efficient storage of solar energy by PCM has the potential to significantly advance the use of renewable energy. Methods: Organic non-paraffin compound beeswax (BW) mixed with other non-paraffin compounds stearic acid (SA), Palmitic acid (PA), Myristic acid (MA), and Lauric acid (LA) in different compositions with the help of magnetic stirrer at 50–60°C for 3–4 hours to prepare BWSA, BWPA, BWMA, and BWLA eutectic PCM. Results: Prepared eutectics melt and solidify in the temperature range 36–56°C and with latent heat in the range of 155–211 kJ/Kg. Conclusions: Due to suitable temperature and good latent heat storage range, it is a good choice as thermal energy storage, for solar drying applications.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The laterodorsal tegmentum and seizure regulation: Revisiting the evidence</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now a routine treatment option for patients suffering from medically refractory epilepsy. DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has proven to be effective but, despite its success, few patients experience complete cessation of seizure activity. However, improving the therapy is challenging because the mechanism underlying its action remains largely unknown. One angle on improving the effectiveness of ANT stimulation is to better understand the various anatomic regions that send projections to and through this area. Here, the authors utilized a connectomic atlas of the mouse brain to better understand the regions projecting to the ANT and were particularly interested by the presence of robust cholinergic projections from the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). A subsequent review of the literature resulted in limited studies, which presented convincing evidence supporting this region's role in seizure control present in acute rodent models of epilepsy. It is thus the purpose of this paper to encourage further research into the role of the LDT on seizure mitigation, with mechanistic effects likely stemming from its cholinergic projections to the ANT. While previous studies have laid a firm foundation supporting the role of this region in modulation of seizure activity, modern scientific methodology has yet to be applied to further elucidate the mechanisms and potential benefits associated with LDT stimulation in the epileptic population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Fewer COVID‐19 Neurological Complications with Dexamethasone and Remdesivir</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the impact of treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both on neurological complications in acute coronavirus diease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used observational data from the International Severe Acute and emerging Respiratory Infection Consortium World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterization Protocol, United Kingdom. Hospital inpatients aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted between January 31, 2020, and June 29, 2021, were included. Treatment allocation was non-blinded and performed by reporting clinicians. A propensity scoring methodology was used to minimize confounding. Treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, or both was assessed against the standard of care. The primary outcome was a neurological complication occurring at the point of death, discharge, or resolution of the COVID-19 clinical episode.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Out of 89,297 hospital inpatients, 64,088 had severe COVID-19 and 25,209 had non-hypoxic COVID-19. Neurological complications developed in 4.8% and 4.5%, respectively. In both groups, neurological complications were associated with increased mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, worse self-care on discharge, and time to recovery. In patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with dexamethasone (n = 21,129), remdesivir (n = 1,428), and both combined (n = 10,846) were associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications: OR = 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69–0.83), OR = 0.69 (95% CI = 0.51–0.90), and OR = 0.54 (95% CI = 0.47–0.61), respectively. In patients with non-hypoxic COVID-19, dexamethasone (n = 2,580) was associated with less neurological complications (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.62–0.97), whereas the dexamethasone/remdesivir combination (n = 460) showed a similar trend (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.31–1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir, or both in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications in an additive manner, such that the greatest benefit was observed in patients who received both drugs together.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to explore the gene expression profile of primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain specimens of 4 patients with granulomatous vasculitis (GV), 5 with lymphocytic vasculitis (LV), 4 with amyloid β-related angiitis (ABRA), and 4 normal controls were studied. RNA-sequencing was performed using the Illumina Hiseq-4,000 platform and the Illumina TruSeq Total-RNA library. Student <i>t</i> test and false discovery rate tests were performed for each of the differentially expressed transcripts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for the pathway expression analysis. CIBERSORT was used to estimate the abundances of different immune cell subsets in the tissues based on gene expression data.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Transcripts differentially expressed between PCNSV and normal brain indicated that endosomal, mitochondrial, and ribosome dysfunction, alterations in protein synthesis, and noncoding RNAs might be involved in PCNSV. Pathway analysis revealed the activation of dendritic cell maturation and antigen processing as well as neuroinflammation in PCNSV versus normal brain, whereas oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited. CIBERSORT estimation of immune cell subsets suggested that activated NK cells, M1 macrophages, memory B cells, and follicular helper T cells were likely to be more prevalent in PCNSV samples. Naïve CD4 T cells and monocytes were mainly estimated to be present in GV and ABRA. Plasma cell and γδ T-cell signatures were mainly found in LV and normal brain. GV showed higher levels of genes associated with macrophage activities and T cells. ABRA showed higher levels of long noncoding RNAs and miR-616. LV showed higher levels of genes encoding immunoglobulins.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RNA sequencing confirmed PCNSV heterogeneity. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <b>Background:</b> Associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and brain morphology have been reported, although with several inconsistencies. These may partly stem from confounding bias, which could distort associations and limit generalizability. We examined how associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms change with adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked in the literature (aim 1), and for IQ and head motion, which are typically corrected for but play ambiguous roles (aim 2).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling single-cell phenotypes links yeast stress acclimation to transcriptional repression and pre-stress cellular states</a></h4>

              
                Stress defense and cell growth are inversely related in bulk culture analyses; however, these studies miss substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, thus obscuring true phenotypic relationships. Here, we devised a microfluidics system to characterize multiple phenotypes in single yeast cells over time before, during, and after salt stress. The system measured cell and colony size, growth rate, and cell-cycle phase along with nuclear trans-localization of two transcription factors: stress-activated Msn2 that regulates defense genes and Dot6 that represses ribosome biogenesis genes during an active stress response. By tracking cells dynamically, we discovered unexpected discordance between Msn2 and Dot6 behavior that revealed subpopulations of cells with distinct growth properties. Surprisingly, post-stress growth recovery was positively corelated with activation of the Dot6 repressor. In contrast, cells lacking Dot6 displayed slower growth acclimation, even though they grow normally in the absence of stress. We show that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 response display faster production of Msn2-regulated Ctt1 protein, separable from the contribution of Msn2. These results are consistent with the model that transcriptional repression during acute stress in yeast provides a protective response, likely by redirecting translational capacity to induced transcripts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergence of two global regulators to coordinate expression of essential virulence determinants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is known to function as a global regulator of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> gene expression. Sequence-based transcriptomic profiling identified the mycobacterial regulon controlled by the cAMP receptor protein, CRP. In this study, we identified a new subset of CRP-associated genes including virulence determinants which are also under the control of a major regulator, PhoP. Our results suggest that PhoP as a DNA binding transcription factor, impacts expression of these genes, and phosphorylated PhoP promotes CRP recruitment at the target promoters. Further, we uncover a distinct regulatory mechanism showing that activation of these genes requires direct recruitment of both PhoP and CRP at their target promoters. The most fundamental biological insight is derived from the inhibition of CRP binding at the regulatory regions in a PhoP-deleted strain owing to CRP-PhoP protein-protein interactions. Based on these results, a model is proposed suggesting how CRP and PhoP function as co-activators of the essential pathogenic determinants. Taken together, these results uncover a novel mode of regulation where a complex of two interacting virulence factors impact expression of virulence determinants. These results have significant implications on TB pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Macroscopic control of cell electrophysiology through ion channel expression</a></h4>

              
                Cells convert electrical signals into chemical outputs to facilitate the active transport of information across larger distances. This electrical-to-chemical conversion requires a tightly regulated expression of ion channels. Alterations of ion channel expression provide landmarks of numerous pathological diseases, such as cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, or cancer. Although the activity of ion channels can be locally regulated by external light or chemical stimulus, it remains challenging to coordinate the expression of ion channels on extended spatial-temporal scales. Here, we engineered yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to read and convert chemical concentrations into a dynamic potassium channel expression. A synthetic dual-feedback circuit controls the expression of engineered potassium channels through phytohormones auxin and salicylate to produce a macroscopically coordinated pulses of the plasma membrane potential (PMP). Our study provides a compact experimental model to control electrical activity through gene expression in eukaryotic cell populations setting grounds for various cellular engineering, synthetic biology, and potential therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phage resistance profiling identifies new genes required for biogenesis and modification of the corynebacterial cell envelope</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria of the order <i>Corynebacteriales</i> including pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosi </i> and <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i> are characterized by their complex, multi-layered envelope. In addition to a peptidoglycan layer, these organisms possess an additional polysaccharide layer made of arabinogalactan and an outer membrane layer composed predominantly of long-chain fatty acids called mycolic acids. This so-called mycolata envelope structure is both a potent barrier against antibiotic entry into cells and a target of several antibacterial therapeutics. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mycolata envelope assembly therefore promises to reveal new ways of disrupting this unique structure for the development of antibiotics and antibiotic potentiators. Because they engage with receptors on the cell surface during infection, bacteriophages have long been used as tools to uncover important aspects of host envelope assembly. However, surprisingly little is known about the interactions between <i>Corynebacteriales </i>phages and their hosts. We therefore made use of the phages Cog and CL31 that infect <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> (<i>Cglu</i>), a model member of the <i>Corynebacteriales</i>, to discover host factors important for phage infection. A high-density transposon library of <i>Cglu</i> was challenged with these phages followed by transposon sequencing to identify resistance loci. The analysis identified an important role for mycomembrane proteins in phage infection as well as components of the arabinogalactan and mycolic acid synthesis pathways. Importantly, the approach also implicated a new gene (<i>cgp_0396</i>) in the process of arabinogalactan modification and identified a conserved new factor (AhfA, Cpg_0475) required for mycolic acid synthesis in <i>Cglu</i>.
