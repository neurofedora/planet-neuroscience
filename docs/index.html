              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18613">The Illusion-Illusion: Vision Language Models See Illusions Where There are None</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illusions are entertaining, but they are also a useful diagnostic tool in cognitive science, philosophy, and neuroscience. A typical illusion shows a gap between how something "really is" and how something "appears to be", and this gap helps us understand the mental processing that lead to how something appears to be. Illusions are also useful for investigating artificial systems, and much research has examined whether computational models of perceptions fall prey to the same illusions as people. Here, I invert the standard use of perceptual illusions to examine basic processing errors in current vision language models. I present these models with illusory-illusions, neighbors of common illusions that should not elicit processing errors. These include such things as perfectly reasonable ducks, crooked lines that truly are crooked, circles that seem to have different sizes because they are, in fact, of different sizes, and so on. I show that many current vision language systems mistakenly see these illusion-illusions as illusions. I suggest that such failures are part of broader failures already discussed in the literature.

                arXiv:2412.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Brain network models offer insights into brain dynamics, but the utility of model-derived bifurcation parameters as biomarkers remains underexplored. Objective: This study evaluates bifurcation parameters from a whole-brain network model as biomarkers for distinguishing brain states associated with resting-state and task-based cognitive conditions. Methods: Synthetic BOLD signals were generated using a supercritical Hopf brain network model to train deep learning models for bifurcation parameter prediction. Inference was performed on Human Connectome Project data, including both resting-state and task-based conditions. Statistical analyses assessed the separability of brain states based on bifurcation parameter distributions. Results: Bifurcation parameter distributions differed significantly across task and resting-state conditions ($p < 0.0001$ for all but one comparison). Task-based brain states exhibited higher bifurcation values compared to rest. Conclusion: Bifurcation parameters effectively differentiate cognitive and resting states, warranting further investigation as biomarkers for brain state characterization and neurological disorder assessment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19622">Signatures of prediction during natural listening in MEG data?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.19622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19041">Revealing the Self: Brainwave-Based Human Trait Identification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People exhibit unique emotional responses. In the same scenario, the emotional reactions of two individuals can be either similar or vastly different. For instance, consider one person's reaction to an invitation to smoke versus another person's response to a query about their sleep quality. The identification of these individual traits through the observation of common physical parameters opens the door to a wide range of applications, including psychological analysis, criminology, disease prediction, addiction control, and more. While there has been previous research in the fields of psychometrics, inertial sensors, computer vision, and audio analysis, this paper introduces a novel technique for identifying human traits in real time using brainwave data. To achieve this, we begin with an extensive study of brainwave data collected from 80 participants using a portable EEG headset. We also conduct a statistical analysis of the collected data utilizing box plots. Our analysis uncovers several new insights, leading us to a groundbreaking unified approach for identifying diverse human traits by leveraging machine learning techniques on EEG data. Our analysis demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we explore two deep-learning models to compare the performance of our solution. Consequently, we have developed an integrated, real-time trait identification solution using EEG data, based on the insights from our analysis. To validate our approach, we conducted a rigorous user evaluation with an additional 20 participants. The outcomes of this evaluation illustrate both high accuracy and favorable user ratings, emphasizing the robust potential of our proposed method to serve as a versatile solution for human trait identification.

                arXiv:2412.19365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is perceptual and physiological evidence that the retina registers and signals luminance and luminance contrast using dual-channel mechanisms. This process begins in the retina, wherein the luminance of a uniform zone and differentials of luminance in neighboring zones determine the degree of brightness or darkness of the zones. The neurons that process the information can be classified as "bright" or "dark" channels. The present paper provides an overview of these retinal mechanisms along with evidence that they provide brightness judgments that are log-linear across roughly seven orders of magnitude.

                arXiv:2412.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The arrow of time can be quantified through the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the distributions of forward and reverse trajectories in a system. Many approaches to estimate this rely on specific models, but the use of incorrect models can introduce uncontrolled errors. Here, we describe a model-free method that uses trajectory data directly to estimate the evidence for irreversibility over finite windows of time. To do this we build on previous work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample size. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems that adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data generated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our method to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to naturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons, emphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data. These results open new avenues for investigating how the brain represents the arrow of time.

                arXiv:2407.16589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph theoretical methods have proven valuable for investigating alterations in both anatomical and functional brain connectivity networks during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that representing brain networks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity structure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain connectivity changes using low-dimensional, informative representations of networks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded in the Poincar\'e disk model of hyperbolic geometry. Here, we define a local measure of distortion of the geometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is applied to a brain networks dataset of patients with AD and healthy participants, derived from DWI and fMRI scans. We show that, compared with standard graph measures, our method identifies more accurately the brain regions most affected by neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormality detection in memory-related and frontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally, our findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a potential biomarker for characterizing disease progression.

                arXiv:2408.12804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do neural network models of vision learn brain-aligned representations because they share architectural constraints and task objectives with biological vision or because they learn universal features of natural image processing? We characterized the universality of hundreds of thousands of representational dimensions from visual neural networks with varied construction. We found that networks with varied architectures and task objectives learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite appearing highly distinct at a surface level. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with fMRI, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network's specific characteristics. Remarkably, each network can be reduced to fewer than ten of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the human brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal image representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.

                arXiv:2402.19157v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the the degree to which a network is directed and hierarchically organised is closely associated with the degree to which its dynamics break detailed balance and produce entropy. We consider a range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features affect their entropy production rate. We begin with an analytical treatment of a 2-node network followed by numerical simulations of synthetic networks using the preferential attachment and Erd\"os-Renyi algorithms. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks to determine the effect of complex real-world topologies. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium dynamics and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the consequences of directed network structure on non-equilibrium dynamics and highlight the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement in neurotechnology in recent years has created an emerging critical intersection between neurotechnology and security. Implantable devices, non-invasive monitoring, and non-invasive therapies all carry with them the prospect of violating the privacy and autonomy of individuals' cognition. A growing number of scientists and physicians have made calls to address this issue, but applied efforts have been relatively limited. A major barrier hampering scientific and engineering efforts to address these security issues is the lack of a clear means of describing and analyzing relevant problems. In this paper we develop Cognitive Neurosecurity, a mathematical framework which enables such description and analysis by drawing on methods and results from multiple fields. We demonstrate certain statistical properties which have significant implications for Cognitive Neurosecurity, and then present descriptions of the algorithmic problems faced by attackers attempting to violate privacy and autonomy, and defenders attempting to obstruct such attempts.

Abstract: Current neural network models of primate vision focus on replicating overall levels of behavioral accuracy, often neglecting perceptual decisions' rich, dynamic nature. Here, we introduce a novel computational framework to model the dynamics of human behavioral choices by learning to align the temporal dynamics of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to human reaction times (RTs). We describe an approximation that allows us to constrain the number of time steps an RNN takes to solve a task with human RTs. The approach is extensively evaluated against various psychophysics experiments. We also show that the approximation can be used to optimize an "ideal-observer" RNN model to achieve an optimal tradeoff between speed and accuracy without human data. The resulting model is found to account well for human RT data. Finally, we use the approximation to train a deep learning implementation of the popular Wong-Wang decision-making model. The model is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model of visual processing and evaluated using both artificial and natural image stimuli. Overall, we present a novel framework that helps align current vision models with human behavior, bringing us closer to an integrated model of human vision.

Abstract: The Psycho Frame, a sophisticated system primarily used in Universal Century (U.C.) series mobile suits for NEWTYPE pilots, has evolved as an integral component in harnessing the latent potential of mental energy. Its ability to amplify and resonate with the pilot's psyche enables real-time mental control, creating unique applications such as psychomagnetic fields and sensory-based weaponry. This paper presents the development of a novel robotic control system inspired by the Psycho Frame, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and deep learning for real-time control of robotic systems. By capturing and interpreting brainwave data through EEG, the system extends human cognitive commands to robotic actions, reflecting the seamless synchronization of thought and machine, much like the Psyco Frame's integration with a Newtype pilot's mental faculties. This research demonstrates how modern AI techniques can expand the limits of human-machine interaction, potentially transcending traditional input methods and enabling a deeper, more intuitive control of complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in artificial intelligence, capable of processing and understanding extensive human knowledge to enhance problem-solving across various domains. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to drive the discovery of symbolic solutions within scientific and engineering disciplines, where such solutions are crucial for advancing theoretical and practical applications. We propose a novel framework that utilizes LLMs in an evolutionary search methodology, augmented by a dynamic knowledge library that integrates and refines insights in an \textit{open-ended manner}. This approach aims to tackle the dual challenges of efficiently navigating complex symbolic representation spaces and leveraging both existing and newly generated knowledge to foster open-ended innovation. By enabling LLMs to interact with and expand upon a knowledge library, we facilitate the continuous generation of novel solutions in diverse forms such as language, code, and mathematical expressions. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for symbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to human scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in conceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative process, marking a significant step towards harnessing AI in the perpetual pursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05861">Rethinking Deep Learning: Non-backpropagation and Non-optimization Machine Learning Approach Using Hebbian Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing strong AI could provide a powerful tool for addressing social and scientific challenges. Neural networks (NNs), inspired by biological systems, have the potential to achieve this. However, weight optimization techniques using error backpropagation are not observed in biological systems, raising doubts about current NNs approaches. In this context, Itoh (2024) solved the MNIST classification problem without using objective functions or backpropagation. However, weight updates were not used, so it does not qualify as machine learning AI. In this study, I develop a machine learning method that mimics biological neural systems by implementing Hebbian learning in NNs without backpropagation and optimization method to solve the MNIST classification problem and analyze its output. Development proceeded in three stages. In the first stage, I applied the Hebbian learning rule to the MNIST character recognition algorithm by Itoh (2024), resulting in lower accuracy than non-Hebbian NNs, highlighting the limitations of conventional training procedures for Hebbian learning. In the second stage, I examined the properties of individually trained NNs using norm-based cognition, showing that NNs trained on a specific label respond powerfully to that label. In the third stage, I created an MNIST character recognition program using vector norm magnitude as the criterion, achieving an accuracy of approximately 75%. This demonstrates that the Hebbian learning NNs can recognize handwritten characters without objective functions, backpropagation, optimization processes, and large data set. Based on these results, developing a mechanism based on norm-based cognition as a fundamental unit and then increasing complexity to achieve indirect similarity cognition should help mimic biological neural systems and contribute to realizing strong AI.

                arXiv:2412.08816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic applications emulate the processing performed by the brain by using spikes as inputs instead of time-varying analog stimuli. Therefore, these time-varying stimuli have to be encoded into spikes, which can induce important information loss. To alleviate this loss, some studies use population coding strategies to encode more information using a population of neurons rather than just one neuron. However, configuring the encoding parameters of such a population is an open research question. This work proposes an approach based on maximizing the mutual information between the signal and the spikes in the population of neurons. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition. Two applications are presented: blood pressure pulse wave classification, and neural action potential waveform classification. In both tasks, the data is encoded into spikes and the encoding parameters of the neuron populations are tuned to maximize the encoded information using the proposed algorithm. The spikes are then classified and the performance is measured using classification accuracy as a metric. Two key results are reported. Firstly, adding neurons to the population leads to an increase in both mutual information and classification accuracy beyond what could be accounted for by each neuron separately, showing the usefulness of population coding strategies. Secondly, the classification accuracy obtained with the tuned parameters is near-optimal and it closely follows the mutual information as more neurons are added to the population. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly outperforms random parameter selection, showing the usefulness of the proposed approach. These results are reproduced in both applications.

                arXiv:2412.11112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.

">Loss of SynDIG4/PRRT1 alters distribution of AMPA receptors in Rab4- and Rab11-positive endosomes and impairs basal AMPA receptor recycling.</a></h4>

              
                The transmembrane protein Synapse Differentiation Induced Gene 4 (SynDIG4) functions as an auxiliary factor of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and plays a critical role in excitatory synapse plasticity as well as hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Mice lacking SynDIG4 have reduced surface expression of GluA1 and GluA2 and are impaired in single tetanus-induced long-term potentiation and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term depression. These findings suggest that SynDIG4 may play an important role in regulating AMPAR distribution through intracellular trafficking mechanisms; however, the precise roles by which SynDIG4 governs AMPAR distribution remain unclear. In this study, we characterized the endocytosis and recycling of GluA1-containing AMPARs under basal conditions. We did not observe any change in baseline endocytosis; however, we did observe a significant decrease in recycling of GluA1-containing AMPARs in cultured hippocampal neurons from mice lacking SynDIG4. This resulted in a significant increase in the levels of internal GluA1 and GluA2, along with greater colocalization of these subunits with Rab4-positive recycling endosomes in hippocampal neurons lacking SynDIG4. Notably, the overlap between Rab4- and Rab11-positive vesicles was elevated in hippocampal neurons lacking SynDIG4, suggesting an impairment in the trafficking between Rab4 and Rab11 compartments. Furthermore, our findings revealed a reduction in surface GluA1 within synaptic regions of hippocampal neurons lacking SynDIG4. Collectively, these results indicate that SynDIG4 regulates the distribution of GluA1-containing AMPARs via the Rab4-dependent endosomal recycling pathway, thereby maintaining AMPAR levels at synaptic regions under baseline conditions. This regulatory function of SynDIG4 may contribute to the deficits in GluA1-dependent synaptic plasticity and impairment of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory behaviors observed in SynDIG4 deficient mice.

">Primary sensory neuron dysfunction underlying mechanical itch hypersensitivity in a Shank3 mouse model of autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and atypical sensory perception. The link between ASD and skin abnormalities, inducing itchiness, has never been investigated in depth. This study explores mechanical itch sensitivity in the Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mouse model. Key observations include heightened scratching in response to skin deformation and hypersensitivity to mechanical itch (i.e. alloknesis) in Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mice. In Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mice, ex vivo electrophysiological experiments revealed that C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) were hyporesponsive, and transcriptomic analysis showed a downregulation of TAFA4, a protein secreted by C-LMTRs. Interestingly, pharmacologically inhibiting A{beta}-LTMR, important in mechanical itch initiation, abolished the itch hypersensitivity. Also, TAFA4 injections reduced the spontaneous scratching response to skin deformation but failed to restore itch sensitivity. Our data suggest that somatosensory deficits in Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mice lead to hypersensitivity to itchiness and indicate that two pathways might regulate mechanical itchiness, dependent on TAFA4.

">Neural mechanisms of attention, not expectation, govern spatial selection by probabilistic cueing</a></h4>

              
                Spatial probabilistic "Posner" cueing is widely employed in studies of endogenous spatial attention. Such cueing guides attention by providing prior knowledge about the likely spatial location of task-relevant events. Yet, it has been compellingly argued that such spatial priors also elicit expectation effects, rendering Posner cueing unsuitable for measuring attentional effects in isolation. We address this debate by combining signal detection theory models of behavior with concurrent electrophysiological recordings, and directly compare Posner cueing effects with those of attention and expectation cueing. Participants performed two tasks: a dual cueing task, with orthogonal relevance (attention) and probability (expectation) cues, as well as a Posner cueing task. Relevance and probability cueing independently modulated distinct behavioral parameters - perceptual sensitivity and decisional criterion, respectively - whereas Posner cueing modulated both sensitivity and criterion. However, only sensitivity modulations by Posner cueing were correlated with those of relevance cueing. Criterion modulations by Posner cueing were uncorrelated with those of probability cueing. Both Posner and relevance cueing, but not probability cueing, modulated various neural markers of spatial attention, including steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitude and alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillation power. Representational similarity analysis and cue-label prediction with deep convolutional neural networks revealed dissociable underpinnings of relevance and probability cueing, and identified Posner cueing's neural representations with those of relevance cueing. Our results address a long-standing debate in the attention literature and clearly demonstrate that spatial selection by probabilistic cueing is governed by neural mechanisms of attention, not expectation.

                During locomotion, the coordinated activity of dozens of muscles shapes the kinematic features of each stride, including systematic changes in limb movement across walking speed. Motor units, each of which consists of a single motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates, contribute to the total activation of each muscle through their recruitment and firing rate when active. However, it remains unknown how the nervous system controls locomotor speed by changing the firing of individual motor units. To address this, we combined quantitative behavioral analysis of mouse locomotion with single motor unit recordings from the lateral and long heads of the triceps brachii, which drive monoarticular extension of the elbow and biarticular movements of the elbow and shoulder, respectively. In contrast to prior studies employing bulk EMG to examine muscle activity, our recordings revealed the diversity of spike patterning across motor units as well as systematic differences in motor unit activity across muscles and locomotor speeds. First, motor unit activity differed significantly across the lateral and long heads, suggesting differential control of these two closely apposed elbow extensor muscles. Second, we found that individual units were recruited probabilistically during only a subset of strides, showing that bulk EMG signals consistently present in every stride in fact reflect stochastically varying subsets of individual motor units. Finally, although recruitment probability and firing rate both increased at faster walking speeds, increases in recruitment were proportionally larger than rate changes, and recruitment of individual units accompanied changes in limb kinematics. Together, these results reveal how the firing of individual motor units varies systematically across muscles and walking speeds to produce flexible locomotor behavior.

">Human Slip Control: Investigating the Role of Hand Acceleration Modulation in Preventing Slips</a></h4>

              
                Ensuring a stable grasp during manipulative movements is crucial for robotic applications. While grip force has been the primary means of slip control, our human study revealed that trajectory modulation is also an effective slip control policy during pick-and-place tasks. Motivated by these findings, we developed and compared a slip control policy based on trajectory modulation to one based on grip force control for robotic pick-and-place tasks. Our results show that trajectory modulation significantly outperforms grip force control in certain scenarios, highlighting its potential for slip control in robotics. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of incorporating forward models in developing effective trajectory modulation slip control systems. Overall, our study provides insight into an alternative method for slip control and suggests that humans use trajectory modulation as an alternative to grip force control for slippage prevention. This insight helps design algorithms to improve robotic manipulation tasks and prevent slippage.

">Plasticity of visual looming response reveals a dissociation of innate and learned components</a></h4>

              
                Animals rely on both innate and learned behaviour to respond optimally to their environment. However, little is known about how the brain may reconcile the ability to produce hardwired responses essential to survival while still allowing for adaptive flexibility. Here, we demonstrate that innate looming stimulus responses, an innate predator-evasion behaviour, can be robustly extinguished via repeated unreinforced presentation over several days. We report that this extinction is long-lasting and generalises to other contexts, but can be rapidly recovered via the pairing of the visual stimulus with an aversive electric foot-shock stimulus. Moreover, fiber photometric recordings reveal that this behavioural paradigm results in the attenuation of SC and PAG physiological responses to visual looming stimuli, and that these responses do not recover following recovery of behavioural responses. An analysis of c-Fos expression patterns throughout the midbrain and hippocampus uncovered a ventral CA1 (vCA1) ensemble that is active during both innate and learned visual looming fear responses. We investigate the functional significance of this vCA1 ensemble and report that, while its activity is not necessary for innate defensive behaviour, it is necessary for learned fear responses. Together, these findings reveal a novel role of the hippocampus in enabling adaptive behavioural responses to the innately threatening visual looming stimulus which acts in complement with innate circuitry of the SC and PAG.

	<p>Objectives: Computer-aided schizophrenia (SZ) detection methods mainly depend on electroencephalogram and brain magnetic resonance images, which both capture physical signals from patients&amp;amp;rsquo; brains. These inspection techniques take too much time and affect patients&amp;amp;rsquo; compliance and cooperation, while difficult for clinicians to comprehend the principle of detection decisions. This study proposes a novel method using face diagnosis images based on traditional Chinese medicine principles, providing a non-invasive, efficient, and interpretable alternative for SZ detection. Methods: An innovative face diagnosis image analysis method for SZ detection, which learns feature representations based on Vision Transformer (ViT) directly from face diagnosis images. It provides a face features distribution visualization and quantitative importance of each facial region and is proposed to supplement interpretation and to increase efficiency in SZ detection while keeping a high detection accuracy. Results: A benchmarking platform comprising 921 face diagnostic images, 6 benchmark methods, and 4 evaluation metrics was established. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves SZ detection performance with a 3&amp;amp;ndash;10% increase in accuracy scores. Additionally, it is found that facial regions rank in descending order according to importance in SZ detection as eyes, mouth, forehead, cheeks, and nose, which is exactly consistent with the clinical traditional Chinese medicine experience. Conclusions: Our method fully leverages semantic feature representations of first-introduced face diagnosis images in SZ, offering strong interpretability and visualization capabilities. It not only opens a new path for SZ detection but also brings new tools and concepts to the research and application in the field of mental illness.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can boost motor recovery after a stroke. Certain movement phases are more responsive to NIBS, so a system that auto-detects these phases would optimize stimulation timing. This study assessed the effectiveness of various machine learning models in identifying movement phases in hemiparetic individuals undergoing simultaneous NIBS and EEG recordings. We hypothesized that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of NIBS, would enhance EEG signals related to movement phases and improve classification accuracy compared to sham stimulation. Methods: EEG data from 10 chronic stroke patients and 11 healthy controls were recorded before, during, and after tDCS. Eight machine learning algorithms and five ensemble methods were used to classify two movement phases (hold posture and reaching) during each of these periods. Data preprocessing included z-score normalization and frequency band power binning. Results: In chronic stroke participants who received active tDCS, the classification accuracy for hold vs. reach phases increased from pre-stimulation to the late intra-stimulation period (72.2% to 75.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Late active tDCS surpassed late sham tDCS classification (75.2% vs. 71.5%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Linear discriminant analysis was the most accurate (74.6%) algorithm with the shortest training time (0.9 s). Among ensemble methods, low gamma frequency (30&amp;amp;ndash;50 Hz) achieved the highest accuracy (74.5%), although this result did not achieve statistical significance for actively stimulated chronic stroke participants. Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms showed enhanced movement phase classification during active tDCS in chronic stroke participants. These results suggest their feasibility for real-time movement detection in neurorehabilitation, including brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces for stroke recovery.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: There is a need in Korea for research estimating the impact of aging using the Useful Field Of View (UFOV) test, which can evaluate visual function for elderly drivers. Methods: This observational study involved young people in their twenties and thirties, later-middle-aged people in their fifties or older, and elderly people 65 or older recruited from the Gangwon-do region. UFOV testing was conducted on the participants where the participants completed a questionnaire about general and driving-related characteristics. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyze the mean difference by age group, and a Pearson correlation analysis was carried out to evaluate the correlation between age and visual function. In addition, a simple linear regression analysis was conducted to verify UFOV subdomains that can confirm changes according to age increasing. Results: Findings after analyzing UFOV subtest differences by age group revealed significant differences in the visual function index of the young, later-middle-aged, and elderly in all three tests, and the difference between the later-middle-aged and old groups was only found in divided attention. The correlation between age and visual function was significant in all three subtests. And all three subtests were confirmed to be indicators that can verify changes according to increasing age. Conclusions: This study showed that visual function significantly decreases with age. Selective attention was confirmed as a visual function type that changes sensitively according to increasing age.</p>

	<p>Background: The segmentation of electroencephalography (EEG) signals into a limited number of microstates is of significant importance in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Currently, the microstate analysis algorithm based on global field power has demonstrated its efficacy in clustering resting-state EEG. The task-related EEG was extensively analyzed in the field of brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs); however, its primary objective is classification rather than segmentation. Methods: We propose an innovative algorithm for analyzing task-related EEG microstates based on spatial patterns, Riemannian distance, and a modified deep autoencoder. The objective of this algorithm is to achieve unsupervised segmentation and clustering of task-related EEG signals. Results: The proposed algorithm was validated through experiments conducted on simulated EEG data and two publicly available cognitive task datasets. The evaluation results and statistical tests demonstrate its robustness and efficiency in clustering task-related EEG microstates. Conclusions: The proposed unsupervised algorithm can autonomously discretize EEG signals into a finite number of microstates, thereby facilitating investigations into the temporal structures underlying cognitive processes.</p>

	<p>Background: The spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s gray matter (GM) have been interpreted as representations of neural activity variations. In previous research, white matter (WM) signals, often considered noise, have also been demonstrated to reflect characteristics of functional activity and interactions among different brain regions. Recently, functional gradients have gained significant attention due to their success in characterizing the functional organization of the whole brain. However, previous studies on brain functional gradients have predominantly focused on GM, neglecting valuable functional information within WM. Methods: In this paper, we have elucidated the symmetrical nature of the functional hierarchy in the left and right brain hemispheres in healthy individuals, utilizing the principal functional gradient of the whole-brain WM while also accounting for gender differences. Results: Interestingly, both males and females exhibit a similar degree of asymmetry in their brain regions, albeit with distinct regional variations. Additionally, we have thoroughly examined and analyzed the distribution of functional gradient values in the spatial structure of the corpus callosum (CC) independently, revealing that a simple one-to-one correspondence between structure and function is absent. This phenomenon may be associated with the intricacy of their internal structural connectivity. Conclusions: We suggest that the functional gradients within the WM regions offer a fresh perspective for investigating the structural and functional characteristics of WM and may provide insights into the regulation of neural activity between GM and WM.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive functions are the basis for the development of language skills. Cognitive disorders occur in schizophrenia and may be present even before the first symptoms of psychosis. Language deficits are also mentioned as one of the diagnostic symptoms of this disease. Methods: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database. Articles comparing linguistic and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia were searched for. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, twenty-six original articles were selected. Results: Most studies have observed a partial correlation between language and cognitive deficits. The correlation most often involved some cognitive functions or some components of language assessment. Conclusions: The correlation reported in many studies shows that there is a correlation between language and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. However, numerous studies contradict these reports. It is, therefore, possible that this correlation exists, but not in all patients. Future research should therefore be aimed at identifying in which patients this correlation is present.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disease caused by aberration of chromosome 22 that results in some phenotypic features and developmental disorders. This paper presents a cross-sectional study on speech and communication of Polish children with 22q11DS. Methods: Individuals affected with 22q11DS may show difficulties in functioning, including speech and hearing. Therefore, we prepared a speech development questionnaire and employed it to obtain data from parents (or legal guardians) of 54 children with 22q11DS. The questionnaire covered the following speech and communication development stages: babbling, using first words, first sentences, verbal and non-verbal communication, speech disfluencies, hearing loss, speech intelligibility, difficulties in interpersonal contact, and participation in speech therapy. The obtained answers underwent statistical analysis to verify relationships between the stages of personal development and selected dysfunctions and disorders. Results: In the study group we observed delays in achieving subsequent speech developmental stages and that hearing loss was associated with delays in producing first words. Hearing loss was reported in about a quarter of cases, but a significant proportion of children (55.56%) reported speech disfluencies, which had not been emphasized in previous works, where hearing loss is considered a common co-occurring disorder. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that this may represent a phenomenon associated with 22q11DS that warrants further investigation using standardized tests for assessing disfluencies. Additionally, we observed that speech therapists and caregivers were perceived as not fully aware of the speech development impairments caused by 22q11DS. These preliminary observations point to the need for future studies and increased awareness efforts in this area.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. These symptoms often lead to significant postural deformities and an increased risk of falls, severely impacting the quality of life. Conventional rehabilitation methods have shown benefits, but recent advancements suggest that virtual reality (VR) could offer a promising alternative. This scoping review aims to analyze the current literature to evaluate the effectiveness of VR in the postural rehabilitation of patients with PD. A scientific literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Our selection criteria included studies that compared VR-based rehabilitation to traditional methods regarding posture-related outcomes. We identified and analyzed nine RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The results consistently demonstrated that VR-based rehabilitation leads to greater improvements in balance and gait compared to conventional therapy. Key findings include significant enhancements in balance confidence and postural control and a reduction in fall rates. The superior efficacy of VR-based rehabilitation can be attributed to its engaging and immersive nature, which enhances patient motivation and adherence to therapy. VR allows for precise, repeatable training scenarios tailored to individual patient needs, providing a safe environment to practice and improve motor skills. In conclusion, VR-based rehabilitation represents an innovative approach with substantial potential to improve the quality of life for PD patients. However, limitations such as small sample sizes and short intervention durations in existing studies highlight the need for larger multicenter trials with longer follow-up periods to confirm these findings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive training paradigms rely on the idea that consistent practice can drive neural plasticity, improving not only connectivity within critical brain networks, but also ultimately result in overall enhancement of trained cognitive functions, irrespective of the specific task. Here we opted to investigate the temporal dynamics of neural activity and cognitive performance during a structured cognitive training program. Methods: A group of 20 middle-aged participants completed 20 training sessions over 10 weeks. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) parameters, including alpha and theta power, alpha/theta ratio, and fronto-parietal coherence, were analyzed at four time points to assess changes in neural activity. Results: Results revealed significant overall improvements in the trained task (n-back) performance, without an effect on the untrained task (OSPAN). qEEG analyses showed increased change in posterior (and a less robust in frontal) alpha power, particularly during mid-training, suggesting an improved neural efficiency in regions associated with attentional allocation and task engagement. Theta power remained stable across sessions, indicating a limited influence on neural processes underlying working memory and attentional control. The parietal alpha/theta ratio showed weak increases during mid-training, reflecting subtle shifts in the neural efficacy and cognitive engagement. There were no significant changes in functional connectivity between frontal and parietal locations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cognitive training primarily influences localized neural activity, rather than network-level connectivity. This lack of a longer-range network-level effect might also explain the failure of cognitive training paradigms to induce performance enhancements on the untrained tasks.</p>

">Fluid intelligence relates to neural measures of cognitive map formation</a></h4>

              
                Psychometric research on intelligence consistently identifies latent factors underlying performance correlations across cognitive tasks, with one general factor (g) explaining most variance and predicting general life outcomes. Their biological basis is yet unresolved, in particular with regard to the neural information processing mechanisms that may underlie intelligence. Here we test the hypothesis that interindividual differences in relational processing, supported by cognitive maps in the hippocampus, are related to fluid intelligence (gf), a statistical approximation of the general factor. Using standardized cognitive tests and fMRI of mnemonic tasks, we demonstrate a positive correlation specifically between gf and map-like relational encoding of task information. This relationship was neither present for non-relational mnemonic responses in the hippocampus nor for less g-related factors. These findings offer first empirical support for a link between neural mechanisms related to relational reasoning and general cognitive performance and probe the presumed relevance of hippocampal coding properties for cognition more broadly.

">Human precentral gyrus neurons link speech sequences from listening to speaking</a></h4>

              
                Speech perception and production are interconnected processes, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated this relationship by recording large-scale single-neuron activity in the human brain during a delayed sentence repetition task. Contrary to the traditional view that the precentral gyrus is solely responsible for motor execution, we found that neurons there encoded activity across all task phases of listening, delay, initiation, and speaking. Notably, we discovered "mirror" neurons that activated transiently after hearing and before producing specific speech sounds, and "bridge" neurons that maintained activity between the same speech elements during listening and speaking. Population analysis revealed distinct latent components for each task phase and persistent dynamics for specific sentences. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the neuronal basis of speech processing, emphasizing the intricate interplay between perception, production, and verbal working memory.

">Convergent representations and spatiotemporal dynamics of speech and language in brain and deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have explored the correspondence between single-modality DNN models (speech or text) and specific brain networks for speech and language. The key factors underlying these correlations and their spatiotemporal evolution within the brain language network remain unclear, particularly across different DNN modalities. To address these questions, we analyzed the representation similarity between self-supervised learning (SSL) models for speech (Wav2Vec2) and language (GPT-2), against neural responses to naturalistic speech captured via high-density electrocorticography. Our results indicated high prediction accuracy of both types of SSL models relative to neural activity before and after word onsets. It was the shared components between Wav2Vec2.0 and GPT-2 that explained the majority portion of the SSL-brain similarity. Furthermore, we observed distinct spatiotemporal dynamics: both models showed high encoding accuracy 40 milliseconds before word onset, especially in the mid-superior temporal gyrus (mid-STG), which can be explained by the shared contextual components in the SSL models; the Wav2Vec2.0 also peaked at 200 milliseconds after word onset around the posterior STG, which was mainly attributed to the acoustic-phonetic and static semantic information encoded in the SSL models. These results highlight how contextual and acoustic-phonetic cues encoded in DNNs align with spatiotemporal neural activity patterns, suggesting a significant overlap in how artificial and biological systems process linguistic information.

">Functional expression and sex dimorphism of the T-type Cav3.2 Calcium Channel in human DRG Neurons</a></h4>

              
                T-type/Cav3 calcium channels are key in neuronal excitability and pain processing with Cav3.2 being the prominent isoform in primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Its pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing induces analgesia in several preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, the presence of Cav3.2, encoded by the CACNA1H gene, in human DRG neurons remains unresolved. Using RNA in-situ hybridization and electrophysiological recordings, we show that human DRGs express Cav3.2 in a subset of neurons positive for the neurotrophic factor receptor TrkB (NTRK2 gene). The Cav3.2 current exhibits typical biophysical and pharmacological properties, including inhibition by a low concentration of nickel and by Z944, a specific T-type calcium channel blocker in advanced clinical development. Conversely, ABT-639, a T-type calcium channel inhibitor that failed in Phase 2 trials for pain relief, does not inhibit Cav3.2 currents in human DRG neurons. Importantly, Cav3.2 currents are prominent in neurons from female organ donors, supporting the presence of sex differences in pain mechanisms in humans. These findings underscore the potential of continued exploration of Cav3.2 as a therapeutic target for pain treatment and highlight a specific subset of human neurons that likely rely on this channel to modulate their excitability.

">Hampered AMPK-ULK1 cascade in Alzheimer disease (AD) instigates mitochondria dysfunctions and AD-related alterations that are alleviated by metformin</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mitochondrial structure and function alterations are key pathological features in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream effector Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) represent a key node controlling mitochondria health, the alteration of which likely contribute to AD development. Methods: We designed this study to investigate AMPK-ULK1 activation state in post-mortem human sporadic AD brains, in 3xTgAD mice that recapitulate most of human AD features, and in neuronal cells expressing the amyloid precursor protein with the familial Swedish mutation (APPswe). We examined the impact of the pharmacological and genetic modulation of AMPK-ULK1 cascade on mitochondria structure and functions in APPswe cells. We evaluated the potential beneficial impact of AMPK-ULK1 activation by Metformin (Met) on mitochondria defects, as well as on early- and late-stage AD-related alterations in vivo and ex vivo. Results: At first, we show that AMPK-ULK1 cascade is defective in murine and human AD brains as well as in APPswe cells. We then report that Met administration to 3xTgAD mice alleviates the alterations of neuronal mitochondria structure and function and we consolidate these results in cells using both pharmacological and genetic tools to modulate AMPK-ULK1 cascade. In mice brains, Met reduces the early accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) as well as the amyloid beta burden present in aged mice. Mechanistically, we show that Met increases the localization of APP-CTFs within cathepsin D-positive lysosomal compartments in vivo and enhances cathepsin D activity in vitro. The reduction of Amyloid beta load by Met occurs through an increased recruitment of Iba1+ cells to Amyloid beta plaques and an enhancement of the phagocytic activity of microglia. Accordingly, in symptomatic 3xTgAD mice, Met alleviates microgliosis and astrogliosis, modulates microglia morphology, reduces peripheral proinflammatory cytokines levels, and regulates the expression of a set of inflammatory genes. In addition, Met normalizes dendritic spines shape in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures modeling AD and improves learning performance of 3xTgAD mice. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates potential therapeutic benefits of targeting AMPK-ULK1 cascade to reverse both early and late AD-related alterations, deserving further investigation in fundamental research and in human clinical studies.

">Volitional stopping is preceded by a transient beta oscillation</a></h4>

              
                Human motor cortex EEG beta (15-30 Hz) oscillations undergo transient power modulations (bursts) during volitional control of movements. They are a potential control signal for brain-machine interfaces and are a therapeutic target in Parkinson's disease. The prevailing view is that EEG beta bursts increase during stopping and immobility, but do not precede stopping. In contrast to prior work in humans and animals that used a latent and unobservable stopping time in the stop-signal task, we developed a translational animal model to align EEG with overt action stopping. We recorded 32-electrode EEG along with the angular velocity of a treadmill while head-fixed rats stopped in-progress running on a freely-rotating, non-motorized treadmill. Contrasting prior work, motor cortex beta bursts increased before stopping and not during stopping or immobility. Using information theoretic measures, we show that beta power was informative about treadmill velocity 200 msec in the future, but only during planning to stop. By introducing artificial temporal jitter to mimic the estimation of stopping time used in prior work, we show that this predictive brain-action relationship fails with even small jitter. Finally, we use a variety of machine learning methods to show that, despite EEG beta oscillations being a clear neural correlate preceding stopping, it has limited utility for real-time action decoding. Our work suggests a new conceptual model for neural control of action stopping.

">Interaction between native and prosthetic visual responses in optogenetic visual restoration</a></h4>

              
                Degenerative retinal disorders leading to irreversible photoreceptor death are a common cause of blindness. Optogenetic gene therapy aims to restore vision in affected individuals by introducing light sensitive opsins into the surviving neurons of inner retina. While up until now the main focus of optogenetic therapy has been on terminally blind individuals, treating at stages where residual native vision is present could have several advantages. Yet, it is still unknown how residual native and optogenetic vision would interact if present at the same time. Using transgenic mice expressing the optogenetic tool ReaChR in ON-bipolar cells, we herein examine this interaction through electroretinography (ERG) and visually evoked potentials (VEP). We find that optogenetic responses show a peculiar ERG signature and are enhanced in retinas without photoreceptor loss. Conversely, native responses are dampened in the presence of ReaChR. Moreover, in VEP recordings we find that optogenetic responses reach the cortex asynchronous to the native response. These findings should be taken into consideration when planning future clinical trials and may direct future preclinical research to optimize optogenetic approaches for visual restoration. The identified ERG signatures moreover may serve to track treatment efficiency in clinical trials.

">Pathological α-synuclein elicits granulovacuolar degeneration independent of tau</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pathologic heterogeneity is a hallmark of Lewy body dementia (LBD), yet the impact of Lewy pathology on co-pathologies is poorly understood. Lewy pathology, containing -synuclein, is often associated with regional tau pathology burden in LBD. Similarly, granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs) have been associated with tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, GVBs have been detected in a broad range of neurodegenerative conditions including both -synucleinopathies and tauopathies. Despite the frequent co-occurrence, little is known about the relationship between -synuclein, tau, and granulovacuolar degeneration. Methods: We developed a mouse model of limbic-predominant -synucleinopathy by stereotactic injection of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the basal forebrain. This model was used to investigate the relationship of -synuclein pathology with tau and GVB formation. Results: Our model displayed widespread -synuclein pathology with a limbic predominant distribution. Aberrantly phosphorylated tau accumulated in a subset of -synuclein inclusion-bearing neurons, often colocalized with lysosomes. Many of these same neurons also contained CHMP2b- and CK1{delta}-positive granules, established markers of GVBs, which suggests a link between tau accumulation and GVB formation. Despite this observation, GVBs were also detected in tau-deficient mice following PFF-injection, suggesting that pathological -synuclein alone is sufficient to elicit GVB formation. Conclusions: Our findings support that -synuclein pathology can independently elicit granulovacuolar degeneration. The frequent co-accumulation of tau and GVBs suggests a parallel mechanism of cellular dysfunction. The ability of -synuclein pathology to drive GVB formation in the absence of tau highlights the broader relevance of this process to neurodegeneration with relevance to the pathobiology of LBD.

">Altered neuronal network activity and connectivity in human Down Syndrome excitatory cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, affecting one in 600 live births worldwide, and is caused by trisomy of the human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). Here, we investigated whether trisomy 21 results in changes in excitatory neuron network development, that could contribute to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes of DS. Replaying cerebral cortex development in vitro with Trisomy 21 and control isogenic and non-isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) enabled the analysis of the effect of Hsa21 triplication on neural network activity and connectivity specifically in developing excitatory cortical neurons. Network activity analysis revealed a significant decrease in neuronal activity in TS21 neurons early in development. TS21 neurons showed a marked reduction of synchronised bursting activity up to 80 days in vitro and over 5 months in vivo following transplantation into the mouse forebrain. Viral transynaptic tracing identified significant reduction of neuronal connectivity in TS21 neuronal networks in vitro, suggesting that reduced network connectivity contributes to the absence of synchronised bursting. Expression of voltage-gated potassium channels was significantly reduced in TS21 neurons, and single neuron recordings confirmed the lack of hyperpolarization-activated currents, indicating a functional loss of the potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (HCN1) in DS TS21 neurons. We conclude that the trisomy of Hsa21 leads to changes in ion channel composition, network activity and connectivity in cortical excitatory neuron networks, all of which collectively are likely to contribute to some of the neurodevelopmental features of DS.

">Exact linear theory of perturbation response in a space- and feature-dependent cortical circuitmodel</a></h4>

              
                What are the principles that govern the responses of cortical networks to their inputs and the emergence of these responses from recurrent connectivity? Recent experiments have probed these questions by measuring cortical responses to two-photon optogenetic perturbations of single cells in the mouse primary visual cortex. A robust theoretical framework is needed to determine the implications of these responses for cortical recurrence. Here we propose a novel analytical approach: a formulation of the dependence of cell-type-specific connectivity on spatial distance that yields an exact solution for the linear perturbation response of a model with multiple cell types and space- and feature-dependent connectivity. Importantly and unlike previous approaches, the solution is valid in regimes of strong as well as weak intra-cortical coupling. Analysis reveals the structure of connectivity implied by various features of single-cell perturbation responses, such as the surprisingly narrow spatial radius of nearby excitation beyond which inhibition dominates, the number of transitions between mean excitation and inhibition thereafter, and the dependence of these responses on feature preferences. Comparison of these results to existing optogenetic perturbation data yields constraints on cell-type-specific connection strengths and their tuning dependence. Finally, we provide experimental predictions regarding the response of inhibitory neurons to single-cell perturbations and the modulation of perturbation response by neuronal gain; the latter can explain observed differences in the feature-tuning of perturbation responses in the presence vs. absence of visual stimuli.

">The effects of object category training on the responses of macaque inferior temporal cortex are consistent with performance-optimizing updates within a visual hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                How does the primate brain coordinate plasticity to support its remarkable ability to learn object categories? To address this question, we measured the consequences of category learning on the macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a key waypoint along the ventral visual stream that is known to support object recognition. First, we observed that neural activity across task-trained monkeys IT showed increased object category selectivity, enhanced linear separability (of categories), and overall more categorical representations compared to those from task-naive monkeys. To model how these differences could arise, we next developed a computational hypothesis-generation framework of the monkeys learning process using anatomically-mapped artificial neural network (ANN) models of the primate ventral stream that we combined with various choices of learning algorithms. Our simulations revealed that specific gradient-based, performance-optimizing updates of the ANNs internal representations substantially approximated the observed changes in the IT cortex. Notably, we found that such models predict novel training-induced phenomena in the IT cortex, including changes in category-orthogonal representations and ITs alignment with behavior. This convergence between experimental and modeling results suggests that plasticity in the visual ventral stream follows principles of task optimization that are well approximated by gradient descent. We propose that models like the ones developed here could be used to make accurate predictions about visual plasticity in the ventral stream and its transference - or lack thereof - to any future test image.

">Personalized electric field simulations of deformable large TMS coils based on automatic position and shape optimization</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapies use both focal and unfocal coil designs. Unfocal designs often employ bendable windings and moveable parts, making realistic simulations of their electric fields in inter-individually varying head sizes and shapes challenging. This hampers comparisons of the various coil designs and prevents sys-tematic evaluations of their dose-response relationships. Objective: Introduce and validate a novel method for optimizing the position and shape of flexible coils taking individual head anatomies into account. Evaluate the impact of realistic modeling of flexible coils on the electric field simulated in the brain. Methods: Accurate models of four coils (Brainsway H1, H4, H7; MagVenture MST-Twin) were derived from computed tomography data and mechanical measurements. A generic representation of coil deformations by concatenated linear transformations was introduced and validated. This served as basis for a principled approach to optimize the coil positions and shapes, and to optionally maximize the electric field strength in a region of interest (ROI). Results: For all four coil models, the new method achieved configurations that followed the scalp anatomy while robustly preventing coil-scalp intersections on N=1100 head models. In contrast, setting only the coil center positions without shape deformation regularly led to physically impossible configurations. This also affected the electric field calculated in the cortex, with a median peak difference of ~16%. In addition, the new method outperformed grid search-based optimization for maximizing the electric field of a standard figure 8 coil in a ROI with a comparable computational complexity. Conclusion: Our approach alleviates practical hurdles that so far hampered accurate simula-tions of bendable coils. This enables systematic comparison of dose-response relationships across the various coil designs employed in therapy.

">Huntingtin interactome reveals huntingtin role in regulation of double strand break DNA damage response (DSB/DDR), chromatin remodeling and RNA processing pathways</a></h4>

              
                Huntingtons Disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no disease-modifying therapies, is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene encoding polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (HTT) protein. Mechanisms of HD cellular pathogenesis and cellular functions of the normal and mutant HTT proteins are still not completely understood. HTT protein has numerous interaction partners, and it likely provides a scaffold for assembly of multiprotein complexes many of which may be altered in HD. Previous studies have implicated DNA damage response in HD pathogenesis. Gene transcription and RNA processing has also emerged as molecular mechanisms associated with HD. Here we used multiple approaches to identify HTT interactors in the context of DNA damage stress. Our results indicate that HTT interacts with many proteins involved in the regulation of interconnected DNA repair/remodeling and RNA processing pathways. We present evidence for a role for HTT in double strand break repair mechanism. We demonstrate HTT functional interaction with a major DNA damage response kinase DNA-PKcs and association of both proteins with nuclear speckles. We show that S1181 phosphorylation of HTT is regulated by DSB, and can be carried out (at least in vitro) by DNA-PK. Furthermore, we show HTT interactions with RNA binding proteins associated with nuclear speckles, including two proteins encoded by genes at HD modifier loci, TCERG1 and MED15, and with chromatin remodeling complex BAF. These interactions of HTT may position it as an important scaffolding intermediary providing integrated regulation of gene expression and RNA processing in the context of DNA repair mechanisms.

                <p>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) has revealed new levels of cellular organization and diversity within the human brain. However, full-length mRNA isoforms are not resolved in typical snRNA-seq analyses using short-read sequencing that cannot capture full-length transcripts. Here we combine standard 10x Genomics short-read snRNA-seq with targeted PacBio long-read snRNA-seq to examine isoforms of genes associated with neurological diseases at the single-cell level from prefrontal cortex samples of diseased and nondiseased human brain, assessing over 165,000 cells. Samples from 25 postmortem donors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease (PD), along with age-matched controls, were compared. Analysis of the short-read libraries identified shared and distinct gene expression changes across the diseases. The same libraries were then assayed using enrichment probes to target 50 disease-related genes followed by long-read PacBio sequencing, enabling linkage between cell type and isoform expression. Vast mRNA isoform diversity was observed in all 50 targeted genes, even those that were not differentially expressed in the short-read data. We also developed an informatics method for detection of isoform structural differences in novel isoforms versus the reference annotation. These data expand available single-cell datasets of the human prefrontal cortical transcriptome with combined short- and long-read sequencing across AD, DLB, and PD, revealing increased mRNA isoform diversity that may contribute to disease features and could potentially represent therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Treatment for major depressive disorder (depression) often has partial efficacy and a large portion of patients are treatment resistant. Recent studies implicate reduced somatostatin (SST) interneuron inhibition in depression, and new pharmacology boosting this inhibition via positive allosteric modulators of α5-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (α5-PAM) offers a promising effective treatment. However, testing the effect of α5-PAM on human brain activity is limited, meriting the use of detailed simulations. We utilized our previous detailed computational models of human depression microcircuits with reduced SST interneuron inhibition and α5-PAM effects, to simulate EEG of individual microcircuits across depression severity and α5-PAM doses. We developed machine learning models that predicted optimal dose from EEG with high accuracy and recovered microcircuit activity and EEG. This study provides dose prediction models for α5-PAM administration based on EEG biomarkers of depression severity. Given limitations in doing the above in the living human brain, the results and tools we developed will facilitate translation of α5-PAM treatment to clinical use.

                <p>by Nyall Jamieson, Christiana Charalambous, David M. Schultz, Ian Hall</p>

Understanding the temporal relationship between key events in an individual’s infection history is crucial for disease control. Delay data between events, such as infection and symptom onset times, is doubly censored because the exact time at which these key events occur is generally unknown. Current mathematical models for delay distributions are derived from heuristic justifications. Here, we derive a new model for delay distributions, specifically for incubation periods, motivated by bacterial-growth dynamics that lead to the Burr family of distributions being a valid modelling choice. We also incorporate methods within these models to account for the doubly censored data. Our approach provides biological justification in the derivation of our delay distribution model, the results of fitting to data highlighting the superiority of the Burr model compared to currently used models when the mode of the distribution is clearly defined or when the distribution tapers off. Under these conditions, our results indicate that the derived Burr distribution is a better-performing model for incubation-period data than currently used methods, with the derived Burr distribution being 13 times more likely to be a better-performing model than the gamma distribution for Legionnaires’ disease based on data from a known outbreak.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In 1979, I joined Jim Ranck's group in Brooklyn and began recording hippocampal neurons. The first project was to record single neurons across three behaviors in different chambers: pellet retrieval on a radial-arm maze, bar-pressing for food reward in an operant chamber, and maternal pup-retrieval in a large home box. We found spatial firing in all three chambers, with a single-neuron's firing pattern unpredictable from one chamber to the next. We interpreted the spatial firing patterns as representing “context.” Later, in the 1980s, I began collaborating with Bob Muller (and Jim Ranck). In the first of a pair of 1987 papers, we used computerized data acquisition, recorded in simple, reduced environments to demonstrate robust, stable place cell firing and the characteristic features of firing fields. In the second paper we showed that when a rat is transferred from one environment to another, the set of place cells “remaps.” “Remapping” was defined later, in a pair of 1990 papers. “Context” was introduced in the early three-behavior experiment but was not discussed in the 1987 papers. What is the true relationship between the biological observation of “remapping” and the psychological concept of “context”? This difficult question is addressed here and in more detail in our recent paper.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among patients with acute stroke, we aimed to identify those who will later develop central post-stroke pain (CPSP) versus those who will not (non-pain sensory stroke [NPSS]) by assessing potential differences in somatosensory profile patterns and evaluating their potential as predictors of CPSP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a prospective longitudinal study on 75 acute stroke patients with somatosensory symptoms, we performed quantitative somatosensory testing (QST) in the acute/subacute phase (within 10 days) and on follow-up visits for 12 months. Based on previous QST studies, we hypothesized that QST values of cold detection threshold (CDT) and dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA) would differ between CPSP and NPSS patients before the onset of pain. Mann–Whitney <i>U</i>-tests and mixed analysis of variances with Bonferroni corrections were performed to compare z-normalized QST scores between both groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 26 patients (34.7%) developed CPSP. In the acute phase, CPSP patients showed contralesional cold hypoesthesia compared to NPSS patients (<i>p</i> = 0.04), but no DMA differences. Additional exploratory analysis showed NPSS patients exhibit cold hyperalgesia on the contralesional side compared to the ipsilesional side, not seen in CPSP patients (<i>p</i> = 0.011). A gradient-boosting approach to predicting CPSP from QST patterns before pain onset had an overall accuracy of 84.6%, with a recall and precision of 75%. Notably, both in the acute and the chronic phase, approximately 80% of CPSP and NPSS patients showed bilateral QST abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cold perception differences between CPSP and NPSS patients appear early post stroke before pain onset. Prediction of CPSP through QST patterns seems feasible. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Previously, we reported that α-synuclein (α-syn) clusters synaptic vesicles (SV) Diao et al., 2013, and neutral phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) can mediate this clustering Lai et al., 2023. Meanwhile, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of α-syn such as acetylation and phosphorylation play important yet distinct roles in regulating α-syn conformation, membrane binding, and amyloid aggregation. However, how PTMs regulate α-syn function in presynaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, based on our previous findings, we further demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation, which occurs under physiological conditions and is irreversible in mammalian cells, significantly enhances the functional activity of α-syn in clustering SVs. Mechanistic studies reveal that this enhancement is caused by the N-acetylation-promoted insertion of α-syn’s N-terminus and increased intermolecular interactions on the LPC-containing membrane. N-acetylation in our work is shown to fine-tune the interaction between α-syn and LPC, mediating α-syn’s role in synaptic vesicle clustering.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95488">Impact of the clinically approved BTK inhibitors on the conformation of full-length BTK and analysis of the development of BTK resistance mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune disorders, and multiple sclerosis. Since the approval of the first BTK inhibitor (BTKi), Ibrutinib, several other inhibitors including Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib, and Pirtobrutinib have been clinically approved. All are covalent active site inhibitors, with the exception of the reversible active site inhibitor Pirtobrutinib. The large number of available inhibitors for the BTK target creates challenges in choosing the most appropriate BTKi for treatment. Side-by-side comparisons in CLL have shown that different inhibitors may differ in their treatment efficacy. Moreover, the nature of the resistance mutations that arise in patients appears to depend on the specific BTKi administered. We have previously shown that Ibrutinib binding to the kinase active site causes unanticipated long-range effects on the global conformation of BTK (Joseph et al., 2020). Here, we show that binding of each of the five approved BTKi to the kinase active site brings about distinct allosteric changes that alter the conformational equilibrium of full-length BTK. Additionally, we provide an explanation for the resistance mutation bias observed in CLL patients treated with different BTKi and characterize the mechanism of action of two common resistance mutations: BTK T474I and L528W.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102667">Target protein identification in live cells and organisms with a non-diffusive proximity tagging system</a></h4>

              
                Identifying target proteins for bioactive molecules is essential for understanding their mechanisms, developing improved derivatives, and minimizing off-target effects. Despite advances in target identification (target-ID) technologies, significant challenges remain, impeding drug development. Most target-ID methods use cell lysates, but maintaining an intact cellular context is vital for capturing specific drug–protein interactions, such as those with transient protein complexes and membrane-associated proteins. To address these limitations, we developed POST-IT (Pup-On-target for Small molecule Target Identification Technology), a non-diffusive proximity tagging system for live cells, orthogonal to the eukaryotic system. POST-IT utilizes an engineered fusion of proteasomal accessory factor A and HaloTag to transfer Pup to proximal proteins upon directly binding to the small molecule. After significant optimization to eliminate self-pupylation and polypupylation, minimize depupylation, and optimize chemical linkers, POST-IT successfully identified known targets and discovered a new binder, SEPHS2, for dasatinib, and VPS37C as a new target for hydroxychloroquine, enhancing our understanding these drugs’ mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrated the application of POST-IT in live zebrafish embryos, highlighting its potential for broad biological research and drug development.

                Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) allows genome-scale imaging of RNAs in individual cells in intact tissues. To date, MERFISH has been applied to image thin-tissue samples of ~10 µm thickness. Here, we present a thick-tissue three-dimensional (3D) MERFISH imaging method, which uses confocal microscopy for optical sectioning, deep learning for increasing imaging speed and quality, as well as sample preparation and imaging protocol optimized for thick samples. We demonstrated 3D MERFISH on mouse brain tissue sections of up to 200 µm thickness with high detection efficiency and accuracy. We anticipate that 3D thick-tissue MERFISH imaging will broaden the scope of questions that can be addressed by spatial genomics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95106">Telomere length sensitive regulation of interleukin receptor 1 type 1 (IL1R1) by the shelterin protein TRF2 modulates immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Telomeres are crucial for cancer progression. Immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment has been shown to be very important in cancer prognosis. However, the mechanisms by which telomeres might affect tumour immune response remain poorly understood. Here, we observed that interleukin-1 signalling is telomere-length dependent in cancer cells. Mechanistically, non-telomeric TRF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2) binding at the IL-1-receptor type-1 (IL1R1) promoter was found to be affected by telomere length. Enhanced TRF2 binding at the <i>IL1R1</i> promoter in cells with short telomeres directly recruited the histone-acetyl-transferase (HAT) p300, and consequent H3K27 acetylation activated IL1R1. This altered NF-kappa B signalling and affected downstream cytokines like <i>IL6, IL8,</i> and <i>TNF</i>. Further, <i>IL1R1</i> expression was telomere-sensitive in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) clinical samples. Infiltration of tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) was also sensitive to the length of tumour cell telomeres and highly correlated with <i>IL1R1</i> expression. The use of both IL1 Receptor antagonist (IL1RA) and <i>IL1R1</i> targeting ligands could abrogate M2 macrophage infiltration in TNBC tumour organoids. In summary, using TNBC cancer tissue (&gt;90 patients), tumour-derived organoids, cancer cells, and xenograft tumours with either long or short telomeres, we uncovered a heretofore undeciphered function of telomeres in modulating IL1 signalling and tumour immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98349">Learning enhances behaviorally relevant representations in apical dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Learning alters cortical representations and improves perception. Apical tuft dendrites in cortical layer 1, which are unique in their connectivity and biophysical properties, may be a key site of learning-induced plasticity. We used both two-photon and SCAPE microscopy to longitudinally track tuft-wide calcium spikes in apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in barrel cortex as mice learned a tactile behavior. Mice were trained to discriminate two orthogonal directions of whisker stimulation. Reinforcement learning, but not repeated stimulus exposure, enhanced tuft selectivity for both directions equally, even though only one was associated with reward. Selective tufts emerged from initially unresponsive or low-selectivity populations. Animal movement and choice did not account for changes in stimulus selectivity. Enhanced selectivity persisted even after rewards were removed and animals ceased performing the task. We conclude that learning produces long-lasting realignment of apical dendrite tuft responses to behaviorally relevant dimensions of a task.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95988">Unveiling chemotherapy-induced immune landscape remodeling and metabolic reprogramming in lung adenocarcinoma by scRNA-sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Chemotherapy is widely used to treat lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients comprehensively. Considering the limitations of chemotherapy due to drug resistance and other issues, it is crucial to explore the impact of chemotherapy and immunotherapy on these aspects. In this study, tumor samples from nine LUAD patients, of which four only received surgery and five received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. In vitro and in vivo assays, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Seahorse assay, and tumor xenograft models, were carried out to validate our findings. A total of 83,622 cells were enrolled for subsequent analyses. The composition of cell types exhibited high heterogeneity across different groups. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that chemotherapy drove significant metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells and macrophages. We identified two subtypes of macrophages: Anti-mac cells (CD45+CD11b+CD86+) and Pro-mac cells (CD45+CD11b+ARG +) and sorted them by flow cytometry. The proportion of Pro-mac cells in LUAD tissues increased significantly after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pro-mac cells promote tumor growth and angiogenesis and also suppress tumor immunity. Moreover, by analyzing the remodeling of T and B cells induced by neoadjuvant therapy, we noted that chemotherapy ignited a relatively more robust immune cytotoxic response toward tumor cells. Our study demonstrates that chemotherapy induces metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment of LUAD, particularly affecting the function and composition of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells. We believe our findings will offer insight into the mechanisms of drug resistance and provide novel therapeutic targets for LUAD in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96536">A transcription network underlies the dual genomic coordination of mitochondrial biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the expression of genes encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. However, aside from a handful transcription factors regulating specific subsets of mitochondrial genes, the overall architecture of the transcriptional control of mitochondrial biogenesis remains to be elucidated. The mechanisms coordinating these two genomes are largely unknown. We performed a targeted RNAi screen in developing eyes with reduced mitochondrial DNA content, anticipating a synergistic disruption of tissue development due to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deficiency. Among 638 transcription factors annotated in the <i>Drosophila</i> genome, 77 were identified as potential regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. Utilizing published ChIP-seq data of positive hits, we constructed a regulatory network revealing the logic of the transcription regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Multiple transcription factors in core layers had extensive connections, collectively governing the expression of nearly all mitochondrial genes, whereas factors sitting on the top layer may respond to cellular cues to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis through the underlying network. CG1603, a core component of the network, was found to be indispensable for the expression of most nuclear mitochondrial genes, including those required for mtDNA maintenance and gene expression, thus coordinating nuclear genome and mtDNA activities in mitochondrial biogenesis. Additional genetic analyses validated YL-1, a transcription factor upstream of CG1603 in the network, as a regulator controlling CG1603 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92741">TIPE drives a cancer stem-like phenotype by promoting glycolysis via PKM2/HIF-1α axis in melanoma</a></h4>

              
                TIPE (<i>TNFAIP8</i>) has been identified as an oncogene and participates in tumor biology. However, how its role in the metabolism of tumor cells during melanoma development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that TIPE promoted glycolysis by interacting with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in melanoma. We found that TIPE-induced PKM2 dimerization, thereby facilitating its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. TIPE-mediated PKM2 dimerization consequently promoted HIF-1α activation and glycolysis, which contributed to melanoma progression and increased its stemness features. Notably, TIPE specifically phosphorylated PKM2 at Ser 37 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Consistently, the expression of TIPE was positively correlated with the levels of PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in melanoma tissues from clinical samples and tumor bearing mice. In summary, our findings indicate that the TIPE/PKM2/HIF-1α signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in promoting CSC properties by facilitating the glycolysis, which would provide a promising therapeutic target for melanoma intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97350">Eco-evolutionary dynamics of adapting pathogens and host immunity</a></h4>

              
                As pathogens spread in a population of hosts, immunity is built up, and the pool of susceptible individuals are depleted. This generates selective pressure, to which many human RNA viruses, such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, respond with rapid antigenic evolution and frequent emergence of immune evasive variants. However, the host’s immune systems adapt, and older immune responses wane, such that escape variants only enjoy a growth advantage for a limited time. If variant growth dynamics and reshaping of host-immunity operate on comparable time scales, viral adaptation is determined by eco-evolutionary interactions that are not captured by models of rapid evolution in a fixed environment. Here, we use a Susceptible/Infected model to describe the interaction between an evolving viral population in a dynamic but immunologically diverse host population. We show that depending on strain cross-immunity, heterogeneity of the host population, and durability of immune responses, escape variants initially grow exponentially, but lose their growth advantage before reaching high frequencies. Their subsequent dynamics follows an anomalous random walk determined by future escape variants and results in variant trajectories that are unpredictable. This model can explain the apparent contradiction between the clearly adaptive nature of antigenic evolution and the quasi-neutral dynamics of high-frequency variants observed for influenza viruses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100011">Passive accumulation of alkaloids in inconspicuously colored frogs refines the evolutionary paradigm of acquired chemical defenses</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the origins of novel, complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.

">TMEM63A, associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of myelination</a></h4>

              
                Infantile hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 19 (HLD19) is a rare genetic disorder where patients exhibit reduced myelin in central nervous system (CNS) white matter tracts and present with varied neurological symptoms. The causative gene TMEM63A encodes a mechanosensitive ion channel whose role in myelination has not been explored. Our study shows that TMEM63A is a major regulator of OL-driven myelination in the CNS. In mouse and zebrafish, Tmem63a inactivation led to early deficits in myelination, recapitulating the HLD19 phenotype. OL-specific conditional mouse knockouts of Tmem63a exhibited transient reductions in myelin, indicating that TMEM63A regulates myelination cell-autonomously. We show that TMEM63A is present at plasma membrane and on lysosomes and modulates myelin/myelin-associated protein production. Intriguingly, HLD19-associated TMEM63A variants from patients blocked trafficking to cell membrane. Together, our results reveal an ancient role for TMEM63A in fundamental aspects of myelination in vivo and highlight two exciting new models for the development of treatments for devastating hypomyelinating leukodystrophies.

">SLC35A2 loss of function variants affect glycomic signatures, neuronal fate, and network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                SLC35A2 encodes a UDP-galactose transporter essential for glycosylation of proteins and galactosylation of lipids and glycosaminoglycans. Germline genetic SLC35A2 variants have been identified in congenital disorders of glycosylation and somatic SLC35A2 variants have been linked to intractable epilepsy associated with malformations of cortical development. However, the functional consequences of these pathogenic variants on brain development and network integrity remain elusive. In this study, we use an isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron model to comprehensively interrogate the functional impact of loss of function variants in SLC35A2 through the integration of cellular and molecular biology, protein glycosylation analysis, neural network dynamics, and single cell electrophysiology. We show that loss of function variants in SLC35A2 result in disrupted glycomic signatures and precocious neurodevelopment, yielding hypoactive, asynchronous neural networks. This aberrant network activity is attributed to an inhibitory/excitatory imbalance as characterization of neural composition revealed preferential differentiation of SLC35A2 loss of function variants towards the GABAergic fate. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings of synaptic activity reveal a shift in excitatory/inhibitory balance towards increased inhibitory drive, indicating changes occurring specifically at the pre-synaptic terminal. Our study is the first to provide mechanistic insight regarding the early development and functional connectivity of SLC35A2 loss of function variant harboring human neurons, providing important groundwork for future exploration of potential therapeutic interventions.

">Long-term, cell type-specific effects of prenatal stress on dorsal striatum and relevant behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Maternal stress during pregnancy, or prenatal stress, is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In ASD, dorsal striatum displays abnormalities correlating with symptom severity, but there is a gap in knowledge about dorsal striatal cellular and molecular mechanisms that may contribute. Using a mouse model, we investigated how prenatal stress impacted striatal-dependent behavior in adult offspring. We observed enhanced motor learning and earlier response times on an interval timing task, with accompanying changes in time-related medium spiny neuron (MSN) activity. We performed adult dorsal striatal single-cell RNA sequencing following prenatal stress which revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in multiple cell types; downregulated DEGs were enriched for ribosome and translational pathways consistently in MSN subtypes, microglia, and somatostatin neurons. DEGs in MSN subtypes over-represented ASD risk genes and were enriched for synapse-related processes. These results provide insights into striatal alterations relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Effect of flicker-induced retinal stimulation of mice revealed by full-field electroretinography</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To investigate the effects of brief flickering light stimulation (FLS) on retinal electrophysiology and its blood flow in normal C57BL6J mice. Methods: Retinal blood flow (RBF) and full-field electroretinography (ffERG) were measured before and after a 60-second long FLS (12 Hz, 0.1 cd{middle dot}s/m2) in a cohort of 8-12 weeks old C57BL6J mice (n=10) under anaesthetic and light-adapted conditions. A separate set of age-matched mice (n=9) underwent RBF and ffERG measurements before and after steady light stimulation (SLS) at 1 cd/m2 under similar conditions. The changes in RBF (arterial and venous flow) and ffERG responses (amplitudes and implicit times of a- and b-wave) were analyzed. Results: FLS significantly increased both arterial (p=0.003) and venous (p=0.018) blood flow as well as b-wave amplitudes (p=0.017) compared to SLS, which did not have any significant changes in both RBF and ERG. However, no significant differences were found in other ffERG responses (amplitude and implicit time of a-wave and b-wave implicit time) between the two groups after light stimulation. An increase in b-wave amplitude was positively associated with increase in both arterial (r=0.655, p=0.040) and venous blood flow (r=0.638, p=0.047) in the FLS group. Conclusions: Transient FLS induced a significant increase in both RBF and electro-retinal activity, but such increase was not observed after SLS. Our results suggest the role of FLS, which exerts metabolic stress on the retina, in triggering retinal neurovascular coupling.

">A Blueprint of Sex-Specific Neuronal Regulation in the C. elegans Nervous System at Single-Cell Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Sex-specific behaviors within a species are often attributed to variances in neuronal wiring and molecular signatures. However, how the genetic sex shapes the molecular architecture of the nervous system at a single neuron level is still unknown. To address this gap, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the transcriptome of the sex-shared nervous system of adult male and hermaphrodite Caenorhabditis elegans. By ranking neurons based on the degree of molecular dimorphism, we uncover novel sexually dimorphic neurons such as PLM neurons, where functional dimorphism was corroborated by diminished posterior touch responses in hermaphrodites. We identify sex-specific regulators of mechanosensory behavior and neuronal function by combining our dataset with reverse genetic screens. While most sex-shared neurons retain their neurotransmitter identity, the male neuropeptide connectome undergoes substantial remodeling, with most of the neuropeptides showing a male-bias expression. This reinforces the notion that neuropeptides are crucial for diversifying connectome outputs. Furthermore, by correlating gene expression with outgoing synaptic connectivity, we identified regulatory candidates for synaptic wiring, including both shared and sex-specific genes. This comprehensive resource provides foundational insights into the molecular drivers of sexual dimorphism, facilitating future exploration of regulatory mechanisms and their impact on sex-specific behaviors in higher organisms.

">Genetically Labeled Premyelinating Oligodendrocytes: Bridging Oligodendrogenesis and Neuronal Activity</a></h4>

              
                To myelinate axons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) must stop dividing and differentiate into premyelinating oligodendrocytes (preOLs). PreOLs are thought to survey and begin ensheathing nearby axons, and their maturation is often stalled at human demyelinating lesions. Lack of genetic tools to visualize and manipulate preOLs has left this critical differentiation stage woefully understudied. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse line that specifically labels preOLs across the central nervous system. Genetically labeled preOLs exhibit distinct morphology, unique transcriptomic and electrophysiological features, and do not overlap with OPCs. PreOL lineage tracing revealed that subsets of them undergo prolonged maturation and that different brain regions initiate oligodendrogenesis with the spatiotemporal specificity. Lastly, by fate mapping preOLs under sensory deprivation, we find that neuronal activity functions within a narrow time window of preOL maturation to promote their survival and successful integration. Our work provides a new tool to probe this critical cell stage during axon ensheathment, allowing for fine dissection of axon-oligodendrocyte interactions.

">Best Cochlear Locations for Delivering Interaural Timing Cues in Electric Hearing</a></h4>

              
                Growing numbers of children and adults who are deaf are eligible to receive cochlear implants (CI), which provide access to everyday sound. CIs in both ears (bilateral CIs or BiCIs) are becoming standard of care in many countries. However, their effectiveness is limited because they do not adequately restore the acoustic cues essential for sound localization, particularly interaural time differences (ITDs) at low frequencies. The cochlea, the auditory sensory organ, typically transmits ITDs more effectively at the apical region, which is specifically "tuned" to low frequencies. We hypothesized that effective restoration of robust ITD perception through electrical stimulation with BiCIs depends on targeting cochlear locations that transmit information most effectively. Importantly, we show that these locations can occur anywhere along the cochlea, even on the opposite end of the frequency map from where ITD cues are most dominantly encoded in an acoustic hearing system.

">Truncated TrkB: The predominant TrkB Isoform in Nociceptors</a></h4>

              
                Truncated form of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B isoform (TrkBT1), traditionally considered a dominant-negative regulator of full-length TrkB (TrkBTK+), remains poorly understood in peripheral sensory neurons, particularly nociceptors. Furthermore, sensory neuronal TrkB expression and function has been traditionally associated with non-nociceptive neurons, particularly A{delta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors (A{delta}-LTMRs). In this study, we challenge these prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that TrkBT1 is the predominant TrkB isoform expressed in sensory neurons and plays a functional role in modulating neuronal activity. We present a comprehensive characterization of TrkBT1 expression and function in trigeminal sensory neurons and uncover its critical role in nociceptor activity, sensitization, and survival. Using western blot, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RTPCR, we demonstrate that TrkBT1 is the predominant isoform expressed in nociceptors, identified by markers such as TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8 and 5HT3A as well as non-nociceptors, while TrkBTK+ is restricted to non-nociceptive subpopulation. Functionally, we show that acute application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induces modest calcium influx in nociceptors, though unable to sensitize nociceptors. However, prolonged BDNF exposure significantly potentiates capsaicin-induced calcium influx, an effect blocked by the TrkB-specific antagonist ANA12. Intriguingly, BDNF also promotes the survival of both nociceptive and non-nociceptive sensory neurons in culture, an effect similarly dependent on TrkBT1 activity. Our data also reveal that ANA12 inhibits BDNF-mediated neuronal sensitization and survival in a concentration-dependent manner, implicating distinct TrkBT1 signaling pathways in these processes. Collectively, our findings redefine TrkBT1 as a functional modulator of nociceptor activity rather than a passive regulator of full-length TrkB. By uncovering its dual roles in nociceptor sensitization and survival, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of BDNF/TrkB signaling in pain. Future work evaluating the role of TrkBT1 in sensory biology could offer new perspectives on how this receptor contributes to neuronal function and plasticity during chronic pain conditions.

                ObjectiveTo investigate the radiomics features of the hippocampus and the amygdala subregions in FDG-PET images that can best differentiate Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimers Disease (AD), and healthy patients.

MethodsBaseline FDG-PET data from 555 participants in the ADNI dataset were analyzed, comprising 189 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 201 with MCI, and 165 with AD. The hippocampus and amygdala were segmented based on the DKT-Atlas, with additional subdivisions guided by probabilistic atlases from Freesurfer. Then radiomic features (n=120) were extracted from 38 hippocampal subregions and 18 amygdala nuclei using PyRadiomics. Various feature selection techniques, including ANOVA, PCA, Chi-square, and LASSO, were applied alongside nine machine learning classifiers.

ResultsThe Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model combined with LASSO demonstrated excellent classification performance: ROC AUC of 0.957 for CN vs. AD, ROC AUC of 0.867 for MCI vs. AD, and ROC AUC of 0.782 for CN vs. MCI. Key regions, including the accessory basal nucleus, presubiculum head, and CA4 head, were identified as critical biomarkers. Features including GLRLM (Long Run Emphasis) and Small Dependence Emphasis (GLDM) showed strong diagnostic potential, reflecting subtle metabolic and microstructural changes often preceding anatomical alterations.

ConclusionSpecific hippocampal and amygdala subregions and their four radiomic features were found to have a significant role in the early diagnosis of AD, its staging, and its severity assessment by capturing subtle shifts in metabolic patterns. Furthermore, these features offer potential insights into the diseases underlying mechanisms and model interpretability.

">An Independent Coding Scheme for Distance versus Position in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Animals navigate using cognitive maps of their environment, integrating external landmarks and distances between them. Hippocampal place cells are the neuronal substrate of these cognitive maps. However, while hippocampal allocentric position coding in reference to external landmarks is well characterized, the determinants of idiothetic hippocampal distance coding remain poorly understood. Using virtual reality, electrophysiological recordings in mice, and local cue manipulations we could dissociate distance from position coding. In the cue-poor condition, we found pervasive distance coding with high distance indices in all bidirectional place cells including both superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells. In this condition, the mapping of distance onto a low-dimensional manifold and rigid distance relationships between place fields suggested strong attractor dynamics similar to those observed for grid cells. Inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which disrupts grid cells, significantly reduced both distance coding and rigid distance dynamics, suggesting an alteration (but not complete abolition) of the underlying attractor. In contrast, allocentric position coding could be observed in cue-rich environments, predominantly engaged deep CA1 pyramidal cells, and persisted during MS inactivation. These results are consistent with a selective contribution of grid cells and associated rigid attractor dynamics to hippocampal idiothetic distance coding but not allocentric position coding.

">Phylogenetic variation of immature neurons in mammalian amygdala: high prevalence in primate expanded nuclei projecting to neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Structural changes involving new neurons can occur through stem cell-driven neurogenesis and late-maturing "immature" neurons, namely undifferentiated neuronal precursors frozen in a state of arrested maturation. The latter exist in the cerebral cortex, being particularly abundant in large-brained mammals. Similar cells have been described in the amygdala of some species, although their interspecies variation remain poorly understood. Here, their occurrence, number, molecular expression, and morphology were systematically analyzed in eight diverse mammalian species widely differing in neuroanatomy, brain size, lifespan, and socioecology. We show remarkable phylogenetic variation of the immature neurons in the amygdala, with a significantly greater prevalence in primates. The cells are associated with the amygdalas basolateral complex that in evolution has expanded in primates in conjunction with cortical projections, thus mimicking the general trend of the neocortex. These results support the emerging view that large brains performing complex socio-cognitive functions rely on wide reservoirs of immature neurons.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMSs) that significantly impact patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. This review aims to synthesize the current literature on the application of brain stimulation techniques, including non-invasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), as well as invasive approaches like deep brain stimulation (DBS). We explore the efficacy and safety profiles of these techniques in alleviating both motor impairments, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive decline, depression, and impulse control disorders. Current findings indicate that while non-invasive techniques present a favorable safety profile and are effective for milder symptoms, invasive methods like DBS provide significant relief for severe cases that are unresponsive to other treatments. Future research is needed to optimize stimulation parameters, establish robust clinical protocols, and expand the application of these technologies across various stages of PD. This review underscores the potential of brain stimulation as a vital therapeutic tool in managing PD, paving the way for enhanced treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background: Spatial working memory is crucial for processing visual and spatial information, serving as a foundation for complex cognitive tasks. However, the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation on its dynamics and underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the specific trends and neural mechanisms underlying spatial working memory alterations during 36 h of acute sleep deprivation. Methods: Twenty participants underwent a 36 h protocol of acute sleep deprivation. Utilizing the spatial 2-back task for assessing spatial working memory, combined with event-related potential (ERP) technology, we compared behavioral and neural responses at four critical time points&amp;amp;mdash;before deprivation, and after 12, 24, and 36 h of sleep deprivation&amp;amp;mdash;to uncover dynamic cognitive changes. Results: The findings indicate that the impact of sleep deprivation on spatial working memory exhibits significant temporal dependence. After 24 h of deprivation, both behavioral performance and ERP component amplitudes showed significant declines. During the period from 24 to 36 h, the amplitudes of the P2, N2, and P3 components exhibited a recovery trend, potentially reflecting neural compensatory mechanisms. Conclusions: The impact of 36 h acute sleep deprivation on spatial working memory is characterized by time-dependent and phase-specific effects. Initially, sleep deprivation leads to severe cognitive depletion, followed by an adaptive compensatory phase where neural mechanisms may partially restore function. These findings highlight the non-linear nature of cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation, involving complex self-regulatory and compensatory mechanisms, with implications for understanding cognitive resilience and adaptive processes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autistic adults are more likely to be unemployed compared to neurotypical adults and those with disability. To address these poorer employment outcomes, it is important to consider factors that may be impacting on autistic adults&amp;amp;rsquo; employment outcomes. Anxiety is a common co-occurring condition for autistic adults; however, there is little research on how anxiety affects or influences autistic people&amp;amp;rsquo;s experience across the employment-seeking process. The aim of this study was to explore whether anxiety is perceived to affect autistic adults&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to engage in employment-seeking tasks. Methods: Online, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 autistic adults (22&amp;amp;ndash;52 years) who were actively seeking employment or had sought employment in the last 18 months. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were generated from the data analysis. Theme 1, Finding the &amp;amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;amp;rdquo;, identified some level of anxiety&amp;amp;mdash;but not too much&amp;amp;mdash;was helpful in performing the employment-seeking tasks and this &amp;amp;ldquo;spot&amp;amp;rdquo; could vary depending on the person and the task. Theme 2, Anxiety affects the ability to perform and function, encapsulates the autistic person&amp;amp;rsquo;s experience when anxiety is too high. The third theme, The &amp;amp;ldquo;vicious cycle&amp;amp;rdquo; of anxiety and employment-seeking behaviours, explores participants&amp;amp;rsquo; ongoing experience of anxiety on their employment-seeking behaviours. Conclusions: The findings suggest that autistic job candidates would benefit from tailored accommodations and adjustments offered throughout the recruitment process, to reduce anxiety and improve employment-seeking outcomes for autistic candidates.</p>

	<p>Brain connectivity analysis plays a crucial role in unraveling the complex network dynamics of the human brain, providing insights into cognitive functions, behaviors, and neurological disorders. Traditional graph-theoretical methods, while foundational, often fall short in capturing the high-dimensional and dynamic nature of brain connectivity. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful approach for this purpose, with the potential to improve diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized interventions. This review examines recent studies leveraging GNNs in brain connectivity analysis, focusing on key methodological advancements in multimodal data integration, dynamic connectivity, and interpretability across various imaging modalities, including fMRI, MRI, DTI, PET, and EEG. Findings reveal that GNNs excel in modeling complex, non-linear connectivity patterns and enable the integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities to provide richer insights into both healthy and pathological brain networks. However, challenges remain, particularly in interpretability, data scarcity, and multimodal integration, limiting the full clinical utility of GNNs. Addressing these limitations through enhanced interpretability, optimized multimodal techniques, and expanded labeled datasets is crucial to fully harness the potential of GNNs for neuroscience research and clinical applications.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire version 2 (SSSQ2) is a brief clinical tool with six items designed to be used (1) as a measure for severity of sound sensitivity symptoms in general (based on its total score) and (2) as a checklist to screen different forms of sound sensitivity. The objective of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SSSQ2. Method: This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 451 people completed the online survey. A total of 154 people completed the survey twice with a two-week interval to establish test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. The average age of the participants was 36.5 years (range 18 to 86 years). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the SSSQ2 is a one-factor questionnaire. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; was 0.80. The test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability was good for the total SSSQ2 score and was moderate for the sum of items 1 and 3 (indicating loudness hyperacusis), item 2 (for pain hyperacusis), item 4 (for misophonia), item 5 (for fear hyperacusis), and item 6 (for noise sensitivity). The minimum amount of change that constitutes a true change in the total SSSQ2 score is &amp;amp;ge;5 points. Conclusions: The SSSQ2 can be used in clinical practice or research setting to measure the severity of general sound sensitivity as a one-factor questionnaire with acceptable internal consistency and good reliability. In addition, the individual items in the SSSQ2 can be used as a checklist to screen for various forms of sound sensitivity.</p>

	<p>Background/objectives: Negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders are related to impaired social functioning and lower quality of life, making accurate assessment important. To date, most tools for assessing negative symptoms are observational, which can be influenced by the raters&amp;amp;rsquo; experience and opinion. Self-rating scales, like the Self-Evaluation of Negative Symptoms (SNS), could complement observer ratings by adding information from the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s perspective. Here, we aim to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dutch translation of the SNS and the relationship between the SNS and functional outcomes. Methods: The SNS was added to the Pharmacotherapy Monitoring Outcome Survey (PHAMOUS)-protocol for adults with a DSM-5 classification of a disorder in the psychosis spectrum. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the construct validity of the five subscales of the SNS. Correlational analyses were performed between the SNS and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Health of Nation Outcomes Scales (HoNOS), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Functional Remission tool (FR) and the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (ManSA). Results: A total of 247 patients participated in this study. Internal consistency was good (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.87). CFA confirmed the five-factor structure of the SNS. The SNS was significantly correlated (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) with the PANSS positive (r = 0.31), PANSS negative (r = 0.33), HoNOS (r = 0.37), FR (r = 0.27) and the ManSA (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.40). Conclusions: The Dutch SNS shows good psychometric properties and is related to functional outcomes and quality of life. The SNS can be valuable in complementing current observational-based instruments, and future research may investigate whether the SNS can be used as a standalone measurement tool for the assessment of negative symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/12/ENEURO.0209-24.2024?rss=1">Minimal Variation in Functional Connectivity in Relation to Daily Affect</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reported associations between functional connectivity and affective disorder symptoms are minimally reproducible, which can partially be attributed to difficulty capturing highly variable clinical symptoms in cross-sectional study designs. "Dense sampling" protocols, where participants are sampled across multiple sessions, can overcome this limitation by studying associations between functional connectivity and variable clinical states. Here, we characterized effect sizes for the association between functional connectivity and time-varying positive and negative daily affect in a nonclinical cohort. Data were analyzed from 24 adults who attended four research visits, where participants self-reported daily affect using the PANAS-X questionnaire and completed 39&nbsp;min of functional magnetic resonance imaging across three passive viewing conditions. We modeled positive and negative daily affect in relation to network-level functional connectivity, with hypotheses regarding within-network connectivity of the default mode, salience/cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual networks and between-network connectivity of affective subcortical regions (amygdala and nucleus accumbens) with both default mode and salience/cingulo-opercular networks. Effect sizes for associations between affect and network-level functional connectivity were small and nonsignificant across analyses. We additionally report that functional connectivity variance is largely attributable to individual identity with small relative variance (&lt;3%) accounted for by within-subject daily affect variation. These results support previous reports that functional connectivity is dominated by stable subject-specific connectivity patterns, while additionally suggesting relatively minimal influence of day-to-day affect. Researchers planning studies examining functional connectivity in relation to daily affect, or other varying stable states, should therefore anticipate small effect sizes and carefully consider power in study planning.</p>

                <p>Preterm infants are at risk for brain injury and neurodevelopmental impairment due, in part, to white matter injury following chronic hypoxia exposure. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which neonatal hypoxia disrupts early neurodevelopment are poorly understood. Here, we constructed a brain-wide map of the regenerative response to newborn brain injury using high-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics to analyze over 800,000 cells in a mouse model of chronic neonatal hypoxia. Additionally, we developed a new method for inferring condition-associated differences in cell type spatial proximity, enabling the identification of niche-specific changes in cellular architecture. We observed hypoxia-associated changes in region-specific cell states, cell type composition, and spatial organization. Importantly, our analysis revealed mechanisms underlying reparative neurogenesis and gliogenesis, while also nominating pathways that may impede circuit rewiring following neonatal hypoxia. Altogether, our work provides a comprehensive description of the molecular response to newborn brain injury.</p>

                <p>by Yongqi Bu, Jiaxuan Liang, Zhen Li, Jianbo Wang, Jun Wang, Guoxian Yu</p>

Diagnosing cancer subtypes is a prerequisite for precise treatment. Existing multi-omics data fusion-based diagnostic solutions build on the requisite of sufficient samples with complete multi-omics data, which is challenging to obtain in clinical applications. To address the bottleneck of collecting sufficient samples with complete data in clinical applications, we proposed a flexible integrative model (CancerSD) to diagnose cancer subtype using limited samples with incomplete multi-omics data. CancerSD designs contrastive learning tasks and masking-and-reconstruction tasks to reliably impute missing omics, and fuses available omics data with the imputed ones to accurately diagnose cancer subtypes. To address the issue of limited clinical samples, it introduces a category-level contrastive loss to extend the meta-learning framework, effectively transferring knowledge from external datasets to pretrain the diagnostic model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CancerSD not only gives accurate diagnosis, but also maintains a high authenticity and good interpretability. In addition, CancerSD identifies important molecular characteristics associated with cancer subtypes, and it defines the Integrated CancerSD Score that can serve as an independent predictive factor for patient prognosis.

For the vast majority of genes in sequenced genomes, there is limited understanding of how they are regulated. Without such knowledge, it is not possible to perform a quantitative theory-experiment dialogue on how such genes give rise to physiological and evolutionary adaptation. One category of high-throughput experiments used to understand the sequence-phenotype relationship of the transcriptome is massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). However, to improve the versatility and scalability of MPRAs, we need a “theory of the experiment” to help us better understand the impact of various biological and experimental parameters on the interpretation of experimental data. These parameters include binding site copy number, where a large number of specific binding sites may titrate away transcription factors, as well as the presence of overlapping binding sites, which may affect analysis of the degree of mutual dependence between mutations in the regulatory region and expression levels. To that end, in this paper we create tens of thousands of synthetic gene expression outputs for bacterial promoters using both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium models. These models make it possible to imitate the summary statistics (information footprints and expression shift matrices) used to characterize the output of MPRAs and thus to infer the underlying regulatory architecture. Specifically, we use a more refined implementation of the so-called thermodynamic models in which the binding energies of each sequence variant are derived from energy matrices. Our simulations reveal important effects of the parameters on MPRA data and we demonstrate our ability to optimize MPRA experimental designs with the goal of generating thermodynamic models of the transcriptome with base-pair specificity. Further, this approach makes it possible to carefully examine the mapping between mutations in binding sites and their corresponding expression profiles, a tool useful not only for developing a theory of transcription, but also for exploring regulatory evolution.

                <p>by Tal Gutman, Tamir Tuller</p>

The P-glycoprotein efflux pump, encoded by the <i>MDR1</i> gene, is an ATP-driven transporter capable of expelling a diverse array of compounds from cells. Overexpression of this protein is implicated in the multi-drug resistant phenotype observed in various cancers. Numerous studies have attempted to decipher the impact of genetic variants within <i>MDR1</i> on P-glycoprotein expression, functional activity, and clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Among these, three specific single nucleotide polymorphisms—<i>T1236C</i>, <i>T2677G</i>, and <i>T3435C</i> - have been the focus of extensive research efforts, primarily through in vitro cell line models and clinical cohort analyses. However, the findings from these studies have been remarkably contradictory. In this study, we employ a computational, data-driven approach to systematically evaluate the effects of these three variants on principal stages of the gene expression process. Leveraging current knowledge of gene regulatory mechanisms, we elucidate potential mechanisms by which these variants could modulate P-glycoprotein levels and function. Our findings suggest that all three variants significantly change the mRNA folding in their vicinity. This change in mRNA structure is predicted to increase local translation elongation rates, but not to change the protein expression. Nonetheless, the increased translation rate near <i>T3435C</i> is predicted to affect the protein’s co-translational folding trajectory in the region of the second ATP binding domain. This potentially impacts P-glycoprotein conformation and function. Our study demonstrates the value of computational approaches in elucidating the functional consequences of genetic variants. This framework provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of <i>MDR1</i> variants and their potential impact on cancer prognosis and treatment resistance. Furthermore, we introduce an approach which can be systematically applied to identify mutations potentially affecting mRNA folding in pathology. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on both ClinVar and TCGA and identify hundreds of disease related variants that modify mRNA folding at essential positions.

                <p>by Nikoleta E. Glynatsi, Vincent Knight, Marc Harper</p>

Researchers have explored the performance of Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma strategies for decades, from the celebrated performance of Tit for Tat to the introduction of the zero-determinant strategies and the use of sophisticated learning structures such as neural networks. Many new strategies have been introduced and tested in a variety of tournaments and population dynamics. Typical results in the literature, however, rely on performance against a small number of somewhat arbitrarily selected strategies, casting doubt on the generalizability of conclusions. In this work, we analyze a large collection of 195 strategies in thousands of computer tournaments, present the top performing strategies across multiple tournament types, and distill their salient features. The results show that there is not yet a single strategy that performs well in diverse Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma scenarios, nevertheless there are several properties that heavily influence the best performing strategies. This refines the properties described by Axelrod in light of recent and more diverse opponent populations to: be nice, be provocable and generous, be a little envious, be clever, and adapt to the environment. More precisely, we find that strategies perform best when their probability of cooperation matches the total tournament population’s aggregate cooperation probabilities. The features of high performing strategies help cast some light on why strategies such as Tit For Tat performed historically well in tournaments and why zero-determinant strategies typically do not fare well in tournament settings.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging is crucial in quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) and thereby making an endovascular treatment (EVT) after large vessel occlusion. However, CTP is prone to overestimating the ischemic core. We sought to delineate the optimal regional CBF (rCBF) thresholds of pre-EVT CTP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We collected acute ischemic stroke patients due to large vessel occlusion who achieved successful recanalization with baseline CTP, immediate post-EVT diffusion-weighted image (DWI) within 3 hours, and delayed post-EVT DWI between 24 and 196 hours. Core volumes estimated by CTP at various rCBF thresholds were validated against immediate and delayed DWI lesion volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 175 acute large vessel occlusion patients were included. Baseline CTP was taken in a median of 24 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 21–31 minutes) after arrival; after the CTP, groin puncture in a median of 37 minutes (IQR 28–52 minutes), immediate post-EVT DWI scans in a median of 1.6 hours (IQR 0.8–2.1 hours), and delayed DWI scans in a median of 89 hours (IQR 69–106 hours). The correlations between the rCBF thresholds were the best at rCBF &lt;22% for immediate DWI (0.64; 95% CI 0.55–0.73) and at rCBF &lt;30% for delayed DWI (0.69; 95% CI 0.61–0.76). The interval between CTP and recanalization was inversely correlated with the overestimation of ischemic core volume compared with the subsequent DWI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Optimal rCBF thresholds for estimating ischemic core using CTP depend significantly on the timing of DWI post-EVT and CTP to recanalization delay. The optimal rCBF thresholds for ischemic core estimation may vary depending on the clinical setting. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In keeping with the historical focus of this special issue of Hippocampus, this paper reviews the history of my development of the SPEAR model. The SPEAR model proposes that separate phases of encoding and retrieval (SPEAR) allow effective storage of multiple overlapping associative memories in the hippocampal formation and other cortical structures. The separate phases for encoding and retrieval are proposed to occur within different phases of theta rhythm with a cycle time on the order of 125 ms. The same framework applies to the slower transition between encoding and consolidation dynamics regulated by acetylcholine. The review includes description of the experimental data on acetylcholine and theta rhythm that motivated this model, the realization that existing associative memory models require these different dynamics, and the subsequent experimental data supporting these dynamics. The review also includes discussion of my work on the encoding of episodic memories as spatiotemporal trajectories, and some personal description of the episodic memories from my own spatiotemporal trajectory as I worked on this model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23668?af=R">The Anatomy of Context</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>For most of my career, I focused on understanding how and where spatial context, the place where things happen, is represented in the brain. My interest in this began in the early 1990's, during my postdoctoral training with David Amaral, when we defined the rodent homolog of the primate parahippocampal cortex, a region implicated in processing spatial and contextual information. We parceled out the caudal portion of the rat perirhinal cortex (PER) and called it the postrhinal cortex (POR). In my own lab at Brown University, I continued to study the anatomy of the PER, POR, and entorhinal cortices. I also began to characterize and differentiate the functions of these regions, particularly the newly defined POR and the redefined PER. Our electrophysiological and behavioral evidence supports a view of POR function that aligns with our anatomical evidence. Briefly, the POR integrates object and feature information from the PER with spatial information from the retrosplenial, posterior parietal, and secondary visual cortices and the pulvinar and uses this information to represent specific environmental contexts, including the spatial arrangement of objects and features within each context. In addition to maintaining a representation of the current context, the POR plays an attentional role by continually monitoring the context for changes and updating the context representation when changes occur. This context representation is accessible to other regions for cognitive processes, including binding life events with context to form episodic memories, guiding context-relevant behavior, and recognizing objects within scenes and contexts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23677?af=R">Towards an Understanding of the Dentate Gyrus Hilus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>For many years, the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) was a mystery because anatomical data suggested a bewildering array of cells without clear organization. Moreover, some of the anatomical information led to more questions than answers. For example, it had been identified that one of the major cell types in the hilus, the mossy cell, innervates granule cells (GCs). However, mossy cells also targeted local GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, it was not yet clear if mossy cells were glutamatergic or GABAergic. This led to many debates about the role of mossy cells. However, it was clear that hilar neurons, including mossy cells, were likely to have very important functions because they provided strong input to GCs. Hilar neurons also attracted attention in epilepsy because pathological studies showed that hilar neurons were often lost, but GCs remained. Vulnerability of hilar neurons also occurred after traumatic brain injury and ischemia. These observations fueled an interest to understand hilar neurons and protect them, an interest that continues to this day. This article provides a historical and personal perspective into the ways that I sought to contribute to resolving some of the debates and moving the field forward. Despite several technical challenges the outcomes of the studies have been worth the effort with some surprising findings along the way. Given the growing interest in the hilus, and the advent of multiple techniques to selectively manipulate hilar neurons, there is a great opportunity for future research.</p>

                In pancreatic cancer, significant alterations occur in the local nervous system, including axonogenesis, neural remodeling, perineural invasion, and perineural neuritis. Pancreatic cancer can impact the central nervous system (CNS) through cancer cell-intrinsic factors or systemic factors, particularly in the context of cancer cachexia. These peripheral and central neuropathic changes exert substantial influence on cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is common in pancreatic cancer, causing peripheral nerve damage and cognitive dysfunction. Targeting the crosstalk between pancreatic cancer and the nervous system, either peripherally or centrally, holds promise in cancer treatment, pain relief, and improved quality of life. Here, we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms behind these neuropathic changes in pancreatic cancer and discuss potential intervention strategies.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative technology with the potential to transform digital experiences, particularly in relation to mental health concerns such as anxiety. Therefore, this study investigates the potential of a newly designed VR experience to alleviate anxiety by focusing on the mediating role of VR-induced immersion. Methods: The study included 419 individuals aged 10 to 80 years, with 29 aged 10&amp;amp;ndash;15 years and 390 above 15 years, who were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups on the basis of project-defined criteria, including a random allocation to the wheelchair-using group. Both groups used goggles for virtual space navigation, with the experimental group employing a multijoint arm mounted on an aluminum frame and special algorithms to navigate without controllers. We assessed immersion in VR using the Polish adaptation of the Immersion Questionnaire and anxiety using the Polish adaptations of the State&amp;amp;ndash;Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X1) and its early adolescent version, the State&amp;amp;ndash;Trait Anxiety Inventory&amp;amp;ndash;Children (STAI-C1). Results and Conclusions: The results indicate that individuals using the new VR device demonstrated increased immersion and reduced post-test anxiety levels, highlighting the significance of immersion in enhancing positive affect, mitigating the negative effects of VR technology, and offering insights for future development and refinement of VR solutions.</p>

	<p>Introduction. In women, smoking during pregnancy and the postpartum period has important consequences for maternal and infant health, and interventions to assist smoking cessation during this period are essential. Although smoking has been associated with the presence of mental health problems, few studies addressing the factors associated with perinatal smoking have examined the role of stress. The aim of this review was to identify the relationships between the presence of stress and smoking during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Method. A literature search of the PsycInfo, Pubmed and Web of Science databases was carried out to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and June 2024. A total of 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for review. Results. Twelve of the studies analysed the relationship between stress and smoking during pregnancy, two studies involved the postpartum period, and one study included both periods. Diverse instruments were used to assess stress, although the PSS-14 was the most commonly used. Eleven of the studies found a relationship between stress and smoking in the perinatal period, with stress being a predictor of smoking. Conclusions. The findings highlight the need to consider stress management when developing effective interventions to help women quit smoking during pregnancy and maintain abstinence in the postpartum period.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Previous research indicates that Ginkgo biloba extract (Gbe) may contribute to slowing down the progression of dementia. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association between Gbe prescriptions and the progression of dementia severity in a real-world setting. Methods: This study was conducted using data from patients with an initial diagnosis of mild or moderate dementia between January 2005 and December 2022 from the IQVIA&amp;amp;trade; Disease Analyzer database. The follow-up period was up to 10 years. The association between Gbe prescription and dementia severity progression was assessed by Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier analysis and Cox regression, with adjustments made for age, sex, health insurance status, physician specialty, co-prescription of antidementia drugs, and co-diagnoses. Results: A total of 4765 patients were included, of whom 177 were prescribed Gbe. The cumulative incidence of dementia severity progression was 12.7% for patients with Gbe prescription and 22.1% for those without. Gbe prescription was associated with a significantly decreased risk of dementia severity progression (hazard ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27&amp;amp;ndash;0.95), both in patients with mild (HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22&amp;amp;ndash;0.90) and moderate dementia (HR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.06&amp;amp;ndash;0.98). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that Gbe prescription is associated with a reduced risk of dementia severity progression in a real-world setting.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Cognitive dysfunctions are still very common in the chronic phase of stroke when patients are discharged from neurorehabilitation centers. Even individuals who appear to have made a full clinical recovery may exhibit new deficiencies at home. Here, we present evidence of a novel kind of therapy at home aimed at contrasting the heterogenic evolution of stroke patients using a multidomain cognitive approach. Methods: Eighteen ischemic stroke patients were assessed in a within-subject longitudinal design (age 62.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.1 years; eight men). Patients underwent the Tele-NeuroRehabilitation (TNR) multidomain cognitive training treatment using the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS) five times a week for 1 h sessions for four consecutive weeks. The protocol included the stimulation of specific cognitive functions, such as logical skills, praxis skills, attention, executive functions, memory, space time orientation and perception, and speech therapy. To determine neuropsychological changes, patients were evaluated before the sessions (T0), at the end of the sessions (T1), and after six months (T2). Results: The multidomain cognitive training induced a significant improvement in the working memory and language abilities as well as depression symptoms and alleviated caregiver burden. Most of this cognitive enhancement persisted after six months (T2), with the exception of depression symptoms. Otherwise, a significant decline in attention abilities was reported, thus demonstrating a lack of effect in this function. Conclusions: Our results suggest that multidomain cognitive TNR is a suitable protocol for reducing some cognitive and behavioral alterations in patients with strokes, with a beneficial impact also on the caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden distress management. Further RCTs are warranted to validate this new kind of approach.</p>

	<p>Background: Cerebrovascular diseases (CVAs) have several risk factors that are categorized as modifiable and nonmodifiable. Periodontal diseases (PD) have a modifiable role in causing CVA, where several studies suggested direct or indirect correlations with systemic diseases. This study aims to summarize, evaluate and analyze all the evidence available in literature, to reach a better understanding of the relation between periodontitis, gingivitis, tooth loss and CVA. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for all meta-analyses assessing the effect of PD on CVA in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for umbrella reviews in March 2024. Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used for quality assessment. Pooled analysis was performed to assess the effect of periodontitis, gingivitis and tooth loss on CVA, depending on the availability of data using Review Manager Version 5.2.11. Results: Seven of the identified meta-analyses were of high quality, and they were distributed in different countries. Periodontitis was generally associated with a significant increase in CVA risk (OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.70, 3.17, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001 and RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.15&amp;amp;ndash;1.29, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001), same as tooth loss, but to a lower degree (0.78). However, the effect of gingivitis was insignificant in terms of CVA (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.56, p = 0.0008). Conclusions: This study confirms the effect of periodontitis and tooth loss on CVA, disregarding any significant role for gingivitis. The relation reached favors the suggested role of some inflammatory changes in the pathogenic pathway leading to atherosclerotic changes.</p>

<p>In mouse permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) increased cerebral blood flow at peripheral area (dotted circle) and diminished early ischemic lesion in MRI DWI and final infarct volume in TTC staining compared with Sham procedure, However, hypothermia showed only marginal effect. RIC might be more promising strategy than hypothermia for brain protection against ischemic insult.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has attracted considerable attention as a brain protection strategy, although its impact remains unclear. Hypothermia is the most effective strategy in experimental transient cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we compared the efficacy of RIC, hypothermia, and no treatment on cerebral ischemia. We assessed the effects of both permanent and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min in male mice. Brain hemodynamics were monitored during and after the procedure via 2D color-coded ultrasound imaging. Ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), early breakdown of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), expression levels of inflammatory cytokines by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and neurological signs and infarct volume were examined. In permanent MCAO, RIC increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the peri-infarct area, reduced early lesions on MRI–DWI, decreased early MAP2 breakdown, and lowered infarct volume compared with no treatment. However, hypothermia only showed a protective effect against neurological signs. In contrast, in transient MCAO, both RIC and hypothermia reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, mitigated MAP2 breakdown, and reduced infarct volume to a similar extent compared with no treatment. In conclusion, although RIC proved to be more effective than hypothermia in permanent MCAO, the protective effects of RIC and hypothermia were comparable in transient cerebral ischemia. Thus, RIC could be a promising strategy for brain protection against cerebral ischemia.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Remote identification of individuals with severe hyposmia may enable scalable recruitment of participants with underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation. We evaluated the performance of a staged screening paradigm using remote smell testing to enrich for abnormal dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (DAT-SPECT) and alpha-synuclein aggregation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) recruited participants for the prodromal cohort who were 60-years and older without a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Participants were invited to complete a University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) independently through an online portal. Hyposmic participants were invited to complete DAT-SPECT, which determined eligibility for enrollment in longitudinal assessments and further biomarker evaluation including cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (aSynSAA).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As of January 29, 2024, 49,843 participants were sent an UPSIT and 31,293 (63%) completed it. Of UPSIT completers, 8,301 (27%) scored &lt;15th percentile. Of 1,546 who completed DAT-SPECT, 1,060 (69%) had DAT-SPECT binding &lt;100% expected for age and sex. Participants with an UPSIT &lt;10th percentile (n = 1,221) had greater likelihood of low DAT-SPECT binding compared to participants with an UPSIT in the 10th to 15th percentile (odds ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85–4.91). Overall, 55% (198/363) of cases with UPSIT &lt;15th percentile and DAT-SPECT &lt;100% had positive aSynSAA, which increased to 70% (182/260) when selecting for more severe hyposmia (UPSIT &lt;10th percentile).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Remote screening for hyposmia and reduced DAT-SPECT binding identifies participants with a high proportion positive aSynSAA. Longitudinal data will be essential to define progression patterns in these individuals to ultimately inform recruitment into disease modification clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>As requested by the editors of this special issue of Hippocampus on Scientific Histories of Hippocampal Research, this review provides a detailed personal perspective and historical background on the research involved in a number of findings. The review includes description of the development of the water maze and its use in providing evidence to support the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory function. The review also describes how the water maze was then used in further work to support the proposal that NMDA-dependent synaptic modification in the hippocampus mediates the encoding of new spatial memories. This personal history gives a perspective on the convergence of different streams of physiological, biochemical, theoretical and behavioral research that resulted in these findings on hippocampal function.</p>

                Zhou et al. reveal that microtopography regulates nuclear tension, driving site-specific chromatin accessibility and lineage-specific gene expression. Aligned substrates open neurogenic, myogenic, and tenogenic genes, while random substrates enhance osteogenic and chondrogenic gene accessibility. This study offers a novel framework for understanding how microtopographic cues shape stem cell fate.

	<p>Background/Objectives: &amp;amp;alpha;-Synuclein (&amp;amp;alpha;-syn) protein is a major pathological agent of familial Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and its levels and aggregations determine neurotoxicity in PD pathogenesis. Although the pathophysiological functions of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn have been extensively studied, its biological functions remain elusive, and there are reports of wild-type (WT) &amp;amp;alpha;-syn and two missense mutations of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn (A30P and A53T) inducing protective neuritogenesis through neurite outgrowth. However, the function of another &amp;amp;alpha;-syn mutation, E46K, has not been fully elucidated. Thus, we compared the effect of E46K &amp;amp;alpha;-syn with other types to identify the mechanisms underlying neurite outgrowth. Methods: We transfected SK-N-SH cells with WT and mutant (A53T and E46K) &amp;amp;alpha;-syn to investigate the effects of their overexpression on neurite outgrowth. Then, we compared the differential effects of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn on neurite outgrowth using microscopic analysis, including confocal microscopy. We also analyzed the differential regulation of cell division control 42 effector protein 2 (Cdc42EP2) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Finally, to confirm the implication of neurite outgrowth, we knocked down Cdc42EP2 using small interfering RNA. Results: Unlike WT and A53T &amp;amp;alpha;-syn, E46K &amp;amp;alpha;-syn failed to promote neurite outgrowth by not inducing Cdc42EP2 and subsequent &amp;amp;beta;III-tubulin expression. Cdc42EP2 knockdown impaired neurite outgrowth in WT and A53T &amp;amp;alpha;-syn transfectants. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that WT and mutant &amp;amp;alpha;-syn are linked to Cdc42EP2 production in neuritogenesis, implying &amp;amp;alpha;-syn involvement in the physiological function of axon growth and synapse formation. Thus, &amp;amp;alpha;-syn may be a potential therapeutic target for PD.</p>

	<p>Background: Motor imagery includes visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery, which are two strategies that exist for mental rotation and are currently widely studied. However, different mental rotation tests can lead to different strategic performances. There are also many research results where two different strategies appear simultaneously under the same task. Previous studies on the comparative brain mechanisms of kinesthetic imagery and visual imagery have not adopted consistent stimulus images or mature mental rotation paradigms, making it difficult to effectively compare these types of imagery. Methods: In this study, we utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the brain activation of sixty-seven young right-handed participants with different strategy preferences during hand lateral judgment tasks (HLJT). Results: The results showed that the accuracy of the kinesthetic imagery group was significantly higher than that of the visual imagery group, and the reaction time of the kinesthetic imagery group was significantly shorter than that of the visual imagery group. The areas significantly activated in the kinesthetic imagery group were wider than those in the visual imagery group, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9, 46), premotor cortex (BA6), supplementary motor area (SMA), primary motor cortex (BA4), and parietal cortex (BA7, 40). It is worth noting that the activation levels in the frontal eye fields (BA8), primary somatosensory cortex (BA1, 2, 3), primary motor cortex (BA4), and parietal cortex (BA40) of the kinesthetic imagery group were significantly higher than those in the visual imagery group. Conclusion: Therefore, we speculate that kinesthetic imagery has more advantages than visual imagery in the mental rotation of egocentric transformations.</p>

	<p>Background: Prolonged confinement in enclosed environments has raised concerns about its effects on both physical and mental health. Although increased rates of depression or anxiety during COVID-19 lockdowns have been reported, the effects of short-term restrictions on social activities and physical on brain function and structure remain poorly known. Methods: This study explored longitudinal changes in brain gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) immediately after and four months following a short-term lockdown in comparison to pre-lockdown conditions. MRI data were collected from 20 participants before the lockdown, from 29 participants (14 original, 15 new) two months post-lockdown, and from 27 out of the 29 participants four months post-lifting of the lockdown. Results: Results showed significant GMV reductions in the right gyrus rectus and cuneus post-lockdown, with further reductions observed four months after lifting the restrictions, affecting additional brain regions. Longitudinal FC trajectories revealed decreased connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and sensorimotor/attention networks post-lockdown, and recovery after four months post-lifting of the lockdown. Conclusions: The observed plasticity in brain FC indicates substantial recovery potential with the potential long-term effect of structural changes. Our findings offer insights into the effects of isolation on the human brain, potentially informing rehabilitation mechanisms and interventions for individuals in similar conditions.</p>

                VAPB is an adaptor protein known for its role as an anchor for other proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum. A mutant form of VAPB has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the underlying mechanisms resulting from this defect are studied by researchers in this area to uncover its implication in the disease. Here we have characterized six VAPB commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                The past decade has been marked by increased discussions on sustainability; some of the prominent accelerators being, mounting natural disasters, vocal climate activism, and the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interest has crossed over from deliberations in global summits to grassroots-level communication. Additionally, the literature points to the increasing usage of social media in the communication of sustainability with an increase of interest in this area among Asian researchers. This paper aims to understand the direction of sustainability communication and the usage of social media in the communication of sustainability, in the last decade (2013-2023), from an Asian perspective – researchers and respondents from Asia. A comprehensive search of the literature by Asian researchers on sustainability communication on social media in the past decade was conducted using the Scopus database. The studies were clustered around common directions and terminologies, basis an in-depth content analysis. Based on the analysis, the study presents prominent themes and the current direction of research in sustainability communication on social media. The studies analyzed in the scoping review affirm that sustainability communication on social media in Asia has substantial potential to improve the environmental awareness of the public and promote actual pro-environmental behavior both in terms of green purchase as well as conservation behavior. The review provides a holistic view of the recent trends and possible future directions for sustainability communication on social media.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 55.4% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 19.3% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.

                Background Death due to hanging is commonly seen. Sometime the ligature mark will be very prominent and in some cases it might not. In those cases, the post-mortem examination with its gross morphological findings and histopathological analysis, becomes significantly important. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the patterns of epidemiological, gross morphological, and histopathological features in hanging cases. Methods The study was conducted on 46 cases of hanging. Their sociodemographic features were collected. Gross morphological analysis of the ligature mark and various measurements were taken. Later tissue from the ligature mark was sent for histopathological analysis. Statistical analysis was performed on the collected parameters. Results Significant male preponderance was observed in hanging cases. The maximum number of cases of hanging were observed in the fourth decade of life. Daily wage workers were the most significantly affected population. Depression was cited as the cause of suicide in most cases. Carotid intimal tears and injuries to bony and cartilaginous structures were present in smaller numbers. Vital reaction was observed in all 46 cases. Classification of fwound vitality showed a correlation to known time since injury. Conclusion The results of the present study showed that socio-demographic factors play a significant role in the circumstances leading to suicidal deaths. Therefore, in reducing the burden of suicidal deaths, these factors must be addressed. To identify the cause of death as hanging analysis of various gross features and histopathology are very important and should be conducted carefully.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96312">A multisite validation of brain white matter pathways of resilience to chronic back pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic back pain (CBP) is a global health concern with significant societal and economic burden. While various predictors of back pain chronicity have been proposed, including demographic and psychosocial factors, neuroimaging studies have pointed to brain characteristics as predictors of CBP. However, large-scale, multisite validation of these predictors is currently lacking. In two independent longitudinal studies, we examined white matter diffusion imaging data and pain characteristics in patients with subacute back pain (SBP) over 6- and 12-month periods. Diffusion data from individuals with CBP and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed for comparison. Whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics analyses revealed that a cluster in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) tract had larger fractional anisotropy (FA) values in patients who recovered (SBPr) compared to those with persistent pain (SBPp), and predicted changes in pain severity. The SLF FA values accurately classified patients at baseline and follow-up in a third publicly available dataset (Area under the Receiver Operating Curve ~0.70). Notably, patients who recovered had FA values larger than those of HC suggesting a potential role of SLF integrity in resilience to CBP. Structural connectivity-based models also classified SBPp and SBPr patients from the three data sets (validation accuracy 67%). Our results validate the right SLF <i>as a robust predictor of CBP development, with potential for clinical translation</i>. Cognitive and behavioral processes dependent on the right SLF, such as proprioception and visuospatial attention, should be analyzed in subacute stages as they could prove important for back pain chronicity.

This study investigates SARS-CoV-2 features as it evolved to evaluate its infectivity. We examined viral sequences and identified the polarity of amino acids in the receptor binding motif (RBM) region. We detected an increased frequency of amino acid substitutions to lysine (K) and arginine (R) in variants of concern (VOCs). As the virus evolved to Omicron, commonly occurring mutations became fixed components of the new viral sequence. Furthermore, at specific positions of VOCs, only one type of amino acid substitution and a notable absence of mutations at D467 were detected. We found that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages to the ACE2 receptor was impacted by amino acid substitutions. Based on our discoveries, we developed APESS, an evaluation model evaluating infectivity from biochemical and mutational properties. In silico evaluation using real-world sequences and in vitro viral entry assays validated the accuracy of APESS and our discoveries. Using Machine Learning, we predicted mutations that had the potential to become more prominent. We created AIVE, a web-based system, accessible at <a href="https://ai-ve.org">https://ai-ve.org</a> to provide infectivity measurements of mutations entered by users. Ultimately, we established a clear link between specific viral properties and increased infectivity, enhancing our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and enabling more accurate predictions of the virus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96344">The satiety hormone cholecystokinin gates reproduction in fish by controlling gonadotropin secretion</a></h4>

              
                Life histories of oviparous species dictate high metabolic investment in the process of gonadal development leading to ovulation. In vertebrates, these two distinct processes are controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), respectively. While it was suggested that a common secretagogue, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), oversees both functions, the generation of loss-of-function fish challenged this view. Here, we reveal that the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is the primary regulator of this axis in zebrafish. We found that FSH cells express a CCK receptor, and our findings demonstrate that mutating this receptor results in a severe hindrance to ovarian development. Additionally, it causes a complete shutdown of both gonadotropins secretion. Using in-vivo and ex-vivo calcium imaging of gonadotrophs, we show that GnRH predominantly activates LH cells, whereas FSH cells respond to CCK stimulation, designating CCK as the bona fide FSH secretagogue. These findings indicate that the control of gametogenesis in fish was placed under different neural circuits, that are gated by CCK.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89638">Improving PD-1 blockade plus chemotherapy for complete remission of lung cancer by nanoPDLIM2</a></h4>

              
                Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate <i>PDLIM2</i> genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101248">Gasdermin D-mediated neutrophil pyroptosis drives inflammation in psoriasis</a></h4>

              
                Psoriasis is a multifactorial immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Its pathogenesis involves abnormal accumulation of neutrophils and T-cell-related abnormalities. Pyroptosis is a type of regulated cell death associated with innate immunity, but its role in psoriasis is unclear. In this study, we found that <i>gasdermin D (GSDMD</i>) is higher in human psoriatic skin than that in normal skin, and in imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse skin, the expression of <i>Gsdmd</i> was most significantly altered in neutrophils and <i>Il1b</i> was also mainly expressed in neutrophils. Immunohistochemical staining of serial sections of skin lesions from psoriasis patients and healthy control also showed that GSDMD expression is higher in psoriasis lesion, especially in neutrophils. <i>Gsdmd</i> deficiency mitigates psoriasis-like inflammation in mice. GSDMD in neutrophils contributes to psoriasis-like inflammation, while <i>Gsdmd</i> depletion in neutrophils attenuates the development of skin inflammation in psoriasis and reduces the release of the inflammatory cytokines. We found that neutrophil pyroptosis is involved in and contributes to psoriasis inflammation, which provides new insights into the treatment of psoriasis by targeting neutrophil pyroptosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93749">Bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding</a></h4>

              
                Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely, experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain. Here, we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release (<i>SR</i>) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high <i>SR</i> synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100205">Constitutively active receptor ADGRA3 signaling induces adipose thermogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The induction of adipose thermogenesis plays a critical role in maintaining body temperature and improving metabolic homeostasis to combat obesity. β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) is widely recognized as a canonical β-adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Nonetheless, the limited expression of β3-AR in human adipocytes restricts its clinical application. The objective of this study was to identify a GPCR that is highly expressed in human adipocytes and to explore its potential involvement in adipose thermogenesis. Our research findings have demonstrated that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3), an orphan GPCR, plays a significant role in adipose thermogenesis through its constitutively active effects. ADGRA3 exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes and mouse brown fat. Furthermore, the knockdown of <i>Adgra3</i> resulted in an exacerbated obese phenotype and a reduction in the expression of thermogenic markers in mice. Conversely, <i>Adgra3</i> overexpression activated the adipose thermogenic program and improved metabolic homeostasis in mice without exogenous ligand. We found that ADGRA3 facilitates the biogenesis of beige human or mouse adipocytes in vitro. Moreover, hesperetin was identified as a potential agonist of ADGRA3, capable of inducing adipocyte browning and ameliorating insulin resistance in mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the overexpression of constitutively active ADGRA3 or the activation of ADGRA3 by hesperetin can induce adipocyte browning by Gs-PKA-CREB axis. These findings indicate that the utilization of hesperetin and the selective overexpression of ADGRA3 in adipose tissue could serve as promising therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93646">CaBP1 and 2 enable sustained CaV1.3 calcium currents and synaptic transmission in inner hair cells</a></h4>

              
                To encode continuous sound stimuli, the inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapses utilize calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs), which reduce the inactivation of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 calcium channels. Mutations in the <i>CABP2</i> gene underlie non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss DFNB93. Besides CaBP2, the structurally related CaBP1 is highly abundant in the IHCs. Here, we investigated how the two CaBPs cooperatively regulate IHC synaptic function. In <i>Cabp1/2</i> double-knockout mice, we find strongly enhanced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation, slowed recovery from inactivation and impaired sustained exocytosis. Already mild IHC activation further reduces the availability of channels to trigger synaptic transmission and may effectively silence synapses. Spontaneous and sound-evoked responses of spiral ganglion neurons in vivo are strikingly reduced and strongly depend on stimulation rates. Transgenic expression of CaBP2 leads to substantial recovery of IHC synaptic function and hearing sensitivity. We conclude that CaBP1 and 2 act together to suppress voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in order to support sufficient rate of exocytosis and enable fast, temporally precise and indefatigable sound encoding.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural oscillations are fundamental for brain function and govern various cognitive processes. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging advances offer the opportunity to study frequency-specific properties of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations at multiple frequency bands. However, most have focused on spontaneous brain activity in the resting state, leaving a gap in direct evidence regarding the specific activations of cognitive tasks across different frequency bands. We aim to address this gap by exploring the role of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations across multiple frequency bands in cognitive processes. We used task-functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 339 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project to map the activation patterns of performing seven cognitive tasks at multiple frequency bands (ie slow-1 to slow-6). Our findings revealed that different frequency bands are associated with distinct task-activation patterns. Specifically, slow-1/2/3 oscillations primarily contribute to local sensory information processing, while slow-4 is crucial for various fundamental cognitive functions. Slow-5 is involved in cognitive processes that require greater memory load, integrated cognitive processing, and attention maintenance. This underscores the importance of analyzing a broad frequency range to capture the full spectrum of cognitive function, highlighting the diverse roles of different frequency bands in brain activity, shedding light on the underlying mechanism of brain–behavior associations.</span>

Behaviorally, Menks et al. (2024) showed that grammaticality judgment task performance increased steadily from 8 to 15.4 yr, after which age had no further effect. We show in the current study that this age-related grammaticality judgment task performance was negatively related to cortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness in many clusters throughout the brain. Hippocampal volume was positively related to age-related grammaticality judgment task performance and L2 (English) vocabulary knowledge. Furthermore, we found that grammaticality judgment task performance, L2 grammar proficiency, and L2 vocabulary knowledge were positively related to gray matter maturation within parietal regions, overlapping with the functional MRI clusters that were reported previously in Menks et al.

We propose that this overlap in functional and structural results indicates that brain maturation in parietal regions plays an important role in second language learning.</span>

We used functional magnetic resonance-based multivariate pattern analysis to identify such regions. Human participants (20 females, 12 males) watched videos of successful and failed attempts of actions with different goals involving two different object types. We found that the bilateral anterior inferior parietal lobe and the right ventral premotor cortex distinguished between object-specific action goals regardless of outcomes.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The cerebral cortex is critical for advanced cognitive functions and relies on a vast network of neurons to carry out its highly intricate neural tasks. Generating cortical neurons in accurate numbers hinges on cell signaling orchestrated by primary cilia to coordinate the proliferation and differentiation of cortical stem cells. While recent research has shed light on multiple ciliary roles in corticogenesis, specific mechanisms downstream of cilia signaling remain largely unexplored. We previously showed that an excess of early-born cortical neurons in mice mutant for the ciliary gene <span style="font-style:italic;">Inpp5e</span> was rescued by re-introducing Gli3 repressor. By comparing expression profiles between <span style="font-style:italic;">Inpp5e</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Gli3</span> mutants, we here identified novel Gli3 target genes. This approach highlighted the transcription factor gene <span style="font-style:italic;">Sall3</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Pappalysin1</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Pappa</span>), a metalloproteinase involved in IGF signaling, as upregulated genes in both mutants. Further examination revealed that Gli3 directly binds to <span style="font-style:italic;">Sall3</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Pappa</span> enhancers and suppresses their activity in the dorsal telencephalon. Collectively, our analyses provide important mechanistic insights into how primary cilia govern the behavior of neural stem cells, ultimately ensuring the production of adequate numbers of neurons during corticogenesis.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Attention is a complex process involving various components such as alerting, orienting, and resolving conflicts. These components have been widely examined using the Attention Network Test (ANT), which has also been used to explore attentional decline associated with aging. However, discrepancies exist in the literature regarding which specific aspects of attention are most impacted by aging. These inconsistencies could be due to methodological issues such as group comparisons that may exaggerate differences between groups while flattening subtle variations within groups. Methods: To address this issue, we administered the ANT to 60 healthy participants aged between 62 and 90 years. Using a multivariate regression analysis, we examined whether increasing age was associated with changes in alerting, orienting, and conflict resolution, while controlling for overall performance in terms of both reaction times and accuracy. Results: The results showed a general and age-insensitive decline in two of the three attentional components: the alerting effect, which was abolished, and a large conflict effect, which was present regardless of age. In contrast, the orienting of spatial attention was found to linearly increase with increasing age. More focused analyses revealed that the ability to shift attention from the central (initial) to the peripheral (target) location slowed down as a function of age. Conclusions: These results suggest that aging is associated with a greater difficulty in disengaging endogenous attention from the central, uninformative cue to direct attention on task-relevant peripheral targets.</p>

	<p>Background: Anterior choroidal artery (AChoA) aneurysms pose a challenge for both endovascular and clipping procedures. The eloquent territory supplied by the parent vessel has limited collateralization and its compromise can lead to significant morbidity. This study aims to analyze the clinical outcomes and procedure-related complications of clipping and endovascular treatment of AChoA aneurysms to aid physician decision making. Methods: Thirty-two ruptured and unruptured AChoA aneurysms that underwent catheter angiography at a single neurovascular center between January 2000 and December 2023 were included. Either conservative management, clipping, and/or endovascular treatment were performed. Clinical outcomes and complications were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Twenty-four endovascular treatments and seven clipping procedures were included. Of the total 24 endovascular procedures, 46% were primary coiling, 25% were balloon-assisted coiling, 13% were flow diverting stent, 8% were combined balloon-assisted coiling and flow diverting stent, and 8% were combined balloon-assisted and stent-assisted coiling. There was no procedure-related mortality in both groups. No intra- or post-procedural ruptures/re-ruptures occurred during follow-up in both endovascular and clipping cohorts. AChoA territory infarcts occurred in 4% of the endovascular and 29% of the clipping cohorts. Other thromboembolic complications occurred in 4% of the endovascular cohort. The recurrence rate requiring retreatment was 12.5% for the endovascular and 43% for the clipping cohort. A favorable clinical outcome (mRS &amp;amp;le; 2) was 78% for the endovascular cohort and 67% for the clipping cohort. Conclusions: Endovascular and clipping outcomes align with prior studies, with endovascular showing a favorable safety profile. Both approaches are viable, though they present distinct risks and advantages.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This research investigates brain connectivity patterns in reaction to social and non-social stimuli within a virtual reality environment, emphasizing their impact on cognitive functions, specifically working memory. Methods: Employing the LEiDA framework with EEG data from 47 participants, I examined dynamic brain network states elicited by social avatars compared to non-social stick cues during a VR memory task. Through the integration of LEiDA with deep learning and graph theory analyses, unique connectivity patterns associated with cue type were discerned, underscoring the substantial influence of social cues on cognitive processes. LEiDA, conventionally utilized with fMRI, was creatively employed in EEG to detect swift alterations in brain network states, offering insights into cognitive processing dynamics. Results: The findings indicate distinct neural states for social and non-social cues; notably, social cues correlated with a unique brain state characterized by increased connectivity within self-referential and memory-processing networks, implying greater cognitive engagement. Moreover, deep learning attained approximately 99% accuracy in differentiating cue contexts, highlighting the efficacy of prominent eigenvectors from LEiDA in EEG analysis. Analysis of graph theory also uncovered structural network disparities, signifying enhanced integration in contexts involving social cues. Conclusions: This multi-method approach elucidates the dynamic influence of social cues on brain connectivity and cognition, establishing a basis for VR-based cognitive rehabilitation and immersive learning, wherein social signals may significantly enhance cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Background: The human sensorimotor system can naturally synchronize with environmental rhythms, such as light pulses or sound beats. Several studies showed that different styles and tempos of music, or other rhythmic stimuli, have an impact on physiological rhythms, including electrocortical brain activity, heart rate, and motor coordination. Such synchronization, also known as the &amp;amp;ldquo;entrainment effect&amp;amp;rdquo;, has been identified as a crucial mechanism impacting cognitive, motor, and affective functioning. Objectives: This review examines theoretical and empirical contributions to the literature on entrainment, with a particular focus on the physiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its role in cognitive, motor, and affective functions. We also address the inconsistent terminology used in the literature and evaluate the range of measurement approaches used to assess entrainment phenomena. Finally, we propose a definition of &amp;amp;ldquo;physiological entrainment&amp;amp;rdquo; that emphasizes its role as a fundamental mechanism that encompasses rhythmic interactions between the body and its environment, to support information processing across bodily systems and to sustain adaptive motor responses. Methods: We reviewed the recent literature through the lens of the &amp;amp;ldquo;embodied cognition&amp;amp;rdquo; framework, offering a unified perspective on the phenomenon of physiological entrainment. Results: Evidence from the current literature suggests that physiological entrainment produces measurable effects, especially on neural oscillations, heart rate variability, and motor synchronization. Eventually, such physiological changes can impact cognitive processing, affective functioning, and motor coordination. Conclusions: Physiological entrainment emerges as a fundamental mechanism underlying the mind&amp;amp;ndash;body connection. Entrainment-based interventions may be used to promote well-being by enhancing cognitive, motor, and affective functions, suggesting potential rehabilitative approaches to enhancing mental health.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive functions are a crucial part of daily living, especially for adults with Down syndrome (DS) who have a high likelihood of developing Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease in adulthood. In addition, adults with DS move slower and are not meeting the standard aerobic activity guidelines each week. The aim of this study was to examine if Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) would improve cognitive planning as measured by the Tower of London (TOL), set switching as measured by the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and spatial memory as measured by the Corsi Block Test in adults with DS as compared to self-paced cycling. Methods: Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of two interventions over eight weeks. (1) Thirteen older adults with DS completed the ACT intervention, which is stationary cycling with the assistance of a motor to maintain a cadence at least 35% greater than voluntary cycling. (2) Eleven older adults with DS completed voluntary cycling (VC). Results: Our results showed that cognitive planning as measured by total correct score in the TOL showed improvement for both ACT and VC after 8 weeks of exercise, F(1, 22) = 6.22, p = 0.021. There were no significant differences for spatial memory or set switching. Conclusions: We concluded that cycling exercise has a positive impact on cognitive function, especially problem solving in older adults with DS. Our results are discussed with respect to upregulation of neurotrophic factors that increase functioning in the prefrontal cortex that accompanies exercise and leads to improvements in cognitive planning which is essential to many activities of daily living and quality of life for older adults with DS.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The auditory middle-latency responses (AMLRs) assess central sensory processing beyond the brainstem and serve as a measure of sensory gating. They have clinical relevance in the diagnosis of neurological conditions. In this study, magnitude and habituation of the AMLRs were tested for sensitivity and specificity in classifying dizzy patients with vestibular migraine (VM) and post-concussive syndrome. Methods: Twenty-three healthy individuals, 12 concussion and 26 VM patients were recruited. AMLR were recorded performing five blocks of 200 binaural click-stimulations at 60 dB sensation level with a repetition rate of 6.1 Hz. Reduction in P0, Na and Pa magnitudes between blocks was measured. Group classifications were performed through logistic and multiple regression. Results: Among healthy subjects, a consistent P0 and Na habituation can be observed. Concussed subjects show control-like Na habituation, despite a lower magnitude, while P0 habituation was negligible. VM patients showed poor habituation for all waves. Regression analyses suggest that P0 and Na better distinguish healthy subjects from neurological patients, whereas Pa best distinguishes concussion from VM patients. Conclusions: The results support that AMLR habituation can contribute to unraveling different mechanisms of dizziness due to concussion compared to VM, providing insights that can complement routine diagnostic assessments.</p>

                Background The approach to estimating mandibular age has been widely used, although it has shown age estimation disparities in diverse populations, including Indians. Objective Our goal was to test the Demirjian 8-teeth approach utilizing orthopantomogram to estimate age reliably after incorporating the third molar. We also used Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations to estimate age estimation accuracy in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods The retrospective study included 196 people. Individuals were 8–24 years old. The left mandibular teeth were staged using an orthopantomographs utilizing the Demirjian 8-teeth approach. The Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression models determined dental age, and statistical methods compared dental age to chronological age. Results The gender breakdown was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. Gender did not significantly affect chronological mean age or estimated mean age (13.39±3.77 vs. 13.10±3.51, p = 0.583; 11.75±2.92 vs. 11.58±2.70, p = 0.674). Statistically substantial differences in chronological and estimated mean ages between male and female individuals (p<0.001). Out of the total participants, 31.6% had a difference in age of ±1 year, 30.6% had a difference of 1-2 years, and 37.8% had a difference of more than 2 years. Compared to chronological and estimated ages, these variations in age between males and females were not statistically significant (p=0.557). Conclusions The findings of this study support the use of Demirjian’s 8-teeth approach in the Saudi population residing in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, employing Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations.

                Abstract Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods A comprehensive scoping review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies from 2017 to 2024. Primary, English-language clinical trial involving pediatric patients were included without restrictions on surgical procedure, or outcomes. Data extraction was focused on sample sizes, PCL types, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 11 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies indicated metabolic benefits, with 7 out of 11 showing stabilized blood glucose and reduced hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, 5 studies associated PCL with reduced preoperative anxiety, agitation, and discomfort, including thirst and hunger. For stomach content, 5 studies showed PCL reduced gastric residual volume and improved pH. Postoperative findings were mixed: 4 studies found no significant difference in nausea and vomiting, while 2 suggested benefits. Length of hospital stay from 3 studies showed no clinical difference results. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery shows potential to stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and improve recovery. However, the evidence regarding outcomes such as length of hospital stay and postoperative complications remains inconsistent, indicating the need for further investigation.

                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                <p>by Hyeontae Jo, Sung Woong Cho, Hyung Ju Hwang</p>

Differential equations are pivotal in modeling and understanding the dynamics of various systems, as they offer insights into their future states through parameter estimation fitted to time series data. In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). RCS data showed that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of RCS data over time, Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, and Bayesian-based methods, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method called Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD) that provides accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimizes the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, thereby demonstrating the ability of the proposed method in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions over a normal distribution. These results address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data. Therefore, EPD marks a significant advancement in accurately modeling systems with RCS data, realizing a deeper understanding of system dynamics and parameter variability.

                <p>by Xin-Yu Zhang, Lan-Lan Yu, Wei-Yi Wang, Gui-Quan Sun, Jian-Cheng Lv, Tao Zhou, Quan-Hui Liu</p>

Monitoring the spread of infectious disease is essential to design and adjust the interventions timely for the prevention of the epidemic outbreak and safeguarding the public health. The governments have generally adopted the incidence-based statistical method to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> and evaluate the transmission ability of epidemics. However, this method exhibits biases arising from the reported incidence data and assumes the generation interval distribution which is not available at the early stage of epidemic. Recent studies showed that the viral loads characterized by cycle threshold (Ct) of the infected populations evolving throughout the course of epidemic and providing a possibility to infer the epidemic trajectory. In this work, we propose the Cycle Threshold-based Transformer (Ct-Transformer) to estimate <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>. We find the supervised learning of Ct-Transformer outperforms the traditional incidence-based statistic and Ct-based <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> estimating methods, and more importantly Ct-Transformer is robustness to the detection resources. Further, we apply the proposed model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and obtain excellent fine-tuning performance, which attains comparable performance with the supervised Ct-Transformer, verified by both the synthetic and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that the Ct-based deep learning method can improve the real-time estimates of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, enabling more easily adapted to the track of the newly emerged epidemic.

                <p>by Annie G. Bryant, Kevin Aquino, Linden Parkes, Alex Fornito, Ben D. Fulcher</p>

The brain’s complex distributed dynamics are typically quantified using a limited set of manually selected statistical properties, leaving the possibility that alternative dynamical properties may outperform those reported for a given application. Here, we address this limitation by systematically comparing diverse, interpretable features of both intra-regional activity and inter-regional functional coupling from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, demonstrating our method using case–control comparisons of four neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings generally support the use of linear time-series analysis techniques for rs-fMRI case–control analyses, while also identifying new ways to quantify informative dynamical fMRI structures. While simple statistical representations of fMRI dynamics performed surprisingly well (e.g., properties within a single brain region), combining intra-regional properties with inter-regional coupling generally improved performance, underscoring the distributed, multifaceted changes to fMRI dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive, data-driven method introduced here enables systematic identification and interpretation of quantitative dynamical signatures of multivariate time-series data, with applicability beyond neuroimaging to diverse scientific problems involving complex time-varying systems.

Accurate estimates of the incidence of infectious diseases are key for the control of epidemics. However, healthcare systems are often unable to test the population exhaustively, especially when asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases are widespread; this leads to significant and systematic under-reporting of the real incidence. Here, we propose a machine learning approach to estimate the incidence of a pandemic in real-time, using reported cases and the overall test rate. In particular, we use Bayesian symbolic regression to automatically learn the closed-form mathematical models that most parsimoniously describe incidence. We develop and validate our models using COVID-19 incidence values for nine different countries, confirming their ability to accurately predict daily incidence. Remarkably, despite the differences in epidemic trajectories and dynamics across countries, we find that a single model for all countries offers a more parsimonious description and is more predictive of actual incidence compared to separate models for each country. Our results show the potential to accurately model incidence in real-time using closed-form mathematical models, providing a valuable tool for public health decision-makers.

                <p>by Juliana Chase, Liyu Xia, Lung-Hao Tai, Wan Chen Lin, Anne G. E. Collins, Linda Wilbrecht</p>

Computational modeling has revealed that human research participants use both rapid working memory (WM) and incremental reinforcement learning (RL) (RL+WM) to solve a simple instrumental learning task, relying on WM when the number of stimuli is small and supplementing with RL when the number of stimuli exceeds WM capacity. Inspired by this work, we examined which learning systems and strategies are used by adolescent and adult mice when they first acquire a conditional associative learning task. In a version of the human RL+WM task translated for rodents, mice were required to associate odor stimuli (from a set of 2 or 4 odors) with a left or right port to receive reward. Using logistic regression and computational models to analyze the first 200 trials per odor, we determined that mice used both incremental RL and stimulus-insensitive, one-back strategies to solve the task. While these one-back strategies may be a simple form of short-term or working memory, they did not approximate the boost to learning performance that has been observed in human participants using WM in a comparable task. Adolescent and adult mice also showed comparable performance, with no change in learning rate or softmax beta parameters with adolescent development and task experience. However, reliance on a one-back perseverative, win-stay strategy increased with development in males in both odor set sizes, but was not dependent on gonadal hormones. Our findings advance a simple conditional associative learning task and new models to enable the isolation and quantification of reinforcement learning alongside other strategies mice use while learning to associate stimuli with rewards within a single behavioral session. These data and methods can inform and aid comparative study of reinforcement learning across species.

Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody Fc species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties and then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which Fc properties can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data.

                <p>by Sarah E. Baum, Daniele M. Pelissari, Fernanda Dockhorn Costa, Luiza O. Harada, Mauro Sanchez, Patricia Bartholomay, Ted Cohen, Marcia C. Castro, Nicolas A. Menzies</p>

Effectively responding to drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) requires accurate and timely information on resistance levels and trends. In contexts where use of drug susceptibility testing has not been universal (i.e. not all patients are offered testing), surveillance for rifampicin-resistance—one of the core drugs in the TB treatment regimen—has relied on resource-intensive and infrequent nationally-representative prevalence surveys. The expanded availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) over the past decade has increased testing coverage in many settings. However, RDT data collected in the course of routine (but not universal) use may provide biased estimates of resistance if the subset of patients receiving RDTs is not representative of the overall cohort. Here, we developed a method that attempts to correct for non-random use of RDT testing in the context of routine TB diagnosis to recover unbiased estimates of resistance among new and previously treated TB cases. Specifically, we employed statistical corrections to model rifampicin resistance among TB notifications with observed Xpert MTB/RIF (a WHO-recommended RDT) results using a hierarchical generalized additive regression model, and then used model output to impute results for untested individuals. We applied this model to 2017–2023 case-level data on over 800,000 patients from Brazil. Modeled estimates of the prevalence of rifampicin resistance were substantially higher than naïve estimates, with estimated prevalence ranging between 28–44% higher for new cases and 2–17% higher for previously treated cases. Our estimates of RR-TB incidence were estimated with narrower uncertainty intervals relative to WHO estimates for the same time period, and were robust to alternative model specifications. Our approach provides a generalizable method to leverage routine RDT data to derive timely estimates of RR-TB prevalence among notified TB cases in settings where testing for TB drug resistance is not universal.

                <p>by Jiyoung Kang, Hae-Jeong Park</p>

Integrating multiscale, multimodal neuroimaging data is essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural circuits. However, this is challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between spatial coverage and resolution in each modality, necessitating a computational strategy that combines modality-specific information effectively. This study introduces a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) framework designed to address the challenge of combining partially observed, multiscale signals across a larger-scale neural circuit by employing a shared neural state model with modality-specific observation models. The proposed method achieves robust circuit inference by iteratively integrating parameter estimates from local microscale and global meso- or macroscale circuits, derived from signals across various scales and modalities. Parameters estimated from high-resolution data within specific regions inform global circuit estimation by constraining neural properties in unobserved regions, while large-scale circuit data help elucidate detailed local circuitry. Using a virtual ground truth system, we validated the method across diverse experimental settings, combining calcium imaging (CaI), voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI), and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals—each with distinct coverage and resolution. Our reciprocal and iterative parameter estimation approach markedly improves the accuracy of neural property and connectivity estimates compared to traditional one-step estimation methods. This iterative integration of local and global parameters presents a reliable approach to inferring extensive, complex neural circuits from partially observed, multimodal, and multiscale data, showcasing how information from different scales reciprocally enhances entire circuit parameter estimation.

                <p>by Kenneth Y. Wertheim, Robert Chisholm, Paul Richmond, Dawn Walker</p>

Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumour in children. Over half of all high-risk cases are expected to succumb to the disease even after chemotherapy, surgery, and immunotherapy. Although the importance of <i>MYCN</i> amplification in this disease is indisputable, the mechanistic details remain enigmatic. Here, we present a multicellular model of neuroblastoma comprising a continuous automaton, discrete cell agents, and a centre-based mechanical model, as well as the simulation results we obtained with it. The continuous automaton represents the tumour microenvironment as a grid-like structure, where each voxel is associated with continuous variables such as the oxygen level therein. Each discrete cell agent is defined by several attributes, including its cell cycle position, mutations, gene expression pattern, and more with behaviours such as cell cycling and cell death being stochastically dependent on these attributes. The centre-based mechanical model represents the properties of these agents as physical objects, describing how they repel each other as soft spheres. By implementing a stochastic simulation algorithm on modern GPUs, we simulated the dynamics of over one million neuroblastoma cells over a period of months. Specifically, we set up 1200 heterogeneous tumours and tracked the <i>MYCN</i>-amplified clone’s dynamics in each, revealed the conditions that favour its growth, and tested its responses to 5000 drug combinations. Our results are in agreement with those reported in the literature and add new insights into how the <i>MYCN</i>-amplified clone’s reproductive advantage in a tumour, its gene expression profile, the tumour’s other clones (with different mutations), and the tumour’s microenvironment are inter-related. Based on the results, we formulated a hypothesis, which argues that there are two distinct populations of neuroblastoma cells in the tumour; the p53 protein is pro-survival in one and pro-apoptosis in the other. It follows that alternating between inhibiting MDM2 to restore p53 activity and inhibiting ARF to attenuate p53 activity is a promising, if unorthodox, therapeutic strategy. The multicellular model has the advantages of modularity, high resolution, and scalability, making it a potential foundation for creating digital twins of neuroblastoma patients.

The baroreflex is one of the most important control mechanisms in the human cardiovascular system. This work utilises a closed-loop in silico model of baroreflex regulation, coupled to pulsatile mechanical models with (i) one heart chamber and 36-parameters and (ii) four chambers and 51 parameters. We perform the first global sensitivity analysis of these closed-loop systems which considers <i>both</i> cardiovascular and baroreflex parameters, and compare the models with their respective unregulated equivalents. Results show the reduced influence of regulated parameters compared to unregulated equivalents and that, in the physiological resting state, model outputs (pressures, heart rate, cardiac output etc.) are most sensitive to parasympathetic arc parameters. This work provides insight into the effects of regulation and model input parameter influence on clinical metrics, and constitutes a first step to understanding the role of regulation in models for personalised healthcare.

                <p>by Bethan Cracknell Daniels, Darunee Buddhari, Taweewun Hunsawong, Sopon Iamsirithaworn, Aaron R. Farmer, Derek A. T. Cummings, Kathryn B. Anderson, Ilaria Dorigatti</p>

The development of a safe and efficacious vaccine that provides immunity against all four dengue virus serotypes is a priority, and a significant challenge for vaccine development has been defining and measuring serotype-specific outcomes and correlates of protection. The plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) is the gold standard assay for measuring serotype-specific antibodies, but this test cannot differentiate homotypic and heterotypic antibodies and characterising the infection history is challenging. To address this, we present an analysis of pre- and post-infection antibody titres measured using the PRNT, collected from a prospective cohort of Thai children. We applied four machine learning classifiers and multinomial logistic regression to the titre data to predict the infecting serotype. The models were validated against the true infecting serotype, identified using RT-PCR. Model performance was calculated using 100 bootstrap samples of the train and out-of-sample test sets. Our analysis showed that, on average, the greatest change in titre was against the infecting serotype. However, in 53.4% (109/204) of the subjects, the highest titre change did not correspond to the infecting serotype, including in 34.3% (11/35) of dengue-naïve individuals (although 8/11 of these seronegative individuals were seropositive to Japanese encephalitis virus prior to their infection). The highest post-infection titres of seropositive cases were more likely to match the serotype of the highest pre-infection titre than the infecting serotype, consistent with antigenic seniority or cross-reactive boosting of pre-infection titres. Despite these challenges, the best performing machine learning algorithm achieved 76.3% (95% CI 57.9–89.5%) accuracy on the out-of-sample test set in predicting the infecting serotype from PRNT data. Incorporating additional spatiotemporal data improved accuracy to 80.6% (95% CI 63.2–94.7%), while using only post-infection titres as predictor variables yielded an accuracy of 71.7% (95% CI 57.9–84.2%). These results show that machine learning classifiers can be used to overcome challenges in interpreting PRNT titres, making them useful tools in investigating dengue immune dynamics, infection history and identifying serotype-specific correlates of protection, which in turn can support the evaluation of clinical trial endpoints and vaccine development.

Finding optimal parameters for detailed neuronal models is a ubiquitous challenge in neuroscientific research. In recent years, manual model tuning has been gradually replaced by automated parameter search using a variety of different tools and methods. However, using most of these software tools and choosing the most appropriate algorithm for a given optimization task require substantial technical expertise, which prevents the majority of researchers from using these methods effectively. To address these issues, we developed a generic platform (called Neuroptimus) that allows users to set up neural parameter optimization tasks via a graphical interface, and to solve these tasks using a wide selection of state-of-the-art parameter search methods implemented by five different Python packages. Neuroptimus also offers several features to support more advanced usage, including the ability to run most algorithms in parallel, which allows it to take advantage of high-performance computing architectures. We used the common interface provided by Neuroptimus to conduct a detailed comparison of more than twenty different algorithms (and implementations) on six distinct benchmarks that represent typical scenarios in neuronal parameter search. We quantified the performance of the algorithms in terms of the best solutions found and in terms of convergence speed. We identified several algorithms, including covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization, that consistently, without any fine-tuning, found good solutions in all of our use cases. By contrast, some other algorithms including all local search methods provided good solutions only for the simplest use cases, and failed completely on more complex problems. We also demonstrate the versatility of Neuroptimus by applying it to an additional use case that involves tuning the parameters of a subcellular model of biochemical pathways. Finally, we created an online database that allows uploading, querying and analyzing the results of optimization runs performed by Neuroptimus, which enables all researchers to update and extend the current benchmarking study. The tools and analysis we provide should aid members of the neuroscience community to apply parameter search methods more effectively in their research.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite treatments which reduce relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS), many patients continue to experience progressive disability accumulation. MS is associated with metabolic disruptions and cerebral metabolic stress predisposes to tissue injury and possibly impaired remyelination. Additionally, myelin homeostasis is metabolically expensive and reliant on glycolysis. We investigated cerebral metabolic changes in MS and when in the disease course they occurred, and assessed their relationship with microstructural changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study used combined fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and oxygen, thereby quantifying glycolysis. Twelve healthy controls, 20 patients with relapsing MS, and 13 patients with non-relapsing MS were studied. Relapsing patients with MS were treatment naïve and scanned pre- and post-initiation of high efficacy disease modifying therapy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In normal appearing white matter, we observed increased glucose utilization and reduced oxygen utilization in newly diagnosed MS, consistent with increased glycolysis. Increased glycolysis was greater in patients with a longer disease duration course and higher disability. Among newly diagnosed patients, different treatments had differential impacts on glucose utilization. Last, whereas hypermetabolism within lesions was clearly associated with inflammation, no such relationship was found within normal appearing white matter.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Increased white matter glycolysis is a prominent feature of cerebral metabolism in MS. It begins early in the disease course, increases with disease duration and is independent of microstructural evidence of inflammation in normal appearing white matter. Optimization of the metabolic environment may be an important component of therapies designed to reduce progressive disability. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder traditionally characterized by the selective loss of medium spiny neurons in the basal ganglia. However, it has become apparent that white matter injury and oligodendrocyte dysfunction precede the degeneration of medium spiny neurons, garnering interest as a key pathogenic mechanism of HD. Oligodendrocytes are glial cells found within the central nervous system involved in the production of myelin and the myelination of axons. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath that wraps around axons, facilitating signal conduction and neuronal viability. The degeneration of myelin hinders effective communication and leaves neurons vulnerable to external damage and subsequent degeneration. Abnormalities in oligodendrocyte maturation have been established in the HD human brain, however, investigations into the underlying dysfunction of human oligodendrocytes in HD are limited. This review will detail the involvement of oligodendrocytes and white matter damage in HD. Recent developments in modeling human-specific oligodendrocyte pathology in HD will be discussed, with a particular focus on emerging somatic cell reprogramming approaches.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Niemann Pick type C1 (NPC1) is a rare, fatal disorder characterized by endosomal lipid accumulation that leads to damage of both peripheral organs and central nervous system (cerebellum and hippocampus are especially affected). Currently, miglustat is the only approved drug for NPC1, thus the identification of new treatments is mandatory. We have previously demonstrated that the drug dipyridamole (DIP), an enhancer of adenosine signaling, can reduce the pathological phenotype in patient-derived fibroblasts. In this paper, we evaluated the <i>in vivo</i> effects of DIP in NPC1 mice. Male and female NPC1<sup>nih</sup> mice were treated with DIP 30 mg/kg i.p. from 28 to 64 days of age. Motor function was assessed by Erasmus Ladder test, hippocampal cognitive decline by Novel Object Recognition test and brain pathology by immunofluorescence and biochemical assays. Peripheral pathology was evaluated by analyzing lipid accumulation in spleen and liver (HP-TLC). In NPC1, mice DIP rescued recognition memory and increased hippocampal expression of calbindin. On the contrary, the drug was unable to improve motor function, cerebellar pathology and lipid accumulation in spleen and liver. Our results demonstrated that DIP selectively ameliorates the cognitive impairment in NPC1 mice. This drug could thus represent a valuable therapeutic tool to be used in combination with other treatments in NPC1.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is traditionally considered a region dedicated to long-term memory, recent neuroimaging and intracranial recording evidence suggests that the MTL also contributes to certain aspects of visual short-term memory (VSTM), such as the quality or precision of retained VSTM content. This study aims to further investigate the MTL's role in VSTM precision through the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants underwent 1.5 mA offline tDCS over bilateral temporal lobes using left cathodal and right anodal electrodes, administered for either 20 min (active) or 0.5 min within a 20-min window (sham), in a counterbalanced design. As the electrical current passes through midbrain structures with this bilateral stimulation montage, prior behavioral and modeling evidence suggests that this tDCS protocol can modulate MTL functions. To confirm this and examine its impacts on VSTM, participants completed a VSTM color recall task immediately following tDCS, while undergoing a 20-min fMRI scan and a subsequent 7.5-min resting-state scan, during which they focused on a fixation cross. Behavioral results indicated that this tDCS protocol decreased VSTM precision without significantly affecting overall recall success. Furthermore, psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that tDCS over the temporal lobe modulated hippocampal-occipital functional connectivity during the VSTM task, despite no main effect on fMRI BOLD activity. Notably, this modulation was also observed during resting-state fMRI 15–20 min post-tDCS, with the magnitude of the effect correlating with participants' behavioral changes in VSTM precision across active and control conditions. Combined, these findings suggest that tDCS over the temporal lobe can modulate the intrinsic functional connectivity between the MTL and visual sensory areas, thereby affecting VSTM precision.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that inherited astrocyte dysfunction can be a primary trigger for epilepsy development; however, the available data are rather limited. In addition, astrocytes are considered as a perspective target for the design of novel and improvement of the existing antiepileptic therapy. Piracetam and related nootropic drugs are widely used in the therapy of various epileptic disorders, but detailed mechanisms of racetams action and, in particular, their effects on glial functions are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the functional state of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Krushinsky–Molodkina (KM) rats genetically prone to audiogenic seizures and compared the action of piracetam on the DG astrocytes in KM and normal Wistar rats. Wistar and naïve KM rats which received injections of saline (control) or piracetam (100 mg/kg) for 21 days were recruited in our studies. Comparative analysis of control Wistar and KM rats revealed genetically determined abnormalities in DG astrocytes of KM rats including an increased expression of NFIA but a decreased GFAP, ALDH1L1, EAATs, and glutamine synthetase (GS). Piracetam treatment normalized the expression of all studied markers, except NFIA, in KM rats, while in Wistar rats, it potentiated only GS and NFIA. The results suggested that the nootropic and antiepileptic effects of piracetam may be, at least partially, mediated by the modulation of astroglia functions. In addition, analysis of NFIA and GS colocalization revealed the novel pattern of astrocyte heterogeneity in the DG which was significantly altered in epileptic rats but corrected by piracetam.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97465">Genome concentration limits cell growth and modulates proteome composition in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Defining the cellular factors that drive growth rate and proteome composition is essential for understanding and manipulating cellular systems. In bacteria, ribosome concentration is known to be a constraining factor of cell growth rate, while gene concentration is usually assumed not to be limiting. Here, using single-molecule tracking, quantitative single-cell microscopy, and modeling, we show that genome dilution in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells arrested for DNA replication limits total RNA polymerase activity within physiological cell sizes across tested nutrient conditions. This rapid-onset limitation on bulk transcription results in sub-linear scaling of total active ribosomes with cell size and sub-exponential growth. Such downstream effects on bulk translation and cell growth are near-immediately detectable in a nutrient-rich medium, but delayed in nutrient-poor conditions, presumably due to cellular buffering activities. RNA sequencing and tandem-mass-tag mass spectrometry experiments further reveal that genome dilution remodels the relative abundance of mRNAs and proteins with cell size at a global level. Altogether, our findings indicate that chromosome concentration is a limiting factor of transcription and a global modulator of the transcriptome and proteome composition in <i>E. coli</i>. Experiments in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> and comparison with eukaryotic cell studies identify broadly conserved DNA concentration-dependent scaling principles of gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100086">The evolutionary modifications of a GoLoco motif in the AGS protein facilitate micromere formation in the sea urchin embryo</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary introduction of asymmetric cell division (ACD) into the developmental program facilitates the formation of a new cell type, contributing to developmental diversity and, eventually, species diversification. The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: an ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, activator of G-protein signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans. This raises the question of what evolutionary modifications of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms’ AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution.
