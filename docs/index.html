">Electrical stimulation elicits space- and parameter-dependent spiking responses in human cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation (ES) is used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and investigate brain dynamics, yet its effects on human cortical microcircuits remain poorly understood. Cortical organoids provide a unique platform to investigate these mechanisms in isolation from subcortical and long-range cortical inputs. Here we illustrate how cortical organoids respond to ES, identifying the response profiles of isolated cortical circuits while detailing a roadmap of how ES parameters affect the organoid spiking activity. We employed a high-density multielectrode array to record neuronal activity from cortical organoids (n=417 units in N=7 organoids) during ES, systematically varying stimulation frequency, intensity, pulse width, and charge density. By analyzing single unit spiking activity, we found that ES elicits excitatory, inhibitory, and mixed responses in 39%, 12%, and 17% of the units, respectively. On average, this response lasted 100 ms and became stable within 26 trials. The magnitude of both excitatory and inhibitory responses was maximal near the stimulation site and decayed with distance. The response magnitude was inversely correlated with pulse intensity and duration, but not with stimulation frequency and charge density. These findings demonstrate that local cortical circuits are sufficient to initiate the early excitatory phase of the canonical ES response, whose magnitude depends on ES parameters, and can sustain the excitatory phase for over 100 ms. The reduced late inhibitory phase, together with the absence of late excitatory components observed 200 ms after ES in intact adult brains in-vivo, suggests that these phases may depend on neuronal maturation or inter-area connections. Our work thus establishes cortical organoids as a framework for studying the local contributions to ES-induced activity in a developmental model of the human cortex.

                Animal models can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying stress-related disorders. Yet, significant translational challenges persist, as laboratory behavioral assays are often reductionistic, with limited attention to ethologically relevant behavioral diversity. Recent advances in high-throughput pose-estimation tools and computational ethology methods are addressing this limitation by enhancing the resolution and validity of behavioral phenotyping. In this context, it is known that early life stress (ELS) reshapes how animals handle subsequent threats later in life, but the fine-scale dynamics and ethological details of this shift remain elusive. To overcome this, we combined a deep-learning pose-estimation pipeline (DeepLabCut) with a supervised freezing classifier (SimBA) and an unsupervised behavioral motifs identification platform (keypoint MoSeq) to study in detail the diversity and dynamics of behavior in an auditory fear-conditioning (FC) paradigm in two independent cohorts of adult male mice that were exposed to ELS through the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm. We first validated the blunted freezing response after ELS in a supervised manner using SimBA. Next, keypoint MoSeq segmented the same pose-estimation data into ethologically meaningful motifs over time. When compared to control animals, ELS offspring showed an altered FC response, reduced behavioral entropy and limited diversity in their behavioral repertoire. Such response was characterized by longer active-behavior bouts and more recurrent transitions between states, indicating a more stereotyped and predictable response. Multidimensional scaling of time-binned behavioral vectors and distance metrics identified a resilient subpopulation within the ELS group that displayed a control-like behavioral profile, characterized by a steeper increase in freezing behavior during the FC task and a more diverse behavioral repertoire with reduced recurrence of stereotyped actions, less frequent and shorter active bouts and prolonged passive responses. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS shifts the balance between passive and active coping strategies and that resilience is marked by a less stereotypical yet more diverse and flexible behavioral response to a subsequent stressful demand. Finally, we further validated the unsupervised behavioral motifs with a predictive model that identified distinctive kinematic features of these responses, which could be used to build new behavioral classifiers that can be applied in other behavioral paradigms. These results demonstrate the potential of computational ethology to dissect complex behavioral patterns and improve our understanding of individual stress responses. By combining supervised and unsupervised behavioral analysis tools, we can deepen our understanding of the latent structure of stress behavior and identify objective markers of vulnerability and resilience.

">Absence of short-term axon initial segment plasticity in human, mouse, and rat cortical circuits</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining neuronal inputs and outputs within the physiological range relies on the ability of neurons to update their responsiveness to inputs dependent on changing activity levels. Termed homeostatic plasticity, the mechanisms that neurons employ to control their responsiveness are varied, and proposed to include structural changes to a key neuronal structure, the axon initial segment (AIS). As the site of action potential initiation, the AIS has been postulated to rapidly change its length in response to increased or decreased cellular and circuit activity. To date, AIS structural plasticity has only been tested in tissue cultures and rodent models. In our current study, we assess the ability of neurons to alter their AIS length over a variety of timescales in ex vivo rodent and human brain slices, human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and in mice dark-reared during early life; using a combination of electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We find no evidence for changes to AIS length following depolarisation for up to 3 hours, despite positive controls confirming modulated activity. However, we do find that neuronal physiological properties are altered by changes in activity, but these are largely independent of action potential initiation associated with the AIS. In summary, we find no evidence supporting a role for AIS structural plasticity in mouse, rat, or human cortical neurons.

">Frequency-specific maturation of cortical organization and social-cognitive links from childhood to adolescence</a></h4>

              
                The human brain unfolds its functional architecture over multiple timescales during childhood and adolescence, yet we know little about how these developmental trajectories vary between individuals. Slow brain signals at different frequencies are thought to support distinct functional processes, but their contribution to shaping large-scale cortical organization across development remains unclear. Here, we map the maturation of cortical organization by decomposing spontaneous slow brain activity into multiple frequency bands in participants aged 6-19 years. We identify a reproducible three-stage progression - child-like, transitional, and adult-like configurations - whose timing depends on frequency: faster dynamics mature earliest, intermediate frequencies develop gradually, and lower-frequency dynamics reorganize abruptly around puberty. Individual cognitive and social traits modulate these trajectories: children with higher social anxiety or higher IQ reach adult-like configurations earlier in specific frequency bands, whereas lower-IQ children show generalized delays. These results reveal that cortical organization matures along multiple, frequency-specific timescales and that intellectual and socio-emotional factors shape its pace. Our multi-frequency framework provides a new perspective on hierarchical brain development and may inform biomarkers for atypical neurodevelopment.

<p>A high-resolution electron microscopy dataset of a mid-morphogenesis (comma stage) <i>C. elegans</i> embryo was used to reconstruct developmental intermediates as sensory neurons and their glial partners assemble into sense organs. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> sense organs provide a powerful model for understanding how different cell types interact to assemble a functional organ. Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset, we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid [AM], four cephalic [CEP], six inner labial [IL], four outer labial quadrant [OLQ], and two outer labial lateral [OLL]). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then “zippers” down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath–socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis.</p>

                Anastasaki and colleagues establish a previously unknown glutamate growth dependency in pediatric low-grade brain tumors (gliomas). Glioma cells hijack normal neuron-glial molecular circuits present during neurodevelopment, using aberrant glutamate receptor stimulation to activate PDGFRα/ERK via Src. This uncovers a molecular link between neurotransmitter signaling and tumor growth in children.

                Zhou et al. show that creatine sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis by impairing ERK2 activation, thereby inhibiting ERK2-mediated stabilization of FSP1. Combining creatine supplementation with targeting PD-1 synergistically enhances anti-tumor immunity in mice. These results suggest that creatine activates ferroptosis, induces tumor suppression, and enhances ferroptosis-based treatments for CRC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105451">Coral anthozoan-specific opsins employ a novel chloride counterion for spectral tuning</a></h4>

              
                Animal opsins are G protein-coupled receptors that have evolved to sense light by covalently binding a retinal chromophore via a protonated (positively charged) Schiff base. A negatively charged amino acid in the opsin, acting as a counterion, stabilizes the proton on the Schiff base, which is essential for sensitivity to visible light. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of a unique class of opsins from a reef-building coral belonging to the anthozoan-specific opsin II group (ASO-II opsins), which intriguingly lack a counterion residue at any of established sites. Our findings reveal that, unlike other known animal opsins, the protonated state of the Schiff base in visible light-sensitive ASO-II opsins is highly dependent on exogenously supplied chloride ions (Cl<sup>−</sup>). By using structural modeling and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to interpret spectroscopy data, we conclude that, in the dark state, ASO-II opsins employ environmental Cl<sup>−</sup> as their native counterion, while a nearby polar residue, Glu292 in its protonated neutral form, facilitates Cl<sup>−</sup> binding. In contrast, Glu292 plays a crucial role in maintaining the protonation state of the Schiff base in the light-activated protein, serving as the counterion in the photoproduct. Furthermore, Glu292 is involved in G protein activation of the ASO-II opsin, suggesting that this novel counterion system coordinates multiple functional properties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102840">Automatic and accurate reconstruction of long-range axonal projections of single-neuron in mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Single-neuron axonal projections reveal the route map of neuron output and provide a key cue for understanding how information flows across the brain. Reconstruction of single-neuron axonal projections requires intensive manual operations in tens of terabytes of brain imaging data and is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. The main issue lies in the need for precise reconstruction algorithms to avoid reconstruction errors, yet current methods struggle with densely distributed axons, focusing mainly on skeleton extraction. To overcome this, we introduce a point assignment-based method that uses cylindrical point sets to accurately represent axons and a minimal information flow tree model to suppress the snowball effect of reconstruction errors. Our method successfully reconstructs single-neuron axonal projections across hundreds of GBs (Gigabytes) images within a mouse brain with an average of 80% f1-score, while current methods only provide less than 40% f1-score reconstructions from a few hundred MBs (Megabytes) images. This huge improvement is helpful for high-throughput mapping of neuron projections.

                The Global South has emerged as a beacon of innovation in scholarly publishing, championing equitable and community-driven models of knowledge dissemination. Here we explore various initiatives originating from Latin America, Africa, and Asia, highlighting platforms that are free for both readers and authors. These initiatives also promote multilingualism, public funding, and non-profit, scholarly-led governance structures. We argue that the Global South’s approach offers a blueprint for a fairer, more inclusive, and more just academic publishing ecosystem.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104238">Development of D-box peptides to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome</a></h4>

              
                E3 ubiquitin ligases engage their substrates via ‘degrons’ - short linear motifs typically located within intrinsically disordered regions of substrates. As these enzymes are large, multi-subunit complexes that generally lack natural small-molecule ligands and are difficult to inhibit via conventional means, alternative strategies are needed to target them in diseases, and peptide-based inhibitors derived from degrons represent a promising approach. Here we explore peptide inhibitors of Cdc20, a substrate-recognition subunit and activator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) that is essential in mitosis and consequently of interest as an anti-cancer target. APC/C engages substrates via degrons that include the ‘destruction box’ (D-box) motif. We used a rational design approach to construct binders containing unnatural amino acids aimed at better filling a hydrophobic pocket that contributes to the D-box binding site on the surface of Cdc20. We confirmed binding by thermal-shift assays and surface plasmon resonance and determined the structures of a number of the Cdc20-peptide complexes. Using a cellular thermal shift assay, we confirmed that the D-box peptides also bind to and stabilise Cdc20 in the cell. We found that the D-box peptides inhibit ubiquitination activity of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> and are more potent than the small-molecule inhibitor Apcin. Lastly, these peptides function as portable degrons capable of driving the degradation of a fused fluorescent protein. Interestingly, we find that although inhibitory activity of the peptides correlates with Cdc20-binding affinity, degradation efficacy does not, which may be due to the complex nature of APC/C regulation and effects of degron binding of subunit recruitment and conformational changes. Our study lays the groundwork for the further development of these peptides as molecular therapeutics for blocking APC/C as well as potentially for harnessing the APC/C for targeted protein degradation.

In two areas within the Hill Antechamber and the Dinaledi Chamber, this work uncovered concentrations of abundant <i>Homo naledi</i> fossils including articulated, matrix-supported skeletal regions consistent with rapid covering by sediment prior to the decomposition of soft tissue. We additionally re-examine the spatial positioning of skeletal material and associated sediments within the Puzzle Box area, from which abundant <i>H. naledi</i> remains representing a minimum of six individuals were recovered in 2013 and 2014. Multiple lines of evidence exclude the hypothesis that skeletal remains from these three areas come from bodies that decomposed on the floor of the chamber or within a shallow depression prior to burial by sediments. The spatial positioning of skeletal material, the topography of the subsystem, and observations on sediments within and surrounding features exclude the hypothesis that rapid burial by sediment was a result of gravity-driven slumping or spontaneous movement of sediments. We present a minimal hypothesis of hominin cultural burial and test the evidence from all three areas, finding that this hypothesis is most compatible with the pattern of evidence. These results suggest that mortuary behavior, including cultural burial, was part of the repertoire of <i>Homo naledi</i>.

">Dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex links abstract planning to motor execution</a></h4>

              
                Mental planning is essential for producing action sequences. Despite the contribution of planning to many everyday activities, the neurocognitive processes that map a selected plan into a concrete course of action are unclear. We asked whether planning and execution are linked by abstract task relationships that are divorced from the specifics of action implementation. Human participants underwent functional MRI while performing a task that required encoding and maintaining abstract representations in order to plan and later apply those representations to execute action sequences. Our analyses revealed that dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encoded representations during the planning period that shifted progressively from information based on perceptual input to information associated with the abstract task context. These abstract representations were then used to translate between the action plan and its execution irrespective of the perceptual and motor details, indicating that DMPFC builds and sustains an abstract representational bridge that links planning to action.

">Lifestyle and transcriptional signatures associated with ethnicity/race-related variations in the functional connectome</a></h4>

              
                The functional connectome architecture of the human brain, which involves ethnicity/race characteristics, has significantly advanced our understanding of brain-behaviour relationships. However, the multifaceted underpinnings of ethnicity/race-related variations in the brain functional connectome remain largely unclear. In this study, we leverage precision individualized functional mapping to examine ethnicity/race-related differences in the brain's intrinsic functional organization, as well as their associations with lifestyle factors and transcriptional signatures. Our findings indicate that variations in network topography and functional connectivity across ethnic/racial groups follow a hierarchical pattern along the sensorimotor-association axis and are constrained by brain morphology. We identify lifestyle factors, primarily education and substance use, that mediate the associations between ethnicity/race and functional connectivity. Via the use of human brain gene expression data, we further demonstrate that cortical gene expression patterns are spatially associated with ethnicity/race-related variations in functional connectivity. Gene ontology analysis of ethnic/racial-associated genes reveals significant enrichment in biological processes, including synaptic signalling pathways and neuronal system development. Collectively, these results reveal the complex relationships between ethnicity/race-related differences in brain function and brain morphology, lifestyle factors, and transcriptomic profiles.

">Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling of Interoceptive Psychophysics</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the capacity to sense, perceive, and metacognitively appraise viscerosensory and homeostatic signals, is a growing focus in psychology and psychiatry. Adaptive psychophysical tasks now allow quantification of perceptual sensitivity, bias, and precision in cardiac and respiratory domains. However, accurately estimating these parameters often requires large numbers of trials or participants, posing practical challenges, especially in clinical research where participant availability and tolerance are limited. One approach to reduce participant burden while maintaining statistical rigour is to optimise data analysis. Here, we present hierarchical Bayesian models tailored for cardiac and respiratory interoceptive psychophysics that efficiently estimate sensitivity, bias, and precision at both individual and group levels. Using simulations and empirical data, we validate these models and demonstrate that they allow enhanced inference relative to conventional approaches. To support adoption, we provide openly-accessible resources, including a tutorial on how to implement and fit these models in R (written with researchers without modelling expertise in mind) and an app for sample-size justification. These tools facilitate robust, efficient, and generalisable modelling of interoceptive performance, enabling rigorous studies even with limited trials or participant availability.

">Multi-Scale Anti-Correlated Neural States Dominate Naturalistic Whole-Brain Activity</a></h4>

              
                The human brain's response to naturalistic stimuli is characterized by complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Within these dynamics there is a transitioning structure between sets of anti-correlated neural states that is frequently observed but has not been systematically investigated across scales. In this paper, we use three different naturalistic fMRI datasets to quantify anti-correlation in global and local neural states during naturalistic viewing or listening and investigate their interdependence and their relationship to changes in the stimuli. We demonstrate that continuous naturalistic brain activity shows an anti-correlational structure that spans both global and local spatial scales, with regions in the dorsal attention network showing strong alignment between local and global state transitions. On the global scale, ongoing dynamics are dominated by two antagonistic states that correspond to Default Mode Network and Task Positive Network configurations, with a third transitional state mediating between them. On the local scale, we observe anti-correlated neural states that are associated with periods of relatively high and low brain activity. Across the brain, these are driven by subsets of voxels that are systematically anti-correlated with their area's dominant activity pattern. This antagonism is related to stimulus changes, which tend to trigger a switch to the TPN state globally and to high activity states locally. On the local scale we also see a modality-specific pattern, with visual changes mostly driving transitions in visual cortical regions and auditory changes predominantly affecting auditory and language-related areas. The consistency of these findings across datasets with different stimulus types (audiovisual and purely auditory) indicates that anti-correlated neural states represent a domain-general organizational principle of brain function. We propose that anti-correlated dynamics functionally represent a convergent solution to the fundamental challenge of maintaining coherent internal representations while remaining responsive to meaningful changes in the environment.

">The effects of action-based predictions in early visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                During voluntary movement, predictions about the sensory consequences of an action typically result in reduced sensory sensitivity. The forward model theory proposes that this reduced sensitivity is due to neural suppression or cancellation of sensory action outcomes. However, recently this theory has been challenged by three alternative theories: the pre-activation account, sharpening, and the opposing processes theory. In this fMRI study, we directly tested and compared these four theories using univariate and multivariate analyses both prior to and during stimulus presentation. Participants performed a visual orientation discrimination task on two sequentially presented gratings, which were either presented automatically (passive condition) or triggered by their own button press (active condition). Auditory cues at trial onset indicated the overall grating orientation, followed by a preparatory phase in which participants anticipated the upcoming stimuli. During this phase, the predicted stimulus orientation was decodable from early visual cortex activity in both active and passive conditions at levels significantly above chance, indicating pre-activation of the predicted orientation, but with no difference between active and passive conditions. BOLD responses did not emerge earlier in active conditions, arguing against the pre-activation theory. During stimulus presentation, actively generated stimuli elicited larger BOLD responses than passively presented ones, contradicting the forward model theory, which predicts overall response suppression. Decoding accuracy did not differ between conditions, inconsistent with the sharpening hypothesis, which predicts enhanced neural precision for actively generated stimuli. Instead, our findings align most closely with the opposing processes theory, which posits pre-activation in both conditions. However, the stronger BOLD response for actively generated stimuli is not predicted by any existing theory, suggesting that additional mechanisms - such as heightened attention or motor-related enhancement - may contribute to sensory processing during self-initiated actions.

">Species-specific Rates of Fatty Acid MetabolismSet the Scale of Temporal Patterning of Corticogenesisthrough Protein Acetylation Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Developmental processes display temporal differences across species, leading to divergence in organ size and composition. In the cerebral cortex, neurons of diverse identities are generated sequentially through a temporal patterning mechanism conserved throughout mammals. This corticogenesis process is considerably prolonged in the human species, leading to increased brain size and complexity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we found that human cortical progenitors displayed lower levels of fatty acid oxidation than their mouse counterparts, in line with their protracted pattern. Treatments that enhance mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) accelerated the development of human cortical organoids, including faster progression of neural progenitor cell fate and precocious generation of late-born neurons and glia. FAO accelerated temporal patterning through increased Acetyl-CoA-dependent protein acetylation, including on specific histone transcriptional marks. Thus, species-specific metabolic rates regulate the turnover of post-translation modifications to set the scale of temporal gene regulatory networks of corticogenesis.

                Certain neurophysiological mechanisms of pain can be investigated in anesthetized animals, and such a model is potentially useful for the development of pain treatment. Yet, the interference of pain-related neural patterns and anesthesia-related patterns should be understood. Here we studied he interplay between acute pain-induced and urethane-induced EEG activity. We analyzed the activity of the rats' somatosensory cortex under urethane-induced anesthesia both before and after introducing a painful stimulus (formalin injection into the left hind limb). Our analysis of the EEG parameters, such as EEG amplitude, amplitude differences between the left and right hemispheres, and spectral entropy showed significant pain-related effects. The responses to painful stimuli depended on the anesthesia phase.

">Evidence of spinal cord comparator modules for rapid corrections of movements</a></h4>

              
                Successful movement requires continuous adjustments in response to changes in internal and external environments. To do so, neural circuits continuously compare efference copies of motor commands with sensory input to respond to sensory prediction errors. Some responses need to be very fast and, for limbs, likely occur in as yet undefined spinal cord circuits. Here, we describe spinal circuits involving dI3 neurons, showing that they receive multimodal sensory inputs and direct efferent copies from both Renshaw cells and motor neurons. We further show that they form connections to motor pools, including diverging connections to antagonist motor nuclei. Reducing dI3 neuronal activity diminished stumbling responses, as did disrupting Renshaw cell circuits, providing evidence for a comparator role of dI3 neurons for online corrections. Together, our findings reveal a pivotal role for dI3 neurons functioning as comparators of internal predictions and external sensory feedback to mediate rapid corrections of ongoing movements.

                While alterations in brain lipids are a central feature of Alzheimer s disease (AD), therapeutic strategies targeting brain lipid metabolism are still lacking. Prior preclinical work has shown that pharmacological inhibition of the fatty acid desaturase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), leads to recovery of hippocampal synapses with associated improvements in learning and memory in the slow-progressing 3xTg AD mouse model. Here, we used the rapidly progressing, highly amyloidogenic 5xFAD AD model to further delve into the effect of the SCD inhibitor (SCDi) on AD-associated fatty acid alterations and synapse loss. Hippocampus, cortex and plasma samples were collected from male and female 5xFAD and non-carrier control mice for fatty acid profiling and assessment of disease hallmarks. Plaque pathology, gliosis, and fatty acid alterations that included an increase in the C16:1/C16:0 desaturation index, a measure of SCD enzymatic activity, were apparent in the female hippocampus at 5 months of age, with similar fatty acid changes appearing in males by 8 months. Intracerebroventricular infusion of SCDi via osmotic pump for 28 days in 5 months old female 5xFAD and NC mice modulated the SCD-related fatty acid disturbances as well as PUFA concentrations. Quantification of Golgi staining revealed an SCDi-induced recovery of dendritic spine density. The beneficial effects of SCDi treatment on fatty acid balance and hippocampal dendritic spines in this more aggressive amyloidogenic 5xFAD model further support SCD inhibition as a promising therapeutic avenue for AD.

">Evaluation of Data-based Motion Correction Techniques for High Temporal Resolution Functional PET</a></h4>

              
                Functional Positron Emission Tomography (fPET) data offers novel insights into brain energy demands and molecular connectivity. Recent advances in improving temporal resolutions for this imaging technique have opened up new research possibilities. However, lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) inherent to short PET frames bring into question whether current realignment approaches still provide appropriate motion correction. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of standard motion correction methods and explore potential improvements for high temporal resolution fPET with 3s frames. We investigated two techniques aimed at improving the SNR to facilitate more accurate realignment of fPET images, in comparison to conventional motion correction: a deep-learning technique based on the application of a conditional generative adversarial network and an exponentially weighted sliding window average. Performance was evaluated by correlating rigid motion parameters between approaches and with simultaneously acquired fMRI data, and by assessing magnitudes of task-induced activation. Our results indicate that neither of the two methods substantially improve mitigation of motion artefacts. Given the increased computational effort of both techniques, we propose that the standard motion correction procedure is adequate for processing high temporal resolution fPET data. Nevertheless, future development of targeted strategies to enhance motion correction may further advance this imaging technique.

">Repeated Viewing of a Narrative Movie Changes Event Timescales in The Brain</a></h4>

              
                Many experiences occur repeatedly throughout our lives: we might watch the same movie more than once and listen to the same song on repeat. How does the brain modify its representations of events when experiences are repeated? We hypothesized that, with repeated viewing of a narrative movie, brain regions would adapt their event representations by becoming either finer (more detailed) or coarser (more generalized). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from 30 human participants who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while watching three 90-second clips from "The Grand Budapest Hotel" six times each. We used hidden Markov models and pattern similarity analysis applied to searchlights across the brain to quantify the strength of event structure at different timescales for each clip presentation. We then tested how event structure strength changed at both slow and fast timescales with repeated viewings. Most brain regions exhibited stability in the strength of event structure at both slow and fast timescales. Other regions, however, showed flexible event representations that became more or less granular across repeated clip presentations. Notably, several brain regions exhibited consistent changes in the strength of event structure at a slow timescale across different movie clips. Furthermore, in lateral occipital cortex and middle temporal gyrus, greater loss of event structure at a slow timescale predicted more detailed memory recall. These results highlight that event dynamics in the brain are not fixed, but can change flexibly with experience.

">Live access to the emotional dynamics of REM sleep dreams in lucid dreamers with narcolepsy</a></h4>

              
                Sleep helps regulate emotions, but it is still unclear whether -and how- the emotions we experience in dreams contribute to this regulation. To uncover the potential function of dream emotions, we must first understand what they are and how they unfold in dreams. The emotional content of dreams has mostly been studied using post-sleep dream reports, which provide a biased and static snapshot of a complex and dynamic experience. In this study, we took a more direct approach, accessing dream emotions in real-time. We asked twenty-four lucid dreamers with narcolepsy to report the emotional valence of their dreams, - positive, negative or neutral-, while still asleep, using predefined facial codes during daytime naps monitored with polysomnography. Of the 126 naps recorded, 62 contained at least one emotional code during REM sleep, yielding 191 codes in total. The ratios of positive and negative codes were evenly balanced per nap. The 33 naps with at least two codes allowed us to track the dream emotional dynamics. Over half of these naps showed opposite emotional valences (positive and negative). By measuring the time elapsed between codes, we estimated the average duration of a given dream's emotional valence in REM sleep to be about one minute. Positive emotions emerged on average earlier than negative ones during lucid REM sleep. These findings confirm the highly emotional nature of dreams and, more importantly, highlight that emotions in REM sleep dreams are fluid and fast-changing. Such emotional dynamics during REM sleep dreams may help us to better understand the mechanisms of the emotional regulatory function of dreams.

">Complex Patterns of Altered White Matter Structural Connectivity within a 'subjective valuation network' in Treatment-Resistant Depression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) poses a significant clinical challenge, demanding a deeper understanding of its neurobiological underpinnings to improve therapeutics. We examined white matter microstructure and structural connectivity in TRD, focusing on the "subjective valuation network" (SVN), which captures motivated behavior, reward processing, and emotional regulation circuits commonly altered in depression. This allowed us to identify potential neuroimaging biomarkers associated with treatment resistance. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired from a sample of age- and gender-balanced individuals with TRD (n = 44; female = 24, male = 11, non-binary/unchecked = 7) and non-depressed controls (n = 42; female = 27, male = 12, non-binary/unchecked = 5). Tract-based spatial statistics were used to compare whole-brain white matter integrity differences between groups. Probabilistic tractography was then used to assess fractional anisotropy (FA) and white matter structural connectivity within the SVN across groups. SVN was defined a priori based on converging functional connectivity studies and included key regions such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, and insula and their connecting white matter tracts. Additionally, correlations between clinical measures of depression severity and cognition and structural features of the network's white matter fibers (i.e., FA and structural connectivity) were explored. Results: Compared to non-depressed controls, individuals with TRD exhibited reduced FA within the left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and anterior cingulum, supporting widespread white matter integrity degradations in TRD. No correlations were found between FA and depression severity, suggesting a more specific association with anhedonic features. Whole-network measures of FA and structural connectivity of the SVN did not differ between groups. However, specific subcircuits' structural connectivity within the SVN differed between groups; namely, the white matter tracts connecting the insula-vmPFC, striatum-insula, and striatum-vmPFC. Hyperconnectivity emerged for patients with TRD for tracts connecting the insula-vmPFC and striatum-vmPFC region-pairs, with hypoconnectivity observed between the striatum-insula. Exploratory analyses for the TRD group indicated the subcircuits with altered structural connectivity within the SVN correlated with depressive severity. This indicates subcircuit network alterations may associate with greater difficulty experiencing pleasure -- a core symptom of depression and a potential marker of treatment resistance. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for widespread disruption of white matter microstructure and altered structural connectivity within specific subcircuits of the SVN in TRD. These findings point to an intricate pattern of structural hyper- and hypoconnectivity within the subcircuits of the SVN which may underlie the core symptoms of TRD. The altered structural connectivity within the SVN may contribute to the pathophysiology of TRD, especially concerning the motivational and emotional deficits associated with anhedonia. Future research employing multimodal neuroimaging techniques and longitudinal designs is warranted to further elucidate the functional consequences of these structural abnormalities and their potential as predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment interventions in TRD. Specifically, investigating how these white matter alterations change with successful treatment or targeted interventions aimed at improving anhedonia could inform more effective therapies for this challenging condition.

">Generating diffusion MRI scalar maps from T1-weighted images using Reversible GANs</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides valuable insights into brain tissue microstructure, but acquiring high-quality DTI data is time-intensive and not always feasible. To mitigate data scarcity and enhance accessibility, we investigate the generation of synthetic DTI scalar maps -- specifically mean diffusivity (MD) -- from structural 3D volumetric T1-weighted brain MRI using a reversible generative adversarial network (RevGAN). Unlike conventional pipelines requiring multiple steps, our approach enables a single-step translation from T1 to diffusion-derived measures. We assess the quality and utility of the synthetic maps in two downstream tasks: sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification. Performance comparisons between models trained on real and synthetic DTI maps demonstrate that RevGAN-generated images retain meaningful microstructural features and offer competitive accuracy, underscoring their potential for data augmentation and analysis in neuroimaging workflows. We also examine how well models trained on these data generalize to a new population dataset from India (NIMHANS cohort).

">Optimized Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping at 7T MRI for Assessing Iron Deposition in Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Elevated brain iron levels are common in Alzheimers disease (AD). Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is an advanced MRI technique for assessing iron accumulation. The optimized QSM at 7 Tesla (7T) MRI may further improve the sensitivity to detect subtle susceptibility changes in AD. METHODS: We optimized a QSM processing pipeline for 7T MRI by systematically comparing multiple reconstruction algorithms. Evaluation criteria included image quality, artifact suppression, and anatomical clarity. The finalized pipeline was applied to individuals with AD and healthy controls (HCs). RESULTS: The results revealed significantly elevated magnetic susceptibility values in the globus pallidus and dentate nucleus of the AD group compared to HCs. These findings were confirmed through both visual inspection and quantitative analysis of high-resolution QSM maps. DISCUSSION: Our results highlight the importance of optimizing QSM pipelines at 7T for accurate susceptibility quantification. We identified an optimal pipeline suitable for future applications in patients with AD and other neurological conditions.

">Direction of motion decoding in mouse V1: Neuron predictive power relates to functional connectivity organization</a></h4>

              
                Variability in single neuron responses presents a challenge in establishing reliable representations of visual stimuli essential for driving behavior. To enhance accuracy, integration of responses from multiple neurons is imperative. This study leverages simultaneous recordings from a large population (tens of hundreds) of neurons, achieved through in vivo mesoscopic 2-photon calcium imaging of the primary visual cortex (V1) in mice, under visual stimulus conditions as well as in resting state (absence of stimulus). The visual stimulus consisted of 16 distinct randomly shuffled directions of motion presented to the mice. We employed mutual information to identify neurons that contain the most significant information about the stimulus direction. As expected, neurons displaying high predictive power (HPP) in stimulus decoding exhibit elevated firing event rates during stimulus presentation. Furthermore, functional connectivity among HPP neurons during visual stimulation is denser and stronger compared to functional connectivity among other visually responsive neurons. Functional connections among HPP neurons appear to form independently of distance, suggesting a distributed yet highly coordinated network. In contrast, HPP neuronal activity and functional connectivity differed significantly at resting state. Specifically, during the resting state, HPP neurons exhibited lower event rates and functional connectivity structure that was not significantly different from that of other visually responsive neurons. This suggests that HPP neurons are less susceptible to being driven simultaneously by internal brain states in the absence of a stimulus. Finally, the tuning properties of HPP neurons were unexpectedly diverse: while some were sharply tuned, others conveyed a similar amount of mutual information, despite exhibiting much weaker tuning. This study sheds light on the organization of neuronal ensembles important for decoding visual motion direction in mouse area V1, contributing to the understanding of information processing in mouse visual cortex.

">Separating error from bias: A new framework for facial age estimation in humans and AIs</a></h4>

              
                Apparent facial age plays an important role in social interactions, serving a meaningful marker of biological aging. Although both humans and AIs achieve reasonable accuracy in estimating age from a person's face, performance remains imprecise, leaving substantial room for errors and biases. Drawing on principles from classical psychophysics, we demonstrate that the existing literature on age estimation suffers from a critical theoretical and methodological shortcoming, which casts doubt on established findings. We show that the conventional measure used to benchmark the accuracy of human and AI performance is fundamentally confounded by response bias. Consequently, we introduce a novel measure that eliminates this confound. A revised framework based on simulated data, reanalysis of existing data, and new experimental results, reveals fresh insights into how facial age is processed by humans and AIs. Our structure opens up new directions for future research and applications in the study of aging.

">NGN2 Expression and Regional Patterning Allow Rapid Differentiation from hiPSCs to DRG-Like Neurons Responsive to Type 2 Cytokines</a></h4>

              
                Itch or pruritus, is a sensation that elicits scratching behaviour and is a major symptom and cause of morbidity in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), prurigo nodularis (PN), and urticaria. Itch is often triggered by inflammatory stimuli in the skin including type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, and/or IL-31. Several therapies targeting type 2 immune pathways have been developed to treat pruritus; however, itch improvement in many patients remains to be improved. Thus, additional approaches to modulate sensory neuron activity are needed. Ex vivo or even in vitro study of the molecular mechanisms underlying primary sensory neuron activation is challenging since harvesting neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in patients can only be done from cadavers. Herein, we describe rapid human sensory neurons generation (2 days to precursor cells) by in vitro differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) from simultaneous application of patterning factors with NGN2 overexpression. We show that these hiPSC-derived sensory neurons possess key characteristics of primary sensory neurons. They express key neuronal markers, such as TRKA receptors, TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, and functionally respond to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin. In addition, they express key type 2 cytokine receptors such as interleukin (IL)-4R and IL31-R, known to promote itch in AD and PN. Moreover, these cells are functional as our sensory neurons respond to IL-4, IL-13 and IL-31 stimulation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that our protocol generates a phenotypic profile consistent with native somatosensory neurons that can facilitate development of novel approaches to model and treat pruritic disease.

">Median Preoptic Astrocytes: Role in Sleep Regulation and Potential Mediators of Sex Differences</a></h4>

              
                One in three Americans suffer from chronic sleep disorders, and women are 40% more likely than men to experience sleep disorders. This disparity emerges at puberty and is strongly associated with fluctuations in the ovarian hormone, estrogen (E2), suggesting that E2 and biological sex are a risk factor for sleep disorders. Previous work in the lab has demonstrated that E2 suppresses sleep in female rats, including in sleep deprived rats whose homeostatic need for sleep is increased. However, the specific mechanism for E2 induced decrease in sleep remains unknown. Work in the lab suggests a role for adenosine in mediating E2s sleep suppressive effects; E2 significantly increases Median Preoptic Nucleus (MnPO) extracellular adenosine and attenuates the action of specific agonists on the sleep promoting A2A-Receptor. Astrocytes represent a major source of adenosine in the CNS and have been shown to influence neuronal activity and downstream behaviors. In this project, we tested the hypothesis that astrocytes mediate E2s sleep suppressive effects. We used Gq-linked designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to evaluate the Gq pathway, which represents a core signaling mechanism in astrocyte activity. We found that, in female rats, activation of Gq signaling in astrocytes decreased sleep and inhibited homeostatic need for sleep. We further expressed the Pleckstrin Homology domain of PLC-like protein (p130PH), which has been shown to attenuate astrocyte activity and functions, in median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) astrocytes. We found that p130PH expression in MnPO astrocytes raised homeostatic sleep pressure to the same extent as 6 hours of sleep deprivation. We further report that inhibiting astrocytic function did not prevent E2s sleep suppressing effects suggesting that astrocytes may not play a role in estrogenic modulation of sleep. However, we did discover that MnPO astrocyte effects on sleep are sex-dependent. p130PH expression in MnPO astrocytes increased sleep and homeostatic sleep drive in female rats but showed a trend towards decreasing sleep and homeostatic sleep need in males. Further, while astrocyte effects on homeostatic sleep need are relegated to the dark phase in female rats, astrocytes appear to influence homeostatic sleep need in both the dark and light phase. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a sex-based difference in astrocyte effects on sleep and homeostatic sleep pressure.

">Mice navigate scent trails using predictive policies</a></h4>

              
                Animals actively sense their environment to extract features of interest to guide behaviors. For mammals, odors are prominent environmental features which are sampled by active modulation of sniffing and orofacial orientation. We sought to understand the strategies that mice use to navigate surface-bound odor cues. We presented mice with dynamic, non-repeating odor trails using a paper treadmill, and observed their behaviors as they collected rewards offered randomly along the trail. By combining high-speed videography over long distances with quantitative behavioral analyses, we find that mice rapidly learn to track odor trails persistently and precisely. Mice with a single nostril blocked can track odor trails, but with a lateral bias and lower precision than control animals. Tracking is severely impaired in animals with both nostrils intact but with interhemispheric communication disrupted by anterior commissure transection. Respiration measurements revealed that a sniff close to the trail triggers a rapid turn towards the trail, a reaction that is lost in commissure-cut animals. Importantly, trail tracking is not simply reactive but involves adaptation to and retention of a short-term memory of the trail geometry and statistics. Our results, recapitulated by a Bayesian inference model, indicate that mice combine immediate sensory information with an internal model of the odor environment to follow odor trails efficiently.

">Using Diffusion Transformers to Generate Synthetic Diffusion Scalar Maps for Data Augmentation</a></h4>

              
                Generation of high-quality synthetic brain MRI data could be beneficial for advancing neuroimaging research, particularly when access to large-scale, labeled datasets is limited. In this work, we leverage a pretrained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to synthesize 3D mean diffusivity (MD) scalar maps from the Cam-CAN dataset. To adapt the DiT model -- originally trained on 2D natural images -- for 3D neuroimaging data, we implemented a preprocessing strategy that tiles 2D slices from 3D volumes into composite 2D images, enabling effective finetuning. The quality of the generated synthetic images was evaluated using Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, demonstrating high fidelity and anatomical coherence. To assess the utility of synthetic data in downstream tasks, we conducted transfer learning experiments for dementia classification on the ADNI dataset. A sex classification model, trained on both real and synthetic Cam-CAN data, was repurposed for this task, showing that synthetic samples can enhance model performance. These results highlight the potential of diffusion-based generative models for augmenting neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical applications.

">Evaluation of Deep Learning Algorithms to Predict Multiple Dementia-Related Neuropathologies from Brain MRI, Clinical and Genetic Data</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) involve overlapping neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies -- such as amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), tau, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), TDP-43, and alpha-synuclein -- that complicate diagnosis and treatment. While PET and CSF biomarkers are useful for detecting A{beta} and tau, they are invasive, expensive, and not widely available. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is non-invasive and widely accessible, offering an opportunity for pathology prediction when combined with deep learning. Most prior studies have focused on single-pathology detection, but there remains a need for models that can jointly predict multiple co-occurring pathologies. In this work, we evaluate deep learning models that integrate structural MRI with demographic, clinical, and genetic data to classify six autopsy-confirmed neuropathologies: A{beta}, tau, CAA, TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis, and dementia with Lewy bodies. We compare our hybrid deep learning model to AutoGluon, an automated machine learning framework. Our findings support the potential of multimodal AI to enable non-invasive, comprehensive neuropathological profiling in ADRD.

">Improving neuroimaging headgear placement robustness using facial-landmark guided augmented reality</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Accurate and consistent probe placement is crucial in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments, especially in longitudinal and group-based studies. Both operator experience and subject head shape variability can affect placement accuracy. Aim: We aim to develop an easy-to-use software, NeuroNavigatAR (NNAR), utilizing augmented reality (AR) and machine-learning to estimate and display in real-time the subject's cranial and head landmarks to guide consistent headgear placement. Approach: By applying a facial recognition toolbox to the image frames extracted from a video camera, we can obtain and continuously track subject-specific three-dimensional (3-D) facial landmarks. Separately, we have precomputed a robust linear transformation between facial landmarks and key cranial landmarks, including nasion and preauricular points, using a large public head-model library consisting of over 1,000 subjects. These allow us to rapidly estimate subject-specific cranial landmarks and subsequently render atlas-derived head landmarks to the subject's camera stream. Results: An open-source graphical user interface implementing this AR system has achieved a speed of 15 frame-per-second using a laptop. A median 10-20 position error of 1.52 cm was found when using a general adult atlas, and is further reduced to 1.33 cm and 0.75 cm when using age-matched atlas models and subject-specific head surfaces, respectively. NNAR demonstrated consistent head-landmark prediction errors across repeated measurement sessions; there is also no statistically significant difference in accuracy across age groups. Conclusions: NNAR is an easy-to-use AR headgear placement monitoring tool that is expected to significantly enhance consistency and reduce setup time for fNIRS and EEG probe donning across a wide range of studies.

">Frequency-selective contrast sensitivity modulation driven by fine-tuned exogenous attention at the foveal scale</a></h4>

              
                Exogenous attention is a rapid, involuntary mechanism that automatically reallocates processing resources toward salient stimuli. It enhances visual sensitivity in the vicinity of the salient stimulus, both in extrafoveal regions and within the high-acuity foveola. While the spatial frequencies modulated by exogenous attention in extrafoveal vision are well characterized, it remains unknown how this mechanism operates within the foveola, which can resolve spatial frequencies up to 30 cycles per degree (CPD). Here, we examined which spatial frequencies were enhanced by fine-grained deployments of exogenous attention within this highest-acuity region of the visual field. Using high-precision eye-tracking and gaze-contingent display control to precisely localize gaze during attentional allocation, we found that exogenous attention at the foveal scale selectively enhances contrast sensitivity for low- to mid-range spatial frequencies (4-8 CPD), with no significant benefits for higher spatial frequencies (12-20 CPD). In contrast, attention-related benefits on asymptotic performance at the highest contrast were observed across a wide range of spatial frequencies. These results indicate that, despite the high-resolution capacity of the foveola, exogenous attention remains an inflexible mechanism that, even at this scale, selectively enhances contrast gain for lower spatial frequencies-mirroring its behavior in extrafoveal vision.

">A Neural Circuit for Modular Gating of Organ Somatosensation</a></h4>

              
                End-organs such as the bladder rely on a delicate balance between internal urgency and voluntary restraint. However, the specific spinal circuits coordinating these functions remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a genetically defined population of lumbosacral spinal interneurons marked byTrpc4expression that gate bladder sensory input and regulate micturition reflexes. Single-cell transcriptomics and in situ physiology reveal molecularly distinctTrpc4subtypes. Functional manipulation reveals that Trpc4 neurons are essential for coordinating bladder-sphincter activity and gating visceral pain. Their ablation leads to bladder hypersensitivity and voiding dysfunction, while targeted activation reverses these maladaptive states. Circuit tracing reveals convergence of primary afferent and descending brainstem inputs ontoTrpc4neurons. These findings establishTrpc4interneurons are critical for bladder sensory-motor integration and extend classical spinal gating models to encompass visceral pain and organ reflex control.

">Molecularly defined auditory neuron subtypes show different vulnerabilities to noise- and age-related synaptopathy in mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal subtype-specific synaptopathy is a hallmark of many forms of neurodegeneration. We examined the cellular basis for synaptic vulnerability in the auditory system, where three subtypes of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) - Ia, Ib, and Ic - carry acoustic information from the cochlea to the brain. In response to noise and aging, a subset of synapses between inner hair cells and SGNs are lost, but it is unclear how this loss varies across SGN subtypes. Using genetic labelling, we showed that Ia SGNs have larger post-synaptic densities (PSDs) than Ib and Ic SGNs and are the most resilient subtype. Ia PSD volumes increased with age and were unchanged after noise exposure. By contrast, average Ib/Ic PSD volumes did not change with age but decreased with noise. Genetic reprogramming of Ib/Ic neurons to a Ia-like identity provided significant protection against noise-induced synaptopathy, linking identity to resilience and providing an entry point for therapeutics.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The dorsal midline thalamus (DMT) is composed of the paraventricular (PV) and paratenial (PT) nuclei. While the anatomical and functional properties of PV are well-established, PT has remarkably received very little attention—even though the efferent projections of PV and PT are very similar. Using a combination of retrograde tracing and immunohistochemistry, we examined the anatomical inputs to PT and compared them with those to the anterior and posterior PV and to the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. In addition, we examined orexinergic and serotonergic afferents to the PT, comparing them with those to other thalamic nuclei. We found that PT and PV receive input from a common set of structures, including the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, septum, subiculum of the hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. However, the pattern and density of these various afferents to PT and PV significantly differed. For instance, PT received much stronger inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex, while PV received stronger projections from the subiculum of the hippocampus and more widespread input from the hypothalamus and the brainstem. By comparison, afferents to AD differed from PT (and PV), as AD received substantial input from the retrosplenial and anterior cingulate cortices, and uniquely from the lateral mammillary nucleus. Further, orexinergic (ORX) and serotonergic (5-HT) fibers distributed at best modestly to PT, which contrasted with quite dense ORX and 5-HT innervation of PV. The present findings, essentially representing the first comprehensive examination of afferent projections to PT, show that the inputs to PT mainly arise from limbic forebrain structures—with pronounced projections from the orbitofrontal cortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. The functional properties of PT partially overlap with those of PV, but as described herein PT also participates in unique affective, cognitive, and motivational behaviors.</p>

<p>The multi-compartmental organization of spleen-projecting neurons—from the celiac ganglia to the spleen—complicates anatomical identification. We provide a dissection guide, characterize their microstructure, and use neuronal tracing to validate the celiac ganglia–spleen connection while demonstrating that these neurons can be transduced by a viral vector.

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the crucial role played by the sympathetic spleen innervation in regulating immune cell function involving fighting pathogens or tissue injury. These findings have sparked interest across different research fields with a common goal of understanding and manipulating splenic sympathetic activity to modulate immune function and inflammation. However, the anatomical identification of spleen-projecting neurons in rodents presents a considerable challenge, given the multi-compartmentalized location of their cellular components.</p>
<p>This article addresses this challenge by providing a detailed anatomical dissection guide of the mouse celiac ganglion and splenic nerve, harboring the cell body and projecting axons, respectively. By combining antero- and retrograde neuronal tracing, immunofluorescence, 3D reconstruction, and viral tracing techniques, we validate the connectivity between the celiac ganglion and the spleen and provide insights into their microanatomy. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of viral transduction in these neurons. Additionally, we identified nerve-associated macrophages (NAMs) within the splenic nerve and demonstrated their responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Our findings offer a comprehensive anatomical framework for studying spleen-projecting neurons, paving the way for future investigations into their role in immune regulation and inflammation, as well as their manipulation using advanced neurobiological tools.</p>

Bone health is a growing concern in aging populations, and bioactive peptides in dairy products offer a promising approach to preventing bone-related diseases. However, the lack of a public database for osteogenic peptides (OPs) has limited the computational detection efforts. In this work, we introduce OP-AND, a curated public database of osteogenic peptides. We also propose a novel hypothesis that peptides derived from proteins involved in osteoclast formation may serve as non-osteogenic. Considering the limited availability of OP data, we present SimPep, a deep learning framework that achieves 86.87% accuracy and 76.88% area under receiver-operating characteristic curve score using 5-fold cross-validation. SimPep’s performance is further evaluated on external datasets, and a pipeline is introduced to select potential OPs for experimental studies. The camel milk alpha s1-casein peptide ‘MKLLILTCLVAVALARPKYPLRYPEVF’ is highlighted as a top candidate for future exploration. The OP-AND database is available in https://github.com/CBRC-lab/SimPep_and_OP-AND.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013376">The R-loop grammar predicts R-loop formation under different topological constraints</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Margherita Maria Ferrari, Svetlana Poznanović, Manda Riehl, Jacob Lusk, Stella Hartono, Georgina Gonzalez-Isunza, Frédéric Chédin, Mariel Vázquez, Nataša Jonoska</p>

R-loops are transient three-stranded nucleic acids that form during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes with the template DNA, freeing the non-template strand of the DNA. There is growing evidence that R-loops play important roles in physiological processes such as the regulation of gene expression, and that they contribute to chromosomal instability and disease. It is known that R-loop formation is influenced by both the sequence and the topology of the DNA substrate, but many questions remain about how R-loops form and the three-dimensional structures that they adopt. Here we represent an R-loop as a word in a formal grammar, the <i>R-loop grammar</i>. We use the R-loop grammar to predict R-loop formation. We train the R-loop grammar on experimental data obtained by single-molecule R-loop footprinting and sequencing (SMRF-seq). Despite not explicitly encoding topological information, the R-loop grammar accurately predicts R-loop formation on plasmids with varying starting topologies and outperforms previous methods in R-loop prediction.

                <p>by Arnab Mutsuddy, Jonah R. Huggins, Aurore K. Amrit, Atalanta Manuela Harley-Gasaway, Cemal Erdem, Evan T. Jones, Olivia G. Laurine, Jon C. Calhoun, Marc R. Birtwistle</p>

Data from cell viability assays, which measure cumulative division and death events in a population and reflect substantial cellular heterogeneity, are widely available. However, interpreting such data with mechanistic computational models is hindered because direct model/data comparison is often muddled. We developed an algorithm that tracks simulated division and death events in mechanistically-detailed single-cell lineages to enable such a model/data comparison and suggest causes of cell-cell drug response variability. Using our previously developed model of mammalian single-cell proliferation and death signaling, we simulated drug dose response experiments for four targeted anti-cancer drugs (alpelisib, neratinib, trametinib and palbociclib) and compared them to experimental data. Simulations are consistent with data for strong growth inhibition by trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and overall lack of efficacy for alpelisib (PI-3K inhibitor), but are inconsistent with data for palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and neratinib (EGFR inhibitor). Model/data inconsistencies suggest that (i) the importance of CDK4/6 for driving the cell cycle may be overestimated, and (ii) the cellular balance between basal (tonic) and ligand-induced signaling is a critical determinant of receptor inhibitor response. Simulations show subpopulations of rapidly and slowly dividing cells in both control and drug-treated conditions. Variations in mother cells prior to drug treatment impinging on ERK pathway activity are associated with the rapidly dividing phenotype and trametinib resistance. This work lays a foundation for the application of mechanistic modeling to large-scale cell viability datasets and better understanding determinants of cellular heterogeneity in drug response.

                <p>by Francesca Soncin</p>

The placenta is one of the most diverse organs among eutherian mammals, and comparative placentation studies can reveal fundamental processes that support a successful pregnancy. A new study in PLOS Biology uses swine placental organoids and in vivo spatial transcriptomics to uncover key insights into placental cell diversity and evolution.

More work is needed to characterize the evolutionary diversity of placental development in eutherian mammals. This Primer discusses a recent PLOS Biology study that provides a rich spatial transcriptomic characterization of the porcine placenta and develops a new swine trophoblast organoid model

<p>Graphical abstract illustrating the study design, experimental workflow, and key findings from single-cell profiling of peripheral mononuclear cells in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing anti-CD20 therapy, revealing disease- and treatment-associated immune signatures.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate disease-related and anti-CD20 therapy-related changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using multi-omics single-cell analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Targeted single-cell sequencing of transcriptomes and epitopes was performed on PBMCs isolated from 64 blood samples collected from MS patients at baseline and at 3 time points following anti-CD20 treatment, alongside HC. Multicolor spectral flow cytometry was performed on 15 of the samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cell cluster analysis identified a subpopulation of classical monocytes with significantly high interleukin-1 beta (<i>IL1B</i>) expression and a pro-inflammatory profile compared to other monocyte clusters. This monocyte cluster expressed genes of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as <i>CXCL8</i>, <i>CCL3</i>, <i>CCL4</i>, and <i>TNFα</i> and was a major cell transmitter subset within the intercellular communication network. The IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster was prevalent in HC (8.1% of PBMCs), but reduced in untreated MS patients (0.8% of PBMCs). High <i>CXCR4</i> expression and Gene Ontology-term analysis indicated that IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes from MS patients had central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating abilities in contrast to HC, likely regulated by <i>LEF1</i>. After anti-CD20 treatment, IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes showed changes in pro-inflammatory gene expression and <i>MYC</i>-associated regulatory networks, and their abundance increased 6-fold in the blood.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our single-cell analysis identified a unique peripheral IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster with a suggested CNS-infiltrating cellular phenotype that may explain its lower abundance in the blood of untreated compared to anti-CD20 treated MS patients. Treatment-associated changes in this population may contribute to the non-B cell related effects of anti-CD20 therapy. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a highly variable, multisystemic genetic disorder caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of <i>DMPK.</i> Toxicity is exerted by repeat-containing <i>DMPK</i> transcripts that sequester muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins and lead to deleterious yet predictable changes in alternative splicing. To contend with high phenotypic and molecular variability that complicate application of viral-based therapies, we develop and test a DM1-responsive genetic element to control viral-based therapeutic output.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used MBNL-dependent cassette exons to generate adeno-associated virus (AAV)-compatible control elements (DMX<sup>on</sup>). Minigenes were tested in vitro using a Dox-inducible MBNL1 cell model and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DM1 myotubes and in vivo using DM1 model mice following intramuscular and systemic AAV injection. DMX<sup>on</sup> splicing, correction of endogenous splicing or skeletal muscle myotonia, and prevention of cardiac toxicity associated with therapeutic MBNL1 overexpression were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DMX<sup>on</sup> cassettes respond to MBNL1 dose or expression of CUG repeat RNA. DMX<sup>on</sup> controlled expression of therapeutic MBNL1 protein can improve skeletal muscle myotonia or prevent cardiac toxicity due to MBNL1 overexpression in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMX<sup>on</sup> control elements can increase the therapeutic window of viral-based therapeutics in DM1, and activity is dependent upon delivered cargo and model severity. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Parkinson's disease (PD), the power of beta oscillations (± 13–30 hertz [Hz]) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFPs) is associated with motor symptoms. Beta power can be used for adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) algorithms based upon symptom fluctuations. The time course of beta power modulations after levodopa intake at home remains to be described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten-minute averages of beta peak power were recorded in 33 patients with PD treated with STN-DBS for a median duration of 134 days during the titration phase. Median beta power after scheduled medication intakes (n = 24,103) and the effects of peak frequency, stun effect, stimulation amplitude, levodopa dose, and preoperative levodopa response were analyzed using cluster-based permutation testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Beta power was significantly reduced between 30 and 140 minutes after intake for stimulation amplitudes between 0 and 2.1 mA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). This response was seen in low (12.7–20.5 Hz) but not high (21.5–30.3 Hz) beta frequencies. Significant clusters were found regardless of stun effect and preoperative levodopa response, during low stimulation amplitudes (&lt; 1 mA), and for 100 and 150 mg but not 50 mg doses. A linear mixed-effects model for the area under the curve (AUC) levodopa beta response (30–180 min) revealed a dose–response relationship, a stronger negative response in low-beta compared with high-beta frequencies, and no significant effect of stimulation amplitude.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STN beta power responds to levodopa during low to moderate stimulation amperages, depending on the beta peak frequency and dose, which is informative for aDBS implementation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Mechanotransduction is essential for complex cellular behaviors such as muscle contraction and hearing sensation. RNA processing is a molecular mechanism that regulates gene expression. Bais and Giudice review the recently growing body of research showing that mechanotransduction and RNA processing work together to modulate cell adaptations to mechanical forces.

                PI5P4Kα is a critical metabolic gatekeeper in PDAC, promoting glucose and iron acquisition to support tumor survival. Arora et al. demonstrate that PI5P4Kα suppression disrupts the metabolic flexibility of PDAC cells, leading to apoptotic cell death, revealing a highly actionable therapeutic vulnerability.

                Suzuki et al. demonstrate that mosquito salivary gland extracts enhance flavivirus pathogenicity through TLR2-mediated recruitment of immune cells. These findings suggest that TLR2 contributes to early immune modulation at the infection site and represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102681">The long noncoding RNA lnc-FANCI-2 intrinsically restricts RAS signaling in human papillomavirus type 16-infected cervical cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2, a newly discovered long noncoding RNA, is associated with cervical lesion progression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 1 (CIN1, low grade), CIN2–3 (high grade), to cervical cancer. Viral oncoprotein E7 of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) and host transcription factor YY1 are two major factors promoting lnc-FANCI-2 expression. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we knocked out the expression of <i>lnc-FANCI-2</i> in the HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell line, CaSki cells. The selected knockout (KO) single-cell clones displayed altered cell morphology and proliferation with changes of cellular soluble receptors, but normal HPV16 E6 and E7 expression. Relative to the parental cells, lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells exhibited significantly increased RAS signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but decreased response to IFN signaling, along with increased p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 (two RAS signaling effectors), IGFBP3, MCAM, VIM, and CCND2 (cyclin D2) and decreased expression of RAC3. lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki interacts with cellular proteins H13, HNRH1, K1H1, MAP4K4, and RNPS1. MAP4K4 knockdown led to enhance the expression of p-Erk1/2 and p-Akt. High lnc-FANCI-2 and low MCAM levels in cervical cancer tissues were found to be associated with patients’ survival. A key function of lnc-FANCI-2 intrinsically regulates RAS signaling to impact cervical lesion progression and cervical cancer prognosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100257">Identifying in vivo genetic dependencies of melanocyte and melanoma development</a></h4>

              
                The advent of large-scale sequencing in both development and disease has identified large numbers of candidate genes that may be linked to important phenotypes. We have developed a rapid, scalable system for assessing the role of candidate genes using zebrafish. We generated transgenic zebrafish in which Cas9 was knocked in to the endogenous <i>mitfa</i> locus, a master transcription factor of the melanocyte lineage. The main advantage of this system compared to existing techniques is maintenance of endogenous regulatory elements. We used this system to identify both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous regulators of normal melanocyte development. We then applied this to the melanoma setting to demonstrate that loss of genes required for melanocyte survival can paradoxically promote more aggressive phenotypes, highlighting that in vitro screens can mask in vivo phenotypes. Our genetic approach offers a versatile tool for exploring developmental processes and disease mechanisms that can readily be applied to other cell lineages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105978">Cap-independent co-expression of dsRNA-sensing and NF-κB pathway inhibitors enables controllable self-amplifying RNA expression with reduced immunotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) holds promise for durable therapeutic gene expression, but its broader utility beyond vaccines is limited by potent innate immune responses triggered during replication. These responses shut down translation, induce cytotoxicity, degrade host mRNAs, and drive cytokine production. While exogenous immunosuppressants can blunt these effects, they complicate treatment and risk systemic side effects. To address this, we engineered ‘immune-evasive saRNA’ that intrinsically suppresses the innate immune pathways triggered by its own replication. This strategy leverages cap-independent translation to co-express a suite of inhibitors from a single saRNA transcript, targeting key innate immune pathways, including protein kinase R (PKR), oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)/RNase L, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In primary mouse fibroblast-like synoviocytes, a cell type central to the pathology of joint diseases, immune-evasive saRNA enables sustained transgene expression without external immunosuppressants, substantially reducing cytotoxicity and antiviral cytokine secretion. Crucially, this system offers both concentration-dependent control of expression and on-demand termination via a small-molecule antiviral. Together, these findings establish a framework for developing saRNA therapeutics with an improved tolerability profile that can be switched off once therapeutic outcomes are met, offering a path toward a controllable gene expression platform that fills the therapeutic gap between the transience of mRNA and the permanence of viral vectors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105471">Thrifty wide-context models of B cell receptor somatic hypermutation</a></h4>

              
                Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is the diversity-generating process in antibody affinity maturation. Probabilistic models of SHM are needed for analyzing rare mutations, understanding the selective forces guiding affinity maturation, and understanding the underlying biochemical process. High-throughput data offers the potential to develop and fit models of SHM on relevant data sets. In this article, we model SHM using modern frameworks. We are motivated by recent work suggesting the importance of a wider context for SHM; however, assigning an independent rate to each k-mer leads to an exponential proliferation of parameters. Thus, using convolutions on 3-mer embeddings, we develop ‘thrifty’ models of SHM of various sizes; these can have fewer free parameters than a 5-mer model and yet have a significantly wider context. These offer a slight performance improvement over a 5-mer model, and other modern model elaborations worsen performance. We also find that a per-site effect is not necessary to explain SHM patterns given nucleotide context. Also, the two current methods for fitting an SHM model—on out-of-frame sequence data and on synonymous mutations—produce significantly different results, and augmenting out-of-frame data with synonymous mutations does not aid out-of-sample performance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104355">Multi-omics investigation of spontaneous T2DM macaque emphasizes gut microbiota could up-regulate the absorption of excess palmitic acid in the T2DM progression</a></h4>

              
                Although gut microbiota and lipid metabolites have been suggested to be closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the interactions between gut microbiota, lipid metabolites, and the host in T2DM development remains unclear. Rhesus macaques may be the best animal model to investigate these relationships given their spontaneous development of T2DM. We identified eight spontaneous T2DM macaques and conducted a comprehensive study investigating the relationships using multi-omics sequencing technology. Our results from 16 S rRNA, metagenome, metabolome, and transcriptome analyses identified that gut microbiota imbalance, tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid β oxidation disorders, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) accumulation, and inflammation occurred in T2DM macaques. We verified the accumulation of palmitic acid (PA) and activation of inflammation in T2DM macaques. Importantly, mice transplanted with spontaneous T2DM macaque fecal microbiota and fed a high PA diet developed prediabetes within 120 days. We determined that gut microbiota mediated the absorption of excess PA in the ileum, resulting in the accumulation of PA in the serum, consequently leading to T2DM in mice. In particular, we demonstrated that the specific microbiota composition was probably involved in the process. This study provides new insight into interactions between microbiota and metabolites and confirms causative effect of gut microbiota on T2DM development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102232">Temporal dynamics of viral fitness and the adaptive immune response in HCV infection</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have shown that viral variants that elude the host immune response may incur a fitness expense, diminishing the survival of the viral strain within the host, and the capacity of the variant to survive future transmission events. This definition can be divided into intrinsic fitness—fitness without immune pressure—and effective fitness, which includes immune influence. Co-occurring mutations outside immune-targeted epitope regions may also affect variant survival (epistasis). Analysis of viral fitness and epistasis over the non-structural protein regions is lacking for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Using a rare cohort of subjects recently infected with HCV, we build on prior work by integrating mathematical modeling and experimental data to examine the interplay between transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses, immune responses, fitness, and co-occurring mutations. We show that viral fitness declines during the first 90 days post-infection (DPI), associated with the magnitude of CD8 +T cell responses and early diversification. Fitness then rebounds in a complex pattern marked by co-occurring mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that an early, strong CD8 +T cell response in the absence of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) exerts strong selective pressure, allowing escape and chronic infection. These insights support HCV vaccine strategies that elicit broad T and B cell immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98666">Mesolimbic dopamine ramps reflect environmental timescales</a></h4>

              
                Mesolimbic dopamine activity occasionally exhibits ramping dynamics, reigniting debate on theories of dopamine signaling. This debate is ongoing partly because the experimental conditions under which dopamine ramps emerge remain poorly understood. Here, we show that during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning in mice, mesolimbic dopamine ramps are only observed when the inter-trial interval is short relative to the trial period. These results constrain theories of dopamine signaling and identify a critical variable determining the emergence of dopamine ramps.

Here, we looked at Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC) to assess interactions between SWO phase and HGB power. We use a publicly-available electrocorticography (ECoG) dataset recorded during repetitive motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) of hand and tongue movements. We found channels with significant SWO-HGB PAC for all subjects and tasks, distributed across multiple brain regions. In the sensorimotor cortex PAC occurred at specific coupling phases and was primarily observed during ME, while frontal and temporal regions exhibited similar PAC levels across ME and MI but lacked distinct preferred coupling phases. When training decoders for movement detection, PAC underperformed compared to SWOs or HGB; however, it showed a strong correlation with accuracy when single-channel SWOs were used as decoding feature, highlighting its potential for channel selection. Weaker correlations were found when PAC was compared to task-related HGB power increases, suggesting that these represent distinct neural features.</span>

                <p>Cortical tracking of the speech envelope is an emerging, noninvasive measure of neurophysiological processing of speech that is being widely adopted. It demonstrates good ecological validity, as it allows researchers to study human processing of continuous, naturalistic speech containing dynamic spectrotemporal variations and rich linguistic content. While measures of cortical tracking have strong clinical and research applications, there is a lack of research documenting the reliability of these measures, including how they are affected by the stimulus and how the stimulus is represented, as well as electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition and analysis parameters. In this study, we measured the test&ndash;retest reliability of cortical tracking of the speech envelope across different stimuli (an audiobook vs a podcast), stimulus features (broadband envelope and its derivative, multiband envelope and its derivative), reference electrodes (average mastoid vs common average reference), and EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, full) in 26 neurotypical adults (20 female) to assess the potential for cortical tracking to serve as a reliable measure of speech processing. We also examined the amount of data required to achieve stable reliability estimates. We observed moderate to good test&ndash;retest reliability for most parameters with as little as 390&nbsp;s of data, supporting the utility of cortical tracking of the speech envelope as a reliable tool for assessing speech processing. The findings of this study will allow researchers to more effectively design and implement studies on cortical tracking in neurotypical adults and adults with language disorders.</p>

                <p>Sleep is a vital physiological phenomenon observed among almost all organisms. Although its exact purpose remains elusive, sleep has been linked to memory consolidation. In our present study, we investigated the role of sleep quality on sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Previous studies have shown that <I>tequila</I>, a serine protease, affects long-term memory (LTM) consolidation in flies. In the present study, we identified that the hypomorphic mutation in the <I>tequila</I> gene (<I>tequila<sup>f01792</sup></I>) leads to increased daytime sleep fragmentation at a very early age in male flies. Intrigued by this observation, we delved into further understanding the role of <I>tequila</I> in sleep-dependent memory consolidation by manipulating sleep duration using pharmacological methods such as GABA-A agonist. Inducing sleep using GABA-A agonist resulted in improved sleep during the day. This further led to a significant improvement in the LTM of these flies when compared with the vehicle-treated flies. In conclusion, daytime-dependent sleep fragmentation is possibly one of the reasons behind the LTM deficit observed in <I>tequila<sup>f01792</sup></I> flies. Furthermore, we observed that these flies had disturbed sleep only during the daytime, whereas in the night the flies had increased sleep duration. The increased sleep fragmentation during the daytime possibly leads to memory impairment and rescuing sleep fragmentation partially rescues memory consolidation. These outcomes suggest that the <I>tequila</I> gene is involved in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.</p>

Understanding animal movements at different spatial scales presents a significant challenge as their patterns can vary widely from daily foraging behaviours to broader migration or territorial movements. This challenge is of general interest because it impacts the ability to manage wildlife populations effectively. In this study, we conduct diffusion analysis based on European badger (<i>Meles meles</i>) movement data obtained from three different regions in the UK (Gloucestershire, Cornwall, and Northern Ireland) and fit a generalised linear mixed-effects model to examine the relationship between variables. We also feature a novel application of <i>extended dynamic mode decomposition</i> (EDMD) to uncover patterns relating to badger social organisation. By applying our approach to these different populations, we were able to assess its performance across a range of badger densities. A key result was that in some areas, EDMD clusters matched observed group home ranges, whilst in others, discrepancies likely arose because of population management interventions, such as badger culling. The methods presented offer a promising approach for studying territoriality and the impacts of management strategies on animal movement behaviour.

                <p>by Daiki Wakita, Satoshi Yamaji, Daiki Umetsu, Takeshi Kano</p>

Collective cell behavior is fundamental to structure multicellular organisms. There, constituting cells always have heterogeneous properties across cell types (macro-heterogeneity) and within a cell type (micro-heterogeneity). Many studies have described the existence of heterogeneity in various systems at the cellular level, whereas little has investigated its effect on the systems. Unveiling how heterogeneity plays a role in the collective behavior would build a bridge from microscopic to macroscopic biological phenomena. We use the muscle remodeling in <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system, in which drastic reconstruction processes involve the physical interactions of various cells. At the early pupal stages, hundreds of hemocytes vigorously migrate and decompose the larval muscles into fragments called sarcolytes. We used in vivo and in silico approaches to understand how the dynamics of the sarcolyte population are characterized by hemocytes and other cells in the environment. Our in vivo imaging showed that the sarcolyte population gradually reduced the speed while changing the spatial arrangements. We also found that the sarcolyte dynamics involve macro-heterogeneity, namely, the coexistence of fat body cells and hemocytes, as well as micro-heterogeneity within hemocytes. To computationally evaluate the effects of factors determining the speed and arrangement of the sarcolyte population, we built a mathematical model assuming simplified interactions between sarcolytes, hemocytes, and fat body cells. Our simulations showed that, firstly, the efficient spreading and stable pattern formation of sarcolytes were together achieved by a delayed emergence of fat body cells and the micro-heterogeneity in hemocyte motility. Secondly, based on the similarity of observed and simulated network-like arrangements of sarcolytes, spatial confinement was another factor that causes the stabilization of sarcolytes. This study provides a pattern formation mechanism by which macro- and micro-heterogeneous migratory cells generate a ‘dual-purpose’ collective behavior—quickly spreading particles throughout the field while efficiently organizing them into an orderly arrangement.

Apoptosis has been reported to drive regeneration in many species. Executioner caspases, the key effectors in apoptosis, are responsible for production and secretion of various pro-regenerative signals from apoptotic cells to the surrounding cells. However, whether executioner caspase activation (ECA) can promote regeneration without inducing apoptosis is poorly understood. Here, by generating transgenic mice carrying a lineage tracing system for cells that have experienced ECA, we demonstrate that ECA occurs in a few hepatocytes in homeostatic livers. The fraction of hepatocytes with ECA dramatically expands during regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) treatment. Interestingly, rather than undergoing apoptosis, the majority of hepatocytes with ECA survive and proliferate during liver regeneration. Inhibition of ECA in livers results in reduced hepatocyte proliferation and impaired regeneration, whereas increasing ECA to a level sufficient to kill hepatocytes also impedes regeneration, suggesting that ECA needs to be precisely controlled at a sublethal level. Mechanistically, we show that ECA promotes hepatocyte proliferation through enhancing JAK/STAT3 activity. Our work reveals an essential apoptosis-independent role of executioner caspases in liver regeneration.

Ratios between two metabolites are sensitive indicators of metabolic changes. Lipidomic profiling studies have revealed that plasma ether lipids, a class of glycero- and glycerophospho-lipids with reported health benefits, are negatively associated with obesity. Here, we utilized lipid ratios as surrogate markers of lipid metabolism to explore the processes underlying the inverse relationship between ether lipid metabolism and obesity. Plasma lipidomics data from two independent human cohorts (<i>n</i> = 10,339 and <i>n</i> = 4,492) were integrated to assess the associations between 82 lipid ratios and obesity-related markers in males and females. Results were externally validated using mouse transcriptomics data from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (<i>n</i> = 152−227 across 74 strains). Genome-wide association studies using imputed genotypes from a population cohort (<i>n</i> = 4,492) were performed to examine the genetic architecture of the ratios. Findings showed that waist circumference (WC), body mass index, and waist–hip ratio were inversely associated with total plasmalogens relative to total phospholipids in both sexes. Ratios comprising product–substrate pairs positioned either side of enzymes involved in plasmalogen synthesis and degradation showed positive and negative associations with WC, respectively. Branched-chain fatty acids negatively correlated with WC, while omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids exhibited differing associations depending on their position within the pathway. Mouse transcriptomics corroborated these results. Genomics data showed strong associations between ratios containing choline-plasmalogens and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the transmembrane protein 229B (<i>TMEM229B</i>) gene region. This work demonstrates the utility of lipid ratios in understanding lipid metabolism. By applying the ratios to multi-omic datasets, we identified alterations in enzymatic activity and genetic variants likely affecting ether lipid synthesis in obesity that could not have been obtained from lipidomics data alone. Additionally, we characterized a potential role for <i>TMEM229B</i>, offering new perspectives on ether lipid metabolism and regulation.

The placenta is a dynamic, embryo-derived organ essential for fetal growth and development. While all eutherian mammals have placentas composed of fetal-derived trophoblasts that mediate maternal–fetal exchange, their anatomical and histological structures vary across species due to evolutionary divergence. Despite the cellular heterogeneity of porcine trophoblasts in vivo, understanding the mechanisms driving porcine placental development has been limited by the lack of in vitro models replicating this heterogeneity. In this study, we derived swine trophoblast organoids (sTOs) from full-term porcine placentas, retaining key transcriptional signatures of in vivo trophoblasts. To identify conserved cell populations, we integrated Visium spatial transcriptomics from mid-gestation porcine placentas with single-cell transcriptomics from sTOs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed novel markers of the porcine uterus and placenta, enabling precise separation of histological structures at the maternal–fetal interface. The integration of tissue and sTO transcriptomics showed that sTOs spontaneously differentiate into distinct trophoblast populations, with conserved gene expression and cell communication programs. These findings demonstrate that sTOs recapitulate porcine placental trophoblast populations, offering a powerful model for advancing placentation research. Our work also provides a spatially resolved whole-transcriptome dataset of the porcine maternal–fetal interface, opening new avenues for discoveries in placental development, evolution, and health across mammals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cortical malformations, including microgyria, are often associated with neurodevelopmental comorbidities such as epilepsy and cognitive impairments in humans. To investigate how early cortical disruption leads to persistent behavioral impairments, we employed a neonatal neocortical focal freeze lesion (FFL) model of polymicrogyria in male Wistar rats. Unilateral cortical lesions were induced at postnatal day 0 (P0), and molecular changes in hippocampal gene expression (glutamatergic signaling: <i>Grin1</i>, <i>Grin2a</i>, <i>Grin2b</i>, <i>Gria1</i>, <i>Gria2</i>; neuroinflammation: <i>Nlrp3</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Il1rn</i>; glial markers: <i>Gfap</i>, <i>Aif1</i>; neurotrophic factors: <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Fgf2</i>) were analyzed at P21. Behavioral outcomes, including locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, and recognition memory, were assessed in adulthood (P70–P90). Neonatal cortical lesions induced subregion-specific alterations in hippocampal gene expression: <i>Grin2b</i> and <i>Gria1</i> expression decreased in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus, while <i>Grin2a</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, and <i>Fgf2</i> increased in the contralateral ventral hippocampus. These molecular changes were associated with subsequent cognitive deficits (impaired recognition memory) and emotional dysregulation (heightened anxiety-like behavior) in adult rats, alongside reduced exploratory activity. Basic motor functions and sociability remained unaffected, and seizure susceptibility (assessed via maximal electroshock threshold) was unchanged, highlighting the specificity of the observed impairments. Our findings suggest a potential mechanistic link between early-life cortical malformations with microgyrus formation, dysregulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic signaling, and persistent neurobehavioral deficits. These results underscore the translational relevance of the freeze lesion model for studying the neurodevelopmental trajectory of cortical malformation-related comorbidities.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are finding use in real-world neurological settings. Whereas part 1 of this 3-part review series focused on the birth of AI and its foundational principles, this part 2 review shifts gears to explore more practical aspects of neurological care. The review details how large language models, generative AI, and robotics are supporting diagnostic accuracy, patient interaction, and treatment personalization. Special attention is given to ethical and philosophical facets of AI that nonetheless impact practical aspects of care and patient safety, such as accountability for AI-driven decisions and the “black box” nature of many algorithms. We will discuss whether AI systems can develop sentience, and the implications for human-AI collaboration. By examining human-robot interactions in neurology, this part 2 review highlights the profound impact AI could have on patient care and, as covered in the ensuing part 3, on global health care delivery and data analytics, while maintaining ethical oversight and human control.

<p>Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) represent over 200 clinically heterogeneous genetic conditions involving degeneration of the cerebellum and associated tracts with resultant impairment of balance and coordination. Advancements in genomic testing have enabled rapid identification of the majority of known recessive disorders, shifting research focus to the development of targeted mechanistic treatments addressing underlying physiological pathways. Molecular classification allows recognition of cellular, biochemical, and genetic targets for high-effect precision therapy development. ARCAs represent a significant global health burden, requiring establishment of a robust pathway for novel therapeutic discovery through modification of mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and subsequent clinical trial development.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Glibenclamide for Large Hemispheric Infarction Analyzing mRS and Mortality (CHARM) trial enrolled participants with large hemispheric infarction, randomized to a placebo or intravenous glyburide. Our objective in this post-hoc study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline stroke volume and the potential efficacy of i.v. glyburide.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants enrolled in CHARM and aged ≤70 years were included if a &lt;125 ml ischemic core lesion volume was measured by computed tomography perfusion or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was a shift analysis on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. Independent variables included age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, world region, tissue plasminogen activator, and endovascular thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 147 participants with a baseline large-core stroke volume &lt;125 ml were available for this analysis (mean age 58 years, 37% women, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 18, and the time to study drug was 9.1 ± 2.1 h). The median baseline core volume of 92 mL (IQR 81–107 ml) did not differ by treatment arm. The i.v. glyburide-treated participants had a favorable shift in outcome relative to the placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 2.11, 95% CI 1.10–4.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy, i.v. glyburide-treated subjects had a favorable outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 8.19, 95% CI 1.60–42.0, <i>p</i> = 0.01), fewer decompressive craniectomies (0% vs 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.02), less midline shift (4.2 ± 2.5 mm vs 7.6 ± 5.5 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and lower 90-day mortality (5.6% vs 31%, <i>p</i> = 0.05) compared with the placebo, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This post-hoc analysis of the CHARM trial provides hypothesis-generating evidence that i.v. glyburide may improve outcome in large-core stroke &lt;125 ml, especially among endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients. These results require confirmation in a prospective randomized clinical trial. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:616–624</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elezanumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa), an inhibitor of central nervous system regeneration after inflammation or injury. The aim was to assess the safety and efficacy of elezanumab in relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P were phase 2 trials in relapsing (RADIUS-R) or progressive (RADIUS-P) MS. Participants were randomized to intravenous elezanumab 400mg, 1800mg, or placebo every 4 weeks through week 48. The primary endpoint was the mean Overall Response Score (ORS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In RADIUS-R, 208 participants received elezanumab 400mg (n = 69), elezanumab 1800mg (n = 69), or placebo (n = 70). In RADIUS-P, 123 participants received elezanumab 400mg (n = 40), elezanumab 1800mg (n = 40), or placebo (n = 43). The primary endpoint of ORS was not met in either study. For RADIUS-R, mean ORS was −0.2 with effect size of −0.2 for elezanumab 400mg and −0.2 with effect size of −0.2 for elezanumab 1800mg. For RADIUS-P, mean ORS was 0.0 with effect size of 0.0 for elezanumab 400mg and 0.1 with effect size of 0.1 for elezanumab 1800mg.</p>
<p>Elezanumab was well tolerated; the rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment groups in both studies. Adverse events with ≥10% of elezanumab population were falls, urinary tract infections, headaches in RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P, and also fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and muscular weakness in RADIUS-P.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elezanumab was safe and well tolerated, but did not meet the primary endpoint in either study. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:590–602</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the impact of dopamine deficiency and isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) on cognitive performance in early neuronal α-synuclein disease (NSD) with hyposmia but without motor disability.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative baseline data, cognitive performance was assessed with a cognitive summary score (CSS) derived from robust healthy control (HC) norms. Performance was examined for participants with hyposmia in early NSD-Integrated Staging System (NSD-ISS), either stage 2A (cerebrospinal fluid α-synuclein seed amplification assay [SAA]+, dopamine transporter scan [DaTscan]−) or 2B (SAA+, DaTscan+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants were stage 2A (n = 101), stage 2B (N = 227), and HCs (n = 158). Although stage 2 had intact Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (mean [SD] = 27.0 [2.3]), stage 2A had a numerically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.05, <i>p =</i> NS; effect size = 0.09) and stage 2B a statistically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.23, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; effect size = 0.40) compared with HCs. In stage 2A, hyposmia alone was associated with normal cognition, but those with comorbid iRBD had significantly worse cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, effect size =0.50). In stage 2B, hyposmia alone had abnormal cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.0078, effect size = 0.29), and superimposed iRBD had a statistically significant additive effect.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using a novel CSS, we demonstrated that hyposmia is associated with cognitive deficits in prodromal NSD without motor disability, particularly when comorbid dopamine system impairment or comorbid iRBD is present. Therefore, it is critical to include and assess cognition at all stages when studying synuclein disease, even in the absence of motor disability. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:482–491</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27266?af=R">Midlife Steroid‐Binding Globulin Levels and In Vivo Neuroimaging Measures of Tau in Older Men and Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In men and women, sex steroid hormones have been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We aimed to investigate the influence of midlife testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels on later-life in vivo markers of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition in clinically healthy older men.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This time-lagged study includes participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation cohort. One hundred fifty-nine men (mean age<sub>PET-scan</sub> = 58 [±/9] years) underwent blood (hormones) collection in 2002 to 2005, and then a single Aβ <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET scan in 2016 to 2020. Linear regressions examined sex-stratified associations among total testosterone, and SHBG with Aβ-PET, and tau-PET after adjusting for age. Separate models examined the moderating effect of Aβ-PET and <i>APOE</i>ε4.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In men, the elevated SHBG level was associated with lower tau-PET in entorhinal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0005], <i>p</i> = 0.007), inferior temporal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.04), and rostral middle frontal regions (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.02). These findings were largely driven by <i>APOE</i>ε4 non-carriers. Testosterone levels were not associated with the Aβ-PET or tau-PET signal.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report a potential protective effect of SHBG levels on tau-PET burden in men. Higher levels of SHBG have been associated with lower risk of vascular-related comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, and is regulated by modifiable lifestyle factors. Given mounting evidence of a link between vascular injury and tauopathy in preclinical AD, our findings suggest an intriguing protective cardiovascular pathway for men against higher tau burden later in life.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27267?af=R">Longitudinal Analysis of Neuroradiological Biomarkers for Fragile X‐Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome and Implications for Clinical Trials</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to show the capacity of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures to serve as monitoring biomarkers for Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From 2 longitudinal studies of male <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers, 2 brain MRI scans were selected from each participant, collected within a period of 2 years (12 healthy controls, 17 carriers without FXTAS, and 51 carriers with FXTAS; all men, ages 40 to 80 years), along with clinical measurements and <i>FMR1</i> cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat numbers. Candidate MRI biomarkers included whole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebellar, brainstem, and whole brain volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the FXTAS group, mixed-effects models demonstrated significant volume loss across an average interval of 1.32 years for the whole brain, cerebellum and brain stem volumes, and significant increases in WMH, with large magnitude effects for whole brain and WMH volumes. All MRI measures showed deterioration with advancing FXTAS stage, with the strongest pattern shown in WMH volume. CGG repeat number showed significant nonlinear associations with all 4 brain MRI metrics, with mid-range CGG repeat carriers evidencing the worst brain atrophy and WMHs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Structural brain MRI measurements, especially those capturing white matter deterioration, are correlated with <i>FMR1</i> premutation size of CGG repeat length and sensitive to FXTAS disease progression across a relatively short interval of less than 2 years, making them potentially suitable as surrogate end points for clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates a strong genetic overlap between developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) and movement disorders. De novo loss-of-function variants in <i>NUS1</i> have been recently identified in DEE cases. Herein, we report a large cohort of cases with pathogenic <i>NUS1</i> variants and describe their clinical presentation and the details of the associated epilepsy and movement disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cases with <i>NUS1</i>-related disorders were identified through a multicentric international collaboration made possible by the GeneMatcher platform. Clinical data were acquired through retrospective case-note review.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 41 subjects carrying 38 different pathogenic or likely pathogenic heterozygous <i>NUS1</i> variants. The majority of cases displayed developmental delays and intellectual disability of variable severity. Epilepsy was present in 68.3% of cases (28/41) with onset typically in early childhood. Strikingly, 87.8% of cases (36/41) presented with movement disorders and for 13 of these cases the movement disorder was not accompanied by epilepsy. The phenomenology of the movement disorders was complex with myoclonus observed in 68.3% of cases (28/41), either in isolation or in combination with dystonia, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Seven cases that otherwise did not have prominent movement disorders had mild incoordination and intention tremor, suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction. There was no observed genotype–phenotype correlation, suggesting that other genetic or acquired factors impact the clinical presentation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Heterozygous <i>NUS1</i> pathogenic variants cause a complex neurological disorder, variably featuring developmental and epileptic encephalopathies and a broad spectrum of movement disorders, which represent the major source of neurological disability for most cases.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in <i>HCN2</i>, encoding for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN) gated channel 2.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>GeneMatcher facilitated the recruitment of 21 individuals with <i>HCN2</i> variants from 15 unrelated families, carrying <i>HCN2</i> variants. In vitro functional studies were performed by electrophysiology with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and membrane trafficking was investigated in HEK cells by confocal imaging. Structural 3D-analysis of the <i>HCN2</i> variants was performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The phenotypic spectrum included developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 17/21), epilepsy (10/21), language disorders (16/21), movement disorders (12/21), and axial hypotonia (10/21). Thirteen pathogenic variants (12 new and 1 already described) were identified: 11 missense (8 monoallelic and 3 biallelic), 1 recurrent inframe deletion (monoallelic), and 1 frameshift (biallelic). Functional analysis of p.(Arg324His) variant showed a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, whereas p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) exhibited dominant negative effects. The p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu), and p.(Gly587Asp) variants rendered HCN2 electrophysiologically silent and impaired membrane trafficking. Structural 3D-analysis revealed that, except for p.(Arg324His), all variants altered HCN2 stability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings broadened the HCN2 disease clinical spectrum to include DD/ID with or without epilepsy. Functional analysis in cellular models reveal that pathogenic <i>HCN2</i> variants can cause either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, providing critical information for the development of targeted therapies for <i>HCN2</i>-related disorders.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epilepsy surgery needs predictive features that are easily implemented in clinical practice. Previous studies are limited by small sample sizes, lack of external validation, and complex computational approaches. We aimed to identify and validate visually stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) features with the highest predictive value for surgical outcome, and assess the reliability of their visual extraction.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 177 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent SEEG-guided surgery at 4 epilepsy centers. We assessed the predictive performance of 10 SEEG features from various SEEG periods for surgical outcome, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and considering resected channels and surgical outcome as the gold standard. Findings were validated externally using balanced accuracy. Six experts, blinded to outcome, evaluated the visual reliability of the optimal feature using interrater reliability, percentage agreement (standard deviation ± SD) and Gwet's kappa (κ ± SD).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The derivation cohort comprised 100 consecutive patients, each with at least 1-year of postoperative follow up (40% temporal lobe epilepsy; 42% Engel Ia). Spatial co-occurrence of gamma spikes and preictal spikes emerged as the optimal predictive feature of surgical outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.82). Applying the optimized threshold from the derivation cohort, external validation in 2 datasets showed similar performances (balanced accuracy 69.2% and 73.2%). Expert interrater reliability for gamma spikes (percentage agreement, 96% ± 2%; κ, 0.63 ± 0.16) and preictal spikes (percentage agreement, 92% ± 2%; κ, 0.65 ± 0.18) were substantial.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Spatial co-occurrence of gamma spikes and preictal spikes predicts surgical outcome. These visually identifiable features may reduce the burden of SEEG analysis by reducing analysis time, and improve outcome by guiding surgical resection margins. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:547–560</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures are a highly prevalent comorbidity in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a 2- to 6-fold increased risk, and are associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Despite growing research on seizure detection and treatment in AD, the cognitive profiles of individuals with both AD and seizures remain poorly characterized using comprehensive neuropsychological methods.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and cognitive data from individuals age 65+ with AD were analyzed from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Cognitive domains assessed included memory, language, attention, processing speed, and executive function. Raw scores were converted into z-scores using a control sample (n = 14,665). Group comparisons were conducted using independent <i>t</i> tests, χ<sup>2</sup> tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, and logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with seizures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 9,662 individuals with AD, 1.2% (n = 117) had active seizures (AD-S). The AD-S group was younger, had higher stroke and transient ischemic attack rates, earlier cognitive decline, longer symptom duration, cognitive fluctuations, abrupt cognitive changes, and worse cognitive and functional outcomes. Cognitive deficits in AD-S, particularly in executive function and processing speed, persisted after adjusting for dementia severity. Compared to vascular dementia, AD-S individuals exhibited greater impairments in fluency, naming, and processing speed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Comorbid AD and seizures are associated with distinct cognitive and clinical profiles, greater vascular disease burden, and more severe dementia.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27286?af=R">Uncovering Image‐Driven Subtypes with Distinct Pathology and Clinical Course in Autopsy‐Confirmed Four Repeat Tauopathies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The four-repeat (4R) tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and globular glial tauopathy (GGT). This study aimed to characterize spatiotemporal atrophy progression using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to examine its relationship with clinical course and neuropathology in a cohort of autopsy-confirmed 4R tauopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study included 85 autopsied patients (54 with PSP, 28 with CBD, and 3 with GGT) who underwent multiple 3T MRI scans, as well as neuropsychological, neurological, and speech/language examinations, and standardized postmortem neuropathological evaluations. An unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), was applied to the cross-sectional brain volumes to estimate spatiotemporal atrophy patterns and data-driven subtypes and stages in each patient. The relationships among estimated subtypes, pathological diagnoses, and longitudinal changes in clinical testing were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SuStaIn algorithm identified 2 distinct subtypes: (1) the subcortical subtype, in which atrophy progresses from the midbrain to the cortex, and (2) the cortical subtype, in which atrophy progresses from the frontal cortex to the subcortical regions. The subcortical subtype was more associated with typical PSP, whereas the cortical subtype was more associated with atypical PSP with a cortical distribution of pathology and CBD (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The cortical subtype had a faster rate of change on the PSP Rating Scale than the subcortical subtype (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SuStaIn analysis revealed 2 MRI-driven subtypes with distinct spatiotemporal atrophy patterns, clinical courses, and neuropathology. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive and improved understanding of disease progression and its relationship to tau pathology in 4R tauopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:492–507</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27280?af=R">Carotid Revascularization Versus Medical Management for Ischemic Stroke with Ipsilateral Carotid Web: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Carotid artery web is an underrecognized cause of ischemic stroke and is associated with a high risk of recurrent events. It is uncertain whether medical management or carotid revascularization is beneficial for patients with ischemic stroke and ipsilateral carotid web. In the absence of large randomized clinical trials and observational studies, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing medical management and carotid revascularization in this population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024485069). We searched five databases: Embase, Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We included observational studies that studied the association between recurrent stroke in patients with ipsilateral carotid web receiving medical management (antiplatelet and anticoagulation) and carotid revascularization. Random effects modeling was performed, and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals were reported.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 17 studies (16 published and 1 institutional study). In the medical management group, 32% (90/281) of patients experienced recurrent ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the carotid web. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of recurrent ischemic stroke with carotid revascularization (relative risk 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.06–0.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>I</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 14.5%). Both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting were equally effective in reducing recurrent stroke risk (relative risk 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.11–1.76, <i>p</i> = 0.99).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Carotid revascularization is associated with reduced recurrence rates, with no difference between revascularization subtypes (carotid endarterectomy vs carotid artery stenting). However, given the small, heterogeneous cohorts and the uncertain natural history of carotid artery web under medical management, these findings should be interpreted with caution until prospective, controlled comparative effectiveness studies are performed.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27281?af=R">Effect of Cumulative Exposure to Ocrelizumab on Memory B‐Cell Repopulation Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Extended interval dosing protocols of B-cell-depleting therapies in multiple sclerosis (MS) are being developed, but intervals between infusions are often arbitrary. We describe total and memory B-cell repopulation dynamics in MS patients on a memory B-cell-guided extended interval dosing ocrelizumab (OCR) protocol.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>OCR was administered on peripheral CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell repopulation (≥1 cell/μL), monitored using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Associations with CD19+ B cells and CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells were tested using mixed-effect hurdle models, with rate ratios (RR) predicting cell counts and odds ratios (OR) predicting cell depletion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We collected 1,369 samples from 101 patients, 61.4% women, aged 42.2 years (IQR 32.3–51.1 years) and follow up 4.1 years (IQR 2.9–5.2 years). The median time between samples and previous OCR infusion was 6.6 months (IQR 4.7–8.8 months). Time since previous OCR infusion was positively associated with CD19+ B cells (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.10–1.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell counts (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.09–1.13, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). A greater cumulative OCR dose was associated with persistent CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell depletion (OR 1.90, 1.57–2.31, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). CD19+ B-cell repopulation was inversely associated with age (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.010). Female patients showed a lower ratio of CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells/total CD19+ B cells (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26–0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Disease activity was low, with most radiological activity observed within the first year of OCR treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Memory B-cell repopulation becomes slower with increasing cumulative OCR dose. Age- and sex-related mechanisms probably influence repopulation dynamics. Given the evidence for a pathogenic role of memory B cells, these observations could be considered when planning extended interval dosing strategies of OCR treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27285?af=R">Timing of Changes in Alzheimer's Disease Plasma Biomarkers as Assessed by Amyloid and Tau PET Clocks</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the timing of change of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) from six different assay platforms, alongside established AD biomarkers, using amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET)-based AD progression timelines.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 784 individuals with longitudinal amyloid PET and 359 with longitudinal tau PET, were analyzed to estimate the age at amyloid and tau PET positivity, respectively. Longitudinal plasma biomarker measurements were available from 190 individuals with an estimated amyloid PET positivity age and from 70 individuals with an estimated tau PET positivity age. In a subset of 17 clinical progressors, age at tau PET positivity strongly predicted symptom onset, allowing for estimation of symptom onset age. Biomarker trajectories based on time from amyloid or tau PET positivity or symptom onset were modelled using Generalized Additive Mixed models. Time intervals of significant biomarker change and the earliest timepoints at which biomarkers exceeded predefined abnormality thresholds were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All plasma biomarkers except NfL became abnormal prior to established thresholds for amyloid and tau PET positivity. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 became abnormal very early in both amyloid PET and tau PET timelines, while plasma GFAP became abnormal early in the tau PET timeline. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels plateaued, whereas plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL levels increased throughout the modeled disease progression. Some variations in the timing of these changes were observed across different biomarker assays.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 may be useful in identifying individuals with very low levels of amyloid pathology, whereas p-tau, GFAP, and NfL may be useful in staging disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:508–523</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a focal epilepsy extensively examined through advanced neuroimaging techniques to elucidate its pathophysiological mechanisms. This study investigates the differences in dynamic brain activity and gene expression in TLE patients. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were collected from 60 TLE patients and 30 healthy controls (HC). Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) was employed to identify regions with dALFF variance differences, which were then designated as regions of interest (ROIs). Co-activation patterns (CAP) was constructed to compare brain dynamic changes. Pearson's correlation analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms associated with atypical neural dynamics in TLE. Five CAP states were identified from the rs-fMRI data. Compared to HC, TLE with cognitive normal (TLE-CN) and TLE with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI) patients exhibited atypical state-specific temporal characteristics, including number of states (counts), fraction of time, persistence, resilience, and transition probability (TP) between states. Importantly, dynamic indicators of CAP states were significantly correlated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, 2752 genes were significantly associated with atypical dynamic brain states in TLE, with these genes primarily enriched in synapse-related pathways. This study offers novel insights into atypical neural dynamics from a temporal perspective. The brain network dynamics defined by CAP analysis deepen our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of TLE and TLE-CI, revealing a link between atypical neural architecture and gene expression in TLE.</p>

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>To assess the impact of SK channel agonists on seizure-like events (SLEs) in various seizure models in slices of the temporal cortex obtained from pharmacoresistant patients. SLEs were triggered by applying 4-aminopyridine (100 μM) to slices of the entorhinal cortex taken from both normal and pilocarpine-treated rats. Additionally, SLEs were induced in slices of the temporal cortex obtained from individuals who had undergone epilepsy surgery. In the case of human slices, SLEs were also provoked by increasing potassium levels along with the administration of either 4-AP (100 μM) or bicuculline (50 μM). The activation of SK2/3 channels by the compound CYPPA (<i>n</i> = 8) effectively prevented SLEs in slices from the brains of normal rats, pilocarpine-treated rats (<i>n</i> = 8), and in human cortex slices (<i>n</i> = 9) when SLEs were triggered by 4-AP. In human temporal cortex slices, CYPPA also demonstrated efficacy in preventing SLEs induced by an elevation in potassium concentration combined with bicuculline application (<i>n</i> = 5). SKA-31, exhibited efficacy in slices from normal rats (<i>n</i> = 8), rats treated with pilocarpine (<i>n</i> = 8), and in human slices (<i>n</i> = 7) when SLEs were provoked by 4-AP. However, its effectiveness was limited when applied to human tissue slices exposed to bicuculline and elevated potassium levels. The SK1 channel activator GW-542573X displayed only moderate anticonvulsant effects in the models under investigation. SK2 channels showed the highest effectiveness across the different epilepsy models. Sensitivity to the SK3 channel activator was found to be more pronounced compared to the other two activators studied.</p>
