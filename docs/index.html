                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A fluorescent sensor for the real-time measurement of extracellular oxytocin dynamics in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin (OT), a hypothalamic neuropeptide that acts as a neuromodulator in the brain, orchestrates a variety of animal behaviors. However, the relationship between brain OT dynamics and complex animal behaviors remains largely elusive, partly because of the lack of a suitable technique for its real-time recording in vivo. Here, we describe MTRIAOT, a G protein-coupled receptor-based green fluorescent OT sensor with a large dynamic range, optimal affinity, ligand specificity to OT orthologs, minimal effects on downstream signaling, and long-term fluorescence stability. By combining viral gene delivery and fiber photometry-mediated fluorescence measurements, we demonstrated the utility of MTRIAOT for real-time detection of brain OT dynamics in living mice. Importantly, MTRIAOT-mediated measurements revealed "OT oscillation," a hitherto unknown rhythmic change in OT levels in the brain. MTRIAOT will allow the analysis of OT dynamics in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social selectivity and social motivation in voles</a></h4>

              
                Selective relationships are fundamental to humans and many other animals, but relationships between mates, family members, or peers may be mediated differently. We examined connections between social reward and social selectivity, aggression, and oxytocin receptor signaling pathways in rodents that naturally form enduring, selective relationships with mates and peers (prairie voles) or peers (meadow voles). Female prairie and meadow voles worked harder to access familiar vs. unfamiliar individuals, regardless of sex, and huddled extensively with familiar subjects. Male prairie voles also displayed strongly selective huddling preferences for familiar animals, but worked hardest to repeatedly access females vs. males, with no difference in effort by familiarity. This demonstrates a fundamental disconnect between motivation and social selectivity in males, and reveals a striking sex difference in pathways underlying social monogamy. Meadow voles exhibited social preferences but low social motivation, consistent with tolerance rather than reward supporting social groups in this species. Natural variation in oxytocin receptor genotype was associated with oxytocin receptor density, and both genotype and receptor binding predicted individual variation in prosocial and aggressive behaviors. These results provide a basis for understanding species, sex, and individual differences in the mechanisms underlying the role of social reward in social preference.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Patients with Huntington’s disease (HD) have an increased incidence of diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction have not been entirely clarified. Revealing the pathogenesis of diabetes can provide a novel understanding of the onset and progression of HD, as well as potential clues for the development of new therapeutics. Here, we demonstrated that the mouse pancreatic insulinoma cell line NIT-1 expressing N-terminal mutant huntingtin (mHTT) containing 160 polyglutamine (160Q cells) displayed lower cell proliferative ability than the cells expressing N-terminal wild-type HTT containing 20 polyglutamine (20Q cells). In addition, 160Q cells were more prone to apoptosis and exhibited deficient glucose-stimulated insulin expression and secretion. Furthermore, insulin signaling molecule insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) expression decreased and was recruited into mHTT aggregates. Consequently, glucose stimulation failed to activate the downstream molecule phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) in 160Q cells, leading to reduced phosphorylation levels of serine–threonine protein kinase AKT and forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). These data indicate that activation of the glucose-stimulated PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling pathway is significantly blocked in pancreatic β-cells in HD. Importantly, insulin treatment inhibited the aggregation of mHTT and significantly improved the activation of PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling in 160Q cells. These results suggest that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 pathway might be due to the recruitment of IRS-2 into mHTT aggregates in HD β-cells, ultimately contributing to the impairment of pancreatic β-cells. In conclusion, our work provides new insight into the underlying mechanisms of the high incidence of diabetes and abnormal glucose homeostasis in HD.</p>

	<p>The risk of accidents while operating a drone is quite high. The most important solution is training for drone pilots. Drone pilot training can be done in both physical and virtual environments, but the probability of an accident is higher for pilot trainees, so the first method is to train in a virtual environment. The purpose of this study is to develop a new system to collect data on students&#039; educational development performance of students during the use of Gamified Drone Training Simulator and objectively analyze students&#039; development. A multimodal recording system that can collect simulator, keystroke, and brain activity data has been developed to analyze the cognitive and physical activities of participants trained in the gamified drone simulator. It was found that as the number of trials increased, participants became accustomed to the cognitive load of visual/auditory tasks and therefore the power in the alpha and beta bands decreased. It was observed that participants&#039; meditation and attention scores increased with the number of repetitions of the educational game. It can be concluded that the number of repetitions lowers stress and anxiety levels, increases attention, and thus enhances game performance.</p>

	<p>Reconsolidation is a process by which memories are destabilized, updated, and then restabilized. Strong memories are resistant to undergoing reconsolidation. Here, we addressed whether an overtrained fear memory could be made susceptible to reconsolidation by first extinguishing, and then renewing, the memory. Rats were trained with ten tone-footshock pairings, followed by eight days of tone extinction in the training context. The next day, rats were placed into a second context and memory for the tone was renewed/reactivated with a single tone presentation. Immediately following reactivation, rats received an injection of midazolam or vehicle. Rats were then tested for freezing to the tone in a third context. Midazolam had no effect in rats that did not undergo tone extinction, but significantly attenuated freezing to the tone in extinguished rats. Thus, rats that received tone extinction underwent tone memory reconsolidation following its renewal. In a second experiment, we administered the reactivation session and midazolam injections prior to extinction. Midazolam had no effect and rats extinguished at a rate similar to controls. These data suggest that strong emotional memories are capable of updating following weakening of memory expression through extinction.</p>

	<p>Objective: To characterize the effect of unilateral (single and two-level) lumbar facet/zygapophysial joint fixation on paraspinal muscle spindle activity immediately following L4 or L6 high velocity low amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) delivered at various thrust durations. Methods: Secondary analysis of immediate (≤2 s) post-HVLA-SM trunk muscle spindle response from two studies involving anesthetized adult cats (n = 39; 2.3–6.0 kg) with either a unilateral single (L5/6) or two-level (L5/6 and L6/7) facet joint fixation. All facet fixations were contralateral to L6 dorsal root recordings. HVLA-SM was delivered to the spinous process in a posterior-to-anterior direction using a feedback motor with a peak thrust magnitude of 55% of average cat body weight and thrust durations of 75, 100, 150, and 250 ms. Time to 1st action potential and spindle activity during 1 and 2 s post-HVLA-SM comparisons were made between facet joint fixation conditions and HVLA-SM segmental thrust levels. Results: Neither two-level facet joint fixation, nor HVLA-SM segmental level significantly altered immediate post-HVLA-SM spindle discharge at tested thrust durations (FDR &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Two-level facet joint fixation failed to alter immediate (≤2 s) post-HVLA-SM spindle discharge when compared to single-level facet joint fixation at any thrust duration. Segmental thrust level did not alter immediate post-HVLA-SM spindle response in two-level facet joint fixation preparations.</p>

	<p>Background: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of the study was to determine serum concentrations of AGEs and their soluble receptor (sRAGE) in MS patients and healthy controls and to investigate their possible influence on disease activity. Methods: Serum concentrations of AGE and sRAGE in patients with MS and healthy controls were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The mean serum AGE concentration in patients with MS was higher than in healthy controls, whereas the mean serum sRAGE concentration was lower than in the control group. However, the differences were not statistically significant. In MS patients, serum AGE and sRAGE concentrations did not differ significantly, depending on the duration of the disease and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Conclusions: Multiple sclerosis may be accompanied by disturbances of the AGE-sRAGE axis. However, further studies are warranted to confirm it. The duration of the disease and the degree of disability do not seem to affect the progression of the glycation process, particularly in the stable phase of the disease.</p>

	<p>Azerbaijani 28-year-old female showed weakness (MRC (Medical Research Council Scale for Muscle Strength) grade 4 in the proximal part of the upper and MRC grade 2–3 in the lower extremities), difficulty in stair lifting, positive symptom of Hoover’s rising, «waddling gait», decline deep reflexes symmetrical, lack of surface reflexes, positive Babinsky’s reflex on the right, urinary incontinence during sneezing, prolonged walking and exercise from puberty. Additional methods made it possible to identify minor violations of conduction of the left ventricle, electromyography signs of primary muscular disease with predominant involvement of the proximal muscles of the lower extremities, elevation of serum creatine kinase (746,81 U/l), active foci of demyelination in the left frontal lobe, intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal IgG bands (type 2) in cerebrospinal fluid, atrophy and fatty degeneration of all muscles of the shins, homozygous Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in TRIM32 gene and heterozygous VUS c.2300C &amp;amp;gt; G (p.Thr767Arg) in KIF5A, c.2840G &amp;amp;gt; A (p.Arg947Lys) in MYH2, c.1502G &amp;amp;gt; C (p.Gly501Ala) in POMT1 genes. Comparison of the phenotypes of the mutations that have been identified with the clinical picture of the patient suggests that VUS c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in the TRIM32 gene can be pathological. Summarizing, it can be argued that the cause of the identified disorders is a homozygous variant c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in TRIM32 gene that causes LGMDR8 in a patient with MS.</p>

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive and irreversible disease and the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. In Spain, it affects around 120.000–150.000 individuals, and its prevalence is estimated to increase in the future. PD has a great impact on patients’ and caregivers’ lives and also entails a substantial socioeconomic burden. The aim of the present study was to examine the current situation and the 10-year PD forecast for Spain in order to optimize and design future management strategies. This study was performed using the modified Delphi method to try to obtain a consensus among a panel of movement disorders experts. According to the panel, future PD management will improve diagnostic capacity and follow-up, it will include multidisciplinary teams, and innovative treatments will be developed. The expansion of new technologies and studies on biomarkers will have an impact on future PD management, leading to more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and individualized therapies. However, the socio-economic impact of the disease will continue to be significant by 2030, especially for patients in advanced stages. This study highlighted the unmet needs in diagnosis and treatment and how crucial it is to establish recommendations for future diagnostic and therapeutic management of PD.</p>

	<p>Biomarkers to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) would enable patients to gain access to appropriate services and may facilitate the development of new therapies. Given the large numbers of people affected by AD, there is a need for a low-cost, easy-to-use method to detect AD patients. Potentially, the electroencephalogram (EEG) can play a valuable role in this, but at present no single EEG biomarker is robust enough for use in practice. This study aims to provide a methodological framework for the development of robust EEG biomarkers to detect AD with clinically acceptable performance by exploiting the combined strengths of key biomarkers. A large number of existing and novel EEG biomarkers associated with slowing of EEG, reduction in EEG complexity. and decrease in EEG connectivity were investigated. Support vector machine and linear discriminate analysis methods were used to find the best combination of the EEG biomarkers to detect AD with significant performance. A total of 325,567 EEG biomarkers were investigated, and a panel of six biomarkers was identified and used to create a diagnostic model with high performance (&amp;amp;gt;=85% for sensitivity and 100% for specificity).</p>

	<p>Background: Various three-dimensional (3D) glioblastoma cell culture models have a limited duration of viability. Our aim was to develop a long-term 3D glioblastoma model, which is necessary for reliable drug response studies. Methods: Human U87 glioblastoma cells were cultured in alginate microfibers for 28 days. Cell growth, viability, morphology, and aggregation in 3D culture were monitored by fluorescent and confocal microscopy upon calcein-AM/propidium iodide (CAM/PI) staining every seven days. The glioblastoma 3D model was validated using temozolomide (TMZ) treatments 3 days in a row with a recovery period. Cell viability by MTT and resistance-related gene expression (MGMT and ABCB1) by qPCR were assessed after 28 days. The same TMZ treatment schedule was applied in 2D U87 cell culture for comparison purposes. Results: Within a long-term 3D model system in alginate fibers, U87 cells remained viable for up to 28 days. On day 7, cells formed visible aggregates oriented to the microfiber periphery. TMZ treatment reduced cell growth but increased drug resistance-related gene expression. The latter effect was more pronounced in 3D compared to 2D cell culture. Conclusion: Herein, we described a long-term glioblastoma 3D model system that could be particularly helpful for drug testing and treatment optimization.</p>

In each landscape, the strategy was the same: convene diverse partners, identify biological and sociocultural assets, document residents&rsquo; use of natural resources, and tailor the findings to the needs of decision-makers. Nine of the 14 landscapes have since been protected (5.7 million hectares of new protected areas), contributing to a quadrupling of conservation coverage in Loreto (from 6 to 23%).

                <p>Van der Waals epitaxy provides a fertile playground for the monolithic integration of various materials for advanced electronics and optoelectronics. Here, a previously unidentified nanorod-assisted van der Waals epitaxy is developed and nearly single-crystalline GaN films are first grown on amorphous silica glass substrates using a graphene interfacial layer. The epitaxial GaN-based light-emitting diode structures, with a record internal quantum efficiency, can be readily lifted off, becoming large-size flexible devices. Without the effects of the potential field from a single-crystalline substrate, we expect this approach to be equally applicable for high-quality growth of nitrides on arbitrary substrates. Our work provides a revolutionary technology for the growth of high-quality semiconductors, thus enabling the hetero-integration of highly mismatched material systems.</p>

                <p>FAN1, a DNA structure-specific nuclease, interacts with MLH1, but the repair pathways in which this complex acts are unknown. FAN1 processes DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and FAN1 variants are modifiers of the neurodegenerative Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD), presumably by regulating HD-causing CAG repeat expansions. Here, we identify specific amino acid residues in two adjacent FAN1 motifs that are critical for MLH1 binding. Disruption of the FAN1-MLH1 interaction confers cellular hypersensitivity to ICL damage and defective repair of CAG/CTG slip-outs, intermediates of repeat expansion mutations. FAN1-S126 phosphorylation, which hinders FAN1-MLH1 association, is cell cycle&ndash;regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase activity and attenuated upon ICL induction. Our data highlight the FAN1-MLH1 complex as a phosphorylation-regulated determinant of ICL response and repeat stability, opening novel paths to modify cancer and neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Sedimentary ancient DNA shows terrestrial plant richness continuously increased over the Holocene in northern Fennoscandia</a></h4>

              
                <p>The effects of climate change on species richness are debated but can be informed by the past. Here, we generated a sedimentary ancient DNA dataset covering 10 lakes and applied novel methods for data harmonization. We assessed the impact of Holocene climate changes and nutrients on terrestrial plant richness in northern Fennoscandia. We find that richness increased steeply during the rapidly warming Early Holocene. In contrast to findings from most pollen studies, we show that richness continued to increase thereafter, although the climate was stable, with richness and the regional species pool only stabilizing during the past three millennia. Furthermore, overall increases in richness were greater in catchments with higher soil nutrient availability. We suggest that richness will increase with ongoing warming, especially at localities with high nutrient availability and assuming that human activity remains low in the region, although lags of millennia may be expected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Predicting non-state terrorism worldwide</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several thousand people die every year worldwide because of terrorist attacks perpetrated by non-state actors. In this context, reliable and accurate short-term predictions of non-state terrorism at the local level are key for policy makers to target preventative measures. Using only publicly available data, we show that predictive models that include structural and procedural predictors can accurately predict the occurrence of non-state terrorism locally and a week ahead in regions affected by a relatively high prevalence of terrorism. In these regions, theoretically informed models systematically outperform models using predictors built on past terrorist events only. We further identify and interpret the local effects of major global and regional terrorism drivers. Our study demonstrates the potential of theoretically informed models to predict and explain complex forms of political violence at policy-relevant scales.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">North Atlantic Oscillation in winter is largely insensitive to autumn Barents-Kara sea ice variability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Arctic sea ice extent in autumn is significantly correlated with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the satellite era. However, questions about the robustness and reproducibility of the relationship persist. Here, we show that climate models are able to simulate periods of strong ice-NAO correlation, albeit rarely. Furthermore, we show that the winter circulation signals during these periods are consistent with observations and not driven by sea ice. We do so by interrogating a multimodel ensemble for the specific time scale of interest, thereby illuminating the dynamics that produce large spread in the ice-NAO relationship. Our results support the importance of internal variability over sea ice but go further in showing that the mechanism behind strong ice-NAO correlations, when they occur, is similar in longer observational records and models. Rather than sea ice, circulation anomalies over the Urals emerge as a decisive precursor to the winter NAO signal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Single-cell analyses unravel cell type-specific responses to a vitamin D analog in prostatic precancerous lesions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epidemiological data have linked vitamin D deficiency to the onset and severity of various cancers, including prostate cancer, and although in vitro studies have demonstrated anticancer activities for vitamin D, clinical trials provided conflicting results. To determine the impact of vitamin D signaling on prostatic precancerous lesions, we treated genetically engineered Pten<sup>(i)pe&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice harboring prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) with Gemini-72, a vitamin D analog with reported anticancer activities. We show that this analog induces apoptosis in senescent PINs, normalizes extracellular matrix remodeling by stromal fibroblasts, and reduces the prostatic infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrates that while a subset of luminal cells expressing Krt8, Krt4, and Tacstd2 (termed luminal-C cells) is lost by such a treatment, antiapoptotic pathways are induced in persistent luminal-C cells. Therefore, our findings delineate the distinct responses of PINs and the microenvironment to Gemini-72, and shed light on mechanisms that limit treatment&rsquo;s efficacy.</p>

                <p>Birds today are the most diverse clade of terrestrial vertebrates, and understanding why extant birds (Aves) alone among dinosaurs survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction is crucial to reconstructing the history of life. Hypotheses proposed to explain this pattern demand identification of traits unique to Aves. However, this identification is complicated by a lack of data from non-avian birds. Here, we interrogate survivorship hypotheses using data from a new, nearly complete skull of Late Cretaceous (~70 million years) bird <I>Ichthyornis</I> and reassess shifts in bird body size across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. <I>Ichthyornis</I> exhibited a wulst and segmented palate, previously proposed to have arisen within extant birds. The origin of Aves is marked by larger, reshaped brains indicating selection for relatively large telencephala and eyes but not by uniquely small body size. Sensory system differences, potentially linked to these shifts, may help explain avian survivorship relative to other dinosaurs.</p>

                <p>A wide variety of intracellular membraneless compartments are formed via liquid-liquid phase separation of charged proteins and nucleic acids. Understanding the stability of these compartments, while accounting for the compositional heterogeneity intrinsic to cellular environments, poses a daunting challenge. We combined experimental and theoretical efforts to study the effects of nonstoichiometric mixing on coacervation behavior and accurately measured the concentrations of polyelectrolytes and small ions in the coacervate and supernatant phases. For synthetic polyacrylamides and polypeptides/DNA, with unequal mixing stoichiometry, we report a general "looping-in" phenomenon found around physiological salt concentrations, where the polymer concentrations in the coacervate initially increase with salt addition before subsequently decreasing. This looping-in behavior is captured by a molecular model that considers reversible ion binding and electrostatic interactions. Further analysis in the low-salt regime shows that the looping-in phenomenon originates from the translational entropy of counterions that are needed to neutralize nonstoichiometric coacervates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Metabolic control of nitrogen fixation in rhizobium-legume symbioses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rhizobia induce nodule formation on legume roots and differentiate into bacteroids, which catabolize plant-derived dicarboxylates to reduce atmospheric N<SUB>2</SUB> into ammonia. Despite the agricultural importance of this symbiosis, the mechanisms that govern carbon and nitrogen allocation in bacteroids and promote ammonia secretion to the plant are largely unknown. Using a metabolic model derived from genome-scale datasets, we show that carbon polymer synthesis and alanine secretion by bacteroids facilitate redox balance in microaerobic nodules. Catabolism of dicarboxylates induces not only a higher oxygen demand but also a higher NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio than sugars. Modeling and <sup>13</sup>C metabolic flux analysis indicate that oxygen limitation restricts the decarboxylating arm of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which limits ammonia assimilation into glutamate. By tightly controlling oxygen supply and providing dicarboxylates as the energy and electron source donors for N<SUB>2</SUB> fixation, legumes promote ammonia secretion by bacteroids. This is a defining feature of rhizobium-legume symbioses.</p>

                <p>Interpretation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serosurveillance studies is limited by poorly defined performance of antibody assays over time in individuals with different clinical presentations. We measured antibody responses in plasma samples from 128 individuals over 160 days using 14 assays. We found a consistent and strong effect of disease severity on antibody magnitude, driven by fever, cough, hospitalization, and oxygen requirement. Responses to spike protein versus nucleocapsid had consistently higher correlation with neutralization. Assays varied substantially in sensitivity during early convalescence and time to seroreversion. Variability was dramatic for individuals with mild infection, who had consistently lower antibody titers, with sensitivities at 6 months ranging from 33 to 98% for commercial assays. Thus, the ability to detect previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 is highly dependent on infection severity, timing, and the assay used. These findings have important implications for the design and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies.</p>

                <p>Flexible photonics is rapidly emerging as a promising platform for artificial smart skins to imitate or extend the capabilities of human skins. Organic material systems provide a promising avenue to directly fabricate large-scale flexible device units; however, the versatile fabrication of all-organic integrated devices with desired photonic functionalities remains a great challenge. Here, we develop an effective technique for the mass processing of organic microlaser arrays, which act as sensing units, on the chip of photonic skins. With a bilayer electron-beam direct writing method, we fabricated flexible mechanical sensor networks composed of coupled-cavity single-mode laser sources on pliable polymer substrates. These microlaser-based mechanical sensor chips were subsequently used to recognize hand gestures, showing great potential for artificial skin applications. This work represents a substantial advance toward scalable construction of high-performance and low-cost flexible photonic chips, thus paving the way for the implementation of smart photonic skins into practical applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The major mechanism of melanoma mutations is based on deamination of cytosine in pyrimidine dimers as determined by circle damage sequencing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sunlight-associated melanomas carry a unique C-to-T mutation signature. UVB radiation induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) as the major form of DNA damage, but the mechanism of how CPDs cause mutations is unclear. To map CPDs at single-base resolution genome wide, we developed the circle damage sequencing (circle-damage-seq) method. In human cells, CPDs form preferentially in a tetranucleotide sequence context (5'-Py-T&lt;&gt;Py-T/A), but this alone does not explain the tumor mutation patterns. To test whether mutations arise at CPDs by cytosine deamination, we specifically mapped UVB-induced cytosine-deaminated CPDs. Transcription start sites (TSSs) were protected from CPDs and deaminated CPDs, but both lesions were enriched immediately upstream of the TSS, suggesting a mutation-promoting role of bound transcription factors. Most importantly, the genomic dinucleotide and trinucleotide sequence specificity of deaminated CPDs matched the prominent mutation signature of melanomas. Our data identify the cytosine-deaminated CPD as the leading premutagenic lesion responsible for mutations in melanomas.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding have received much attention in the literature. Research in adults and school-age children suggest that the hippocampus and cortical regions in both frontal and parietal areas are involved in successful formation of memories. Overall, the hippocampus has been shown to interact with fronto-parietal regions to collaboratively support successful memory encoding for both individual items as well as item details (such as the source or color in which the item was originally encountered). To date, only one study has investigated neural regions engaged during memory encoding in children younger than 8 years of age, which is unfortunate since early childhood is a period of dramatic improvement in memory. This previous study indicated that both the hippocampus and cortical regions are involved during the encoding of subsequently remembered item details (i.e., sources). However, this study reported few interactions between these regions, and it did not explore item memory at a more general level. To fill these gaps, this article reanalyzed data from the previous report, aiming to examine the neural correlates of item memory during encoding in early childhood (4–8 years) and interactions between the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions during encoding. Consistent with research in older individuals, both the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions were found to participate in item memory encoding. Additionally, functional connectivity between hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions was significantly related to both subsequent item memory and subsequent source memory. Taken together, these findings suggest that not only the activation of individual brain regions (hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions) but also the functional connections between these regions are important for memory encoding. These data add to the growing literature providing insight into how the hippocampus and cortical regions interact to support memory during development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differential CTCF binding in motor neurons and lymphocytes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diversity is critical to lymphocyte roles in the immune system and to neurons, which form complex network structures in the brain. Emerging evidence suggests that an increasing number of molecules associated with the immune system are also expressed in various central nervous system (CNS) regions and play crucial roles in brain development. Examination of shared molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis and lymphocyte differentiation may clarify relevant pathways, and suggests additional biomarkers in lymphocytes for neurological disorders. These results can contribute to find biomarkers that can be monitored through patient lymphocyte populations. Methods: We analysed similarities and conserved regions in several genes regulated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) during lymphocyte and neuronal developmental stages. We performed epigenetic analyses of CTCF binding Trak1, Gabpa, Gabpb1, Gabpb2, Gfi1, Gfi1b gene loci in T and B lymphocytes at different developmental stages, as well as in neural progenitor cells and motor neurons. Results: Common and shared CTCF binding events at Trak1 suggest additional transcriptional regulatory factors that control Trak1 gene expression levels differ in neurons and lymphocytes. Gabpb1 includes a common CTCF binding site shared with neurons and lymphocytes. Correlation of CTCF binding analysis and gene expression profile suggests that CTCF binding plays a role in epigenetic regulation of Gabpb1 gene. While Gfi1a is phylogenetically well-conserved and CTCF sites are occupied in lymphocytes, there are no CTCF binding occupied in neurons and neural progenitor cells. Although Gfi1b is highly homologous to Gfi1, differences in expression levels suggest that Gfi1b is critical for both lymphogenesis and neurogenesis. Neurons and lymphocytes have multiple common CTCF binding sites in the Gfi1b gene. Conclusions: The partial overlap in CTCF regulatory sites for some genes in neurons and lymphocytes suggests that there may be markers which can exhibit parallel changes in these cells and serve as biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Eating versus skipping breakfast has no discernible effect on obesity-related anthropometric outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Eating or skipping breakfast for weight interests scientific and lay communities. Our objective was to systematically review and meta-analyze causal effects of eating versus skipping breakfast on obesity-related anthropometric outcomes in humans. Methods: Six databases were searched for obesity- and breakfast-related terms (final search: 02 JAN 2020). Studies needed to isolate eating versus skipping breakfast in randomized controlled trials. Mean differences were synthesized using inverse variance random effects meta-analysis for each outcome. Positive estimates indicate higher outcomes in breakfast conditions (e.g., weight gain). Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, secondary baseline habit-by-breakfast assignment analysis, and study duration cumulative analysis were performed. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Ten articles (12 comparisons; 6d-12wk) were included. Conditions included recommendations to eat versus skip breakfast, or provision of some or all meals. 95% confidence intervals of all main analyses included the null value of no difference for each outcome: body weight (0.17 kg [-0.40,0.73], k=12, n=487, I 2=74.5), BMI (0.07 kg/m 2 [-0.10,0.23, k=8, n=396, I 2=54.1), body fat percentage (-0.27% [-1.01,0.47], k=6, n=179, I 2=52.4), fat mass (0.24 kg [-0.21,0.69], k=6, n=205, I 2=0.0), lean mass (0.18 kg [-0.08,0.44], k=6, n=205, I 2=6.7), waist circumference (0.18 cm [-1.77,2.13], k=4, n=102, I 2=78.7), waist:hip ratio (0.00 [-0.01,0.01], k=4, n=102, I 2=8.0), sagittal abdominal diameter (0.19 cm [-2.35,2.73], k=2, n=56, I 2=0.0), and fat mass index (0.00 kg/m 2 [-0.22,0.23], k=2, n=56, I 2=0.0). Subgroup analysis showed only one statistically significant result. The interaction effect for BMI (–0.36[-0.65,-0.07]) indicates assignment to conditions consistent with baseline habits had lower BMI. Leave-one-out analysis did not indicate substantial influence of any one study. Conclusions: There was no discernible effect of eating or skipping breakfast on obesity-related anthropometric measures when pooling studies with substantial design heterogeneity and sometimes statistical heterogeneity. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42016033290.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Organizing knowledge to enable faster data interpretation in COVID-19 research [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Enormous volumes of COVID-19 research data have been published and this continues to increase daily. This creates challenges for researchers to interpret, prioritize and summarize their own findings in the context of published literature, clinical trials, and a multitude of databases. Overcoming the data interpretation bottleneck is vital to help researchers to be more efficient in their quest to identify COVID-19 risk factors, potential treatments, drug side-effects, and much more. As a proof of concept, we have organized and integrated a range of COVID-19 and human biomedical data and literature into a knowledge graph (KG). Here we present the datasets we have integrated so far and the content of the KG which consists of 674,969 biological concepts and over 1.6 million relationships between them. The COVID-19 KG is available via KnetMiner, an interactive online platform for gene discovery and knowledge mining, or via RDF and Neo4j graph formats which can be searched programmatically through SPARQL and Cypher endpoints. KnetMiner is a road mapped ELIXIR UK service. We hope this integrated resource will enable faster data interpretation and discovery of linkages between genes, drugs, diseases and many more types of information relating to COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling of DNA binding to the condensin hinge domain using molecular dynamics simulations guided by atomic force microscopy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hiroki Koide, Noriyuki Kodera, Shveta Bisht, Shoji Takada, Tsuyoshi Terakawa</p>

The condensin protein complex compacts chromatin during mitosis using its DNA-loop extrusion activity. Previous studies proposed scrunching and loop-capture models as molecular mechanisms for the loop extrusion process, both of which assume the binding of double-strand (ds) DNA to the hinge domain formed at the interface of the condensin subunits Smc2 and Smc4. However, how the hinge domain contacts dsDNA has remained unknown. Here, we conducted atomic force microscopy imaging of the budding yeast condensin holo-complex and used this data as basis for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to model the hinge structure in a transient open conformation. We then simulated the dsDNA binding to open and closed hinge conformations, predicting that dsDNA binds to the outside surface when closed and to the outside and inside surfaces when open. Our simulations also suggested that the hinge can close around dsDNA bound to the inside surface. Based on these simulation results, we speculate that the conformational change of the hinge domain might be essential for the dsDNA binding regulation and play roles in condensin-mediated DNA-loop extrusion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Theta-gamma coupling emerges from spatially heterogeneous cholinergic neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yihao Yang, Howard Gritton, Martin Sarter, Sara J. Aton, Victoria Booth, Michal Zochowski</p>

Theta and gamma rhythms and their cross-frequency coupling play critical roles in perception, attention, learning, and memory. Available data suggest that forebrain acetylcholine (ACh) signaling promotes theta-gamma coupling, although the mechanism has not been identified. Recent evidence suggests that cholinergic signaling is both temporally and spatially constrained, in contrast to the traditional notion of slow, spatially homogeneous, and diffuse neuromodulation. Here, we find that spatially constrained cholinergic stimulation can generate theta-modulated gamma rhythms. Using biophysically-based excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) neural network models, we simulate the effects of ACh on neural excitability by varying the conductance of a muscarinic receptor-regulated K<sup>+</sup> current. In E-I networks with local excitatory connectivity and global inhibitory connectivity, we demonstrate that theta-gamma-coupled firing patterns emerge in ACh modulated network regions. Stable gamma-modulated firing arises within regions with high ACh signaling, while theta or mixed theta-gamma activity occurs at the peripheries of these regions. High gamma activity also alternates between different high-ACh regions, at theta frequency. Our results are the first to indicate a causal role for spatially heterogenous ACh signaling in the emergence of localized theta-gamma rhythmicity. Our findings also provide novel insights into mechanisms by which ACh signaling supports the brain region-specific attentional processing of sensory information.

                <p>by Mandhri Abeysooriya, Megan Soria, Mary Sravya Kasu, Mark Ziemann</p>

Erroneous conversion of gene names into other dates and other data types has been a frustration for computational biologists for years. We hypothesized that such errors in supplementary files might diminish after a report in 2016 highlighting the extent of the problem. To assess this, we performed a scan of supplementary files published in PubMed Central from 2014 to 2020. Overall, gene name errors continued to accumulate unabated in the period after 2016. An improved scanning software we developed identified gene name errors in 30.9% (3,436/11,117) of articles with supplementary Excel gene lists; a figure significantly higher than previously estimated. This is due to gene names being converted not just to dates and floating-point numbers, but also to internal date format (five-digit numbers). These findings further reinforce that spreadsheets are ill-suited to use with large genomic data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Selection of stimulus parameters for enhancing slow wave sleep events with a neural-field theory thalamocortical model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Felipe A. Torres, Patricio Orio, María-José Escobar</p>

Slow-wave sleep cortical brain activity, conformed by slow-oscillations and sleep spindles, plays a key role in memory consolidation. The increase of the power of the slow-wave events, obtained by auditory sensory stimulation, positively correlates to memory consolidation performance. However, little is known about the experimental protocol maximizing this effect, which could be induced by the power of slow-oscillation, the number of sleep spindles, or the timing of both events’ co-occurrence. Using a mean-field model of thalamocortical activity, we studied the effect of several stimulation protocols, varying the pulse shape, duration, amplitude, and frequency, as well as a target-phase using a closed-loop approach. We evaluated the effect of these parameters on slow-oscillations (SO) and sleep-spindles (SP), considering: (i) the power at the frequency bands of interest, (ii) the number of SO and SP, (iii) co-occurrences between SO and SP, and (iv) synchronization of SP with the up-peak of the SO. The first three targets are maximized using a decreasing ramp pulse with a pulse duration of 50 ms. Also, we observed a reduction in the number of SO when increasing the stimulus energy by rising its amplitude. To assess the target-phase parameter, we applied closed-loop stimulation at 0°, 45°, and 90° of the phase of the narrow-band filtered ongoing activity, at 0.85 Hz as central frequency. The 0° stimulation produces better results in the power and number of SO and SP than the rhythmic or random stimulation. On the other hand, stimulating at 45° or 90° change the timing distribution of spindles centers but with fewer co-occurrences than rhythmic and 0° phase. Finally, we propose the application of closed-loop stimulation at the rising zero-cross point using pulses with a decreasing ramp shape and 50 ms of duration for future experimental work.

                <p>by Daltry L. Snider, Stacy M. Horner</p>

A new study in PLOS Biology finds that interferon (IFN)-induced adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) mRNA is N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified to promote its translation, enabling ADAR1 to modify self-double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) generated during the IFN response and preventing activation of the melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (MDA5)-mediated host antiviral response.

This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology which finds that interferon-induced ADAR1 mRNA is m6A-modified to promote its translation, enabling ADAR1 to modify self-dsRNAs generated during the interferon response; this prevents recognition of these self RNAs and erroneous activation of the MDA5-mediated host antiviral response.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products, mostly as food supplements. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to hydrolytic conversion of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the  adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 181 food products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 21 products (12%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Inversely, CBD was present in the products below the no observed adverse effect level. Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC and not due to effects of CBD itself. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

                Background: Firefighters are placed under severe cardiovascular load in performing active duty and, when carrying various coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, firefighters are predisposed to significant morbidity and mortality. Reducing the incidence of these risk factors is paramount. The purpose of this study is to determine the predictors of CAD risk.   Methods: This study used a quantitative, cross-sectional and correlational design. The researchers conveniently sampled 124 full-time firefighters from the City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service. A researcher-generated questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and CAD risk factors information, such as age, gender, ethnicity, family history of CAD, cigarette smoking and physical activity levels, and all research procedures were conducted according to the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. Data collection took place between September and November 2019. Linear and logistic regression were used to determine the relationship between the various CAD risk factors and the predictors of CAD risk.   Results: Age was a significant predictor of hypertension (p <0.01), dyslipidemia (p <0.01), diabetes (p <0.01), obesity (p <0.01) and central obesity (p <0.01). Gender was a significant predictor of obesity, central obesity and cigarette smoking (p <0.05). Waist circumference was a significant predictor of hypertension (p <0.01), dyslipidemia (p <0.01) and diabetes (p <0.05).   Conclusion: Age was a significant predictor of various modifiable CAD risk factors, including obesity, in both genders and all ethnicities. Attentive monitoring should be in place as firefighters age, along with behavioural modifications designed to reduce age-related increases in CAD risk factors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Norwegian public’s ability to assess treatment claims: results of a cross-sectional study of critical health literacy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Few studies have evaluated the ability of the general public to assess the trustworthiness of claims about the effects of healthcare. For the most part, those studies have used self-reported measures of critical health literacy. Methods: We mailed 4500 invitations to Norwegian adults. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four online questionnaires that included multiple-choice questions that test understanding of Key Concepts people need to understand to assess healthcare claims. They also included questions about intended behaviours and self-efficacy. One of the four questionnaires was identical to one previously used in two randomised trials of educational interventions in Uganda, facilitating comparisons to Ugandan children, parents, and teachers. We adjusted the results using demographic data to reflect the population. Results: A total of 771 people responded. The adjusted proportion of Norwegian adults who answered correctly was > 50% for 17 of the 30 Key Concepts. On the other hand, less than half answered correctly for 13 concepts. The results for Norwegian adults were better than the results for Ugandan children in the intervention arm of the trial and parents, and similar to those of Ugandan teachers in the intervention arm of the trial. Based on self-report, most Norwegians are likely to find out the basis of treatment claims, but few consider it easy to assess whether claims are based on research and to assess the trustworthiness of research. Conclusions: Norwegian adults do not understand many concepts that are essential for assessing healthcare claims and making informed choices.Future interventions should be tailored to address Key Concepts for which there appears to be a lack of understanding.

<p>We discovered P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia in the rat antral lesser curvature by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations with confocal scanning laser microscopy. The nerve endings were derived from large web-like structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors, and wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia with pleomorphic terminal structures. The nerve endings may be specialized ending structures of vagal mechanoreceptors to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We previously reported P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3)-expressing vagal afferent nerve endings with large web-like structures in the subserosal tissue of the antral lesser curvature, suggesting that these nerve endings were one of the vagal mechanoreceptors. The present study investigated the morphological relationship between P2X3-immunoreactive nerve endings and serosal ganglia in the rat gastric antrum by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like subserosal nerve endings with new morphology were distributed laterally to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into numerous nerve fibers with pleomorphic flattened structures to form basket-like nerve endings, and the parent axons were originated from large net-like structures of vagal afferent nerve endings. Basket-like nerve endings wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia, which were characterized by neurofilament 200 kDa-immunoreactive neurons with or without neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity and S100B-immunoreactive glial cells. Furthermore, basket-like nerve endings were localized in close apposition to dopamine beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive sympathetic nerve fibers immunoreactive for vesicular nucleotide transporter. These results suggest that P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings associated with serosal ganglia are the specialized ending structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors in order to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis, and are activated by ATP from sympathetic nerve fibers and/or serosal ganglia for the regulation of mechanoreceptor function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Economic burden of out-of-pocket expenditure, productivity cost during pregnancy and COVID-19 impact on household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka; A study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Investigating the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) associated with maternal health is important since OOPE directly affects the affordability of health services. Global evidence suggests the importance of capturing the productivity cost during pregnancy in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. Furthermore, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the household economy needs to be further evaluated as pregnant women are one of the most vulnerable groups. This study aims at determining the economic burden of OOPE, productivity cost, and COVID-19 impact on pregnant women's household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka. Methods: The study setting is all 22 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. The study has three components; a follow-up study of a cohort of pregnant women to assess the magnitude and associated factors of OOPE and to assess the productivity cost (Component 1), a qualitative case study to explore the impact and causes of the OOPE under free health services (Component 2) and a cross-sectional study to describe the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on household economy (Component 3). The study samples consist of 1,393 and 1,460 participants for components one and three, respectively, and 25 pregnant women will be recruited for component two. The data will be analyzed using descriptive, parametric, and non-parametric statistics for the first and third components and thematic analysis for the second component. Discussion: With the lack of evidence on OOPE, productivity loss/cost in terms of maternal health, and COVID-19 impact on household economy in Sri Lanka, the evidence generated from this study would be valuable for policymakers, health care administrators, and health care practitioners globally, regionally, and locally to plan for future measures for reducing the OOPE, productivity loss/cost, and minimizing the economic hardship of the COVID-19 outbreak during pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Accumulation of essential (copper, iron, zinc) and non-essential (lead, cadmium) heavy metals in Caulerpa racemosa, sea water, and marine sediments of Bintan Island, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Heavy metals are materials naturally occurring in nature and increase with a rise in human activity. Ex-mining areas and domestic waste from human settlements are sources of heavy metal contamination that enter and pollute water, which then accumulates in various organisms including the Caulerpa racemosa community. The accumulation of heavy metals in C. racemosa has a wide impact on the food chain in aquatic ecosystems and humans because this alga is a consumptive commodity.   Methods: Sampling of C. racemosa was carried out at seven sites on Bintan Island, Indonesia covering the eastern (Teluk Bakau, Beralas Pasir, Malang Rapat), northern (Berakit and Pengudang), western (Sakera), and southern parts (Tg. Siambang). Sampling was carried out during different monsoons, and heavy metals in water and sediment samples were measured to determine the heavy metal concentration. Heavy metals were analyzed by a spectrophotometric method using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.   Results: The results showed that heavy metal concentrations fluctuate according to changes in the wind season, which carry currents and spread pollutants into the water. The concentration of metal in the water is also from anthropogenic activities. The heavy metal content of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) in C. racemosa is high in locations close to settlements. Meanwhile, in seawater samples, Fe and Zn metals have the highest concentrations compared to others.  Conclusions: Ex-bauxite mines are a source of Fe and Zn metal contamination in the environment, especially at Tg. Siambang. The levels of these heavy metals in the sediment are also high, as surface particle deposits accumulate at the bottom of the sediment. In general, the levels of heavy metals Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe, and Zn increase in the northern monsoon because the dynamics of the water transport greater heavy metal pollution.

                Small, isolated teaching centers have difficulty mentoring interprofessional junior faculty in research methods and grant writing. Peer mentoring programs for grant writing at larger institutions have been successful. In this short report, we describe our program that leveraged mentor experience using four framing seminars followed by project refinement in three-person peer groups and monthly mentored works in progress meetings. In its first year, ten faculty from medicine, psychology, and pharmacy completed the program and successfully obtained six funded grants. Five of the projects transitioned from single profession applications to interprofessional applications as participants connected and profession-specific expertise was identified. Refinements for future cohorts are discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low back pain and associated risk factors among medical students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Different studies showed the high prevalence of LBP among medical students. However, no study has been conducted on Bangladeshi medical students to estimate the prevalence of LBP. This study evaluated the prevalence, characteristics, and associated risk factors of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 among randomly selected 270 medical students and medical interns in Faridpur Medical College, Bangladesh, using an online questionnaire. In data analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression were performed, and a p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 207 participants responded fully to the survey, and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 22.36 ± 1.915 years. The point, 6-month, and 12-month prevalence of LBP was 25.6%, 46.9%, and 63.3%, respectively. In most participants, LBP was localized (53.2%), recurrent (64.9%), undiagnosed (70.8%), affected for a short period (55%), and relieved without receiving any treatment (60.4%). Participants who had a significantly higher 12-month prevalence of LBP included females (72.2% vs 52.2%), with BMI >25 kg/m2 (73.2% vs 56.7%), those who performed physical activity at low to moderate frequency (72.4% vs 29.5%), those who spent > 6 hours/day by sitting (71.3% vs 45.3%), and those who did not have enough rest time (92.7% vs 56%). Ergonomic features of chairs, such as having back support, adjustable back support, and adjustable sitting surface, significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the outcomes. Conclusion: The prevalence of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh was high, and most of the risk factors associated with the high prevalence of LBP were modifiable. Hence, LBP can be prevented by implementing preventive strategies and providing ergonomic training and physical activity facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">rmcorrShiny: A web and standalone application for repeated measures correlation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We describe a web and standalone Shiny app for calculating the common, linear within-individual association for repeated assessments of paired measures with multiple individuals: repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). This tool makes rmcorr more widely accessible, providing a graphical interface for performing and visualizing the output of analysis with rmcorr. In contrast to rmcorr, most widely used correlation techniques assume paired data are independent. Incorrectly analyzing repeated measures data as independent will likely produce misleading results. Using aggregation or separate models to address the issue of independence may obscure meaningful patterns and will also tend to reduce statistical power. rmcorrShiny (repeated measures correlation Shiny) provides a simple and accessible solution for computing the repeated measures correlation. It is available at: https://lmarusich.shinyapps.io/shiny_rmcorr/.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">McsB forms a gated kinase chamber to mark aberrant bacterial proteins for degradation</a></h4>

              
                In Gram-positive bacteria, the McsB protein arginine kinase is central to protein quality control, labelling aberrant molecules for degradation by the ClpCP protease. Despite its importance for stress response and pathogenicity, it is still elusive how the bacterial degradation labelling is regulated. Here, we delineate the mechanism how McsB targets aberrant proteins during stress conditions. Structural data reveal a self-compartmentalized kinase, in which the active sites are sequestered in a molecular cage. The 'closed' octamer interconverts with other oligomers in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and, contrary to these 'open' forms, preferentially labels unfolded proteins. In vivo data show that heat-shock triggers accumulation of higher-order oligomers, of which the octameric McsB is essential for surviving stress situations. The interconversion of open and closed oligomers represents a distinct regulatory mechanism of a degradation labeler, allowing the McsB kinase to adapt its potentially dangerous enzyme function to the needs of the bacterial cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Resonating neurons stabilize heterogeneous grid-cell networks</a></h4>

              
                A central theme that governs the functional design of biological networks is their ability to sustain stable function despite widespread parametric variability. Here, we investigated the impact of distinct forms of biological heterogeneities on the stability of a two-dimensional continuous attractor network (CAN) implicated in grid-patterned activity generation. We show that increasing degrees of biological heterogeneities progressively disrupted the emergence of grid-patterned activity and resulted in progressively large perturbations in low-frequency neural activity. We postulated that targeted suppression of low-frequency perturbations could ameliorate heterogeneity-induced disruptions of grid-patterned activity. To test this, we introduced intrinsic resonance, a physiological mechanism to suppress low-frequency activity, either by adding an additional high-pass filter (phenomenological) or by incorporating a slow negative feedback loop (mechanistic) into our model neurons. Strikingly, CAN models with resonating neurons were resilient to the incorporation of heterogeneities and exhibited stable grid-patterned firing. We found CAN networks with mechanistic resonators to be more effective in targeted suppression of low-frequency activity, with the slow kinetics of the negative feedback loop essential in stabilizing these networks. As low-frequency perturbations (1/<i>f</i> noise) are pervasive across biological systems, our analyses suggest a universal role for mechanisms that suppress low-frequency activity in stabilizing heterogeneous biological networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Social fluidity mobilizes contagion in human and animal populations</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other group-living animals tend to distribute their social effort disproportionately. Individuals predominantly interact with a small number of close companions while maintaining weaker social bonds with less familiar group members. By incorporating this behavior into a mathematical model, we find that a single parameter, which we refer to as <i>social fluidity</i>, controls the rate of social mixing within the group. Large values of social fluidity correspond to gregarious behavior, whereas small values signify the existence of persistent bonds between individuals. We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak, we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity. As social fluidity increases, animal-disease systems become increasingly density-dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that social fluidity is a stronger predictor of disease outcomes than both group size and connectivity, and it provides an integrated framework for both density-dependent and frequency-dependent transmission.

                The development of pancreatic cancer requires recruitment and activation of different macrophage populations. However, little is known about how macrophages are attracted to the pancreas after injury or an oncogenic event, and how they crosstalk with lesion cells or other cells of the lesion microenvironment. Here, we delineate the importance of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling during the early phase of murine pancreatic cancer. We show that CXCL10 is produced by pancreatic precancerous lesion cells in response to IFNγ signaling, and that inflammatory macrophages are recipients for this chemokine. CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in macrophages mediates their chemoattraction to the pancreas, enhances their proliferation and maintains their inflammatory identity. Blocking of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling <i>in vivo</i> shifts macrophage populations to a tumor promoting (Ym1<sup>+</sup>, Fizz<sup>+</sup>, Arg1<sup>+</sup>) phenotype, increases fibrosis and mediates progression of lesions, highlighting the importance of this pathway in PDA development. This is reversed when CXCL10 is overexpressed in PanIN cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sensory coding and the causal impact of mouse cortex in a visual decision</a></h4>

              
                Correlates of sensory stimuli and motor actions are found in multiple cortical areas, but such correlates do not indicate whether these areas are causally relevant to task performance. We trained mice to discriminate visual contrast and report their decision by steering a wheel. Widefield calcium imaging and Neuropixels recordings in cortex revealed stimulus-related activity in visual (VIS) and frontal (MOs) areas, and widespread movement-related activity across the whole dorsal cortex. Optogenetic inactivation biased choices only when targeted at VIS and MOs,proportionally to each site's encoding of the visual stimulus, and at times corresponding to peak stimulus decoding. A neurometric model based on summing and subtracting activity in VIS and MOs successfully described behavioral performance and predicted the effect of optogenetic inactivation. Thus, sensory signals localized in visual and frontal cortex play a causal role in task performance, while widespread dorsal cortical signals correlating with movement reflect processes that do not play a causal role.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long-term stability of cortical ensembles</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal ensembles, coactive groups of neurons found in spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, are causally related to memories and perception, but it still unknown how stable or flexible they are over time. We used two-photon multiplane calcium imaging to track over weeks the activity of the same pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex from awake mice and recorded their spontaneous and visually evoked responses. Less than half of the neurons were commonly active across any two imaging sessions. These 'common neurons' formed stable ensembles lasting weeks, but some ensembles were also transient and appeared only in one single session. Stable ensembles preserved ~68 % of their neurons up to 46 days, our longest imaged period, and these 'core' cells had stronger functional connectivity. Our results demonstrate that neuronal ensembles can last for weeks and could, in principle, serve as a substrate for long-lasting representation of perceptual states or memories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast and flexible estimation of effective migration surfaces</a></h4>

              
                Spatial population genetic data often exhibits ‘isolation-by-distance,’ where genetic similarity tends to decrease as individuals become more geographically distant. The rate at which genetic similarity decays with distance is often spatially heterogeneous due to variable population processes like genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. Petkova et al., 2016 developed a statistical method called Estimating Effective Migration Surfaces (EEMS) for visualizing spatially heterogeneous isolation-by-distance on a geographic map. While EEMS is a powerful tool for depicting spatial population structure, it can suffer from slow runtimes. Here, we develop a related method called Fast Estimation of Effective Migration Surfaces (FEEMS). FEEMS uses a Gaussian Markov Random Field model in a penalized likelihood framework that allows for efficient optimization and output of effective migration surfaces. Further, the efficient optimization facilitates the inference of migration parameters per edge in the graph, rather than per node (as in EEMS). With simulations, we show conditions under which FEEMS can accurately recover effective migration surfaces with complex gene-flow histories, including those with anisotropy. We apply FEEMS to population genetic data from North American gray wolves and show it performs favorably in comparison to EEMS, with solutions obtained orders of magnitude faster. Overall, FEEMS expands the ability of users to quickly visualize and interpret spatial structure in their data.

                <i>Hydra vulgaris</i> is an emerging model organism for neuroscience due to its small size, transparency, genetic tractability, and regenerative nervous system; however, fundamental properties of its sensorimotor behaviors remain unknown. Here, we use microfluidic devices combined with fluorescent calcium imaging and surgical resectioning to study how the diffuse nervous system coordinates <i>Hydra</i>'s mechanosensory response. Mechanical stimuli cause animals to contract, and we find this response relies on at least two distinct networks of neurons in the oral and aboral regions of the animal. Different activity patterns arise in these networks depending on whether the animal is contracting spontaneously or contracting in response to mechanical stimulation. Together, these findings improve our understanding of how <i>Hydra</i>’s diffuse nervous system coordinates sensorimotor behaviors. These insights help reveal how sensory information is processed in an animal with a diffuse, radially symmetric neural architecture unlike the dense, bilaterally symmetric nervous systems found in most model organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Application of human liver organoids as a patient-derived primary model for HBV infection and related hepatocellular carcinoma</a></h4>

              
                The molecular events that drive Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-mediated transformation and tumorigenesis have remained largely unclear, due to the absence of a relevant primary model system. Here we propose the use of human liver organoids as a platform for modeling HBV infection and related tumorigenesis. We first describe a primary ex vivo HBV-infection model derived from healthy donor liver organoids after challenge with recombinant virus or HBV-infected patient serum. HBV infected organoids produced cccDNA, HBeAg, expressed intracellular HBV RNA and proteins, and produced infectious HBV. This ex vivo HBV infected primary differentiated hepatocyte organoid platform was amenable to drug screening for both anti-HBV activity as well as for drug-induced toxicity. We also studied HBV replication in transgenically modified organoids; liver organoids exogenously overexpressing the HBV receptor NTCP after lentiviral transduction were not more susceptible to HBV, suggesting the necessity for additional host factors for efficient infection. We also generated transgenic organoids harboring integrated HBV, representing a long-term culture system also suitable for viral production and the study of HBV transcription. Finally, we generated HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoids from non-tumor cirrhotic tissue of explants from liver transplant patients. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis of patient-derived liver organoids indicated the presence of an aberrant early cancer gene signature, which clustered with the HCC cohort on the TCGA LIHC dataset and away from healthy liver tissue, and may provide invaluable novel biomarkers for the development of HCC and surveillance in HBV infected patients.

                The term ‘temporal discounting’ describes both choice preferences and motivation for delayed rewards. Here we show that neuronal activity in the dorsal part of the primate caudate head (dCDh) signals the temporally discounted value needed to compute the motivation for delayed rewards. Macaque monkeys performed an instrumental task, in which visual cues indicated the forthcoming size and delay duration before reward. Single dCDh neurons represented the temporally discounted value without reflecting changes in the animal’s physiological state. Bilateral pharmacological or chemogenetic inactivation of dCDh markedly distorted the normal task performance based on the integration of reward size and delay, but did not affect the task performance for different reward sizes without delay. These results suggest that dCDh is involved in encoding the integrated multidimensional information critical for motivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The sensory code within sense of time</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experiences are accompanied by the perception of the passage of time; a cell phone vibration, for instance, is sensed as brief or long. The neuronal mechanisms underlying the perception of elapsed time remain unknown1. Recent work agrees on a role for cortical processing networks2,3, however the causal function of sensory cortex in time perception has not yet been specified. We hypothesize that the mechanisms for time perception are embedded within primary sensory cortex and are thus governed by the basic rules of sensory coding. By recording and optogenetically modulating neuronal activity in rat vibrissal somatosensory cortex, we find that the percept of stimulus duration is dilated and compressed by optogenetic excitation and inhibition, respectively, during stimulus delivery. A second set of rats judged the intensity of tactile stimuli; here, optogenetic excitation amplified the intensity percept, demonstrating sensory cortex to be the common gateway to both time and stimulus feature processing. The coding algorithms for sensory features are well established4-10. Guided by these algorithms, we formulated a 3-stage model beginning with the membrane currents evoked by vibrissal and optogenetic drive and culminating in the representation of perceived time; this model successfully replicated rats' choices. Our finding that stimulus coding is intrinsic to sense of time disagrees with dedicated pacemaker-accumulator operation models11-13, where sensory input acts only to trigger the onset and offset of the timekeeping process. Time perception is thus as deeply intermeshed within the sensory processing pathway as is the sense of touch itself14,15 and can now be treated through the computational language of sensory coding. The model presented here readily generalizes to humans14,16 and opens up new approaches to understanding the time misperception at the core of numerous neurological conditions17,18.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Widespread nociceptive maps in the human neonatal somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Topographic cortical maps are essential for spatial localisation of sensory stimulation and generation of appropriate task-related motor responses. Somatosensation and nociception are finely mapped and aligned in the adult somatosensory (S1) cortex, but in infancy, when pain behaviour is disorganised and poorly directed, nociceptive maps may be less refined. We compared the topographic pattern of S1 activation following noxious (clinically required heel lance) and innocuous (touch) mechanical stimulation of the same skin region in newborn infants (n=32) using multi-optode functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Signal to noise ratio and overall activation area did not differ with stimulus modality. Within S1 cortex, touch and lance of the heel elicit localised, partially overlapping increases in oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO), but while touch activation was restricted to the heel area, lance activation extended into cortical hand regions. The data reveals a widespread cortical nociceptive map in infant S1, consistent with their poorly directed pain behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new protocol for multiple muscle mapping using nTMS</a></h4>

              
                Background: Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a safe and non-invasive tool for investigating cortical representation of muscles in the primary motor cortex. While non-navigated TMS has been successfully applied to simultaneously induce motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in multiple muscles, a more rigorous assessment of the corresponding cortical representation can greatly benefit from navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). Objective: We designed a protocol to map the entire precentral gyrus using neural navigation while recording responses of eight muscles simultaneously. Here, we evaluated the feasibility, validity, and reliability of this protocol. Method: Twenty participants underwent conventional (i.e., muscle-based, grid-constrained) and gyrus-based nTMS mapping. For both protocols, we investigated three different stimulation intensities during two consecutive sessions. Results: The gyrus-based nTMS mapping was received well by all participants and was less time consuming than the grid-constrained standard. On average, MEP amplitudes, latencies, and centre-of-gravity and size of the active areas largely agreed across protocols supporting validity. Intraclass coefficients between sessions unscored the reliability of our protocol. Conclusion: We designed an nTMS protocol for the simultaneous mapping multiple muscles on the cortex. The protocol takes only about ten minutes per participant when including as many as eight muscles. Our assessments revealed that the cortical representation of multiple muscles can be determined with high validity and reliability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multimodal neuroprosthetic interface to record, modulate and classify electrophysiological correlates of cognitive function</a></h4>

              
                Most mental disorders are characterised by impaired cognitive function and behaviour control. Their often chronic reoccurring nature and the lack of efficient therapies necessitate the development of new treatment strategies. Brain-computer interfaces, equipped with multiple sensing and stimulation abilities, offer a new toolbox, whose suitability for diagnosis and therapy of mental disorders has not yet been explored. Here, we developed a soft and multimodal neuroprosthesis to measure and modulate prefrontal neurophysiological features of neuropsychiatric symptoms. We implanted the device epidurally above the medial prefrontal cortex of rats and obtained auditory event-related brain potentials reflecting intact neural stimulus processing and alcohol-induced neural impairments. Moreover, implant-driven electrical and pharmacological stimulation enabled successful modulation of neural activity. Finally, we developed machine learning algorithms which can deal with sparsity in the data and distinguish effects with high accuracy. Our work underlines the potential of multimodal bioelectronic systems to enable a personalised and optimised therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG Alpha Power and Pupil Diameter Reflect Endogenous Auditory Attention Switching and Listening Effort</a></h4>

              
                Auditory attention describes a listeners focus on an acoustic source while they ignore other competing sources that might be present. In an environment with multiple talkers and background noise (i.e. the cocktail party effect), auditory attention can be difficult, requiring the listener to expend measurable cognitive effort. A listener will naturally interrupt sustained attention on a source when switching towards another source during conversation. This change in attention is potentially even more taxing than maintaining sustained attention due to the limits of human working memory, and this additional effort required has not been well studied. In this work, we evaluated an attention decoder algorithm for detecting the change in attention and investigated cognitive effort expended during attentional switching and sustained attention. Two variants of endogenous attention switching were explored: the switches either had in-the-moment decision making or a pre-defined attentional switch time. A least-squares, EEG-based, attention decoding algorithm achieved 64.1% accuracy with a 5-second correlation window and illustrated smooth transitions in the attended talker prediction through switches in sustained attention at approximately half of the analysis window size (2.2 seconds). The expended listening effort, as measured by simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry, was also a strong indicator of switching. Specifically, centrotemporal alpha power [F(2, 18) = 7.473, P = 0.00434] and mean pupil diameter [F(2, 18) = 9.159, P = 0.0018] were significantly different for trials that contained a switch in comparison to sustained trials. We also found that relative attended and ignored talker locations modulate the EEG alpha topographic response. This alpha lateralization was found to be impacted by the interaction between experimental condition and whether the measure was computed before or after the switch [F(2,18) = 3.227, P = 0.0634]. These results suggest that expended listening effort is a promising feature that should be pursued in a decoding context, in addition to speech and location-based features.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Antibiotic treatment induces activation of microglia and impairment of cholinergic gamma oscillations in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotics are widely applied for the treatment of bacterial infections, but their long-term use may lead to gut flora dysbiosis and detrimental effects on brain physiology, behavior as well as cognitive performance. Still, a striking lack of knowledge exists concerning electrophysiological correlates of antibiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota and behavior. Here, we investigated changes in the synaptic transmission and plasticity together with behaviorally-relevant network activities from the hippocampus of antibiotic-treated mice. The prolonged antibiotic treatment led to a strong reduction of myeloid cell pools in bone marrow, circulation and those surveilling the brain. Upon antibiotic treatment, circulating Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes adopted a proinflammatory phenotype with increased expression of CD40 and MHC II. In the central nervous system, microglia displayed typical signs of activation with elevated CD40 and MHC II expression, as well as increased IL-6 and TNF production. Concomitantly, we detected a substantial reduction in the synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 after antibiotic treatment. In line, carbachol-induced cholinergic gamma oscillation were reduced upon antibiotic treatment while the incidence of hippocampal sharp waves was elevated. These changes were associated with the global changes in the expression of neurotrophin nerve growth factor and inducible nitric oxide synthase, both of which have been shown to influence cholinergic functions. Overall, our study demonstrates that antibiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiome and immune cell function are associated with a drastic reduction in the synaptic transmission and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus, a brain region that is critically involved in mediation of innate and cognitive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-Related Differences in Ventral Striatal and Default Mode Network Function During Reciprocated Trust</a></h4>

              
                Social relationships change across the lifespan as social networks narrow and motivational priorities shift to the present. Interestingly, aging is also associated with changes in executive function, including decision-making abilities, but it remains unclear how age-related changes in both domains interact to impact financial decisions involving other people. To study this problem, we recruited 50 human participants (N_younger = 26, ages 18-34; N_older = 24, ages 63-80) to play an economic trust game as the investor with three partners (friend, stranger, and computer) who played the role of investee. Investors underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the trust game while investees were seated outside of the scanner. Building on our previous work with younger adults showing both enhanced striatal responses and altered default-mode network (DMN) connectivity as a function of social closeness during reciprocated trust, we predicted that these relations would exhibit age-related differences. We found that striatal responses to reciprocated trust from friends relative to strangers and computers were blunted in older adults relative to younger adults, thus supporting our primary pre-registered hypothesis regarding social closeness. We also found that older adults exhibited enhanced DMN connectivity with the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during reciprocated trust from friends compared to computers while younger adults exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of age-related differences in sensitivity to social closeness in the context of trusting others.

                Excitotoxicity caused by NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is a major cause of neuronal death in ischemic stroke. However, past efforts of directly targeting NMDARs have unfortunately failed in clinical ischemic stroke trials. Here we reveal an unexpected mechanism underlying NMDARs-mediated neurotoxicity, which leads to identification of a novel target and development of an effective therapeutic peptide for ischemic stroke. We show that NMDARs excitotoxicity upon ischemic insults is mediated by physical and functional coupling to TRPM2. The physical interaction of TRPM2 with NMDARs results in markedly increase in the surface expression of NMDARs, leading to enhanced NMDAR function and increased neuronal death. We identified a specific NMDAR-interacting domain on TRPM2, and developed a cell-permeable peptide to uncouple TRPM2-NMDARs. The disrupting-peptide protects neurons against ischemic injury in vitro and protects mice against ischemic stroke in vivo. These findings provide an unconventional strategy to eliminate excitotoxic neuronal death without directly targeting NMDARs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A comparative study between state-of-the-art MRI deidentification and AnonyMI, a new method combining re-identification risk reduction and geometrical preservation</a></h4>

              
                Deidentifying MRIs constitutes an imperative challenge, as it aims at precluding the possibility of re-identification of a research subject or patient, but at the same time it should preserve as much geometrical information as possible, in order to maximize data reusability and to facilitate interoperability. Although several deidentification methods exist, no comprehensive and comparative evaluation of deidentification performance has been carried out across them. Moreover, the possible ways these methods can compromise subsequent analysis has not been exhaustively tested. To tackle these issues, we developed AnonyMI, a novel MRI deidentification method, implemented as a user-friendly 3D Slicer plugin-in, which aims at providing a balance between identity protection and geometrical preservation. To test these features, we performed two series of analyses on which we compared AnonyMI to other two state-of-the-art methods, to evaluate, at the same time, how efficient they are at deidentifying MRIs and how much they affect subsequent analyses, with particular emphasis on source localization procedures. Our results show that all three methods significantly reduce the re-identification risk but AnonyMI provides the best geometrical conservation. Notably, it also offers several technical advantages such as a user-friendly interface, multiple input-output capabilities, the possibility of being tailored to specific needs, batch processing and efficient visualization for quality assurance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coherent mapping of position and head direction across auditory and visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) may not only signal current visual input but also relevant contextual information such as reward expectancy and the subjects spatial position. Such location-specific representations need not be restricted to V1 but could participate in a coherent mapping throughout sensory cortices. Here we show that spiking activity in primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral, secondary visual cortex (V2L) of freely moving rats coherently represents a location-specific mapping in a sensory detection task performed on a figure-8 maze. Single-unit activity of both areas showed extensive similarities in terms of spatial distribution, reliability and position coding. Importantly, reconstructions of subject position on the basis of spiking activity displayed decoding errors that were correlated between areas in magnitude and direction. In addition to position, we found that head direction, but not locomotor speed or head angular velocity, was an important determinant of activity in A1 and V2L. Finally, pairs of units within and across areas showed significant correlations in instantaneous variability of firing rates (noise correlations). These were dependent on the spatial tuning of cells as well as the spatial position of the animal. We conclude that sensory cortices participate in coherent, multimodal representations of the subjects sensory-specific location. These may provide a common reference frame for distributed cortical sensory and motor processes and may support crossmodal predictive processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributed representations for human inference</a></h4>

              
                Neural representations can be characterized as falling along a continuum, from distributed representations, in which neurons are responsive to many related features of the environment, to localist representations, where neurons orthogonalize activity patterns despite any input similarity. Distributed representations support powerful learning in neural network models and have been posited to exist throughout the brain, but it is unclear under what conditions humans acquire these representations and what computational advantages they may confer. In a series of behavioral experiments, we present evidence that interleaved exposure to new information facilitates the rapid formation of distributed representations in humans. As in neural network models with distributed representations, interleaved learning supports fast and automatic recognition of item relatedness, affords efficient generalization, and is especially critical for inference when learning requires statistical integration of noisy information over time. We use the data to adjudicate between several existing computational models of human memory and inference. The results demonstrate the power of interleaved learning and implicate the use of distributed representations in human inference.

                Oscillatory activity is commonly observed during the maintenance of information in short-term memory, but its role remains unclear. Non-oscillatory models of short-term memory storage are able to encode stimulus identity through their spatial patterns of activity, but are typically limited to either an all-or-none representation of stimulus amplitude or exhibit a biologically implausible exact-tuning condition. Here, we demonstrate a simple phase-locking mechanism by which oscillatory input enables a circuit to generate persistent or sequential activity patterns that encode information not only in their location but also in a discrete set of amplitudes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spatiotemporal link of temporal expectations: contextual temporal expectation is independent of spatial attention</a></h4>

              
                Temporal expectation is the ability to construct predictions regarding the timing of events, based on previously-experienced temporal regularities of different types. For example, cue-based expectations are constructed when a cue validly indicates when a target is expected to occur. However, in the absence of such cues, expectations can be constructed based on contextual temporal information, including the event's hazard-rate function - its moment-by-moment conditional probability that changes over time; and prior experiences, which provide probabilistic information regarding the event's predicted timing (sequential effects). It was previously suggested that cue-based temporal expectation is exerted via synchronization of spatially-specific neural activity at a target's predictable time, within receptive fields corresponding to the target's expected location. Here, we tested if the same theoretical model holds for contextual temporal effects. Participants (n = 40) performed a speeded spatial-cueing detection task, with two-thirds valid spatial cues. The target's hazard-rate function was modulated by varying the foreperiod - the interval between the spatial cue and the target - among trials, and was manipulated between groups by changing the interval distribution. Reaction times were analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, accounting for hazard and sequential effects. Results showed that the effects of contextual temporal structures on reaction times were independent of spatial attention. This suggests that the spatiotemporal mechanisms, thought to account for cue-based expectation, cannot explain other sources of temporal expectations. We conclude that expectations based on contextual structures have different characteristics than cue-based temporal expectation, suggesting reliance on distinct neural mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vergence accuracy in an autostereoscopic display</a></h4>

              
                When fixating an object, observers typically under or over-converge by a small amount, a phenomenon known as "fixation disparity". Fixation disparity is typically measured with physical fixation targets and dichotically presented nonius lines. Here we made fixation disparity measurements with an autostereoscopic display, varying the retinal eccentricity and disparity of the fixation targets. Measurements were made in a group of four practiced observers and in a group of thirteen experimentally naive observers. Fixation disparities with a zero-disparity target were in the direction of fixation behind the plane of the screen and the magnitude of the fixation disparity grew with the eccentricity of the fixation targets (1-5 deg in the practiced observers and 1 - 10 deg in the naive observers). Fixation disparity also increased with increasing disparity of the targets, especially when they were presented at crossed disparities. Fixation disparities were larger overall for naive observers who additionally did not converge in front of the screen when vergence demand was created by crossed disparity fusion locks presented at 5 and 10 deg eccentricities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Control of neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity by re-orientation of membrane-bound Munc13-1</a></h4>

              
                Munc13-1 plays a central role in neurotransmitter release through its conserved C-terminal region, which includes a diacyglycerol (DAG)-binding C1 domain, a Ca2+/PIP2-binding C2B domain, a MUN domain and a C2C domain. Munc13-1 was proposed to bridge synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane in two different orientations mediated by distinct interactions of the C1C2B region with the plasma membrane: i) one involving a polybasic face that yields a perpendicular orientation of Munc13-1 and hinders release; and ii) another involving the DAG-Ca2+-PIP2-binding face that induces a slanted orientation and facilitates release. Here we have tested this model and investigated the role of the C1C2B region in neurotransmitter release. We find that K603E or R769E point mutations in the polybasic face severely impair synaptic vesicle priming in primary murine hippocampal cultures, and Ca2+-independent liposome bridging and fusion in in vitro reconstitution assays. A K720E mutation in the polybasic face and a K706E mutation in the C2B domain Ca2+-binding loops have milder effects in reconstitution assays and do not affect vesicle priming, but enhance or impair Ca2+-evoked release, respectively. The phenotypes caused by combining these mutations are dominated by the K603E and R769E mutations. Our results show that the C1-C2B region of Munc13-1 plays a central role in vesicle priming and support the notion that re-orientation of Munc13-1 controls neurotransmitter release and short-term presynaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of M1 muscarinic receptors reduce pathology and slow progression of neurodegenerative disease.</a></h4>

              
                The most prevalent types of dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, are those that are propagated via the spread of 'prion-like' misfolded proteins. Despite considerable effort, no treatments are available to slow or stop the progression of these dementias. Here, we investigate the possibility that activation of the M1-muscarinic receptor (M1-receptor), which is highly expressed in the brain and that shows pro-cognitive properties, might present a novel disease modifying target. We demonstrate that the progression of murine prion disease, which we show here displays many of the pathological, behavioural and biochemical hallmarks of human neurodegenerative disease, is slowed and normal behaviour maintained by the activation of the M1-receptor with a highly tolerated positive allosteric modulator (VU846). This correlates with a reduction in both neuroinflammation and indicators of mitochondrial dysregulation, as well as a normalisation in the expression of markers associated with neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, VU846 preserves expression of synaptic proteins and post-synaptic signalling components that are altered in disease. We conclude that allosteric regulation of M1-receptors has the potential to reduce the severity of neurodegenerative diseases caused by the ''prion-like'' propagation of misfolded protein in a manner that extends life span and maintains normal behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mice with High FGF21 Serum Levels Had a Reduced Preference for Morphine and an Attenuated Development of Acute Antinociceptive Tolerance and Physical Dependence</a></h4>

              
                As a result of the opioid epidemic, there is a desire to identify new targets for treating opioid use disorder. Previous studies showed that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) decreased alcohol and sweet preference in mice. In this study, FGF21-transgenic (FGF21-Tg) mice, expressing high FGF21 serum levels, and wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J littermates were treated with morphine and saline to determine if differences exist in their physiological and behavioral responses to opioids. FGF21-Tg mice displayed reduced preference for morphine in the conditioned place preference assay compared to WT littermates. Similarly, FGF21-Tg mice had an attenuation of the magnitude and rate of acute morphine antinociceptive tolerance development, and acute and chronic morphine physical dependence, but exhibited no change in chronic morphine antinociceptive tolerance. The ED50 values for morphine-induced antinociception in the 55-degree C hot plate and the 55-degree C warm-water tail withdrawal assays were similar in both strains of mice. Likewise, FGF21-Tg and WT littermates had comparable responses to morphine-induced respiratory depression. Overall, FGF21-Tg mice had an attenuated preference for morphine, a reduced development of morphine-induced dependence, and a reduction in the development of acute morphine antinociceptive tolerance. FGF21 and its receptor have therapeutic potential for reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms and craving, and augmenting opioid therapeutics for acute pain treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural-specific alterations in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and cell signaling associated with two human ganglioside GM3 Synthase Deficiency variants</a></h4>

              
                GM3 Synthase Deficiency (GM3SD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from pathogenic variants in the ST3GAL5 gene, which encodes GM3 synthase, a glycosphingolipid (GSL)-specific sialyltransferase. This enzyme adds a single alpha3-linked sialic acid to the terminal galactose of lactosylceramide (LacCer) to produce the monosialylated ganglioside GM3. In turn, GM3 is extended by other glycosyltransferases to generate nearly all the complex gangliosides enriched in neural tissue. Pathogenic mechanisms that account for neural phenotypes associated with GM3SD are not known. To explore how loss of GM3 impacts neural-specific glycolipid glycosylation and cell signaling, GM3SD patient fibroblasts bearing one of two different ST3GAL5 variants were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiated to neural crest cells (NCCs). GM3 and GM3-derived gangliosides were undetectable in iPSCs and NCCs from both variants, while LacCer precursor levels were elevated compared to wildtype (WT). NCCs of both variants synthesized elevated levels of neutral lacto- and globo-series, as well as minor alternatively sialylated, GSLs compared to WT. Shifts in ceramide profiles associated with iPSC and NCC GSLs were also detected in GM3SD variants. Altered GSL profiles in the GM3SD cells were accompanied by dynamic changes in the cell surface proteome, protein O-GlcNAcylation, and receptor tyrosine kinase abundance. GM3SD cells also exhibited increased apoptosis and sensitivity to erlotnib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of O-GlcNAcase increased protein O-GlcNAcylation and significantly rescued baseline and erlotnib-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these findings indicate broad effects on cell signaling during differentiation of GM3SD patient-derived iPSCs to NCCs. Thus, human GM3SD cells provide a novel platform to investigate structure/function relationships that connect GSL diversity to cell signaling, cell survival, and neural differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Training a spiking neuronal network model of visual-motor cortex to play a virtual racket-ball game using reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent models of spiking neuronal networks have been trained to perform behaviors in static environments using a variety of learning rules, with varying degrees of biological realism. Most of these models have not been tested in dynamic visual environments where models must make predictions on future states and adjust their behavior accordingly. The models using these learning rules are often treated as black boxes, with little analysis on circuit architectures and learning mechanisms supporting optimal performance. Here we developed visual/motor spiking neuronal network models and trained them to play a virtual racket-ball game using several reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by the dopaminergic reward system. We systematically investigated how different architectures and circuit-motifs (feed-forward, recurrent, feedback) contributed to learning and performance. We also developed a new biologically-inspired learning rule that significantly enhanced performance, while reducing training time. Our models included visual areas encoding game inputs and relaying the information to motor areas, which used this information to learn to move the racket to hit the ball. Neurons in the early visual area relayed information encoding object location and motion direction across the network. Neuronal association areas encoded spatial relationships between objects in the visual scene. Motor populations received inputs from visual and association areas representing the dorsal pathway. Two populations of motor neurons generated commands to move the racket up or down. Model-generated actions updated the environment and triggered reward or punishment signals that adjusted synaptic weights so that the models could learn which actions led to reward. Here we demonstrate that our biologically-plausible learning rules were effective in training spiking neuronal network models to solve problems in dynamic environments. We used our models to dissect the circuit architectures and learning rules most effective for learning. Our models offer novel predictions on the biological mechanisms supporting learning behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale dendritic spine extraction and analysis through petascale computing</a></h4>

              
                The synapse is a central player in the nervous system serving as the key structure that permits the relay of electrical and chemical signals from one neuron to another. The anatomy of the synapse contains important information about the signals and the strength of signal it transmits. Because of their small size, however, electron microscopy (EM) is the only method capable of directly visualizing synapse morphology and remains the gold standard for studying synapse morphology. Historically, EM has been limited to small fields of view and often only in 2D, but recent advances in automated serial EM (i.e. connectomics) have enabled collecting large EM volumes that capture significant fractions of neurons and the different classes of synapses they receive (i.e. shaft, spine, soma, axon). However, even with recent advances in automatic segmentation methods, extracting neuronal and synaptic profiles from these connectomics datasets are difficult to scale over large EM volumes. Without methods that speed up automatic segmentation over large volumes, the full potential of utilizing these new EM methods to advance studies related to synapse morphologies will never be fully realized. To solve this problem, we describe our work to leverage Argonne leadership-scale supercomputers for segmentation of a 0.6 terabyte dataset using state of the art machine learning-based segmentation methods on a significant fraction of the 11.69 petaFLOPs supercomputer Theta at Argonne National Laboratory. We describe an iterative pipeline that couples human and machine feedback to produce accurate segmentation results in time frames that will make connectomics a more routine method for exploring how synapse biology changes across a number of biological conditions. Finally, we demonstrate how dendritic spines can be algorithmically extracted from the segmentation dataset for analysis of spine morphologies. Advancing this effort at large compute scale is expected to yield benefits in turnaround time for segmentation of individual datasets, accelerating the path to biology results and providing population-level insight into how thousands of synapses originate from different neurons; we expect to also reap benefits in terms of greater accuracy from the more compute-intensive algorithms these systems enable.

                Devastating and persisting traumatic memories are a central symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Sleep problems are highly co-occurrent with PTSD and intertwined with its etiology. Notably, sleep hosts memory consolidation processes, supported by sleep spindles (11-16 Hz). Here we assess the hypothesis that intrusive memory symptoms in PTSD may arise from excessive memory consolidation, reflected in exaggerated spindling. We use a newly developed spindle detection method, entailing minimal assumptions regarding spindle phenotype, to assess spindle activity in PTSD patients and traumatized controls (n=2x14, matched on gender). Our results show increased spindle activity in PTSD, which positively correlates with daytime intrusive memory symptoms. Together, these findings provide a putative mechanism through which profound sleep disturbance in PTSD may contribute to memory problems. Due to its uniform and unbiased approach, the new, minimal assumption spindle detection method seems a promising tool to detect aberrant spindling in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A machine-learning approach for detection of local brain networks and marginally weak signals identifies novel AD/MCI differentiating connectomic neuroimaging biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: A computationally fast machine learning method is introduced for uncovering the whole-brain voxel-level connectomic spectra that differentiates different status of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The method is applied to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) imaging and clinical data and identified novel AD/MCI differentiating connectomic neuroimaging biomarkers. Methods: A divide-and-conquer algorithm is introduced for detect informative local brain networks at voxel level and whole-brain scale. The connection information within the local networks is integrated into the node voxels, which makes detection of the marginally weak signals possible. Prediction accuracy is significantly improved by incorporating the local brain networks and marginally weak signals. Results: Brain connectomic structures differentiating AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD and healthy, and MIC and healthy were discovered. We identified novel AD/MCI-associated neuroimaging biomarkers by integrating local brain networks and marginally weak signals. For example, network-based signals in paracentral lobule (p-value=6.1e-5), olfactory cortex (p-value=4.6e-5), caudate nucleus (1.8e-3) and precentral gyrus (1.8e-3) are informative in differentiating AD and MCI. Connections between calcarine sulcus and lingual gyrus (p-value=0.049), between parahippocampal gyrus and Amygdala (p-value=0.025), between rolandic opercula and insula lobes (p-values=0.0028 and 0.0026). An overall prediction accuracy of 95.3% was achieved by integrating the selected local brain networks and marginally weak signals, compared to 84.0% by not considering the inter-voxel connections and using marginally strong signals only. Conclusion: (i) The connectomic structures differentiating AD and MCI are significantly different to that differentiating MCI and healthy, which may indicate different neuronal etiology for AD and MCI. (ii) Many neuroimaging biomarkers exert their effects on the outcome diseases through their connections to other markers. Integrating such connections can help identify novel neuroimaging biomarkers and improve disease prediction accuracy.

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=221&query=">Morc1 as a potential new target gene in mood regulation: when and where to find in the brain</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Recent animal and human studies connected the <em class="a-plus-plus">Morc family CW-type zinc finger 1</em> (<em class="a-plus-plus">Morc1</em>) gene with early life stress and depression. Moreover, the <em class="a-plus-plus">Morc</em> superfamily is related to epigenetic regulation in diverse nuclear processes. So far, the <em class="a-plus-plus">Morc1</em> gene was mainly studied in spermatogenesis, whereas its distribution and function in the brain are still unknown. In a first attempt to characterize <em class="a-plus-plus">Morc1</em> in the brain, we performed a Western Blot analysis as well as a real-time PCR analysis during different stages of development. Additionally, we detected <em class="a-plus-plus">Morc1</em> mRNA using real-time PCR in different mood-regulating brain areas in adult rats. We found that MORC1 protein as well as Morc1 mRNA is already expressed in the brain at embryonic day 14 and is stably expressed until adulthood. Furthermore, <em class="a-plus-plus">Morc1</em> mRNA is present in many important brain areas of mood regulation like the medial prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, and the amygdala. The ample distribution in the brain and its molecular structure as a zinc finger protein indicate that <em class="a-plus-plus">Morc1</em> might act as a transcription factor. This function and its expression in mood-regulating areas already in the early brain development turn <em class="a-plus-plus">Morc1</em> into a possible candidate gene for mediating early life stress and depression.</p>

	<p>Microglia influence pathological progression in neurological diseases, reacting to insults by expressing multiple morphofunctional phenotypes. However, the complete morphological spectrum of reactive microglia, as revealed by three-dimensional microscopic reconstruction, has not been detailed in virus limbic encephalitis. Here, using an anatomical series of brain sections, we expanded on an earlier Piry arbovirus encephalitis study to include CA1/CA2 and assessed the morphological response of homeostatic and reactive microglia at eight days post-infection. Hierarchical cluster and linear discriminant function analyses of multimodal morphometric features distinguished microglial morphology between infected animals and controls. For a broad representation of the spectrum of microglial morphology in each defined cluster, we chose representative cells of homeostatic and reactive microglia, using the sum of the distances of each cell in relation to all the others. Based on multivariate analysis, reactive microglia of infected animals showed more complex trees and thicker branches, covering a larger volume of tissue than in control animals. This approach offers a reliable representation of microglia dispersion in the Euclidean space, revealing the morphological kaleidoscope of surveillant and reactive microglia morphotypes. Because form precedes function in nature, our findings offer a starting point for research using integrative methods to understand microglia form and function.</p>

	<p>Aggression and violent offenses are common amongst forensic psychiatric patients. Notably, research distinguishes two motivationally distinct dimension of aggression–instrumental and reactive aggression. Instrumental aggression comprises of appetitive, goal-directed aggressive acts, whereas reactive aggression consists of affective, defensive violence with both their biological basis remaining largely unknown. Childhood trauma and functional genetic polymorphisms in catecholamines converting enzymes, such as mono-amino-oxidase A (MAO-A) and catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) have been suggested to augment an aggressive behavioral response in adulthood. However, it warrants clarification if these factors influence one or both types of aggression. Furthermore, it remains elusive, if having a combination of unfavorable enzyme genotypes and childhood maltreatment further increases violent behavior. Hence, we set out to address these questions in the current study. First, analysis revealed an overall marginally increased frequency of the unfavorable MAO-A genotype in the test population. Second, each gene polymorphisms together with a traumatic childhood significantly increased the AFAS (Appetitive and Facilitative Aggression Scale) scores for both reactive and appetitive aggression. Third, having a combination of both disadvantageous genotypes and a negative childhood served as a minor positive predictor for increased reactive aggression, but had a strong influence on the joy of being aggressive.</p>

	<p>Olfactory decline is an early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is a predictor of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Olfactory decline could reflect AD-related atrophy of structures related to the sense of smell. The aim of this study was to verify whether the presence of a clinical diagnosis of AD or MCI is associated with a volumetric decrease in the olfactory bulbs (OB) and the primary olfactory cortex (POC). We conducted two systematic reviews, one for each region and a meta-analysis. We collected articles from PsychNet, PubMed, Ebsco, and ProQuest databases. Results showed large and heterogeneous effects indicating smaller OB volumes in patients with AD (k = 6, g = −1.21, 95% CI [−2.19, −0.44]) and in patients with MCI compared to controls. There is also a trend for smaller POC in patients with AD or MCI compared to controls. Neuroanatomical structures involved in olfactory processing are smaller in AD and these volumetric reductions could be measured as early as the MCI stage.</p>

	<p>Background. Interpersonal distance (IPD) plays a critical role in a human being’s social life, especially during interpersonal interaction, and IPD is non-verbal social information and not only provides silent cues but also provides a secure space for personal relationships. IPD has been a research field of neural studies from the recent decade, researches had provided behavior and neural correlates of IPD. Objectives. This review aims to summarize the experimental paradigms of IPD-neural research, to reveal the neural activity processes associated with it, and to explore the correlation between IPD-neural activity and IPD-behavior. Methods. We conducted a standardized systematic review procedure, including the formal search method be adopted to seek out any type of studies related to IPD and brain, then devised them into categories to make a systematic review. Results. 17 articles met the inclusion criteria of the review, 5 event-related potential (ERP) studies measured the amplitude and latencies of ERPs, and 12 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies provided the neural activation during IPD tasks. In addition, the passive IPD experimental paradigm is the main experimental paradigm for exploring neural activity in IPD cognition, with the parietal lobe, motor areas, prefrontal lobe, and amygdala being the main brain areas involved. Functional connections between the identified brain regions were found and have a moderate correlation with IPD behavior. Conclusions. This review provides the neural activity of the IPD interaction process. However, the insufficient ecological validity of IPD tasks and ignore the initiative of people in IPD interaction. Therefore, there is a large research space on this topic. The work of the current systematic review contributed to linking the external performance and inner neural activities of IPD.</p>

	<p>Seizures in about 40% of patients with epilepsy fail to respond to anti-seizure medication (ASM) and may lead to uncontrolled and prolonged seizures often inducing status epilepticus (SE). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a long-term treatment with two different generation ASMs: ethosuximide (ETS, a classic ASM) and lacosamide (LCM, a 3rd generation ASM) on neural stem cells’ (NSCs’) proliferation and learning and memory functions after pilocarpine (PILO)-induced SE in mice. The following drugs were used: LCM (10 mg/kg), ETS (20 mg/kg), and PILO (300 mg/kg). Cell counting was done using confocal microscope and ImageJ software. Cognitive functions were evaluated with the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The level of several selected neurometabolites was measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Obtained results indicated no significant impact of ETS treatment on the neurogenesis process in PILO mice. Interestingly, LCM significantly decreased the total amount of newborn neurons. The MWM test indicated no significant changes in the time and distance traveled by the ETS and LCM groups compared to PILO control mice, although all measured parameters were more favorable for the PILO mice treated with ASM. Conclusions: The presented results show that long term treatment with LCM and ETS seems to be safe for the cognitive functions and the proper course of neurogenesis in the mouse PILO-induced SE model, although one should remember that LCM administered chronically may act to reduce new neurons’ formation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This study compared anterior attentional–intentional system performance between three groups: Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and a comparison group (CG). It also evaluated the feasibility of the recruitment and study procedures; (2) Methods: From 45 participants recruited, 39 were allocated (mean age 65.31; 43.59% men) to PD-NC, PD-MCI and CG (13 per group). To assess attention, we used three tasks from the ROtman–Baycrest Battery for Investigating Attention: Simple Reaction time (RT), Choice RT, and Prepare RT. We conducted a mixed-model analysis of variance with a 3 (groups) × 4 (tasks) design to compare reaction times; (3) Results: PD-MCI had slower reaction times than PD-NC (p = 0.028) and the CG (p = 0.052); there was no difference between PD-NC and CG. PD-MCI might perform worse on monitoring tasks than PD-NC, Z = −1.68, p = 0.092. Nearly half the volunteers from the CG and 87% of all eligible patients were enrolled in the study and completed all neuropsychological procedures; (4) Conclusions: General cognitive decline appears related to partial deficits in energization and tends to impair attentional monitoring. Furthermore, PD-NC exhibited similar reaction times to the CG. Results from the feasibility study contributed to the definitive study.</p>

	<p>Levels of independence vary in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). We began this study to describe the current life skills in our clinic population of children and adults with DS. We collected and reviewed demographics, living situation, and life skills from an electronic intake form used in clinic procedures. Descriptive statistics for this cohort study included mean, standard deviation, and frequencies. From 2014–2020, 350 pediatric and 196 adult patients (range 0–62 years) with a first visit to the Massachusetts General Hospital Down Syndrome Program are described. Pediatric patients were most often enrolled in school, and in an inclusion setting. Adult patients were most often participating in a day program, living with family, and wanted to continue living with family in the future. Most (87%) of adults with DS communicated verbally, though fewer could use written communication (17%). Life skills of greatest importance to adolescents and adults with DS included: learning about healthy foods (35%), preparing meals (34%), providing personal information when needed (35%), and describing symptoms to a doctor (35%). Life skills for patients with DS are varied; those associated with a medical appointment, such as sharing symptoms with the doctor, could improve for greater independence.</p>

	<p>Counting ability is one of the many aspects of animal cognition and has enjoyed great interest over the last couple of decades. The impetus for studying counting ability in nonhuman animals has likely come from more than a general interest in animal cognition, as the analysis of animal abilities amplifies our understanding of human cognition. In addition, a model animal with the ability to count could be used to replace human subjects in related studies. Here we designed a behavioral paradigm to train rhesus monkeys to count 1-to-6 visual patterns presented sequentially with long and irregular interpattern intervals on a touch screen. The monkeys were required to make a response to the sixth pattern exclusively, inhibiting response to any patterns appearing at other ordinal positions. All stimulus patterns were of the same size, color, location, and shape to prevent monkeys making the right choice due to non-number physical cues. In the long delay period, the monkey had to enumerate how many patterns had been presented sequentially and had to remember in which ordinal position the current pattern was located. Otherwise, it was impossible for them to know which pattern was the target one. The results show that all three monkeys learned to correctly choose the sixth pattern within 3 months. This study provides convincing behavioral evidence that rhesus monkeys may have the capacity to count.</p>

	<p>Surgical treatment of spondylodiscitis allows for rapid mobilization and shortens hospital stays, which makes surgical treatment the first-line therapy. We aim to describe our experiences with operative treatment on spondylodiscitis and to determine the parameters that are important in the prediction of outcomes. A retrospective review identified 237 patients who were operatively treated for spondylodiscitis in our institution between January 2010 and December 2018. Clinical data were collected through review of electronic records and relevant imaging. In all cases, contrast-enhancing MRI from the infected region of the spine was obtained. Leukocyte count and C-reactive protein concentrations (CRP) were determined in all the patients. We included 237 patients in the study, 87 female (36.7%) and 150 male (63.3%), with a mean age of 71.4 years. Mean follow-up was 31.6 months. Forty-five patients had spondylodiscitis of the cervical, 73 of the thoracic, and 119 of the lumbosacral spine. All the patients with spondylodiscitis of the cervical spine received instrumentation. In thoracic and lumbar spine decompression, surgery without instrumentation was performed in 26 patients as immediate surgery and in a further 28 patients in the early stages following admission, while 138 patients received instrumentation. Eighty-nine patients (37.6%) had concomitant infections. Infection healing occurred in 89% of patients. Favorable outcomes were noted in patients without concomitant infections, with a normalized CRP value and in patients who received antibiotic therapy for more than six weeks (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Unfavorable outcomes were noted in patients with high CRP, postoperative spondylodiscitis, and recurrent spondylodiscitis (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Application of antibiotic therapy for more than six weeks and normalized CRP showed a correlation with favorable outcomes, whereas concomitant infections showed a correlation with unfavorable outcomes. A detailed screening for concomitant infectious diseases is recommended.</p>

	<p>Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases and a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Cognitive frailty is an important predictor of all-cause mortality and dementia in aging individuals. Hypertension is closely related to cognitive frailty and these two conditions often coexist in aging individuals. Few studies have explored the relationship between hypertension and cognitive frailty in the Chinese population. This study investigates the epidemiological characteristics of and factors related to cognitive frailty in aging Chinese patients with hypertension. In total, cognitive function, weakness, social support, depression and sociodemographic were assessed in 305 participants aged 60 and over. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed. The prevalence of cognitive frailty in aging Chinese hypertensive patients was 9.8% (95% CI = 6.4–13.2%). After adjusting for confounding variables, logistic regression showed that the course of hypertension (6–10 years, OR = 8.588, 95% CI = 1.608–45.859;course of more than 10 years, OR = 9.020, 95%CI = 1.854–43.892), multimorbidity (OR = 11.231, 95% CI = 2.912–43.322), depression (OR = 6.917, 95% CI = 2.424–19.738) and social support (OR = 0.187, 95% CI = 0.071–0.492) were independently associated with cognitive frailty. The prevalence of cognitive frailty in aging patients with hypertension in China should not be ignored. The course of hypertension, multimorbidity and depression are the risk factors of cognitive frailty in the aging population and a better level of social support is the protective factor for cognitive frailty.</p>

	<p>In a conversation, recognising the speaker’s social action (e.g., a request) early may help the potential following speakers understand the intended message quickly, and plan a timely response. Human language is multimodal, and several studies have demonstrated the contribution of the body to communication. However, comparatively few studies have investigated (non-emotional) conversational facial signals and very little is known about how they contribute to the communication of social actions. Therefore, we investigated how facial signals map onto the expressions of two fundamental social actions in conversations: asking questions and providing responses. We studied the distribution and timing of 12 facial signals across 6778 questions and 4553 responses, annotated holistically in a corpus of 34 dyadic face-to-face Dutch conversations. Moreover, we analysed facial signal clustering to find out whether there are specific combinations of facial signals within questions or responses. Results showed a high proportion of facial signals, with a qualitatively different distribution in questions versus responses. Additionally, clusters of facial signals were identified. Most facial signals occurred early in the utterance, and had earlier onsets in questions. Thus, facial signals may critically contribute to the communication of social actions in conversation by providing social action-specific visual information.</p>

	<p>Parental influences are important for a child’s behavior, overall adjustment, as well as cognitive/language development. New research is exploring how relationships with parents can influence a child’s neurobiological functioning and development. In this systematic review, our first aim is to describe how the caregiving environment influences these aspects of child development. The second and main aim is to review and recommend that the concept (and measurement) of “emotional availability” may provide a new window in this continued exploration. Emotional availability (EA) refers to the capacity of a dyad to share an emotionally healthy relationship. The EA Scales assess this construct using a multi-dimensional framework, with a method to measure the affect and behavior of both the child and adult partner (caregiver). In this review, we first provide an overview of child development research, with regards to stress physiology, neuroendocrine system, genetics and epigenetics, and brain mechanisms. We then summarize the results of specific EA research in these areas, and propose a theoretical model integrating these constructs. Finally, we offer areas for future research in this area.</p>

                The heart pumps blood against the mechanical afterload from arterial resistance, and increased afterload may alter cardiac electrophysiology and contribute to life-threatening arrhythmias. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying mechanoelectric coupling in cardiomyocytes remain unclear. We developed an innovative patch-clamp-in-gel technology to embed cardiomyocytes in a three-dimensional (3D) viscoelastic...

                Despite the remarkable variability music displays across cultures, certain recurrent musical features motivate the hypothesis that fundamental cognitive principles constrain the way music is produced. One such feature concerns the structure of musical scales. The vast majority of musical cultures use scales that are not uniformly symmetric—that is, scales that...

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Preventing type 1 diabetes in childhood</a></h4>

              
                <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing &beta; cells of the pancreas are destroyed by T lymphocytes. Recent studies have demonstrated that monitoring for pancreatic islet autoantibodies, combined with genetic risk assessment, can identify most children who will develop T1D when they still have sufficient &beta; cell function to control glucose concentrations without the need for insulin. In addition, there has been recent success in secondary prevention using immunotherapy to delay the progression of preclinical disease, and primary prevention approaches to inhibiting the initiating autoimmune process have entered large-scale clinical trials. By changing the focus of T1D management from late diagnosis and insulin replacement to early diagnosis and &beta; cell preservation, we can anticipate a future without the need for daily insulin injections for children with T1D.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Immunotherapy: Building a bridge to a cure for type 1 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy the insulin-producing &beta; cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetic and environmental factors increase T1D risk by compromising immune homeostasis. Although the discovery and use of insulin have transformed T1D treatment, insulin therapy does not change the underlying disease or fully prevent complications. Over the past two decades, research has identified multiple immune cell types and soluble factors that destroy insulin-producing &beta; cells. These insights into disease pathogenesis have enabled the development of therapies to prevent and modify T1D. In this review, we highlight the key events that initiate and sustain pancreatic islet inflammation in T1D, the current state of the immunological therapies, and their advantages for the treatment of T1D.</p>
