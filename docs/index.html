              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15730">Visual Perception, Quantity of Information Function and the Concept of the Quantity of Information Continuous Splines</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric shapes of the outside world objects hide an undisclosed emotional, psychological, artistic, aesthetic and shape-generating potential; they may attract or cause fear as well as a variety of other emotions. This suggests that living beings with vision perceive geometric objects within an information-handling process. However, not many studies have been performed for a better understanding of visual perception from the view of information theory and mathematical modelling, but the evidence first found by Attneave (1954) suggests that the concepts and techniques of information theory may shed light on a better and deeper understanding of visual perception. The quantity of information function can theoretically explain the concentration of information on the visual contours, and, based on this, we first propose the concept of the quantity of information continuous splines for visualization of shapes from a given set of discrete data without adding any in-between points with curvature extreme. Additionally, we first discover planar curve with a constant quantity of information function and demonstrate one of the conditions when a monotonic curvature curve has a constant quantity of information function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15786">MindLLM: A Subject-Agnostic and Versatile Model for fMRI-to-Text Decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals into text has been a key challenge in the neuroscience community, with the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces and uncover deeper insights into brain mechanisms. However, existing approaches often struggle with suboptimal predictive performance, limited task variety, and poor generalization across subjects. In response to this, we propose MindLLM, a model designed for subject-agnostic and versatile fMRI-to-text decoding. MindLLM consists of an fMRI encoder and an off-the-shelf LLM. The fMRI encoder employs a neuroscience-informed attention mechanism, which is capable of accommodating subjects with varying input shapes and thus achieves high-performance subject-agnostic decoding. Moreover, we introduce Brain Instruction Tuning (BIT), a novel approach that enhances the model's ability to capture diverse semantic representations from fMRI signals, facilitating more versatile decoding. We evaluate MindLLM on comprehensive fMRI-to-text benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines, improving downstream tasks by 12.0%, unseen subject generalization by 16.4%, and novel task adaptation by 25.0%. Furthermore, the attention patterns in MindLLM provide interpretable insights into its decision-making process.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16088">Electrophysiological Investigation of Insect Pain Threshold</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether insects experience pain has long been debated in neuroscience and animal behavior research. Increasing evidence suggests that insects possess the ability to detect and respond to noxious stimuli, exhibiting behaviors indicative of pain perception. This study investigates the relationship between pain stimuli and physiological responses in crickets (Gryllidae), focusing on heart rate (ECG) and brain wave (EEG) patterns. We applied a range of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to crickets, recording ECG and EEG data while employing a deep learning-based model to classify pain levels. Our findings revealed significant heart rate changes and EEG fluctuations in response to various stimuli, with the highest intensity stimuli inducing marked physiological stress. The AI-based analysis, utilizing AlexNet for EEG signal classification, achieved 90% accuracy in distinguishing between resting, low-pain, and high-pain states. While no social sharing of pain was observed through ECG measurements, these results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting insect nociception and offer new insights into their physiological responses to external stressors. This research advances the understanding of insect pain mechanisms and demonstrates the potential for AI-driven analysis in entomological studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16456">Category-Selective Neurons in Deep Networks: Comparing Purely Visual and Visual-Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category-selective regions in the human brain, such as the fusiform face area (FFA), extrastriate body area (EBA), parahippocampal place area (PPA), and visual word form area (VWFA), play a crucial role in high-level visual processing. Here, we investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit similar category-selective neurons and how these neurons vary across model layers and between purely visual and vision-language models. Inspired by fMRI functional localizer experiments, we presented images from different categories (faces, bodies, scenes, words, scrambled scenes, and scrambled words) to deep networks and identified category-selective neurons using statistical criteria. Comparing ResNet and the structurally controlled ResNet-based CLIP model, we found that both models contain category-selective neurons, with their proportion increasing across layers, mirroring category selectivity in higher-level visual brain regions. However, CLIP exhibited a higher proportion but lower specificity of category-selective neurons compared to ResNet. Additionally, CLIP's category-selective neurons were more evenly distributed across feature maps and demonstrated greater representational consistency across layers. These findings suggest that language learning increases the number of category-selective neurons while reducing their selectivity strength, reshaping visual representations in deep networks. Our study provides insights into how ANNs mirror biological vision and how multimodal learning influences category-selective representations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16525">Lattice-Based Pruning in Recurrent Neural Networks via Poset Modeling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are central to sequence modeling tasks, yet their high computational complexity poses challenges for scalability and real-time deployment. Traditional pruning techniques, predominantly based on weight magnitudes, often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of these networks. We introduce a novel framework that models RNNs as partially ordered sets (posets) and constructs corresponding dependency lattices. By identifying meet irreducible neurons, our lattice-based pruning algorithm selectively retains critical connections while eliminating redundant ones. The method is implemented using both binary and continuous-valued adjacency matrices to capture different aspects of network connectivity. Evaluated on the MNIST dataset, our approach exhibits a clear trade-off between sparsity and classification accuracy. Moderate pruning maintains accuracy above 98%, while aggressive pruning achieves higher sparsity with only a modest performance decline. Unlike conventional magnitude-based pruning, our method leverages the structural organization of RNNs, resulting in more effective preservation of functional connectivity and improved efficiency in multilayer networks with top-down feedback. The proposed lattice-based pruning framework offers a rigorous and scalable approach for reducing RNN complexity while sustaining robust performance, paving the way for more efficient hierarchical models in both machine learning and computational neuroscience.

                arXiv:2502.16557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous brain activity generically displays transient spatiotemporal coherent structures, which can selectively be affected in various neurological and psychiatric pathologies. Here we model the full brain's electroencephalographic activity as a high-dimensional functional network performing a trajectory in a latent graph phase space. This approach allows us to investigate the orbital stability of brain's activity and in particular its short-term predictability. We do this by constructing a non-parametric statistic quantifying the expansion of initially close functional network trajectories. We apply the method to cohorts of healthy ageing individuals, and patients previously diagnosed with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. Results not only characterise brain dynamics from a new angle, but further show that functional network predictability varies in a marked scale-dependent way across healthy controls and patient groups. The path towards both pathologies is markedly different. Furthermore, healthy ageing's predictability appears to strongly differ from that of Parkinson's disease, but much less from that of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

                arXiv:2502.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding cooperation in social systems is challenging because the ever-changing rules that govern societies interact with individual actions, resulting in intricate collective outcomes. In virtual-world experiments, we allowed people to make changes in the systems that they are making decisions within and investigated how they weigh the influence of different rules in decision-making. When choosing between worlds differing in more than one rule, a naive heuristics model predicted participants decisions as well, and in some cases better, than game earnings (utility) or by the subjective quality of single rules. In contrast, when a subset of engaged participants made instantaneous (within-world) decisions, their behavior aligned very closely with objective utility and not with the heuristics model. Findings suggest that, whereas choices between rules may deviate from rational benchmarks, the frequency of real time cooperation decisions to provide feedback can be a reliable indicator of the objective utility of these rules.

                arXiv:2502.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When is it beneficial to constrain creativity? Creativity thrives with freedom, but when people collaborate to create artifacts, there is tension between giving individuals freedom to revise, and protecting prior achievements. To test how imposing constraints may affect collective creativity, we performed cultural evolution experiments where participants collaborated to create melodies and images in chains. With melodies, we found that limiting step size (number of musical notes that can be changed) improved pleasantness ratings for created tunes. Similar results were observed in cohorts of musicians, and with different selection regimes. In contrast, limiting step size in creating images consistently reduced pleasantness. These conflicting findings suggest that in domains such as music, where artifacts can be easily damaged, and where evolutionary outcomes are hard to foresee, collective creativity may benefit from imposing small step sizes. We discuss parallels with search algorithms and the evolution of conservative birdsong cultures.

                arXiv:2502.17213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurological disorders represent significant global health challenges, driving the advancement of brain signal analysis methods. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) are widely used to diagnose and monitor neurological conditions. However, dataset heterogeneity and task variations pose challenges in developing robust deep learning solutions. This review systematically examines recent advances in deep learning approaches for EEG/iEEG-based neurological diagnostics, focusing on applications across 7 neurological conditions using 46 datasets. We explore trends in data utilization, model design, and task-specific adaptations, highlighting the importance of pre-trained multi-task models for scalable, generalizable solutions.

                arXiv:2502.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI-based delineation of brain tissue removed by epilepsy surgery can be challenging due to post-operative brain shift. In consequence, most studies use manual approaches which are prohibitively time-consuming for large sample sizes, require expertise, and can be prone to errors.
  We propose RAMPS (Resections And Masks in Preoperative Space), an automated pipeline to generate a 3D resection mask of pre-operative tissue. Our pipeline leverages existing software including FreeSurfer, SynthStrip, Sythnseg and ANTS to generate a mask in the same space as the patient's pre-operative T1 weighted MRI. We compare our automated masks against manually drawn masks and two other existing pipelines (Epic-CHOP and ResectVol).
  Comparing to manual masks (N=87), RAMPS achieved a median(IQR) dice similarity of 0.86(0.078) in temporal lobe resections, and 0.72(0.32) in extratemporal resections. In comparison to other pipelines, RAMPS had higher dice similarities (N=62) (RAMPS:0.86, Epic-CHOP: 0.72, ResectVol: 0.72).
  We release a user-friendly, easy to use pipeline, RAMPS, open source for accurate delineation of resected tissue.

                arXiv:2502.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans and other animals readily generalize abstract relations, such as recognizing constant in shape or color, whereas neural networks struggle. To investigate how neural networks generalize abstract relations, we introduce SimplifiedRPM, a novel benchmark for systematic evaluation. In parallel, we conduct human experiments to benchmark relational difficulty, enabling direct model-human comparisons. Testing four architectures--ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Wild Relation Network, and Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL)--we find that SCL best aligns with human behavior and generalizes best. Building on a geometric theory of neural representations, we show representational geometries that predict generalization. Layer-wise analysis reveals distinct relational reasoning strategies across models and suggests a trade-off where unseen rule representations compress into training-shaped subspaces. Guided by our geometric perspective, we propose and evaluate SNRloss, a novel objective balancing representation geometry. Our findings offer geometric insights into how neural networks generalize abstract relations, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI.

                arXiv:2502.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-term memory is essential for cognitive processing, yet our understanding of its neural mechanisms remains unclear. A key focus in neuroscience has been the study of sequential activity patterns, where neurons fire one after another within large networks, to explain how information is maintained. While recurrent connections were shown to drive sequential dynamics, a mechanistic understanding of this process still remains unknown. In this work, we first introduce two unique mechanisms that can subserve short-term memory: slow-point manifolds generating direct sequences or limit cycles providing temporally localized approximations. Then, through analytical models, we identify fundamental properties that govern the selection of these mechanisms, \textit{i.e.}, we derive theoretical scaling laws for critical learning rates as a function of the delay period length, beyond which no learning is possible. We empirically verify these observations by training and evaluating more than 35,000 recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that we will publicly release upon publication. Overall, our work provides new insights into short-term memory mechanisms and proposes experimentally testable predictions for systems neuroscience.

                arXiv:2404.01250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual neural decoding from EEG has improved significantly due to diffusion models that can reconstruct high-quality images from decoded latents. While recent works have focused on relatively complex architectures to achieve good reconstruction performance from EEG, less attention has been paid to the source of this information. In this work, we attempt to discover EEG features that represent perceptual and semantic visual categories, using a simple pipeline. Notably, the high temporal resolution of EEG allows us to go beyond static semantic maps as obtained from fMRI. We show (a) Training a simple linear decoder from EEG to CLIP latent space, followed by a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, is sufficient to decode images with state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. (b) Mapping the decoded latents back to EEG using a linear encoder isolates CLIP-relevant EEG spatiotemporal features. (c) By using other latent spaces representing lower-level image features, we obtain similar time-courses of texture/hue-related information. We thus use our framework, Perceptogram, to probe EEG signals at various levels of the visual information hierarchy.

                arXiv:2409.09862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we developed new mathematical methods for analyzing network topology and applied these methods to the analysis of brain networks. More specifically, we rigorously developed quantitative methods based on complexes constructed from digraphs (digraph-based complexes), such as path complexes and directed clique complexes (alternatively, we refer to these complexes as "higher-order structures," or "higher-order topologies," or "simplicial structures"), and, in the case of directed clique complexes, also methods based on the interrelations between the directed cliques, what we called "directed higher-order connectivities." This new quantitative theory for digraph-based complexes can be seen as a step towards the formalization of a "quantitative simplicial theory." Subsequently, we used these new methods, such as characterization measures and similarity measures for digraph-based complexes, to analyze the topology of digraphs derived from brain connectivity estimators, specifically the estimator known as information partial directed coherence (iPDC), which is a multivariate estimator that can be considered a representation of Granger causality in the frequency-domain, particularly estimated from electroencephalography (EEG) data from patients diagnosed with left temporal lobe epilepsy, in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands, to try to find new biomarkers based on the higher-order structures and connectivities of these digraphs. In particular, we attempted to answer the following questions: How does the higher-order topology of the brain network change from the pre-ictal to the ictal phase, from the ictal to the post-ictal phase, at each frequency band and in each cerebral hemisphere? Does the analysis of higher-order structures provide new and better biomarkers for seizure dynamics and also for the laterality of the seizure focus than the usual graph theoretical analyses?

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05493">Multi-Site rs-fMRI Domain Alignment for Autism Spectrum Disorder Auxiliary Diagnosis Based on Hyperbolic Space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the medical field, most resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data are collected from multiple hospital sites. Multi-site rs-fMRI data can increase the volume of training data, enabling auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for brain diseases to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation algorithms, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract brain network representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, HMMD (Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to align the conditional distributions. This significantly improves the quality of brain representations and enhances diagnostic classification accuracy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust to multi-site heterogeneity and shows promising potential for brain network mechanism analysis.

                arXiv:2309.08916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between brain structure and function is critical for revealing the pathogenesis of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, mapping brain structure to function connections is a very challenging task. In this work, a bidirectional graph generative adversarial network (BG-GAN) is proposed to represent brain structure-function connections. Specifically, by designing a module incorporating inner graph convolution network (InnerGCN), the generators of BG-GAN can employ features of direct and indirect brain regions to learn the mapping function between the structural domain and the functional domain. Besides, a new module named Balancer is designed to counterpoise the optimization between generators and discriminators. By introducing the Balancer into BG-GAN, both the structural generator and functional generator can not only alleviate the issue of mode collapse but also learn complementarity of structural and functional features. Experimental results using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that both generated structure and function connections can improve the identification accuracy of AD. The experimental findings suggest that the relationship between brain structure and function is not a complete one-to-one correspondence. They also suggest that brain structure is the basis of brain function, and the strong structural connections are majorly accompanied by strong functional connections.

                arXiv:2407.03089v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.

                arXiv:2412.07236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.

                arXiv:2502.16238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.

Decomposition-based MOEAs, with uniformly distributed weights (in a simplex), perform well on problems with a regular (simplex-like) Pareto front, but not on those with an irregular Pareto front. Previous studies have focused on adapting the weights to approximate the irregular Pareto front during the evolutionary process. However, these adaptations can actually harm the performance on the regular Pareto front via changing the weights during the search process that are eventually the best fit for the Pareto front. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called the weight adaptation trigger mechanism for decomposition-based MOEAs (ATM-MOEA/D) to tackle this issue. ATM-MOEA/D uses an archive to gradually approximate the shape of the Pareto front during the search. When the algorithm detects evolution stagnation (meaning the population no longer improves significantly), it compares the distribution of the population with that of the archive to distinguish between regular and irregular Pareto fronts. Only when an irregular Pareto front is identified, the weights are adapted. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only performs generally better than seven state-of-the-art weight-adapting methods on irregular Pareto fronts but also is able to achieve the same results as fixed-weight methods like MOEA/D on regular Pareto fronts.

                arXiv:2502.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data increasingly abounds, but distilling their underlying relationships down to something interpretable remains challenging. One approach is genetic programming, which `symbolically regresses' a data set down into an equation.
  However, symbolic regression (SR) faces the issue of requiring training from scratch for each new dataset. To generalize across all datasets, deep learning techniques have been applied to SR.
  These networks, however, are only able to be trained using a symbolic objective: NN-generated and target equations are symbolically compared. But this does not consider the predictive power of these equations, which could be measured by a behavioral objective that compares the generated equation's predictions to actual data.
  Here we introduce a method that combines gradient descent and evolutionary computation to yield neural networks that minimize the symbolic and behavioral errors of the equations they generate from data.
  As a result, these evolved networks are shown to generate more symbolically and behaviorally accurate equations than those generated by networks trained by state-of-the-art gradient based neural symbolic regression methods.
  We hope this method suggests that evolutionary algorithms, combined with gradient descent, can improve SR results by yielding equations with more accurate form and function.

Abstract: In the realm of autonomous driving, conventional approaches for vehicle perception and decision-making primarily rely on sensor input and rule-based algorithms. However, these methodologies often suffer from lack of interpretability and robustness, particularly in intricate traffic scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel brain-inspired driving (BID) framework. Diverging from traditional methods, our approach harnesses brain-inspired perception technology to achieve more efficient and robust environmental perception. Additionally, it employs brain-inspired decision-making techniques to facilitate intelligent decision-making. The experimental results show that the performance has been significantly improved across various autonomous driving tasks and achieved the end-to-end autopilot successfully. This contribution not only advances interpretability and robustness but also offers fancy insights and methodologies for further advancing autonomous driving technology.

                arXiv:2502.16170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have shown promise in solving routing problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) without handcrafted designs. Research in this domain has explored two primary categories of methods: iterative and non-iterative. While non-iterative methods struggle to generate near-optimal solutions directly, iterative methods simplify the task by learning local search steps. However, existing iterative methods are often limited by restricted neighborhood searches, leading to suboptimal results. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that extends the search to larger neighborhoods by learning a destroy-and-repair strategy. Specifically, we introduce a Destroy-and-Repair framework based on Hyper-Graphs (DRHG). This framework reduces consecutive intact edges to hyper-edges, allowing the model to pay more attention to the destroyed part and decrease the complexity of encoding all nodes. Experiments demonstrate that DRHG achieves stateof-the-art performance on TSP with up to 10,000 nodes and shows strong generalization to real-world TSPLib and CVRPLib problems.

Abstract: We propose a new concept, Evolution 6.0, which represents the evolution of robotics driven by Generative AI. When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.

Abstract: Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has emerged as a popular topic of evolutionary computation over the past decade. It aims to concurrently address multiple optimization tasks within limited computing resources, leveraging inter-task knowledge transfer techniques. Despite the abundance of multitask evolutionary algorithms (MTEAs) proposed for multitask optimization (MTO), there remains a comprehensive software platform to help researchers evaluate MTEA performance on benchmark MTO problems as well as explore real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first open-source optimization platform, named MTO-Platform (MToP), for EMT. MToP incorporates over 50 MTEAs, more than 200 MTO problem cases with real-world applications, and {over 20 performance metrics}. Moreover, to facilitate comparative analyses between MTEAs and traditional evolutionary algorithms, we adapted over 50 popular single-task evolutionary algorithms to address MTO problems. MToP boasts a user-friendly graphical interface, facilitating results analysis, data export, and schematics visualization. More importantly, MToP is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing users to develop new algorithms and tackle emerging problem domains. The source code of MToP is available at https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16336">Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms for Multiparty Multiobjective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.16336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scenarios where multiple decision-makers operate within a common decision space, each focusing on their own multi-objective optimization problem (e.g., bargaining games), the problem can be modeled as a multi-party multi-objective optimization problem (MPMOP). While numerous evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve MPMOPs, most results remain empirical. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the expected runtime of evolutionary algorithms on bi-party multi-objective optimization problems (BPMOPs). Our findings demonstrate that employing traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms to solve MPMOPs is both time-consuming and inefficient, as the resulting population contains many solutions that fail to achieve consensus among decision-makers. An alternative approach involves decision-makers individually solving their respective optimization problems and seeking consensus only in the final stage. While feasible for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems, this method may fail to guarantee approximate performance for one party in NP-hard problems. Finally, We propose coevolutionary multi-party multi-objective optimizers (CoEMPMO) for pseudo-Boolean optimization and shortest path problems within a multi-party multi-objective context, which maintains a common solution set among all parties through coevolution. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \( \text{CoEMPMO}_{\text{random}} \) outperforms previous algorithms in terms of the expected lower bound on runtime for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems. Additionally, \( \text{CoEMPMO}_{\text{cons}}^{\text{SP}} \) achieves better efficiency and precision in solving shortest path problems compared to existing algorithms.

Abstract: Transit agencies world-wide face tightening budgets and declining ridership. To maintain quality of service while cutting costs, efficient transit network design is essential. But planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. The most successful approaches to date use metaheuristic algorithms to search through the space of possible transit networks by applying low-level heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these low-level heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper we use deep reinforcement learning with graph neural nets to learn low-level heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm, instead of designing them manually. These learned heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and achieve new state-of-the-art results the challenging Mumford benchmark. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by as much as 52% and 25% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 19% over the city's existing transit network.

Abstract: The discovery of the quantum tunnelling (QT) effect -- the transmission of particles through a high potential barrier -- was one of the most impressive achievements of quantum mechanics made in the 1920s. Responding to the contemporary challenges, I introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that processes information using the effect of QT. I demonstrate the ability of QT-DNN to recognise optical illusions like a human. Tasking QT-DNN to simulate human perception of the Necker cube and Rubin's vase, I provide arguments in favour of the superiority of QT-based activation functions over the activation functions optimised for modern applications in machine vision, also showing that, at the fundamental level, QT-DNN is closely related to biology-inspired DNNs and models based on the principles of quantum information processing.

                arXiv:2409.18582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.

Abstract: This paper extends the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks beyond compact domains, which is of particular interest for the approximation within weighted $C^k$-spaces and weighted Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we establish universal approximation results within function spaces defined over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, including $L^p$-spaces, weighted $C^k$-spaces, and weighted Sobolev spaces, where the latter two include the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Moreover, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Intrinsic neural timescales, which reflect the duration of neural information storage within local brain regions and capacity for information integration, are typically measured using autocorrelation windows (ACWs). Extraction of intrinsic neural timescales from resting-state brain activity has been extensively applied in psychiatric disease research. Given the potential of intrinsic neural timescales as a neural marker for psychiatric disorders, investigating their reliability is crucial. This study, using an open-source database, aimed to evaluate the test–retest reliability of ACW-0 and ACW-50 under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions across three sessions. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were employed to quantify the reliability of the intrinsic neural timescales. Our results showed that intrinsic neural timescales exhibited good reliability (ICC &gt; 0.6) at the whole-brain level across different index types and eye states. Spatially, except for the right temporal region in the eyes-open condition, all other regions showed moderate-to-high ICCs. Over 60% of the electrodes demonstrated moderate-to-high intrinsic neural timescale ICCs under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, with ACW-0 being more stable than ACW-50. Moreover, in the new dataset, the above results were consistently reproduced. The present study comprehensively assessed the reliability of intrinsic neural timescale under various conditions, providing robust evidence for their stability in neuroscience and psychiatry.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Autobiographic remembering often involves types of constructive processes for psychological experiences and hypothetical scenarios of past events. Previous psychological research revealed a range of phenomenological and functional characteristics associated with recalls of episodes with high autobiographical significance. However, neural bases of such psychological characteristics and their association with memory construction processes remain unclear. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we collected autobiographical episodes from 28 young adults and their extensive metrics of phenomenological and functional characteristics related to autobiographical significance. We then sought to identify neural correlates of the psychological characteristics by measuring brain activity while participants recalled specified episodes as accurately as possible or in counterfactual simulation. Multiple-regression analysis using latent factors of psychological characteristics revealed that a factor representing autobiographical significance was associated with activation in the posterior medial memory system, including the angular cortex, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex, during counterfactual simulation. Furthermore, representation similarity analysis using patterns of factor scores revealed significant clusters in the posterior medial system and parts of cerebellar parcels, mainly during counterfactual simulation. These findings indicate that multidimensional psychological characteristics of episodes with autobiographical significance are associated with hypothetical constructive processes in the cortical posterior medial system and cerebellum.</span>

	<p>Background: Exposure to visually appealing food items can enhance their subjective realism, leading to increased cravings, salivation, and automatic approach tendencies. Prior research suggests that brief mindfulness instructions promoting dereification&amp;amp;mdash;recognizing stimuli as transient mental events&amp;amp;mdash;can mitigate these automatic reactions. Objectives: This study assesses whether brief mindfulness instruction can mitigate automatic consumption tendencies induced by food advertisements, exploring the corresponding behavioral, physiological, and neurophysiological mechanisms. Methods: Sixty participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving brief mindfulness instruction and the other a non-dereifying control instruction while exposed to advertised foods. This was followed by an approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance task (AAT), during which behavioral data, salivary volume, event-related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalogram recordings, and self-reports were collected. Results: The results showed no significant differences in approach behaviors between the groups. Hunger, food craving, and salivation levels increased uniformly in response to food cues for both groups. The N1, N2, P3, and late positive potential (LPP) ERPs remained unaltered by the instructions and consistent with the established AAT literature. Advertising heightened the appeal of neutral foods, as evidenced by increased N2, P3, and LPP responses. Conclusions: The brief mindfulness instruction failed to shield participants from the automatic responses elicited by food advertising, contrasting with the effects seen with non-advertised food.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-467/v3?src=rss">Negative perceptions toward older adults and life satisfaction among community-dwelling older citizens in Japan [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 4 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                Long-read sequencing technologies have transformed the field of epigenetics by enabling direct, single-base resolution detection of DNA modifications, such as methylation. This produces novel opportunities for studying the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation, imprinting, and disease. However, the unique characteristics of long-read data, including the modBAM format and extended read lengths, necessitate the development of specialised software tools for effective analysis. The NanoMethViz package provides a suite of tools for loading in long-read methylation data, visualising data at various data resolutions. It can convert the data for use with other Bioconductor software such as bsseq, DSS, dmrseq and edgeR to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In this workflow article, we demonstrate the process of converting modBAM files into formats suitable for comprehensive downstream analysis. We leverage NanoMethViz to conduct an exploratory analysis, visually summarizing differences between samples, examining aggregate methylation profiles across gene and CpG islands, and investigating methylation patterns within specific regions at the single-read level. Additionally, we illustrate the use of dmrseq for identifying DMRs and show how to integrate these findings into gene-level visualization plots. Our analysis is applied to a triplicate dataset of haplotyped long-read methylation data from mouse neural stem cells, allowing us to visualize and compare the characteristics of the parental alleles on chromosome 7. By applying DMR analysis, we recover DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualise the methylation patterns of these genes summarised at single-read resolution. Through DMR analysis, we identify DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualize their methylation patterns at single-read resolution. This streamlined workflow is adaptable to common experimental designs and offers flexibility in the choice of upstream data sources and downstream statistical analysis tools.

                <p>by Paul Henriot, Mohamed El-Kassas, Wagida Anwar, Samia A. Girgis, Maha El Gaafary, Kévin Jean, Laura Temime</p>

Mathematical models are powerful tools to analyze pathogen spread and assess control strategies in healthcare settings. Nevertheless, available models focus on nosocomial transmission through direct contact or aerosols rather than through blood, even though bloodborne pathogens remain a significant source of iatrogenic infectious risk. Herein, we propose an agent-based SEI (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected) model to reproduce the transmission of bloodborne pathogens dynamically within hospitals. This model simulates the dynamics of patients between hospital wards, from admission to discharge, as well as the dynamics of the devices used during at-risk invasive procedures, considering that patient contamination occurs after exposure to a contaminated device. We first illustrate the use of this model through a case study on hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Egypt. Model parameters, such as HCV upon-admission prevalence and transition probabilities between wards or ward-specific probabilities of undergoing different invasive procedures, are informed with data collected in Ain Shams University Hospital in Cairo. Our results suggest a low risk of HCV acquisition for patients hospitalized in this university hospital. However, we show that in a low-resource hospital, frequent device shortages could lead to increased risk. We also find that systematically screening patients in a few selected high-risk wards could significantly reduce this risk. We then further explore potential model applications through a second illustrative case study based on HBV nosocomial transmission in Ethiopia. In the future, this model could be used to predict the potential burden of emerging bloodborne pathogens and help implement effective control strategies in various hospital contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-229/v1?src=rss">Exploring antecedents of built environment for walkability of older adults: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This systematic literature review (SLR) explores how urban design influences walking access in the built environment for walking of older adults, summarizing existing studies. Examining various theories, it analyses themes like safety, security, comfort, convenience, aesthetics, governance, and policy frameworks. By critically reviewing the literature, it seeks to understand current research trends and suggest future directions. Methods The study employs an evidence-based systematic approach, following the standard procedure of SLR to identify relevant studies and extract information. Results It was found that five prominent theories dominated research literature: Active Aging Framework (AAF) (35.4%), Social-Ecological Model of Health Promotion (SEMHP) (25%), Community-Engaged Urban Design Theory (CEUDT) (18%), Neighbourhood Social Environment Theory (NSET) (11%), and the fifth Ecological Model of Aging (EMA) (8%). Empirical research dominated (37.5%), followed by grounded theory (20.8%), case study (18.8%), comparative study (12.5%), document analysis (8.3%), and analytical research (2.1%) in terms of the research type. The SLR revealed that most research uses empirical methods and focuses on applying existing theories. Conclusions It identifies opportunities for future research, suggesting areas for model integration, advancement, and application. Notably, it highlights the potential of combining the two most relevant theories for interventions promoting older adults’ health through walkable environments. This review can aid practitioners and researchers in identifying the theoretical underpinning of key factors for designing walkable cities that cater to older adults’ needs. A potential limitation is its focus on dominant theories, excluding others that might offer valuable insights.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-750/v2?src=rss">Tuberculosis Case Finding Using Self-Assessment Paradigm Through the E-TIBI Application in HIV Patients [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The goal of eliminating tuberculosis has not yet shown a bright spot. Specifically for HIV patients (PLHIV), WHO has made it a special category as a pillar for eliminating tuberculosis. The tuberculosis screening has not yet reached the national target because it is carried out manually by health workers, requiring optimization following technological developments. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of tuberculosis case finding using a self-assessment paradigm in HIV patients. Methods This research was cross-sectional. The data obtained from HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application for 3 months each was analyzed using the compare mean independent t-test. Then the Chi-squared test was carried out on the E-TIBI screening characteristic variables. Result In total, there were 921 respondents with 148 (16%) presumptive TB. It was found that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the number of presumptive TB cases found in HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application. The person with presumptive TB showed 20 of 24 characteristic variables that were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion E-TIBI can increase the tuberculosis case finding in HIV patients so it has the potential to be implemented as a screening tool in the PLHIV community.

The model unifies observations from environments of varying sizes and dimensions in multiple species, suggesting that a common mechanism underlies the hippocampal spatial code.

                Goto et al. measure the pulsatile activity of the reproductive center in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus during puberty in female mice. They discover that food availability rapidly and bidirectionally modulates this pulsatile activity, partially through the hunger center within the same arcuate nucleus, potentially influencing the timing of puberty.

                Chadwick et al. report that in vitro microevolution of Cryptococcus neoformans under high carbon dioxide leads to loss-of-function mutations in Avc1 that confer CO2 tolerance and virulence to CO2-intolerant/low-virulence strains. Similar AVC1 mutations emerge in patients with relapsed cryptococcosis, suggesting that adaptation to CO2 increases fitness in the host.

They captured this BEC heterogeneity according to permissiveness to in vivo lentiviral gene delivery and the hepatocyte-biased transcriptome in mice and non-human primates (NHPs), highlighting the potential for lifelong and disease-resistant corrective gene therapy.

                Petfalski et al. reveal complexities in RNAPI termination. Torsion release, through nascent pre-rRNA cleavage by Rnt1, favors RNAPI pausing and torpedo termination by the exonuclease Rat1, aided by Nsi1 roadblocks and RNAPI-mediated endonuclease cleavage. Termination of prematurely stalled RNAPI is facilitated by TRAMP-mediated nascent transcript polyadenylation and a reverse torpedo mechanism.

As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative’s FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. These are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guidelines for adoption and fodder for discussion. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96290">DNA methylome regulates virulence and metabolism in Pseudomonas syringae</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial pathogens employ epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, to adapt to environmental changes, and these mechanisms play important roles in various biological processes. <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> is a model phytopathogenic bacterium, but its methylome is less well known than that of other species. In this study, we conducted single-molecule real-time sequencing to profile the DNA methylation landscape in three model pathovars of <i>P. syringae</i>. We identified one Type I restriction–modification system (HsdMSR), including the conserved sequence motif associated with <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine (6mA). About 25–40% of the genes involved in DNA methylation were conserved in two or more of the strains, revealing the functional conservation of methylation in <i>P. syringae</i>. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis highlighted the involvement of HsdMSR in virulent and metabolic pathways, including the Type III secretion system, biofilm formation, and translational efficiency. The regulatory effect of HsdMSR on transcription was dependent on both strands being fully 6mA methylated. Overall, this work illustrated the methylation profile in <i>P. syringae</i> and the critical involvement of DNA methylation in regulating virulence and metabolism. Thus, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of epigenetic transcriptional control in <i>P. syringae</i> and related bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97437">Improved base editing and functional screening in Leishmania via co-expression of the AsCas12a ultra variant, a T7 RNA polymerase, and a cytosine base editor</a></h4>

              
                The ability to analyze the function of all genes in a genome is highly desirable, yet challenging in <i>Leishmania</i> due to a repetitive genome, limited DNA repair mechanisms, and lack of RNA interference in most species. While our introduction of a cytosine base editor (CBE) demonstrated potential to overcome these limitations (Engstler and Beneke, 2023), challenges remained, including low transfection efficiency, variable editing rates across species, parasite growth effects, and competition between deleterious and non-deleterious mutations. Here, we present an optimized approach addressing these issues. We identified a T7 RNAP promoter variant ensuring high editing rates across <i>Leishmania</i> species without compromising growth. A revised CBE single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) scoring system was developed to prioritize STOP codon generation. Additionally, a triple-expression construct was created for stable integration of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into a <i>Leishmania</i> safe harbor locus using AsCas12a ultra-mediated DNA double-strand breaks, increasing transfection efficiency by ~400-fold to 1 transfectant per 70 transfected cells. Using this improved system for a small-scale proof-of-principle pooled screen, we successfully confirmed the essential and fitness-associated functions of CK1.2, CRK2, CRK3, AUK1/AIRK, TOR1, IFT88, IFT139, IFT140, and RAB5A in <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>, demonstrating a significant improvement over our previous method. Lastly, we show the utility of co-expressing AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, and CBE for hybrid CRISPR gene replacement and base editing within the same cell line. Overall, these improvements will broaden the range of possible gene editing applications in <i>Leishmania</i> species and will enable a variety of loss-of-function screens in the near future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99455">Genetic inactivation of the β1 adrenergic receptor prevents cerebral cavernous malformations in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed that propranolol reduces experimental murine cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) and prevents embryonic caudal venous plexus (CVP) lesions in zebrafish that follow mosaic inactivation of <i>ccm2</i> (Li et al., 2021). Because morpholino silencing of the β1 adrenergic receptor (<i>adrb1</i>) prevents the embryonic CVP lesion, we proposed that <i>adrb1</i> plays a role in CCM pathogenesis. Here, we report that <i>adrb1<sup>-/-</sup></i> zebrafish exhibited 86% fewer CVP lesions and 87% reduction of CCM lesion volume relative to wild type brood mates at 2dpf and 8–10 weeks stage, respectively. Treatment with metoprolol, a β1 selective antagonist, yielded a similar reduction in CCM lesion volume. <i>Adrb1<sup>-/-</sup></i> zebrafish embryos exhibited reduced heart rate and contractility and reduced CVP blood flow. Similarly, slowing the heart and eliminating the blood flow in CVP by administration of 2,3-BDM suppressed the CVP lesion. In sum, our findings provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that the therapeutic effect of propranolol on CCM is achieved through β1 receptor antagonism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105446">Chronic RNA G-quadruplex accumulation in aging and Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                As the world population ages, new molecular targets in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are needed to combat the expected influx of new AD cases. Until now, the role of RNA structure in aging and neurodegeneration has largely remained unexplored. In this study, we examined human hippocampal <i>postmortem</i> tissue for the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in aging and AD. We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurons with the accumulation of phospho-tau immunostaining contained rG4s, rG4 structure can drive tau aggregation, and rG4 staining density depended on APOE genotype in the human tissue examined. Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation is linked to proteostasis collapse. These morphological findings suggest that further investigation of RNA structure in neurodegeneration is a critical avenue for future treatments and diagnoses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97830">Altered hepatic metabolism mediates sepsis preventive effects of reduced glucose supply in infected preterm newborns</a></h4>

              
                Preterm infants are susceptible to neonatal sepsis, a syndrome of pro-inflammatory activity, organ damage, and altered metabolism following infection. Given the unique metabolic challenges and poor glucose regulatory capacity of preterm infants, their glucose intake during infection may have a high impact on the degree of metabolism dysregulation and organ damage. Using a preterm pig model of neonatal sepsis, we previously showed that a drastic restriction in glucose supply during infection protects against sepsis via suppression of glycolysis-induced inflammation, but results in severe hypoglycemia. Now we explored clinically relevant options for reducing glucose intake to decrease sepsis risk, without causing hypoglycemia and further explore the involvement of the liver in these protective effects. We found that a reduced glucose regime during infection increased survival via reduced pro-inflammatory response, while maintaining normoglycemia. Mechanistically, this intervention enhanced hepatic oxidative phosphorylation and possibly gluconeogenesis, and dampened both circulating and hepatic inflammation. However, switching from a high to a reduced glucose supply after the debut of clinical symptoms did not prevent sepsis, suggesting metabolic conditions at the start of infection are key in driving the outcome. Finally, an early therapy with purified human inter-alpha inhibitor protein, a liver-derived anti-inflammatory protein, partially reversed the effects of low parenteral glucose provision, likely by inhibiting neutrophil functions that mediate pathogen clearance. Our findings suggest a clinically relevant regime of reduced glucose supply for infected preterm infants could prevent or delay the development of sepsis in vulnerable neonates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99373">Endosomal chemokine receptor signalosomes regulate central mechanisms underlying cell migration</a></h4>

              
                Chemokine receptors are GPCRs that regulate the chemotactic migration of a wide variety of cells including immune and cancer cells. Most chemokine receptors contain features associated with the ability to stimulate G protein signaling during β-arrestin-mediated receptor internalization into endosomes. As endosomal signaling of certain non-GPCR receptors plays a major role in cell migration, we chose to investigate the potential role of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling on mechanisms governing this function. Applying a combination of pharmacological and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate that the model chemokine receptor CCR7 recruits G protein and β-arrestin simultaneously upon chemokine stimulation, which enables internalized receptors to activate G protein from endosomes. Furthermore, spatiotemporal-resolved APEX2 proteome profiling shows that endosomal CCR7 uniquely enriches specific Rho GTPase regulators as compared to plasma membrane CCR7, which is directly associated with enhanced activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 and chemotaxis of immune T cells. As Rac1 drives the formation of membrane protrusions during chemotaxis, our findings suggest an important integrated function of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling in cell migration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104069">Axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons</a></h4>

              
                Sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons have a unique pseudo-unipolar morphology in which a stem axon bifurcates into a peripheral and a central axon, with different regenerative abilities. Whereas peripheral DRG axons regenerate, central axons are unable to regrow. Central axon regeneration can however be elicited by a prior conditioning lesion to the peripheral axon. How DRG axon asymmetry is established remains unknown. Here we developed a rodent in vitro system replicating DRG pseudo-unipolarization and asymmetric axon regeneration. Using this model, we observed that from early development, central DRG axons have a higher density of growing microtubules. This asymmetry was also present in vivo and was abolished by a conditioning lesion that decreased microtubule polymerization of central DRG axons. An axon-specific microtubule-associated protein (MAP) signature, including the severases spastin and katanin and the microtubule regulators CRMP5 and tau, was found and shown to adapt upon conditioning lesion. Supporting its significance, interfering with the DRG MAP signature either in vitro or in vivo readily abolished central-peripheral asymmetries in microtubule dynamics and regenerative ability. In summary, our data unveil that axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons.

">Ketogenic Diet Enhances Cognitive-Behavioral Function and Hippocampal Neurogenesis While Attenuating Amyloid Pathology in Tg-SwDI Mice</a></h4>

              
                The ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and moderate protein intake, has gained attention for its therapeutic potential in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Studies in Alzheimer's rodent models report that KD and/or ketogenic supplements attenuate cognitive-behavioral impairments, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta plaques and tau pathology. However, it is unknown whether KD can similarly benefit individuals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a prevalent condition in which amyloid accumulates in cerebral vessels. CAA is highly comorbid in patients with Alzheimer's and, on its own, increases the risk of stroke, cognitive impairment, and dementia, yet no effective treatments currently exist. The objective of this study was to determine whether KD can improve cognitive-behavioral and neuropathological outcomes in a mouse model with CAA. Male Tg-SwDI mice were fed either a standard chow or KD from 3.5 to 7.5 months of age. Following ~3 months of dietary intervention, glucose and ketone-body levels were assessed, then mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate locomotor activity, anxiety-related behaviors, and cognition. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess amyloid pathology, vascular density, neuroinflammation, white matter integrity, and hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition to KD inducing nutritional ketosis and achieving metabolic benefits, mice on KD exhibited increased activity, enhanced spatial learning and memory, and a trend toward improved spatial working memory. These cognitive benefits were accompanied by an attenuation of amyloid pathology and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings suggest that a ketogenic diet may be safe and effective in Alzheimer's and dementia patients with CAA.

">Single-nuclei RNA Sequencing Reveals Distinct Transcriptomic Signatures of Rat Dorsal Root Ganglia in a Chronic Discogenic Low Back Pain Model</a></h4>

              
                Chronic low back pain (LBP), often correlated with intervertebral disc degeneration, is a leading source of disability worldwide yet remains poorly understood. Current treatments often fail to provide sustained relief, highlighting the need to better understand the mechanisms driving discogenic LBP. During disc degeneration, the extracellular matrix degrades, allowing nociceptive nerve fibers to innervate previously aneural disc regions. Persistent mechanical and inflammatory stimulation of nociceptors can induce plastic changes within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, characterized by altered gene expression, enhanced excitability, and lowered activation thresholds. Although these transcriptional changes have been described in other pain states, including osteoarthritis, they remain underexplored in discogenic LBP. To address this gap, this study represents the first application of comprehensive single-nuclei RNA sequencing of DRG neurons in a rat model of chronic discogenic LBP. Eighteen distinct DRG subpopulations were identified and mapped to existing mouse and cross-species atlases revealing strong similarities in neuronal populations with the mouse. Differential expression analysis revealed increased expression of pain-associated genes, including Scn9a and Piezo2, and neuroinflammatory mediators such as Fstl1 and Ngfr, in LBP animals. Axial hypersensitivity, measured using grip strength, significantly correlated with increased expression of Scn9a, Fstl1, and Ngfr, which suggests their role in maintaining axial hypersensitivity in this model. These findings establish a relationship between DRG transcriptomic changes and axial hypersensitivity in a discogenic LBP model, identifying potential molecular targets for non-opioid treatments and advancing understanding of discogenic LBP mechanisms.

">Local variations in L/M ratio influence the detection and color naming of small spots</a></h4>

              
                The distribution of long-wavelength sensitive (L) and middle-wavelength sensitive (M) cones in the retina determines how different frequencies of incident light are sampled across space, and has been hypothesized to influence spatial and color vision. We asked whether the detection and color naming of small, short-duration increment stimuli depend on the relative numbers of L and M cones illuminated. Stimuli were corrected for optical aberrations by an adaptive optics system, and targeted to locations in the parafovea where cone spectral types were known. We found that sensitivity to 680 nm light, normalized by sensitivity to 543 nm light, grew with the proportion of L cones at the stimulated locus, though intra- and intersubject variability was considerable. A similar trend was derived from a simple model of the achromatic (L+M) pathway, as well as from photoreceptor-level ideal observers, suggesting that small spot detection mainly relies on a non-opponent mechanism. Most stimuli were called achromatic, with red and green responses becoming more common as stimulus intensity and local L/M ratio symmetry increased. Our detection data confirm earlier reports that small spot psychophysics can reveal information about local cone topography, and our color naming findings suggest that chromatic sensitivity may improve when the L/M ratio approaches unity.

">Topologically Optimized Intrinsic Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                The estimation of brain networks is instrumental in quantifying and evaluating brain function. Nevertheless, achieving precise estimations of subject-level networks has proven to be a formidable task. In response to this challenge, researchers have developed group-inference frameworks that leverage robust group-level estimations as a common reference point to infer corresponding subject-level networks. Generally, existing approaches either leverage the common reference as a strict, voxel-wise spatial constraint (i.e., strong constraints at the voxel level) or impose no constraints. Here, we propose a targeted approach that harnesses the topological information of group-level networks to encode a high-level representation of spatial properties to be used as constraints, which we refer to as Topologically Optimized Intrinsic Brain Networks (TOIBN). Consequently, our method inherits the significant advantages of constraint-based approaches, such as enhancing estimation efficacy in noisy data or small sample sizes. On the other hand, our method provides a softer constraint than voxel-wise penalties, which can result in the loss of individual variation, increased susceptibility to model biases, and potentially missing important subject-specific information. Our analyses show that the subject maps from our method are less noisy and true to the group networks while promoting subject variability that can be lost from strict constraints. We also find that the topological properties resulting from the TOIBN maps are more expressive of differences between individuals with schizophrenia and controls in the default mode, subcortical, and visual networks.

">Fiber photometry analysis for spontaneous dopamine signals: The z-scored data are not the data</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent sensors have revolutionized the measurement of molecules in the brain, and the dLight dopamine sensor has been used extensively to examine reward- and cue-evoked dopamine release, but only recently has the field turned its attention to spontaneous release events. Analysis of spontaneous events typically requires evaluation of hundreds of events over minutes to hours, and the most common method of analysis, z-scoring, was not designed for this purpose. Here, we compare the accuracy and reliability of three different analysis methods to identify pharmacologically induced changes in dopamine release and uptake in freely moving C57BL/6J mice. The D1-like receptor antagonist SCH23390 was used to prevent dLight sensors from interacting with dopamine in the extracellular space, while cocaine was used to inhibit uptake and raclopride to increase release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. We examined peak-to-peak frequency, peak amplitude, and width, the time spent above an established cutoff. The three methods were 1) the widely-used "Z-Score Method", which automatically smooths baseline drift and normalizes recordings using signal-to-noise ratios, 2) a "Manual Method", in which local baselines were adjusted manually and individual cutoffs were determined for each subject, and 3) the "Prominence Method" that combines z-scoring with prominence assessment to tag individual peaks, then returns to the preprocessed data for kinetic analysis. First, SCH23390 drastically reduced the number of signals detected as expected, but only when the Manual Method was used. Z-scoring failed to identify any changes, due to its amplification of noise when signals were diminished. Cocaine increased signal width as expected using the Manual and Prominence Methods, but not the Z-Score Method. Finally, raclopride-induced increases in amplitude were correctly identified by the Manual and Prominence Methods. The Z-Score Method failed to identify any of the changes in dopamine release and uptake kinetics. Thus, analysis of spontaneous dopamine signals requires assessment of the %{Delta}F/F values, ideally using the Manual Method, and the use of z-scoring is not appropriate.

">β-Hydroxybutyrate enhances brain metabolism in normoglycemia and hyperglycemia, providing cerebroprotection in a mouse stroke model.</a></h4>

              
                Hyperglycemia in poorly controlled diabetes is widely recognized as detrimental to organ dysfunction. However, the acute effects of hyperglycemia on brain metabolism and function are not fully understood. The potential protective benefit of ketone bodies on mitochondrial function in the brain has also not been well characterized. Here, we evaluated the acute effects of hyperglycemia and {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on brain metabolism by employing a novel approach leveraging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependence of bioluminescence originating from luciferin-luciferase activity. Oxygen consumption rate was measured in ex vivo live brain punches to further evaluate mitochondrial function. Additionally, we investigated the functional relevance of BHB using an in vivo photothrombotic stroke model to assess its cerebroprotective effects. Our data demonstrate that brain metabolism in mice is affected by acute exposure to high glucose, at a level similar to consuming food or a beverage with high sucrose. This short-term effect of glucose exposure was reduced by co-administration with the ketone body BHB. Moreover, BHB significantly reduced infarct size in the brain stroke model, providing evidence for its functional protective role in the brain. These findings suggest that BHB may effectively mitigate the adverse effects of metabolic stress and ischemic events on brain metabolism and function.

">Integrated Ultrasound Neuromodulation and Optical Neuroimaging in Awake Mice using a Transparent Ultrasound Transducer Cranial Window</a></h4>

              
                Ultrasound neuromodulation is a rapidly advancing, non-invasive technique with significant therapeutic potential for treating various neurological disorders. Although extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have provided valuable insights into its modulatory effects, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, limiting its clinical translation. Optical neuroimaging techniques can help investigate these mechanisms; however, the opacity and bulkiness of conventional ultrasound transducers pose significant challenges for their integration with in vivo ultrasound neuromodulation studies, particularly in awake rodents. To address these limitations, we propose a straightforward solution: a miniaturized lithium niobate-based transparent ultrasound transducer (TUT) integrated as a thinned-skull cranial window for ultrasound stimulation while facilitating multimodal optical neuroimaging in awake mice brain. Using laser speckle contrast imaging and intrinsic optical signal imaging, we studied changes in brain hemodynamics in response to various ultrasound stimulation sequences. Our experiments demonstrated that TUT cranial window can robustly induce neuromodulatory effects with observed increase in both cerebral blood flow and total hemoglobin, with peak and cumulative hemodynamic changes directionally correlated with ultrasound stimulation duration and intensity. Overall, these findings highlight that TUT cranial window can seamlessly integrate ultrasound stimulation and optical neuroimaging in awake mouse brain models, offering promising prospects for uncovering the underlying mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation.

">Mouse sensorimotor cortex reflects complex kinematic details during reaching and grasping</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated forelimb actions, such as reaching and grasping, rely on motor commands that span a spectrum from abstract target specification to detailed instantaneous muscle control. The sensorimotor cortex is central to controlling these complex movements, yet how the detailed command signals are distributed across its numerous subregions remains unclear. In particular, in mice it is unknown if the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices represent low-level joint angle details in addition to high-level signals like movement direction. Here, we combine high quality markerless tracking and two-photon imaging during a reach-to-grasp task to quantify movement-related activity in the mouse caudal forelimb area (CFA) and forelimb S1 (fS1). Linear decoding models reveal a strong representation of proximal and distal joint angles in both areas, and both areas support joint angle decoding with comparable fidelity. Despite shared low-level encoding, the time course of high-level target-specific information varied across areas. CFA exhibited early onset and sustained encoding of target-specific signals while fS1 was more transiently modulated around lift onset. These results reveal both shared and unique contributions of CFA and fS1 to reaching and grasping, implicating a more distributed cortical circuit for mouse forelimb control than has been previously considered.

">Brain-wide mapping reveals temporal and sexually dimorphic opioid actions</a></h4>

              
                While the molecular and cellular effects of opioids have been extensively studied, the precise mechanisms by which these drugs target specific brain regions over time remain unclear. Similarly, despite well-documented sex differences in opioid responses, the anatomical basis for this sexual dimorphism is not well characterized. To address these questions, we developed an automated, scalable, and unbiased approach for whole-brain anatomical mapping of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos in response to acute morphine exposure. Using ribbon scanning confocal microscopy, we imaged whole cleared brains from male and female wild-type mice at 1 hour and 4 hours post-morphine administration. Our whole-brain analysis of c-Fos expression revealed distinct patterns of morphine-induced regional brain activation across time and sex. Notably, we observed a greater number of structures with significant activity differences at 4 hours compared to 1 hour. In male mice, significant changes were primarily localized to regions within the dopamine system, whereas in female mice, they were concentrated in cortical regions. By combining high-throughput imaging with whole-brain expression analysis, particularly in the context of opioid actions, our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of how drugs of abuse affect the brain.

">Predicting High-Resolution Spatial and Spectral Features in Mass Spectrometry Imaging with Machine Learning and Multimodal Data Fusion</a></h4>

              
                Recent advancements in molecular Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) have sparked interest in integrating high spatial resolution methods with molecular mass-spectrometry-based chemical imaging. Fusion-based algorithms have proven effective in generating high spatial-resolution molecular mass spectra. However, a significant challenge stems from the differing physical mechanisms underlying image generation and data upsampling techniques, potentially leading to discrepancies in integrated information channels. Integrating physical constraints into data processing workflows is essential to tackle this issue. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that merges data from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR), time-of-flight matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI-ToF), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) imaging techniques. By leveraging FT-ICR's unparalleled spectral resolution and ToF-SIMS's exceptional spatial resolution, we achieve submicron spatial resolution, enabling the observation of intact molecular species with remarkable spectral precision.

">Gestational Chlorpyrifos Exposure Imparts Lasting Alterations to the Rat Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus pesticide used extensively in agricultural and residential settings for nearly 60 years. Gestational, sub-acute exposure to chlorpyrifos is linked to increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal studies have modeled these neurobehavioral detriments, however, the functional alterations in the brain induced by this exposure remain largely unknown. To address this, we used a rat model of gestational chlorpyrifos exposure to interrogate the alterations in the developing somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Rat dams were exposed to chlorpyrifos (5 mg/kg) or vehicle on gestational days 18-21 via subcutaneous injection, with no overt acute toxicity. Acetylcholinesterase was modestly inhibited but returned to baseline levels by postnatal day 12. We performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings on postnatal days 12-20 in both male and female progeny of the treated dams. A spike timing dependent plasticity protocol revealed changes to the normal development of use-dependent plasticity, including interference in long-term synaptic depression. Recording inhibitory synaptic activity revealed an increase in the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents and in paired pulse ratios, in conjunction with a significant decrease in miniature postsynaptic currents. These findings suggest a presynaptic mechanism of inhibited GABA release, with potential disinhibition of inhibitory neurons. Evaluation of barrel cortex development displayed disruptions to normal barrel field patterning, with increases in both the septal area and total barrel field. We provide evidence for functional and structural alterations during brain development induced by in utero exposure to the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos that may account for the well-established behavioral outcomes.

">Adaptation of visual responses in degenerating rd10 and healthy mouse retinas during ongoing electrical stimulation.</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Visual adaptation is a physiological and perceptual process by which the visual system adjusts to changes in the environment or visual stimuli. This process is fundamental to how we perceive the world around us and allows our visual system to efficiently encode and process visual information. The retina incorporates adaptaion with its dozens of functionally distinct retinal ganglion cell types. Meanwhile, the field of retinal prostheses is increasing its understanding of electrical adaptation and cell-specific stimulation. However, very little is known about the interaction of visual and electrical stimulation on the adaptation of retinal ganglion cell types. Methods/Approach: Recording with a microelectrode array (MEA), we presented an ON and OFF full-field, visual stimulus to characterize various visual response parameters in healthy and degenerating rd10 mouse retinas. We then evaluated visual response changes before and after blocks of monophasic voltage-controlled electrical pulse stimulation. Main Results: A history of electrical stimulation strengthened visual responses in WT retina, even when changes attributable to in vitro visual adaptation were taken into account. In rd10 retinas, electrical adaptation counteracted the baseline in vitro visual adaptation. In all cases, adaptation often affected the ON and OFF visual response components differentially. Consequently, the ON/OFF classification of individual cells changed as a result of adaptation. Significance: Electrical stimulation-induced changes in the retina should be considered in the encoding of visual stimuli by retinal prosthetic devices. In vitro investigations for bionic vision should strive to probe electrical responsiveness after adaptation to ongoing electrical stimulation has achieved a steady-state.

">Detecting Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) from Text: A Benchmarking Study</a></h4>

              
                Classifying subtypes of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) from connected speech presents significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping linguistic markers. This study benchmarks the performance of traditional machine learning models with various feature extraction techniques, transformer-based models, and large language models (LLMs) for PPA classification. Our results indicate that while transformer-based models and LLMs exceed chance-level performance in terms of balanced accuracy, traditional classifiers combined with contextual embeddings remain highly competitive. Notably, SVM using RoBERTa's embeddings achieves the highest classification accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning in enhancing the automatic classification of PPA subtypes.

">Sex differences distinguish performance in four object recognition-based memory tasks in the Pink1-/- rat model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Many patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) experience early, sometimes prodromal non-motor deficits involving cognition and memory. These so-called mild cognitive impairments hold dire predictions for future risk of freezing, falls and developing PD-related dementia. Moreover, due to a dearth of effective treatments, these symptoms persist and progressively worsen. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand and better treat these debilitating signs. Sex differences in incidence, severity and treatment sensitivities predict that the answers to these questions are sex-specific. The work presented here highlights new ways in which rats with knockout of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 gene (Pink1-/-) emulate PDs mild cognitive deficits and their clinical sex differences. Specifically, longitudinal behavioral testing confirmed that male Pink1-/- rats developed significant deficits in Novel Object Recognition and Novel Object Location tasks by 5 months old but that female Pink1-/- were unimpaired in these and the Object-in-Place task through 12 months of age. Further, What, Where, When Episodic-like Memory testing identified enduring deficits in all three memory domains in Pink1-/- males by 3 months of age whereas in Pink1-/- females, non-significant impairments emerged at 7 months of age and progressed to significant memory deficits by 12 months of age. Together, these data show that Pink1-/- rats model the generally greater vulnerability of male PD patients to cognitive and memory deficits in PD, the growing risk for higher order deficits in female patients as they age, and features including early onset that distinguish episodic memory impairments from other at-risk processes in this disorder.

">Behavioral profiling of hyperbaric oxygen as an intervention for chemotherapy-related functional impairments in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Chemobrain or chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects up to 75% of cancer patients and survivors following chemotherapy treatments. Chemotherapy typically affects multiple domains including learning, memory, attention, executive function, and mood regulation, persisting for decades after treatment cessation and significantly diminishing cancer survivors quality of life. Despite its prevalence and long-term impact, effective interventions for CRCI remain limited. This study investigated the behavioral effects of HBO on mice exposed to chemotherapy drugs methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Adult male and female C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of either saline or chemotherapy (Low-dose: MTX 37.5 mg/kg and 5-FU 50 mg/kg; High-dose: MTX 70 mg/kg and 5-FU 100 mg/kg) once a week for three weeks. Concurrently, subsets of mice underwent daily HBO (2.4 ATA, 90 minutes) five days a week for three weeks. Animals health was evaluated weekly, and behavioral assessment of cognitive, motor, and affective functions was conducted post-treatment. Our results showed that chemotherapy, especially at high-dose, impaired spatial memory and navigation, avoidance learning, fear discrimination, and anxiety regulation differently between males and females. HBO significantly alleviated chemotherapy-induced avoidance learning impairment in both sexes and improved coordinated running capacity in high-dose treated males. However, chemotherapy-HBO cotreatment increased spatial memory deficit in males and increased anxiety-like behaviors in females. In conclusion, even though HBO had some nuanced effects on the various domains, some reversal of CRCI effects were observed. Therefore, HBO should be further studied and considered as a potential treatment for chemobrain.

">Synaptotoxic effects of extracellular tau are mediated by its microtubule-binding region</a></h4>

              
                Immunotherapies targeting extracellular tau share the premise that interrupting cell-to-cell spread of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) will slow dementia pathogenesis. How these interventions affect the actions of synaptotoxic, extracellular tau species that may help mediate cognitive impairment is relatively unknown. Here, we assayed synaptic plasticity disruption in anaesthetised live rats caused by intracerebral injection of synaptotoxic tau present either in (a) secretomes of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iNs) from people with Trisomy 21, the most common genetic cause of AD, or (b) aqueous extracts of human AD brain. Extracellular tau in iN secretomes was found to include fragments that contain the extended microtubule binding regions of tau, MTBR/R' and adjacent C-terminal peptides. Immunodepletion or co-injection with antibodies targeting epitopes within these fragments prevented the acute disruption of synaptic plasticity by these patient-derived synaptotoxic tau preparations. Conversely, a recombinant human tau fragment encompassing the core MTBR/R' - region present in tau fibrils, tau297-391 potently mimicked this deleterious action of patient-derived tau. MTBR/R' -directed antibodies also rapidly reversed a very persistent synaptotoxic effect of soluble brain tau. Our findings reveal a hitherto relatively unexplored potential benefit of targeting MTBR/R'.

">Neuronal differentiation enhances a cytoplasmic pool of tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2)</a></h4>

              
                Mental retardation autosomal dominant 57 (MRD57) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by delayed language and psychomotor development, intellectual disability, hypotonia, gastrointestinal issues and facial dysmorphia. It is linked to genetic mutations in the serine/threonine kinase TLK2, characterised by haploinsufficiency and in some cases, its loss or impaired kinase function. TLK2 is an established cell cycle regulator that has been extensively studied in mitotic cells. It is upregulated in cancers, driving tumour growth, however, the role of TLK2 in postmitotic neurons is not understood. We therefore aimed to gain insight into how TLK2 mutations cause MRD57 by determining where TLK2 is expressed in the brain and its subcellular localisation during neuronal differentiation. Public human and mouse brain transcriptomic data revealed splice variant diversity in the N-terminus of TLK2, which contains its nuclear localisation sequence (NLS). Using splice-specific in situ hybridisation probes, we observed expression of TLK2 isoforms that contain and lack the NLS in the mouse hippocampus and cerebellum. We confirmed these findings in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and found that neuronal differentiation of these cells enhances a cytoplasmic pool of TLK2 by two mechanisms: nuclear export of full length TLK2 and increased expression of TLK2 splice variants lacking the NLS. Finally, acute stimuli that mimic synaptic activity were sufficient to elicit nuclear export of TLK2. Our data highlight the need to establish the neuronal cytoplasmic substrates of TLK2 and determine how the loss of TLK2 activity in MRD57 might impact their function in the developing and mature brain.

">Central amygdalar PKCδ neurons mediate fentanyl withdrawal</a></h4>

              
                Aversion to opioid withdrawal is a significant barrier to achieving lasting opioid abstinence. The central amygdala (CeA), a key brain region for pain, threat-detection, autonomic engagement, and valence assignment, is active during opioid withdrawal. However, the role of molecularly distinct CeA neural populations in withdrawal remains underexplored. Here, we investigated the activity dynamics, brain-wide connectivity, and functional contribution of Protein Kinase C-delta (PKC{delta})-expressing neurons in the CeA lateral capsule (CeLCPKC{delta}) during fentanyl withdrawal in mice. Mapping activity-dependent gene expression in CeLCPKC{delta} neurons revealed a highly withdrawal-active subregion in the anterior half of the CeA. Fiber photometry calcium imaging showed that opioid-naive CeLCPKC{delta} neurons respond to salient noxious and startling stimuli. In fentanyl-dependent mice, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal increased spontaneous neural activity and enhanced responses to noxious stimuli. Chronic inhibition of CeLCPKC{delta} neurons throughout fentanyl exposure, via viral overexpression of the potassium channel Kir2.1, attenuated withdrawal symptoms in fentanyl-dependent mice. Lastly, we identified putative opioid-sensitive inputs to CeLCPKC{delta} neurons using rabies-mediated monosynaptic circuit tracing and color-switching tracers to map mu-opioid receptor-expressing inputs to the CeLC. Collectively, these findings suggest that the hyperactivity of CeLCPKC{delta} neurons underlies the somatic signs of fentanyl withdrawal, offering new insights into the amygdala cell-types and circuits involved in opioid dependence.

">An updated catalogue of split-GAL4 driver lines for descending neurons in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Descending neurons (DNs) occupy a key position in the sensorimotor hierarchy, conveying signals from the brain to the rest of the body below the neck. In Drosophila melanogaster flies, approximately 480 DN cell types have been described from electron-microscopy image datasets. Genetic access to these cell types is crucial for further investigation of their role in generating behaviour. We previously conducted the first large-scale survey of Drosophila melanogaster DNs, describing 98 unique cell types from light microscopy and generating cell-type-specific split-Gal4 driver lines for 65 of them. Here, we extend our previous work, describing the morphology of 137 additional DN types from light microscopy, bringing the total number DN types identified in light microscopy datasets to 235, or nearly 50%. In addition, we produced 500 new sparse split-Gal4 driver lines and compiled a list of previously published DN lines from the literature for a combined list of 738 split-Gal4 driver lines targeting 171 DN types.

">Quinpirole ameliorates the dysfunction of microglia in human LRRK2-R1441G transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is a key contributor to Parkinson' disease (PD) pathogenesis. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the leading genetic contributor to both familial and sporadic PD, has been implicated in driving this connection. However, its precise role remains incompletely understood due to technical challenges. To address this, we utilized a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse model overexpressing human LRRK2 R1441G, which replicates key features of PD. These mice were crossed with Cx3cr1-EGFP mice to enable assessment of microglial dynamics and function using two-photon imaging in awake mice in vivo and acute brain slices ex vivo. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomic analysis was performed using GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler technology to compare transgenic mice with their wild-type counterparts. The R1441G mutation upregulated antigen processing and presentation pathways, increased activated microglia, and enhanced microglial polarization in the dorsal striatum. Mutant microglia exhibited reduced motility and slower responses to focal injury, with processes retracting faster and extending more slowly. Quinpirole, a dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonist, successfully reversed microglial deficits. This study provides the first evidence that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations alter microglial motility and responsiveness in vivo, highlighting D2R activation as a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD.

">EEG responses to auditory cues predict fluency variability and stuttering intervention outcome</a></h4>

              
                Stuttering is a variable speech disorder whose brain mechanisms remain unknown. Sensorimotor brain circuits, critical for motor-speech control, including auditory processing necessary for speech prediction and monitoring, have been linked to the disorder. Despite considerable advances, it remains unclear whether auditory circuits relate to stuttering variability, and whether the panoply of interventions for persons who stutter can lead to brain changes within these circuits. We employed electroencephalography (EEG), in a group of persons who stutter, in combination with auditory probes to tap onto the importance of auditory cortical regions in stuttering variability. Participants produced flexible speech (i.e., describing visual scenes) and non-flexible speech (i.e., reading syllables), following an auditory cue. More pronounced P200 auditory evoked potentials were observed in participants with higher dysfluency rates, mainly in the spontaneous speech task. Interestingly, speech therapy intervention led to a reduction of the P200 potential, which was in turn significantly related to fluency improvements. Furthermore, EEG response patterns discriminative of cue frequency (400 or 800 Hz tones) were also predictive of dysfluency scores. Our study highlights the involvement of auditory cortical processing and that of auditory attention in stuttering variability. We support that a higher state of auditory alertness may be implicated in the sensorimotor mechanisms of stuttering, and that speech therapy interventions promoting more self-confident communication can restraint auditory alertness, and potentially reduce speech dysfluencies.

">3D spatial transcriptomics reveals the molecular domain structure of the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                A core organizing principle of the vertebrate brain is its symmetry along multiple axes. However, the structure of these axes, and the precision with which neurons, circuit modules, and brain regions align to them, remain poorly understood. Here, we used 3D spatial transcriptomics to reconstruct the anatomical and molecular organization of the mouse olfactory bulb. We mapped the positions of nearly one thousand molecularly distinct glomeruli, the structural and functional units of odor processing, revealing highly symmetric organization across brain hemispheres. Within each bulb, we defined a curved axis of symmetry that divides pairs of sister glomeruli. Gene expression programs in olfactory sensory neurons predicted glomerular position with near-glomerular resolution. However, glomerular symmetry was disrupted in deeper layer mitral and granule cells, suggesting a reorganization of olfactory bulb output pathways. Our findings provide the first comprehensive map of the molecular domain structure of the olfactory bulb.

">AFD Thermosensory Neurons Mediate Tactile-Dependent Locomotion Modulation in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons drive animal behaviors by detecting environmental stimuli and relaying information to downstream circuits. Beyond their primary roles in sensing, these neurons often form additional synaptic connections outside their main sensory modality, suggesting broader contributions to behavior modulation. Here, we uncover an unexpected role for the thermosensory neuron AFD in coupling tactile experience to locomotion modulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that while AFD employs cGMP signaling for both thermotaxis and tactile-dependent modulation, the specific molecular components of the cGMP pathway differ between these two processes. Interestingly, disrupting the dendritic sensory apparatus of AFD, which is essential for thermotaxis, does not impair tactile-based locomotion modulation, indicating that AFD can mediate tactile-dependent behavior independently of its thermosensory apparatus. In contrast, ablating the AFD neuron eliminates tactile-dependent modulation, pointing to an essential role for AFD itself, rather than its sensory dendritic endings. Further, we find tactile-dependent modulation requires the AIB interneuron, which connects AFD to touch circuits via electrical synapses. Removing innexins expressed in AFD and AIB abolishes this modulation, while re-establishing AFD-AIB connections with engineered electrical synapses restores it. Collectively, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized function of AFD beyond thermosensation, highlighting its influence on context-dependent neuroplasticity and behavioral modulation through broader circuit connectivity.

">Long-term development of a motor memory</a></h4>

              
                Human behavior is developed through continuous adaptation to our environment over a range of timescales. Extensive studies have investigated the mechanisms and computations underlying this process of sensorimotor adaptation using several hundred trials. However, most of our motor skills have had countless hours of practice. Here we study a simple motor adaptation task using thousands of training trials over multiple weeks to study the long-term development of a motor memory, and examine changes in adaptation, retention, inter-limb transfer, decay, spontaneous recovery and generalization. Unlike previous studies, participants showed complete compensation to the novel dynamics, along with long-term increases in retention and spontaneous recovery. Moreover, we find narrowing in the angular generalization, suggesting continual tuning of the motor memory to the task. This demonstrates the extensive changes occurring with longer training of motor tasks, highlighting their importance in studies of sensorimotor control, rehabilitation and training.

">The neuron-intrinsic membrane skeleton is required for motor neuron integrity throughout lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Axons experience physical stress throughout an organism's lifetime, and disruptions in axonal integrity are hallmarks of both neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic injuries. The spectrin-based membrane periodic skeleton (MPS) is proposed to have a crucial role in maintaining axonal strength, flexibility, and resilience. To investigate the importance of the intrinsic MPS for GABAergic motor neuron integrity in C. elegans, we employed the auxin-inducible degron system to degrade {beta}-spectrin/UNC-70 in a cell-type specific and time-dependent manner. Degradation of {beta}-spectrin from all neurons beginning at larval development resulted in widespread axon breakage and regeneration in VD/DD GABAergic motor neurons in both larval and adult animals. Similarly, targeted degradation of {beta}-spectrin in GABA neurons alone resulted in extensive breakage. Moreover, we found that depleting {beta}-spectrin from the mature nervous system also induced axon breaks. By contrast, epidermal {beta}-spectrin was not required for axon integrity of VD/DD neurons. These findings demonstrate the cell-intrinsic importance of neuronal {beta}-spectrin/UNC-70 for axon integrity both during development and in adulthood.

">Demystifying The Myelin g ratio: Its Origin, Derivation and Interpretation</a></h4>

              
                Most studies involving myelin g ratios over the past 120 years assume this metric enumerates changes in myelin thickness (larger g ratio = thinner myelin) with axon or fiber diameter. And, moreover, such changes are directly correlated with internodal function (conduction velocity). However, such assumptions are warranted only in the absence of experimental errors and artifacts (i.e. under theoretical conditions). In reality, g ratios easily under- or overestimate rates of change exceeding 10%, especially for small caliber fibers. Typical analyses of myelin internodes rely on an explicit mathematical model, g ratio=DA/DF, where DA is axon diameter and DF is fiber diameter (myelin plus axon). Shown recently and herein, this model approximates normal physiological conditions only when the axon-fiber diameter relation is directly proportional, whence it is concordant with the axomyelin unit model. However, in transient or non-steady states (development/aging, disease or myelin plasticity) with linear but not directly proportional relations, g ratios poorly describe myelin structure. Acceptance of this counterintuitive assertion is predicated on a detailed understanding of the g ratio - origins, properties and the biology represented - heretofore uncharted. In light of such g ratio limitations, more general and reliable metrics are proposed, the myelin gc ratio and the g` cline.

">A cortical microcircuit model reveals distinct inhibitory mechanisms of network oscillations and stability</a></h4>

              
                We identify a computational mechanism for network oscillations distinct from classic excitatory-inhibitory networks - CAMINOS (Canonical Microcircuit Network Oscillations) - in which different inhibitory-interneuron classes make distinct causal contributions to network oscillations and stability. A computational network model of the canonical microcircuit consisting of SOM, PV and excitatory neurons reproduced key experimental findings, including: stochastic gamma oscillations with drive-dependent frequency; precise phase-locking of PV interneurons and delayed firing of SOM interneurons; and the distinct effects of optogenetic perturbations of SOM and PV cells. In CAMINOS, the generation of network oscillations depends on both the precise spike timing of SOM and PV interneurons, with PV cells regulating oscillation frequency and network stability, and delayed SOM firing controlling the oscillation amplitude. The asymmetric PV-SOM connectivity is found to be the key source ingredient to generate these oscillations, that naturally establishes distinct PV and SOM-cell spike timing. The CAMINOS model predicts that increased SOM/PV densities along the cortical hierarchy leads to decreased oscillation frequencies (from gamma to alpha/beta) and increased seizure susceptibility, suggesting a unified circuit model for oscillations across different frequency bands.

">The aging human brain exhibits reduced cerebrospinal fluid flow during sleep due to both neural and vascular factors</a></h4>

              
                Aging reduces the quality and quantity of sleep, and greater sleep loss over the lifespan is predictive of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. One mechanism by which sleep loss could contribute to impaired brain health is through disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. CSF is the primary waste transport system of the brain, and in young adults, CSF waves are largest during NREM sleep. However, whether sleep-dependent brain fluid physiology changes in aging is not known, due to the technical challenges of performing neuroimaging studies during sleep. We collected simultaneous fast fMRI and EEG data to measure large-scale CSF flow in healthy young and older adults and tested whether there were age-related changes to CSF dynamics during nighttime sleep. We found that sleep-dependent CSF flow was reduced in older adults, and this reduction was linked to impaired frontal EEG delta power and global hemodynamic oscillations during sleep. To identify mechanisms underlying reduced CSF flow, we used sensory and vasoactive stimuli to drive CSF flow in daytime task experiments, and found that both neural and cerebrovascular physiological changes contributed to the disruption of CSF flow during sleep. Finally, we found that this reduction in CSF flow was associated with gray matter atrophy in aging. Together, these results demonstrate that the aging human brain has reduced CSF flow during sleep, and identifies underlying neurovascular mechanisms that contribute to this age-related decline, suggesting targets for future interventions.

                Learning when to initiate or withhold actions is essential for survival and requires integration of past experiences with new information to adapt to changing environments. While stable prelimbic cortex (PL) ensembles have been identified during reward learning, it remains unclear how they adapt when contingencies shift. Does the same ensemble adjust its activity to support behavioral suppression upon reward omission, or is a distinct ensemble recruited for this new learning? We used single-cell calcium imaging to longitudinally track PL neurons in rats across operant food reward Training, Extinction and Reinstatement, trained rat-specific decoders to predict trial-wise behavior, and implemented an in-silico deletion approach to characterize ensemble contributions to behavior. We show that operant training and extinction recruit distinct PL ensembles that encode response execution and inhibition, and that both ensembles are re-engaged and maintain their roles during Reinstatement. These findings highlight ensemble-based encoding of multiple learned associations within a region, with selective ensemble recruitment supporting behavioral flexibility under changing contingencies.

">Surface Expansion Regionalization of the Hippocampus in Early Brain Development</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal formation is implicated in a myriad of crucial functions, particularly centered around memory and emotion, with distinct subdivisions fulfilling specific roles. However, there is no consensus on the spatial organization of these subdivisions, given that the functional connectivity and gene expression-based parcellation along its longitudinal axis differs from the histology-based parcellation along its medial-lateral axis. The dynamic nonuniform surface expansion of the hippocampus during early development reflects the underlying changes of microstructure and functional connectivity, providing important clues on hippocampal subdivisions. Moreover, the thin and convoluted properties bring out the hippocampal maturity largely in the form of expanding surface area. We thus unprecedentedly explore the development-based surface area regionalization and patterns of the hippocampus by leveraging 513 high-quality longitudinal MRI scans during the first two postnatal years. Our findings imply two discrete hippocampal developmental patterns, featuring one pattern of subdivisions along the anterior-posterior axis (head, regions 1 and 5; body, regions 2, 4, 6, and 7; tail, region 3) and the other one along the medial-lateral axis (subiculum, regions 4, 5, and 6; CA fields, regions 1, 2, and 7). Most of the resulting 7 subdivisions exhibit region-specific and nonlinear spatiotemporal surface area expansion patterns with an initial high growth, followed by a transition to low increase. Each subregion displays bilaterally symmetric pattern. The medial portion of the hippocampal head experiences the most rapid surface area expansion. These results provide important references for exploring the fine-grained organization and development of the hippocampus and its intricate cognitions.

The study provides neurophysiological evidence for the influence of knowledge adaptiveness on shaping predictive coding, revealing that these are intricately linked and predominantly manifest at the abstract and motor coding levels. These findings challenge the traditional view of a competitive relationship between learning context and knowledge, suggesting instead a hierarchical integration where their properties are processed simultaneously. This integration facilitates the adaptive reuse of existing knowledge in the face of new learning. By shedding light on the mechanisms of predictive coding in visuomotor sequences, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of how the brain navigates and adapts to environmental changes, offering insights into the foundational processes that underlie learning and adaptation in dynamic contexts.</span>

	<p>Background: Healthy cognitive functioning is a primary component of well-being, independence, and successful aging. Cognitive deficits can arise from various conditions, such as brain injury, mental illness, and neurological disorders. Rehabilitation is a highly specialized service limited to patients who have access to institutional settings. In response to this unmet need, telehealth solutions are ideal for triggering the migration of care from clinics to patients&amp;amp;rsquo; homes. Objectives: The aim of EARLY-COGN^3 will be threefold: (1) to test the efficacy of a digital health at-home intervention (tele@cognitive protocol) as compared to an unstructured cognitive at-home rehabilitation in a cohort of patients with Chronic Neurological Diseases (CNDs); (2) to investigate its effects on the biomolecular and neurophysiological marker hypothesizing that people with CNDs enrolled in this telerehabilitation program will develop changes in biological markers and cortical and subcortical patterns of connectivity; (3) to analyze potential cognitive, neurobiological, and neurophysiological predictors of response to the tele@cognitive treatment. Method: In this single-blind, randomized, and controlled pilot study, we will assess the short- and long-term efficacy of cognitive telerehabilitation protocol (tele@cognitive) as compared to an unstructured cognitive at-home rehabilitation (Active Control Group&amp;amp;mdash;ACG) in a cohort of 60 people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Subjective Cognitive Complaints (SCCs), or Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD). All participants will undergo a clinical, functional, neurocognitive, and quality of life assessment at the baseline (T0), post-treatment (5 weeks, T1), and at the 3-month (T2) follow-up. Neurophysiological markers and biomolecular data will be collected at T0 and T1. Conclusions: EARLY-COGN^3 project could lead to a complete paradigm shift from the traditional therapeutic approach, forcing a reassessment on how CNDs could take advantage of a digital solution.

	<p>Background: Major depressive disorder is a common mental health issue characterized by persistently low mood and high morbidity and mortality. The major pathophysiology is neuroinflammation, as evidenced by elevated cytokine levels. Patients often fail to achieve full remission with the use of currently available antidepressants, prompting the search for new treatment options. Schaftoside (SS), a flavonoid found in traditional Chinese herbs, has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its antidepressant effects are poorly understood. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment to induce depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. SS was administered at 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg for 28 days. The effect on depression-like behaviors was assessed using behavioral assays, and ELISA was used to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and hippocampus. Results: SS significantly decreased immobility in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, increased sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test, and reduced feeding latency in the novelty-suppressed feeding test. These findings indicate improved depression and anxiety-like behaviors. ELISA showed that SS lowered interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the serum and hippocampus of CUMS mice. Conclusions: Our study indicates that SS has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, possibly through neuroinflammatory processes, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for depression, and thus deserves further investigation into its mechanisms and clinical efficacy.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive decline and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pose a major challenge for the ageing population; with impaired synaptic plasticity playing a central role in their pathophysiology. This article explores the hypothesis that cortico&amp;amp;ndash;cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, can restore synaptic function by targeting impaired spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a key mechanism disrupted in AD. Methods: We reviewed existing studies investigating the effects of ccPAS on neuroplasticity in both ageing and AD populations. Results: Findings suggest age-specific effects, with ccPAS improving motor performance in young adults but showing limited efficacy in older adults, likely due to age-related declines in synaptic plasticity and cortical excitability. In AD, ccPAS studies reveal significant impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity, while long-term depression (LTD)-like mechanisms appear relatively preserved, emphasising the need for targeted neuromodulation approaches. Conclusions: Despite promising preliminary results, evidence remains limited and largely focused on motor function, with the impact of ccPAS on cognitive domains still underexplored. To bridge this gap, future research should focus on larger and more diverse cohorts to optimise ccPAS protocols for ageing and AD populations and investigate its potential for enhancing cognitive function. By refining stimulation parameters and integrating neuroimageing-based personalisation strategies, ccPAS may represent a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating neuroplasticity deficits in ageing and neurodegenerative conditions</p>

	<p>Background: Blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI) can result in depression-like behaviors in the acute and chronic phases. SSRIs have been shown to significantly alleviate depression-like behaviors in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by increasing serotonin (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. However, the therapeutic effects of SSRIs on depression caused by bTBI remain unclear. Objective: Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the therapeutic effects of SSRIs on depression-like behaviors in bTBI models. Methods: We created a rat model to study mild TBI by subjecting rats to increased blast overpressures (BOP) and injecting fluoxetine and escitalopram SSRIs intraperitoneally for 28 days. Results: On day 14 post-BOP exposure, rats treated with SSRIs showed decreased depression-like behaviors. This finding was accompanied by higher 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and increased numbers of Nestin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, rats treated with SSRIs exhibited increased pCREB and BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus on days 7, 14, and 28 after bTBI. Conclusions: Overall, our findings indicate that SSRI-induced recovery from depression-like behaviors after mild bTBI is associated with the upregulation of 5-HT levels, pCREB and BDNF expression, and neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</p>

                Liu et al. report that GPNMB expression in microglia is commonly induced by multiple types of pathological factors functionally participating in phagocytosis of pathological particles via interaction with ATP6V1A and anti-inflammation responses. GPNMB depletion does not influence the severity of acute seizures but exacerbates the development of chronic epileptogenesis.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Suicides among U.S. military veterans are alarmingly high, driven by factors such as mental health issues, combat exposure, and history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)/concussion. This study aims to examine the relationship between concussion history, combat experience, and their effects on mental health issues and suicide ideation among military veterans. Additionally, this study investigates the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on these variables. Methods: A total of 78 veterans (62 males, 16 females) participated in this study. Participants completed a demographic survey and the Global Well-being Index (GWI) to assess concussion history and residual symptoms. A licensed social worker interviewed the veterans using the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder survey (7 Items) (GAD-7) for anxiety, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) for suicide ideation. A 2 &amp;amp;times; 2 cross-tabulation analysis examined the relationships between concussion history, combat experience, and outcomes of anxiety, depression, and suicide ideation. PTSD was also assessed as both a predictor and an outcome. Statistical analyses yielded odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), Chi-square, and Cramer&amp;amp;rsquo;s V (V) correlations along with associated p-values. Results: The combination of concussion history and combat experience strongly predicted either anxiety, depression, or suicide ideation (OR = 7.97, 95% CI: 1.70, 37.44; V = 0.334, (p = 0.003)), more than either factor alone. Combat experience was the strongest predictor of PTSD (OR = 11.12, 95% CI: 3.30, 37.47; V = 0.485, p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), both individually and when combined with concussion history. PTSD strongly influenced mental health issues and suicide ideation (OR = 8.16, 95% CI: 1.74, 38.25; V = 0.339, p = 0.003). Stratification by PTSD status (positive or negative) affected the relationships between independent and dependent variables. Small cell counts resulted in a wide 95% CI for some ORs, though some statistically significant Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s Exact Test results were observed. Credibility analysis using the critical prior interval (CPI) metric confirmed the intrinsic credibility of the results. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the relationships between concussion history, combat experience, and their impacts on mental health issues and suicide ideation among military veterans.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental fatigue can impair sport, exercise and cognitive performance. Warmup activities can improve performance when the individual is rested. However, their effectiveness when individual is fatigued has yet to be established. The research objectives were to evaluate the effects of physical and combined physical plus cognitive warmup activities on subsequent sport, exercise, and cognitive performance when rested and fatigued by sleep restriction in athletes (Study 1) and older adults (Study 2). Methods: In Study 1, 31 padel players completed a padel performance test and Stroop task after physical and combined warmups when rested and fatigued by sleep deprivation. In Study 2, 32 older adults completed sit&amp;amp;ndash;stand, arm curl, walking, Stroop, and psychomotor vigilance tests after no warmup, physical warmup, and combined warmup when rested and fatigued by sleep deprivation. In both studies, combined warmups intermixed short-, medium-, or long-duration cognitive tasks between physical warmup activities. Mental fatigue was measured using visual analog scale ratings. Results: In both studies, sleep deprivation increased mental fatigue and impaired performance. In Study 1, relative to a physical warmup, padel and Stroop performance were improved by combined warmups (with short-to-medium cognitive tasks) when rested and fatigued. In Study 2, relative to no warmup, sit&amp;amp;ndash;stand, arm curl, walking, Stroop, and reaction time performance were improved by physical and combined warmups (with short-to-medium cognitive tasks) when rested and fatigued. Conclusions: The negative effects of sleep deprivation on sport, exercise, and cognitive performance were best mitigated by combined warmups with short-to-medium cognitive tasks. Combined warmups are effective countermeasures against the deleterious effects of mental fatigue on performance.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Interest in diversity is growing worldwide. Today, an understanding and social acceptance of diverse people is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s gray matter volume (GMV), which is thought to reflect brain health, and their understanding of diversity (gender, sexuality (LGBTQ), and origin). Methods: GMV was determined as the value of the Gray Matter Brain Healthcare Quotient (GM-BHQ) based on MRI image analysis. Meanwhile, participants&amp;amp;rsquo; understanding and acceptance of diversity was calculated based on their answers to the psychological questions included in the World Values Survey Wave 7 (WVS7). Results: Our analysis indicated that, in the group of participants with the highest understanding of diversity (PHUD. n = 11), not only the GMV at the whole brain level (t = 2.587, p = 0.027, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.780) but also the GMV of the central executive network (CEN: t = 2.700, p= 0.022, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.814) and saliency network (SN: t = 3.100, p = 0.011, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.935) were shown to be significantly higher than the theoretical value estimated from sex, age, and BMI at the 5% level. In addition, the GMV of the default mode network (DMN: t = 2.063, p = 0.066, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.622) was also higher than the theoretical value at the 10% level. Meanwhile, in the group of others (n = 10), there was no significant difference from the theoretical value. These differences between PHUD and others were also observed when comparing the two with and without controlling for educational and occupational covariates at the 5% or 10% levels. Conclusions: These results suggest that understanding diversity requires a healthy brain, centered on three networks that govern rational judgment, emotion regulation, other-awareness, self-awareness, and the valuing of actions. This is the first study to show that brain structure is related to an understanding and acceptance of the diversity of people.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease characterized by joint swelling, pain, damage to the cartilage, and disability. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory properties of Quantum Health Accelerator&amp;amp;reg; as water enriched with vital bio-quantum information/energy (EW) following complete Freund&amp;amp;rsquo;s adjuvant (CFA)-induced RA in rats. Methods: Forty adult male Wistar rats (180&amp;amp;ndash;220 g) were divided into five groups. Arthritis was induced on day one using a single subcutaneous injection of CFA into the left hind footpad of the rat. Rats were assigned to receive methotrexate (MTX, 2 mg/kg/week, intraperitoneally), EW (orally, instead of normal water ad libitum), or their combination for 29 days. The anti-RA activities were determined by paw edema, joint diameter, arthritis score, and several nociceptive behavioral tests (thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, and tactile allodynia). The levels of inflammatory (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, CRP, RF, and anti-CCP), anti-inflammatory (IL-10), and oxidative stress (NO, MDA, and GSH) markers were measured in serum. In addition, the levels of IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;, IL-4, IL-17, and TGF-&amp;amp;beta; were assessed in the spleen-isolated lymphocytes. Results: We found that treatment with MTX, EW, and their combination remarkably ameliorated thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, and tactile allodynia results following CFA-induced RA in rats. In addition, EW also notably attenuated arthritis score, joint diameter, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative markers while propagating anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative mediators. Conclusions: We reveal that EW possesses anti-arthritic effects, possibly through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Collectively, EW may be a promising therapeutic agent for treating RA.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accurate personalized survival prediction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is essential for effective patient care planning. This study investigates whether grey and white matter changes measured by magnetic resonance imaging can improve individual survival predictions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from 178 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 166 healthy controls in the Canadian Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Neuroimaging Consortium study. A voxel-wise linear mixed-effects model assessed disease-related and survival-related atrophy detected through deformation-based morphometry, controlling for age, sex, and scanner variations. Additional linear mixed-effects models explored associations between regional imaging and clinical measurements, and their associations with time to the composite outcome of death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation. We evaluated whether incorporating imaging features alongside clinical data could improve the performance of an individual survival distribution model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Deformation-based morphometry uncovered distinct voxel-wise atrophy patterns linked to disease progression and survival, with many of these regional atrophies significantly associated with clinical manifestations of the disease. By integrating regional imaging features with clinical data, we observed a substantial enhancement in the performance of survival models across key metrics. Our analysis identified specific brain regions, such as the corpus callosum, rostral middle frontal gyrus, and thalamus, where atrophy predicted an increased risk of mortality.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that brain atrophy patterns measured by deformation-based morphometry provide valuable insights beyond clinical assessments for prognosis. It offers a more comprehensive approach to prognosis and highlights brain regions involved in disease progression and survival, potentially leading to a better understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

	<p>Background and objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether perceptual sensitivity to tactile stimulus is affected by awareness of who controls the stimulus intensity. Methods: Thirteen healthy participants took part in this study. A participant held a dial and an experimenter held the other dial. One dial was to control the intensity of the tactile stimulus while the other (dummy dial) was inactive. The intensity of the tactile stimulus to the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s index finger providing each 1 s was increased by the participant or by someone else with or without the participants viewing a dial controlling the stimulus intensity. Results and conclusions: The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold, when controlled by the participant, was significantly lower compared to when controlled by someone else, regardless of visual availability. This indicates that awareness of the self-control of the tactile stimulus intensity enhances tactile sensitivity. The electrodermal level immediately preceding the stimulus at the perceptual threshold was significantly lower when the participant controlled the stimulus intensity compared to when it was controlled by someone else, with eyes closed. The electrodermal levels immediately before the perceptual threshold stimulus, when triggered by another person, were significantly higher with the eyes closed. These electrodermal findings suggest that cognitive stress is greater when the timing of the initial tactile perception is difficult to predict.</p>

	<p>Recent studies applying machine learning (ML) to saccade and vergence eye movements have demonstrated the ability to distinguish individuals with dyslexia, learning disorders, or attention disorders from healthy individuals or those with other pathologies. Stroke patients are known to exhibit visual deficits and eye movement disorders. This study focused on saccade and vergence measurements using REMOBI technology V3 and the Pupil Core eye tracker. Eye movement data were automatically analyzed with the AIDEAL V3 (Artificial Intelligence Eye Movement Analysis) cloud software developed by Orasis-Ear. This software computes multiple parameters for each type of eye movement, including the latency, accuracy, velocity, duration, and disconjugacy. Three ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest) were applied to the saccade and vergence eye movement features provided by AIDEAL to identify stroke patients from other groups: a population of children with learning disorders and a population with a broader spectrum of dysfunctions or pathologies (including children and adults). The different classifiers achieved macro F1 scores of up to 75.9% in identifying stroke patients based on the saccade and vergence parameters. An additional ML analysis using age-matched groups of stroke patients and adults or seniors reduced the influence of large age differences. This analysis resulted in even higher F1 scores across all three ML models, as the comparison group predominantly included healthy individuals, including some with presbycusis. In conclusion, ML applied to saccade and vergence eye movement parameters, as measured by the REMOBI and AIDEAL technology, is a sensitive method for the detection of stroke-related sequelae. This approach could be further developed as a clinical tool to evaluate recovery, compensation, and the evolution of neurological deficits in stroke patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between risk-taking behaviors, vestibular symptoms/impairment and perception&amp;amp;ndash;action coupling behavior in recently concussed adolescents. Methods: This study utilized a cross-sectional design to evaluate the early effects of concussion on 12&amp;amp;ndash;18-year-old adolescents (n = 47) recruited from a concussion specialty clinic at their presenting clinical appointment. The Perception&amp;amp;ndash;Action Coupling Task (PACT) was used to assess action boundary perception by evaluating the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to quickly and accurately determine whether a virtual &amp;amp;ldquo;ball&amp;amp;rdquo; fits in a virtual &amp;amp;ldquo;hole&amp;amp;rdquo;. Accuracy, response time and inverse efficiency were evaluated at the 0.8 and 1.2 ratios of ball&amp;amp;ndash;hole pairings, where 0.8 indicates the ball was slightly smaller than the hole and 1.2 indicates the ball was slightly larger than the hole. The Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) is a computerized test which measures risk-taking behavior by &amp;amp;ldquo;pumping&amp;amp;rdquo; up a balloon. Each pump provides a small amount of virtual money into their bank; the goal is to make as much money as possible without popping the virtual balloon. The Vestibular Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) tool is a brief screening tool designed to identify ocular or vestibular dysfunction following sport-related concussion, where horizontal/vertical vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) and visual motion sensitivity (VMS) are the primary vestibular outcomes. Pearson correlation matrices were developed to evaluate the association between BART, VOMS and PACT outcomes within the study cohort of concussed adolescents. Results: PACT inverse efficiency at the 1.2 ball&amp;amp;ndash;hole ratio was significantly correlated with all three VOMS outcomes (r = 0.33&amp;amp;ndash;0.37). The standard deviation of pump reaction time during BART was significantly correlated with accuracy (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.47) and inverse efficiency (r = 0.42) at the 1.2 ratio. The standard deviation of the total number of pumps during BART was significantly correlated with PACT response time at the 1.2 ratio (r = 0.34). Horizontal VOR correlated with balloons collected (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.30) and balloons popped (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.30). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that risk-taking behaviors and vestibular symptoms/impairment are associated with worse action boundary perception in adolescents following concussion. This relationship is more pronounced in male adolescents than females.</p>

	<p>Background: Embodied cognition is an emerging concept in cognitive science that emphasizes the integral role of perception, action, and bodily experience in shaping human thought and understanding. Recently, a new instrument has been developed called the Automated Test of Embodied Cognition (ATEC), which provides a comprehensive measure of eight domains of embodied cognition. Method: An embodied cognition in an alcohol use disorder (AUD) sample (N = 49) was assessed using ATEC, which employs cognitively demanding physical tasks, like an exercise video, to measure executive functions (EFs), memory, and other cognitive processes &amp;amp;ldquo;in action&amp;amp;rdquo;. Results: Embodied delayed recall was the most frequent impairment (84%), and EF impairments were also common. Among the EF domains, self-regulation was the most frequently impaired at 43%. Using the ATEC total score, 43% of the sample were rated as having a mild or greater level of overall impairment. Strong support for concurrent validity was found for ATEC EF and memory domains when correlated with neurocognitive assessments conceptually related to them. Significant categorical agreement (impaired/not impaired) was also found between neurocognitive testing and ATEC total score. Using the ATEC total score, younger age, higher education, and better premorbid IQ were found to be potential protective factors against cognitive decline. Conclusions: Findings support ATEC&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential for future studies related to AUD and other disorders that may lead to cognitive decline. Embodied cognition may provide new insights into how AUD affects cognition and functioning and be useful to determine what interventions may improve recovery.</p>

Development and association with symptoms of depression and anxiety. [version 1; peer review: awaiting </a></h4>

              
                Background There is a need to go beyond mere measures of time used on social media. Existing tools inadequately capture the multidimensional nature of social media use, leaving a gap for concise yet comprehensive assessment tools. Aims This study aimed to develop a short questionnaire addressing three critical dimensions of social media use: self-presentation, negative experiences, and problematic use. The association between these dimensions and symptoms of anxiety and depression was also investigated. Methods This study uses two independent datasets of adolescents aged 16+ years in Norway. Using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) analyses, a pool of 31 social media items was analyzed to investigate factor structure and associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression. For model development, the “LifeOnSoMe”-study was employed (>3,500 participants), and data from a pilot study (~500 participants) was used for external validation. Results Based on ACO-analyses, a 20-item six-factor model was identified, encompassing social comparison and self-presentation (five items), and three items for each of the following domains: negative experiences (Negative acts and Unwanted attention from others) and problematic use (Subjective overuse, Social obligations, and Source of concern). Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated very good to excellent fit in both datasets, and consistent associations between the six different domains and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Discussion The suggested 20-item questionnaire provides a robust and succinct tool for evaluating social media’s impact on mental health, offering substantial explanatory power for variance in anxiety and depression symptoms. This can serve as meaningful tool for assessing the potential impact of social media use for mental health and related outcomes.

                A growing amount of research is shedding light on nutrient-rich foods and nutritional supplements’ potential health and disease-preventative advantages. Black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), an esteemed nutraceutical herb, is well-known for its multiple health advantages among health-conscious individuals, researchers, and pharmaceutical businesses. Black cumin and its principal bioactive ingredient, thymoquinone (TQ), have been found to lower oxidative stress and inflammation, while also enhancing immunological function, cellular viability, and energy metabolism. They protect against metabolic, cardiovascular, digestive, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, reproductive, and neurological diseases, as well as cancer. Black cumin works as a countermeasure to minimize the toxicity and side effects of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the possible effects of black cumin on prostate health and disorders like benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are not well understood. This narrative review seeks to reveal knowledge gaps. This study intends to guide future research into the possible uses of black cumin and TQ in prostate health and illness.

Background <p>Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis, adding to strain on healthcare systems. Diagnostic test reporting of norovirus is often delayed, resulting in incomplete data for real-time surveillance.</p> Methods <p>To nowcast the real-time case burden of norovirus a generalised additive model (GAM), semi-mechanistic Bayesian joint process and delay model “epinowcast”, and Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model including syndromic surveillance data were developed. These models were evaluated over weekly nowcasts using a probabilistic scoring framework.</p> Results <p>Using the weighted interval score (WIS) we show a heuristic approach is outperformed by models harnessing time delay corrections, with daily mean WIS = 7.73, 3.03, 2.29 for the baseline, “epinowcast”, and GAM, respectively. Forecasting approaches were reliable in the event of temporally changing reporting values, with WIS = 4.57 for the BSTS model. However, the syndromic surveillance (111 online pathways) did not improve the BSTS model, WIS = 10.28, potentially indicating poor correspondence between surveillance indicators.</p> Interpretation <p>Analysis of surveillance data enhanced by nowcasting delayed reporting improves understanding over simple model assumptions, important for real-time decision making. The modelling approach needs to be informed by the patterns of the reporting delay and can have large impacts on operational performance and insights produced.</p>

Motivated by the spatiotemporal waves of MAPK/ERK activity, crucial for long-range communication in regenerating tissues, we investigated stochastic homoclinic fronts propagating through channels formed by directly interacting cells. We evaluated the efficiency of long-range communication in these channels by examining the rate of information transmission. Our study identified the stochastic phenomena that reduce this rate: front propagation failure, new front spawning, and variability in the front velocity. We found that a trade-off between the frequencies of propagation failures and new front spawning determines the optimal channel width (which geometrically determines the front length). The optimal frequency of initiating new waves is determined by a trade-off between the input information rate (higher with more frequent initiation) and the fidelity of information transmission (lower with more frequent initiation). Our analysis provides insight into the relative timescales of intra- and intercellular processes necessary for successful wave propagation.

Cell stress adaptation plays a key role in normal development and in various diseases including cancer. Caspases are activated in response to cell stress, and growing evidence supports their function in non-apoptotic cellular processes. A role for effector caspases in promoting stress-induced cytoprotective autophagy was demonstrated in <i>Drosophila</i>, but has not been explored in the context of human cells. We found a functionally conserved role for effector caspase 3 (CASP3) and caspase 7 (CASP7) in promoting starvation or proteasome inhibition-induced cytoprotective autophagy in human breast cancer cells. The loss of CASP3 and CASP7 resulted in an increase in PARP1 cleavage, reduction in LC3B and ATG7 transcript levels, and a reduction in H2AX phosphorylation, consistent with a block in autophagy and DNA damage-induced stress response pathways. Surprisingly, in non-lethal cell stress conditions, CASP7 underwent non-canonical processing at two calpain cleavage sites flanking a PARP1 exosite, resulting in stable CASP7-p29/p30 fragments. Expression of CASP7-p29/p30 fragment(s) could rescue H2AX phosphorylation in the CASP3 and CASP7 double knockout background. Strikingly, yet consistent with these phenotypes, the loss of CASP3 and CASP7 exhibited synthetic lethality with BRCA1 loss. These findings support a role for human caspases in stress adaptation through PARP1 modulation and reveal new therapeutic avenues for investigation.

                <p>by Oluwamuyiwa T. Amusan, Shuqi Wang, Chaoran Yin, Heather S. Koehler, Yixun Li, Tencho Tenev, Rebecca Wilson, Benjamin Bellenie, Ting Zhang, Jian Wang, Chang Liu, Kim Seong, Seyedeh L. Poorbaghi, Joseph Yates, Yuchen Shen, Jason W. Upton, Pascal Meier, Siddharth Balachandran, Hongyan Guo</p>

Necroptosis initiated by the host sensor Z-NA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is essential for host defense against a growing number of viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Studies with HSV-1 and other necroptogenic stimuli in murine settings have suggested that ZBP1 triggers necroptosis by directly complexing with the kinase RIPK3. Whether this is also the case in human cells, or whether additional co-factors are needed for ZBP1-mediated necroptosis, is unclear. Here, we show that ZBP1-induced necroptosis in human cells requires RIPK1. We have found that RIPK1 is essential for forming a stable and functional ZBP1-RIPK3 complex in human cells, but is dispensable for the formation of the equivalent murine complex. The receptor-interacting protein (RIP) homology interaction motif (RHIM) in RIPK3 is responsible for this difference between the 2 species, because replacing the RHIM in human RIPK3 with the RHIM from murine RIPK3 is sufficient to overcome the requirement for RIPK1 in human cells. These observations describe a critical mechanistic difference between mice and humans in how ZBP1 engages in necroptosis, with important implications for treating human diseases.

                Background The study examines the impact of mobile phones on the socioeconomic development of rural women in Peru, using data from the National Household Survey from 2016 to 2022. Previous studies have highlighted the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in empowering rural women and reducing the digital gender gap. Method A quantitative approach and a correlational design were applied. The Mincer equation adjusted with the Heckman method was used to estimate the effect of mobile phone use on the income of rural women, considering socioeconomic and demographic variables. The sample included between 1,436 and 1,568 rural Peruvian women per year. Results The results indicate a positive correlation between owning a personal mobile phone and the income of rural women in the period 2016-2019. In 2018, owning a mobile phone was associated with a 39.3% increase in income levels. In 2022, this effect was 49.9%. Conclusions It is concluded that the income of rural women in Peru is positively linked to the possession of a mobile phone, but also depends on factors such as years of education, work experience, marital status, household headship, and labor market participation. The findings support the implementation of public policies to reduce the digital gender gap and promote sustainable development.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Investigate the immune system's role in cluster headache by analyzing cytokines in people with cluster headache and headache-free controls, and explore if certain cytokines could predict a specific phenotype.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured 45 cytokines in adult participants from the Danish Cluster Headache Biobank in a prospective case–control setup. People with cluster headache were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders third-edition. Controls were matched for age and sex.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 412 were analyzed deriving from 99 with chronic cluster headache, 108 with episodic cluster headache (ECH) in bout, 105 with ECH in remission, and 100 successfully matched controls. Compared with controls, 13 cytokines were altered for ECH in bout (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), 3 in remission (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and 10 for chronic cluster headache (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Oncostatin m was significantly elevated in all 3 disease states compared with controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Overall, the investigated cytokines showed distinct patterns of alterations between chronic cluster headache and episodic cluster headache in bout and, interestingly, IL-1β was significantly associated with having chronic cluster headache rather than episodic in bout in a logistic regression model adjusting for potential confounders (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Findings show that the immune system is altered in all 3 states of cluster headache compared with controls. Oncostatin m was elevated, constituting a promising target for future studies. The distinct alterations between episodic and chronic cluster headache are striking and urges further research of the immune system in cluster headache to better understand its potential role in prediction of disease activity and treatment response.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in <i>KCNT1</i> encoding for potassium channels are associated with different epilepsy phenotypes, including epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), other early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and focal epilepsy. Fluoxetine blocks currents from both wild-type (WT) and mutant KCNT1 channels with GoF in vitro features. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with fluoxetine might improve clinical outcome in patients with EIMFS carrying GoF variants in KCNT1 channels showing in vitro sensitivity to fluoxetine blockade.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled three pediatric patients carring de novo KCNT1 genetic variants linked to EIMFS. Functional and pharmacological studies to assess fluoxetine's ability to counteract in vitro variant-induced functional effects were performed with patch-clamp electrophysiology on heterologous channel expression in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. Neuropsychological assessment, electroencephalogram and seizure diary were evaluated at baseline and every 3 months during the study. Electrocardiography and blood levels of medications were monitored for safety.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All 3 <i>KCNT1</i> variants displayed GoF effects in vitro. Exposure to fluoxetine (10μM) blocked both WT and mutant KCNT1 channels, therefore, counteracting variant-induced functional effects. Treatment with fluoxetine caused a variable reduction of seizure frequency (25–75%). Improvement in visual attention, participation, and muscle tone was also reported. No adverse events were reported except for transient dyskinesia in 1 patient, which was probably related to an increase in fluoxetine plasma level.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fluoxetine may be a potential targeted medication in EIMFS caused by <i>KCNT1</i> GoF variants. Further research is needed to assess its long-term efficacy and safety. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) metrics, a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep physiological rhythm, among recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and individuals at high and low risk for developing PD based on genetic and prodromal risk.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cross-sectional exploratory study, participants underwent clinical, cognitive, and motor evaluation to compute risk based on the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) prodromal criteria and a standard overnight polysomnography. CAP rate, CAP index, A index subtypes, number of CAP sequences, and CAP sequence duration were computed from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 30 patients with early PD (mean age = 62.80 ± 7.69, disease duration = 1.10 ± 1.09), 26 participants at risk for PD (age = 64.88 ± 10.09), and 36 participants with low risk for PD (age = 56.83 ± 7.41). Despite comparable macrosleep architecture, most CAP measures were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with the low-risk group, whereas the at-risk group showed transitional values between PD and the low-risk group. The A2 index was significantly lower in both the at-risk and PD groups from the low-risk group (at risk = 7.59 ± 4.59; PD = 7.71 ± 5.83; and low risk = 12.85 ± 8.63; <i>p</i> = 0.010). Lower CAP rate and lower CAP index were associated with greater disease severity (<i>r</i> = −0.23 and − 0.24, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with early clinical PD exhibit alterations in CAP dynamics despite having comparable macrosleep architecture. Alterations of the NREM microsleep structure may occur early in the neurodegenerative process and the A2 index may be an early event in the evolution of the disease with the potential to serve as an early marker for disease progression.

                Background According to “Data Bridge Market Research”, tiny houses are increasingly popular, encouraging people globally to downsize and minimize their ecological footprint. Egypt ranks as one of the nations listed in the worldwide tiny house industry, with a notable increase in interest from 2022 to 2029. This can be developed using sustainable, energy-efficient materials that enhance insulation and thermal comfort, making them an affordable and environmentally friendly option. The study aims to demonstrate how applying insulation to walls and roofs can facilitate a transition from unsustainable lifestyles to more sustainable, economical living, ultimately benefiting both individuals and the environment. Methods This study focuses on the concept of tiny housing, environmental sustainability, and guidelines that are applicable during any step of the design procedure. Four thermal insulation materials will be assessed with a passive design approach on a 40 square metre tiny house, with the help of “Design Builder” software, applied to the walls and roof to discover which material possesses the greatest energy efficiency while lowering the energy consumptions. Results Results showed that the base case scenario achieved 30.96% of the total hours feeling discomfort, and after applying the four insulative materials on a 40 square meters tiny housing, the cellulose insulation has proved to be the most effective one among the others in Faiyum, Egypt, experiencing 24.49% of the total hours being discomfort, with 20.92% highest reduction. PPD% has been examined as well for all four scenarios, proving that the cellulose insulation with a 52.36 PPD% showed a 12.28 PPD% reduction. Conclusion Given Egypt’s financial challenges, architects must prioritize thermal considerations and insulative materials in construction. This study evaluates thermal performance between a no-insulation case and four scenarios using common insulative materials to enhance thermal comfort in Fayium housing, Egypt.

                Robot-assisted therapy is a promising approach to enhance stroke rehabilitation, particularly in improving upper-limb function through intensive and repetitive training. Successful integration of technology into clinical practice relies on therapists’ acceptance and endorsement. Our purpose is to share the perspectives of the occupational therapists who facilitate robot-assisted therapy and the benefits and challenges of practical implementation of the robot. Clinicians who worked with stroke survivors to research the usability, feasibility, and efficacy of the Harmony exoskeleton discuss their impressions of the technology on stroke rehabilitation. Overall, therapists expressed positive views on the therapeutic and adjunctive use of robot-assisted technology, emphasizing patient engagement, objective evaluations of progress, and ease of certain aspects of their role. Additional feedback highlighted the Harmony exoskeleton’s ability to promote neuromuscular re-education and foster neuroplasticity. Barriers to implementation include physical capabilities, patient suitability, technical difficulties, and the need for advanced quantitative feedback and data analysis. To maximize the impact of robot-assisted therapy in stroke rehabilitation, ongoing research and development are necessary to address identified challenges. Improved limb support, quantitative feedback, equipment reliability, and more levels of weight support for patients with higher levels of function may improve therapist acceptance of this device and may inform exoskeleton development.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70000?af=R">Are Wayfinding Abilities Correlated With Specific Brain Anatomy? An Investigation on Regular Car Drivers Using a Navigational Map in an Unknown Environment</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability to navigate spatially in the physical world is a fundamental cognitive skill. This study examines the anatomical correlates of map-assisted wayfinding in an unfamiliar virtual environment using structural magnetic resonance magining (MRI). Thirty-three participants were required to reach up to seven different locations represented on a navigational map in a simulated environment, while their gazing behavior was recorded, and, in close temporal proximity, the anatomical MRI of their brain was acquired. Significant predictors of wayfinding performance were the volumes of the right hippocampus, left retrosplenial cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex—left inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, and right cerebellar lobule VIIB. Detailed analyses revealed a dissociation between two clusters of gray matter density in the right hippocampus. Compared with the poorest wayfinders, the best wayfinders exhibited more gray matter density in a cluster located in the right posterior hippocampus but less gray matter density in a cluster located in the anterior section of the hippocampus. In addition, top performers spent more time gazing at the map, highlighting the benefit of using external aids during navigation tasks. Altogether, these results underscore how structural adaptations are associated with spatial navigation performance.</p>
