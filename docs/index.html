                Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a G-coupled protein receptor that induces crucial biological processes when bound by sphingosine 1-phosphate. Here, we have characterized nine S1PR1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13628">Language modulates vision: Evidence from neural networks and human brain-lesion models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.13628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing information structures in between deep neural networks (DNNs) and the human brain has become a key method for exploring their similarities and differences. Recent research has shown better alignment of vision-language DNN models, such as CLIP, with the activity of the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) than earlier vision models, supporting the idea that language modulates human visual perception. However, interpreting the results from such comparisons is inherently limited due to the "black box" nature of DNNs. To address this, we combined model-brain fitness analyses with human brain lesion data to examine how disrupting the communication pathway between the visual and language systems causally affects the ability of vision-language DNNs to explain the activity of the VOTC. Across four diverse datasets, CLIP consistently outperformed both label-supervised (ResNet) and unsupervised (MoCo) models in predicting VOTC activity. This advantage was left-lateralized, aligning with the human language network. Analyses of the data of 33 stroke patients revealed that reduced white matter integrity between the VOTC and the language region in the left angular gyrus was correlated with decreased CLIP performance and increased MoCo performance, indicating a dynamic influence of language processing on the activity of the VOTC. These findings support the integration of language modulation in neurocognitive models of human vision, reinforcing concepts from vision-language DNN models. The sensitivity of model-brain similarity to specific brain lesions demonstrates that leveraging manipulation of the human brain is a promising framework for evaluating and developing brain-like computer models.

                arXiv:2501.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons primarily communicate through the emission of action potentials, or spikes. To generate a spike, a neuron's membrane potential must cross a defined threshold. Does this spiking mechanism inherently prevent neurons from transmitting their subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations to other neurons? We prove that, in theory, it does not. The subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations of a presynaptic population of spiking neurons can be perfectly transmitted to a downstream population of neurons. Mathematically, this surprising result is an example of concentration phenomenon in high dimensions.

                arXiv:2409.17096v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider self-organization and memory formation in a mesoscopic model of an amorphous solid subject to a random shear strain protocol confined to a strain range $\pm \varepsilon_{\rm max}$. We develop proper read-out protocols to show that the response of the driven system retains a memory of the strain range, which can be subsequently retrieved. Our findings generalize previous results obtained upon oscillatory driving and suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a disordered system interacting with its fluctuating environment. The self-organization results in a correlation between the dynamics of the system and its environment. We conclude by discussing our results within the context of environmental sensing, highlighting their generalizability to adaptation strategies of simple organisms under changing conditions.

                arXiv:2405.07295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) refers to an agent's capability to learn from a continuous stream of data and transfer knowledge without forgetting old information. One crucial aspect of CL is forward transfer, i.e., improved and faster learning on a new task by leveraging information from prior knowledge. While this ability comes naturally to biological brains, it poses a significant challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we suggest that environmental enrichment (EE) can be used as a biological model for studying forward transfer, inspiring human-like AI development. EE refers to animal studies that enhance cognitive, social, motor, and sensory stimulation and is a model for what, in humans, is referred to as 'cognitive reserve'. Enriched animals show significant improvement in learning speed and performance on new tasks, typically exhibiting forward transfer. We explore anatomical, molecular, and neuronal changes post-EE and discuss how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be used to predict neural computation changes after enriched experiences. Finally, we provide a synergistic way of combining neuroscience and AI research that paves the path toward developing AI capable of rapid and efficient new task learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11884">ST-USleepNet: A Spatial-Temporal Coupling Prominence Network for Multi-Channel Sleep Staging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.11884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sleep staging is critical to assess sleep quality and diagnose disorders. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features.

                arXiv:2501.13504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving fast and reliable temporal signal encoding is crucial for low-power, always-on systems. While current spike-based encoding algorithms rely on complex networks or precise timing references, simple and robust encoding models can be obtained by leveraging the intrinsic properties of analog hardware substrates. We propose an encoding framework inspired by biological principles that leverages intrinsic neuronal variability to robustly encode continuous stimuli into spatio-temporal patterns, using at most one spike per neuron. The encoder has low model complexity, relying on a shallow network of heterogeneous neurons. It relies on an internal time reference, allowing for continuous processing. Moreover, stimulus parameters can be linearly decoded from the spiking patterns, granting fast information retrieval. Our approach, validated on both analog neuromorphic hardware and simulation, demonstrates high robustness to noise, spike jitter, and reduced heterogeneity. Consistently with biological observations, we observed the spontaneous emergence of patterns with stereotyped spiking order. The proposed encoding scheme facilitates fast, robust and continuous information processing, making it well-suited for low-power, low-latency processing of temporal data on analog neuromorphic substrates.

                arXiv:2501.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synaptic delay parameterization of neural network models have remained largely unexplored but recent literature has been showing promising results, suggesting the delay parameterized models are simpler, smaller, sparser, and thus more energy efficient than similar performing (e.g. task accuracy) non-delay parameterized ones. We introduce Shared Circular Delay Queue (SCDQ), a novel hardware structure for supporting synaptic delays on digital neuromorphic accelerators. Our analysis and hardware results show that it scales better in terms of memory, than current commonly used approaches, and is more amortizable to algorithm-hardware co-optimizations, where in fact, memory scaling is modulated by model sparsity and not merely network size. Next to memory we also report performance on latency area and energy per inference.

                arXiv:2501.13883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a capability of evolution strategies to train an agent with its policy based on a transformer architecture in a reinforcement learning setting. We performed experiments using OpenAI's highly parallelizable evolution strategy to train Decision Transformer in Humanoid locomotion environment and in the environment of Atari games, testing the ability of this black-box optimization technique to train even such relatively large and complicated models (compared to those previously tested in the literature). We also proposed a method to aid the training by first pretraining the model before using the OpenAI-ES to train it further, and tested its effectiveness. The examined evolution strategy proved to be, in general, capable of achieving strong results and managed to obtain high-performing agents. Therefore, the pretraining was shown to be unnecessary; yet still, it helped us observe and formulate several further insights.

Abstract: In the literature on runtime analyses of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), researchers have recently explored univariate EDAs for multi-valued decision variables. Particularly, Jedidia et al. gave the first runtime analysis of the multi-valued UMDA on the r-valued LeadingOnes (r-LeadingOnes) functions and Adak et al. gave the first runtime analysis of the multi-valued cGA (r-cGA) on the r-valued OneMax function. We utilize their framework to conduct an analysis of the multi-valued cGA on the r-valued LeadingOnes function. Even for the binary case, a runtime analysis of the classical cGA on LeadingOnes was not yet available. In this work, we show that the runtime of the r-cGA on r-LeadingOnes is O(n^2r^2 log^3 n log^2 r) with high probability.

                arXiv:2308.07870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming one of the key technologies of this century. The majority of results in AI thus far have been achieved using deep neural networks trained with the error backpropagation learning algorithm. However, the ubiquitous adoption of this approach has highlighted some important limitations such as substantial computational cost, difficulty in quantifying uncertainty, lack of robustness, unreliability, and biological implausibility. It is possible that addressing these limitations may require schemes that are inspired and guided by neuroscience theories. One such theory, called predictive coding (PC), has shown promising performance in machine intelligence tasks, exhibiting exciting properties that make it potentially valuable for the machine learning community: PC can model information processing in different brain areas, can be used in cognitive control and robotics, and has a solid mathematical grounding in variational inference, offering a powerful inversion scheme for a specific class of continuous-state generative models. With the hope of foregrounding research in this direction, we survey the literature that has contributed to this perspective, highlighting the many ways that PC might play a role in the future of machine learning and computational intelligence at large.

                arXiv:2501.00368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent studies reported that 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron &amp;amp;ndash;emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), even in comparison with other traditional methods, can play a role in diagnosing AE and supporting early treatment. In the present study, we further investigated whether 18F-FDG PET/CT may be a complementary diagnostic tool to conventional procedures in patients with acute symptoms of suspected AE in the early phase. Methods: Eleven consecutive patients with recent acute symptoms suggestive of AE were retrospectively enrolled and underwent brain PET/CT after receiving an intravenous injection of 3.7 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG. Results: PET/CT showed abnormal FDG uptake in 9/11 patients classified as AE, while it was negative in the remaining 2/11 cases with vascular lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), conducted in only 10/11 cases&amp;amp;mdash;one patient was a pacemaker wearer&amp;amp;mdash;identified suspected AE areas in 3/10 cases, ischemic lesions in another 3/10, and nonspecific data in the remaining 4/10 cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests revealed autoantibody delayed occurrence only in three patients (anti-GAD65, anti-Ma2, and anti-LGI1). After first-line treatment, 3/9 patients showed clinical improvement. Another 3/9 patients experienced partial improvement but with recurrence and new AE brain areas identified by PET/CT, which also detected favorable responses to second-line treatment in 2/3 cases. The remaining 3/9 patients, who were not responsive to treatment, ultimately died. Conclusions: In this study, PET/CT was effective in early identification of AE and enabling rapid therapy, even with inconclusive MRI and persistently negative or delayed positive CSF tests. PET/CT may aid in evaluating treatment response and detecting relapse. Notably, a negative PET/CT was associated with AE absence.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Oral word production (OWP) deficits are prominent in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA); however, their functional origin remains unclear. Some studies suggest a lexical, post-lexical, or even a combined functional origin of these deficits. The aim of the present study was to synthesize and analyze the information on the functional origin of the OWP deficits in patients with lvPPA. Methods: A quantitative systematic literature review was carried out using four databases: CINAHL, PsycINFO, Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, and PubMed. Fourteen studies, including a total of 243 patients with lvPPA, and reporting results on picture naming and/or word and/or pseudoword repetition, were selected. Results: The overall findings of this review highlighted that two main functional origins appear to explain the OWP deficits in lvPPA: a lexical impairment affecting lexical processing and a post-lexical impairment affecting phonological short-term memory. Interestingly, the possibility of a third functional origin, affecting the semantic processing level, was also suggested by some studies. Conclusions: We concluded that the presence of different functional origins of OWP in this population may be explained, at least partially, by the diversity of assessment tasks used in studies and the varied manipulation and control of psycholinguistic properties of words (e.g., frequency, length), as well as the various interpretations and analyses of the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; errors. Further studies are needed to substantiate these findings by examining all the components involved in OWP, carefully manipulating the psycholinguistic properties and qualitatively analyzing the errors made by lvPPA participants.</p>

	<p>Objective: Caregivers of individuals with motor neurone disease (MND) face a wide range of psychosocial difficulties. To address these, non-pharmacological interventions have been trialled, showing promising results. However, no clear characterisation of the breadth of psychosocial constructs examined by the interventions is currently available, resulting in the lack of a core outcome set (COS). The present review explored the types of psychosocial outcomes investigated in studies that adopted non-pharmacological interventions with caregivers of people with MND. Methods: A scoping review was conducted across four major databases (Academic Search Ultimate, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE) from inception to the 1 March 2024. Results: From an initial return of 4802 citations, 10 were considered eligible for inclusion. A total of 10 main psychosocial outcomes were identified: anxiety and depression, psychological distress, resilience, caregiver burden, caregiver preparedness, self-efficacy, quality of life, spiritual wellbeing, and mindfulness. Conclusions: Caregiver burden and symptoms of anxiety and depression represent pivotal outcomes, but caution is advised with regard to caregiver burden&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential multidimensional structure. Psychological distress and quality of life are also commonly investigated, but clearer consensus is needed on their conceptualisation. There is a paucity of studies characterising important psychosocial outcomes such as resilience, problem-solving, self-efficacy, and mindfulness, while no investigations are available for relevant outcomes such as coping, isolation, and loneliness. Further research is warranted to address these gaps to improve our insight into non-pharmacological support for MND caregivers and ultimately lead to the development of a core psychosocial outcome set in this population.</p>

	<p>Background: The ionotropic glutamate receptor AMPA (AMPAR) mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission and regulates synaptic strength in various parts of the CNS. Emotional challenges can affect these processes by influencing AMPAR levels and localization via stress hormones, resulting, e.g., in behavioral changes. AMPARs are essential for auditory processing, but their response to stress hormones in the central or peripheral auditory system remains poorly understood. Therefore, this scoping review examines the effects of corticosterone (CORT), a primary stress hormone in rodents, on AMPA receptor levels and localization in the rodent nervous system and considers potential implications for the auditory system. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and OVID EMBASE using MeSH terms related to AMPA receptors and corticosterone. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion criteria, including original research published in English that focused on AMPA receptor subunits (e.g., GluR1-4, GluA1-4, Gria1-4). Of 288 articles screened, 17 met the criteria for final analysis. Results: No reports were found regarding CORT action in the auditory system. Three main experimental models used in the included research were identified: neuronal cultures, isolated tissue cultures, and animal models. Generally, short-term CORT exposure increases AMPAR surface localization and mobility in neuronal cultures, especially in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. However, results from animal models were inconsistent due to variations in experimental design and other factors. The isolated tissue study did not provide sufficient data for clear conclusions. Conclusions: Variability in experimental models limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of CORT on AMPARs across different regions of the nervous system. The differences in live animal studies highlight the need for standardized methods and reporting. Since AMPARs play a crucial role in auditory processing, CORT-induced changes in neuronal cultures may occur in the auditory system. Further research is needed to explore the specific responses of AMPAR subunits and how stress hormones may influence auditory disorders, which could help identify potential treatment strategies.</p>

                Background The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the prevalence of heavy metal contamination in fish, fruits, and vegetables in Southwest Nigeria. The review focused on studies published over a ten-year period, between 2014 and 2024. Methods Articles used for the study were obtained by conducting a comprehensive literature search using several databases, including ResearchGate, Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PubMed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). To identify relevant studies, a plethora of keywords were utilized to search for articles in the selected databases, including. Articles reporting heavy metal contamination in specified food products within the last decade were included. Results Of the 10,212 initially identified articles, 64 met the inclusion criteria after thorough screening. The selected studies were predominantly conducted in Lagos (30), Ondo (8), and Ogun (7) states, with few studies in Oyo, Ekiti, and Osun states. The majority of the research focused on fish (40 studies), followed by vegetables (20) and fruits (4). The commonly studied fish species were observed to be Tilapia zilli, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, Clarias gariepinus, and Oreochromis niloticus, with heavy metal concentrations frequently exceeded WHO limits. Conclusions Therefore, this review highlights the significant risks posed by the presence of heavy metals in food products and underscores the importance of stringent environmental monitoring and the adoption of appropriate regulatory mechanisms for health and environmental risk mitigation. This could help in the formulation of appropriate policy implementation strategies geared towards mitigating heavy metal contamination in the region’s food supply.

                <p>by Soham Mandal, Ann-Marie Baker, Trevor A. Graham, Konstantin Bräutigam</p>

The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) are leading to significant advances in cancer research, particularly in analysing histopathology images for prognostic and treatment-predictive insights. However, effective translation of these computational methods requires computational researchers to have at least a basic understanding of histopathology. In this work, we aim to bridge that gap by introducing essential histopathology concepts to support AI developers in their research. We cover the defining features of key cell types, including epithelial, stromal, and immune cells. The concepts of malignancy, precursor lesions, and the tumour microenvironment (TME) are discussed and illustrated. To enhance understanding, we also introduce foundational histopathology techniques, such as conventional staining with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), antibody staining by immunohistochemistry, and including the new multiplexed antibody staining methods. By providing this essential knowledge to the computational community, we aim to accelerate the development of AI algorithms for cancer research.

                <p>by Hidekazu Hishinuma, Hisako Takigawa-Imamura, Takashi Miura</p>

Mathematical modeling has been utilized to explain biological pattern formation, but the selections of models and parameters have been made empirically. In the present study, we propose a data-driven approach to validate the applicability of mathematical models. Specifically, we developed methods to automatically select the appropriate mathematical models based on the patterns of interest and to estimate the model parameters. For model selection, we employed Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for zero-shot feature extraction, mapping the given pattern images to latent space and specifying the appropriate model. For parameter estimation, we developed a novel technique that rapidly performs approximate Bayesian inference based on Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost). This method allows for parameter estimation under minimal constraints; i.e., it does not require time-series data or initial conditions and is applicable to various types of mathematical models. We tested the method with Turing patterns and demonstrated its high accuracy and correspondence to analytical features. Our strategy enables efficient validation of mathematical models using spatial patterns.

                <p>by Max de Rooij, Balázs Erdős, Natal A. W. van Riel, Shauna D. O’Donovan</p>

Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalisable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than neural networks alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularisation, penalising biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularisation not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularisation reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses.

                <p>by Guochun Yang, Jiefeng Jiang</p>

Practice not only improves task performance but also changes task execution from rule- to memory-based processing by incorporating experiences from practice. However, <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> this change occurs is unclear. We test the hypothesis that strategy transitions in task learning can result from decision-making guided by cost-benefit analysis. Participants learn 2 task sequences and are then queried about the task type at a cued sequence and position. Behavioral improvement with practice can be accounted for by a computational model implementing cost-benefit analysis and the model-predicted strategy transition points align with the observed behavioral slowing. Model comparisons using behavioral data show that strategy transitions are better explained by a cost-benefit analysis across alternative strategies rather than solely on memory strength. Model-guided fMRI findings suggest that the brain encodes a decision variable reflecting the cost-benefit analysis and that different strategy representations are double-dissociated. Further analyses reveal that strategy transitions are associated with activation patterns in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and increased pattern separation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings support cost-benefit analysis as a mechanism of practice-induced strategy shift.

                <p>by Nadja R. Ging-Jehli, James F. Cavanagh, Minkyu Ahn, David J. Segar, Wael F. Asaad, Michael J. Frank</p>

The basal ganglia (BG) play a key role in decision-making, preventing impulsive actions in some contexts while facilitating fast adaptations in others. The specific contributions of different BG structures to this nuanced behavior remain unclear, particularly under varying situations of noisy and conflicting information that necessitate ongoing adjustments in the balance between speed and accuracy. Theoretical accounts suggest that dynamic regulation of the amount of evidence required to commit to a decision (a dynamic “decision boundary”) may be necessary to meet these competing demands. Through the application of novel computational modeling tools in tandem with direct neural recordings from human BG areas, we find that neural dynamics in the theta band manifest as variations in a collapsing decision boundary as a function of conflict and uncertainty. We collected intracranial recordings from patients diagnosed with either Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<i>n</i> = 14) or dystonia (<i>n</i> = 3) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus internus (GPi), and globus pallidus externus (GPe) during their performance of a novel perceptual discrimination task in which we independently manipulated uncertainty and conflict. To formally characterize whether these task and neural components influenced decision dynamics, we leveraged modified diffusion decision models (DDMs). Behavioral choices and response time distributions were best characterized by a modified DDM in which the decision boundary collapsed over time, but where the onset and shape of this collapse varied with conflict. Moreover, theta dynamics in BG structures modulated the onset and shape of this collapse but differentially across task conditions. In STN, theta activity was related to a prolonged decision boundary (indexed by slower collapse and therefore more deliberate choices) during high conflict situations. Conversely, rapid declines in GPe theta during low conflict conditions were related to rapidly collapsing boundaries and expedited choices, with additional complementary decision bound adjustments during high uncertainty situations. Finally, GPi theta effects were uniform across conditions, with increases in theta associated with a prolongation of decision bound collapses. Together, these findings provide a nuanced understanding of how our brain thwarts impulsive actions while nonetheless enabling behavioral adaptation amidst noisy and conflicting information.

                <p>by Vanessa D. Hohn, Laura Tiemann, Felix S. Bott, Elisabeth S. May, Clara Fritzen, Moritz M. Nickel, Cristina Gil Ávila, Markus Ploner</p>

Pain is closely linked to alpha oscillations (8 < 13 Hz) which are thought to represent a supra-modal, top-down mediated gating mechanism that shapes sensory processing. Consequently, alpha oscillations might also shape the cerebral processing of nociceptive input and eventually the perception of pain. To test this mechanistic hypothesis, we designed a sham-controlled and double-blind electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback study. In a short-term neurofeedback training protocol, healthy participants learned to up- and down-regulate somatosensory alpha oscillations using attention. Subsequently, we investigated how this manipulation impacts experimental pain applied during neurofeedback. Using Bayesian statistics and mediation analysis, we aimed to test whether alpha oscillations mediate attention effects on pain perception. The results showed that attention and neurofeedback successfully up- and down-regulated the asymmetry of somatosensory alpha oscillations. However, attention and neurofeedback did not modulate pain ratings or related brain responses. Accordingly, somatosensory alpha oscillations did not mediate attention effects on pain perception. Thus, our results challenge the hypothesis that somatosensory alpha oscillations shape pain perception. A causal relationship between alpha oscillations and pain perception might not exist or be more complex than hypothesized.
Trial registration: Following Stage 1 acceptance, the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05570695.

Antibodies are extensively used in biomedical research, clinical fields, and disease treatment. However, to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of antibody-based experiments, it is crucial to have a detailed understanding of the antibody’s target specificity and epitope. In this study, we developed a high-throughput and precise epitope analysis method, DECODE (Decoding Epitope Composition by Optimized-mRNA-display, Data analysis, and Expression sequencing). This method allowed identifying patterns of epitopes recognized by monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies at single amino acid resolution and predicted cross-reactivity against the entire protein database. By applying the obtained epitope information, it has become possible to develop a new 3D immunostaining method that increases the penetration of antibodies deep into tissues. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of DECODE to more complex blood antibodies, we performed epitope analysis using serum antibodies from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). As a result, we were able to successfully identify an epitope that matched the sequence of the peptide inducing the disease model without relying on existing antigen information. These results demonstrate that DECODE can provide high-quality epitope information, improve the reproducibility of antibody-dependent experiments, diagnostics and therapeutics, and contribute to discover pathogenic epitopes from antibodies in the blood.

                Background Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can lead to emotional and psychological distress between persons with ALS and their family carers. Many persons with ALS develop cognitive impairment, which limits their ability to process complex information, interact, and communicate. This cognitive decline adds to caregiver burden. Few studies have explored interpersonal relations between persons with ALS and their family carers. Aim To better understand how ALS-associated cognitive impairment influences close relations. Methods Individual semi-structured in-depth, interviews were conducted once, with four persons with ALS and four family carers. Reflexive thematic analysis was used. Results Increased distance of close relations was identified as the overarching theme. Differences and similarities within the data were identified according to the two main themes. The first main theme, Everyday life together but apart: a demanding role to play, was structured according to three subthemes: Keeping the façade of civility, Demanding daily interaction and communication, and Taken for granted changes in everyday roles. The second main theme, Coping with a lost future, was structured according to the two subthemes, Striving to live in the normal present, and Holding on to self. Conclusions and significance Cognitive impairment following ALS can lead to increased relational distance between persons with ALS and their family carers. To ease their burden, professionals should recognize person with ALS’ and family carers’ relational issues and grief at an early stage. Focusing on their occupational identity and valued occupations that are still-accessible may help persons with ALS and family carers regain meaning in everyday life.

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The interaction between Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Veillonella species (Veillonella spp.) is unclear. This study aims to investigate the interaction between S. mutans and Veillonella spp. on caries development using systematic review. Methods This systematic review was accorded to the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Three electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library, were used to conduct a systematic search for eligible studies from their inception until July 18, 2023. PROSPERO registration number was No. CRD42023445968. Results We initially identified 4,774 articles. After eliminating duplicates and irrelevant articles, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies revealed important aspects of the relationship between S. mutans and Veillonella spp. in dental caries. One significant finding is that Veillonella spp. can affect the acid production capacity of S. mutans. Some studies indicate that Veillonella spp. can inhibit the acid production by S. mutans, potentially reducing the cariogenic process. Another aspect is the competition for substrates. Veillonella spp. utilize lactic acid, which is a by product of S. mutans metabolism, as a source of carbon. This metabolic interaction may decrease the availability of lactic acid for S. mutans, potentially influencing its cariogenic potential. Conclusions This systematic review highlights the emerging evidence on the interaction between S. mutans and Veillonella spp. in dental caries. The findings suggest that Veillonella spp. can modulate the acid production, and substrate competition of S. mutans, potentially influencing the cariogenic process.

                Where did Ecuador’s foreign debt originate and grow to alarming levels? The purpose of this article is to describe, from an analytical perspective based on the contributions of various authors, the origin of Ecuador’s external debt with international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the support that these organizations provide for the development of the countries of the South, case Ecuador. To achieve this purpose, a documentary methodology was implemented that included an exhaustive review of studies focused on the specific variables subject to analysis, the PRISMA tool and Atlas.ti 23 were used. The results show that the creation of these financing agencies in their attempt to support the financial stability of developing countries has not been sufficiently effective in improving the welfare conditions of a good percentage of the population and has generated an imbalance in the sustained development of the poorest countries. It is concluded that the capitalist system gives predominant priority to the economic growth of nations, thus relegating in its model the consideration of human development. This orientation does not contribute effectively to the improvement of crucial aspects such: education, health and the standard of living of the population.

                Peihong Luo et al. describe in this paper that ERBB4 phosphorylates SMAD4 to mediate a select set of TGF-β transcriptional responses, which underscores the importance of SMAD4 tyrosine phosphorylation. Animal model data suggest that SMAD4 tyrosine phosphorylation promotes cell migration and tumor metastasis.

                Zou et al. use fMRI to show that spaced learning (at lags up to several months) increases the similarity of representations in human ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The behavioral benefits of spaced learning are predicted by these increases and reflect the re-encoding of prior encounters when stimuli repeat.

                Chen et al. demonstrate that the Hao-Fountain syndrome protein, the deubiquitinase USP7, regulates disease-relevant behaviors and synapse development via p53-independent pathways. Further, extensive proteomics, biochemical, and splicing analyses reveal that USP7 interacts with and deubiquitinates the RNA splicing factor Ppil4 to regulate the molecular composition and morphogenesis of the synapse.

                Mouse embryonic stem cells remain connected by bridges for hours after cell division. In this paper, Kodba et al. show that a high Aurora B activity at the bridge leads to microtubule stabilization. Stable microtubules recruit less of the microtubule depolymerase MCAK, which leads to bridge maintenance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101736">Projections from thalamic nucleus reuniens to hippocampal CA1 area participate in context fear extinction by affecting extinction-induced molecular remodeling of excitatory synapses</a></h4>

              
                The ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. Recent data support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) and its projections to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE→dCA1) in this process. However, it remains poorly understood how RE impacts dCA1 neurons during contextual fear extinction (CFE). Here, we reveal that the RE→dCA1 pathway contributes to the extinction of contextual fear by affecting CFE-induced molecular remodeling of excitatory synapses. Anatomical tracing and chemogenetic manipulation in mice demonstrate that RE neurons form synapses and regulate synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) of the dCA1 area, but not in the stratum radiatum (SR). We also observe CFE-specific structural changes of excitatory synapses and expression of the synaptic scaffold protein, PSD-95, in both strata innervated by RE, but not in SR. Interestingly, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. To further support the role of the RE→dCA1 projection in CFE, we demonstrate that brief chemogenetic inhibition of the RE→dCA1 pathway during a CFE session persistently impairs the formation of CFE memory and CFE-induced changes of PSD-95 levels in SLM. Thus, our data indicate that RE participates in CFE by regulating CFE-induced molecular remodeling of dCA1 synapses.

">Frontal midline theta power accounts for inter-individual differences in motor learning ability</a></h4>

              
                Recent neurophysiological studies have demonstrated that frontal midline theta (FMT) activity plays a significant role in motor learning. One of the key challenges in motor learning is to understand the interindividual variability in learning proficiency rates, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. To address this open question, this study recorded electroencephalogram activity during a visuomotor tracking task to investigate whether modulation of FMT power and the consistency of theta phase during motor preparation could explain individual differences in learning proficiency. We found a significant positive correlation between increased FMT power during motor preparation and learning proficiency rates. Specifically, individuals with greater FMT power exhibited faster learning rates. In contrast to this, no significant correlation was observed between the consistency of theta phase during motor preparation and learning proficiency. Together, these findings highlight that the FMT power, rather than phase synchrony, is closely associated with motor learning efficiency. This study provides a novel perspective for understanding the causes of individual differences in motor learning and further corroborates the previous evidence showing FMT power contributes to motor learning processes.

">The brain dynamics of congenitally blind people seeing faces with sound</a></h4>

              
                Sensory substitution devices (SSDs) convert images to sounds to equip blind individuals with nominally visual functions, like face or letter sensitivity. Prior studies showed that image-to-sound SSDs engage cortices ordinarily specialised for visual functions. However, the brain dynamics of SSD-supported perception remains unknown. Either visual cortices are the first locus of discrimination of SSD percepts, or their activation is a by-product of perceptual processes unfurling elsewhere, such as in auditory cortices. Resolving this uncertainty is critical for understanding whether the blind truly "see" via SSDs. Using electrical neuroimaging of EEG data from congenitally blind adults, we show for the first time that inferotemporal visual cortices are the earliest site of face sensitivity when conveyed via SSDs. The blind do indeed "see" with SSDs. By providing the temporal dynamics of SSD perception, our findings provide unique evidence for the theory that cortices are characterised by task-contingent functional organisation.

">Exploring GPCR-mediated optogenetic modulation of seizure network in a pig model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Optogenetics offers unmatched cellular specificity and control over cellular activity. Various opsins have been tested in animal models of epilepsy, each contributing to our understanding of seizure circuit dynamics. However, inhibitory optogenetic tools based on microbial rhodopsins have low light sensitivity and, thus, are less suitable for applications involving larger brains. We evaluated eOPN3, a red-shifted, highly sensitive inhibitory G- protein coupled receptor opsin in a porcine seizure model using integrated electro-optical sensing and modulation. The results demonstrated the feasibility of eOPN3 circuit modulation in a large animal epilepsy model. Methods: MRI-guided stereotactic surgery was used to deliver 20-60 L of AAV_eOPN3 (AAV5/AAV9-CaMKII-eOPN3-mScarlet) into the hippocampus (HPC) of three Goottingen minipigs. Each hemisphere received either an active or a control viral vector (AAV5/9-CaMKII-mScarlet) with gadolinium to visualize the injection sites and diffusion volume via post-operative MRI. Two to three months post-injection, bilateral deep brain stimulation electrodes integrated with optic fibers were stereotactically implanted into the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) and HPC to assess: 1) opsin expression using fiber photometry, 2) optogenetic modulation of stimulation evoked response potentials (SERPs), 3) induction and propagation of seizure-like activity via intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) injection, and 4) optogenetic modulation of KA-induced seizure activity. After the electrophysiology recording, brains were harvested for histological analysis to evaluate injection target precision, eOPN3 expression, and estimate eOPN3-modulated volume. Results: eOPN3 expression was confirmed during surgery via fiber photometry. ANT electrical stimulation elicited robust SERPs in the HPCs, which were attenuated by HPC light illumination. HPC stimulation similarly induced SERPs in the ipsilateral ANT and the contralateral HPC. The HPC stimulation-induced SERPs were significantly reduced by illuminating the site of the recording areas, the ipsilateral ANT and the contralateral HPC, demonstrating the optogenetic inhibition of the synaptic release from the HPC. KA injection into the HPC induced 20-30 Hz seizure-like activity. The ANT and HPC light illumination suppressed the localized KA-induced seizure activity in the early stage. However, after the generalization of KA-induced seizures, the ANT-HPC illumination lost efficacy for the control of seizures. Histological analysis confirmed eOPN3 expression in the HPC, ANT and other Papez circuit nodes. Conclusion: Our pilot study highlights that eOPN3-mediated inhibition alters SERP and the latency and spread of KA-induced seizure-like activity. We developed a platform incorporating pre- and postoperative MRI for precise viral vector delivery, real-time fiber photometry for quantifying opsin expression, and integrated electro-optical sensing and stimulation to assess optogenetic efficacy in a large animal model. The large animal model provides a solid foundation for future translational research to develop electro-optical devices and cellular therapies for human epilepsy.

">Hypothalamic Vasopressin Neurons Enable Maternal Thermoregulatory Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Newborns of many mammalian species are partial poikilotherms and require adult thermoregulatory care for survival. In mice, pup survival in cold and cool ambient temperature depends on the ability of adult caregivers to huddle pups and bring them into a high-quality nest. It is therefore essential that adult mice adjust parental care as a function of changes in ambient temperature. Here, we investigated how mouse maternal care adapts to a range of temperatures, from cold to warm. We show that changes in ambient temperature affect several individual and co-parenting maternal behaviors in both dams and virgin female mice, and modulate activity of vasopressin neurons. Furthermore, we establish that the effects of ambient temperature on both maternal care and the activity of vasopressin neurons depend in part on thermosensation, specifically on the TRPM8 sensor. Using trans-synaptic anterograde tracing and whole-brain activity mapping, we find that vasopressin neurons from the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus connect synaptically with temperature-responsive brain structures implicated in maternal care. We then show that optogenetic activation of vasopressin projections to the central amygdala, a structure activated by cold ambient temperature, recapitulates the effects of cold on co-parenting behaviors. Our data provide a biological mechanism for maternal thermoregulatory behavior in mice with translational relevance to the reported association between ecosystem temperature fluctuations and variations in human child neglect cases.

">Maturation of Hippocampus-Medial Prefrontal Cortex Projections Defines a Pathway-Specific Sensitive Period for Cognitive Flexibility</a></h4>

              
                The septotemporal axis of the hippocampus separates it into domains with unique molecular, cellular, downstream connectivity and behavioral profiles, and yet very little is known about the ontogenesis of these highly specialized subcircuits. Here, we used viral tracing, optogenetic-assisted patch clamping, chemogenetics and behavior in mice to examine changes in domain-defined hippocampus efferent projections from postnatal day (P)10 to P60. We found distinct anatomical and synaptic developmental signatures in ventral and intermediate CA1 downstream connectivity, with unique contributions to the prelimbic and infralimbic subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Inhibition of the ventral CA1 (vCA1)-mPFC pathway during juvenility led to a deficit in adult cognitive flexibility exclusively in females, establishing a sex- and pathway-specific sensitive period preceding the stabilization of vCA1-mPFC synaptic transmission. Our data elucidate domain- and target-defined postnatal maturation of hippocampus efferents, identifying a sex-specific sensitive period with crucial implications for early life influences on adult cognition.

">Evaluation of distal facial nerve branches contribution to facial nerve paralysis in rodents</a></h4>

              
                Introduction/Aims: Facial nerve paralysis is a complex and devastating condition. Translational research of facial paralysis recovery remains largely limited to animal studies, for which there are many potential models employed. When studying facial nerve regeneration in rodents, it is important to understand the converging contributions of the motor supply into the whisker pad. A consensus surgical approach and animal model has yet to be defined. Of particular interest for movement of the nose and whiskers are the buccal and marginal mandibular nerves. This study aims to evaluate how these distal nerve branches contribute to facial nerve paralysis and identify key morphological changes at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the whisker pad of rodents. Methods: Adult rats underwent isolated transection of the buccal branch of the facial nerve, both the buccal and marginal mandibular branches of the facial nerve, or control sham surgery. Results: Histological, electrophysiological, and behavior assessments confirmed that the transection of the buccal branch alone did not cease whisker movement in rats, but when combined with a transection of the marginal mandibular branch, it resulted in full paralysis of the whisker and nose movement. Discussion: These results are indicative of the distinct roles of these nerves branches in facial paralysis repair following a transection injury. Further, our results suggest additional targets for facial nerve repair treatments.

">Data-driven denoising in spinal cord fMRI with principal component analysis</a></h4>

              
                Numerous approaches have been used to denoise spinal cord functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Principal component analysis (PCA)-based techniques, which derive regressors from a noise region of interest (ROI), have been used in both brain (e.g., CompCor) and spinal cord fMRI. However, spinal cord fMRI denoising methods have yet to be systematically evaluated. Here, we formalize and evaluate a PCA-based technique for deriving nuisance regressors for spinal cord fMRI analysis (SpinalCompCor). In this method, regressors are derived with PCA from a noise ROI, an area defined outside of the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid. A parallel analysis is used to systematically determine how many components to retain as regressors for modeling; this designated a median of 11 regressors across three fMRI datasets: motor task (n=26), breathing task (n=27), and resting state (n=10). First-level fMRI modeling demonstrated that principal component regressors did fit noise (e.g., physiological noise from blood vessels), particularly in the resting state fMRI dataset. However, group-level motor task activation maps themselves did not show a clear benefit from including SpinalCompCor regressors over our original denoising model. The potential for collinearity of principal component regressors with the task may be a concern, and this should be considered in future implementations for which task-correlated noise is anticipated.

                Spinophilin is a dendritic spine enriched scaffolding and protein phosphatase 1 targeting protein. To detail spinophilin interacting proteins, we created an Ultra-ID and ALFA-tagged spinophilin encoding construct that permits proximity labeling and orthogonal nanobody pulldown (ID-oPD) of spinophilin-associated protein complexes in heterologous cells. We identified 614 specific, and 312 specific and selective, spinophilin interacting proteins in HEK293 cells and validated a subset of these using orthogonal approaches. Many of these proteins are involved in mRNA processing and translation. In the brain, we determined that spinophilin mRNA is highly neuropil localized and that spinophilin may normally function to limit its own expression but promote the expression of other PSD-associated proteins. Overall, our use of an ID-oPD approach uncovers a novel putative role for spinophilin in mRNA translation and synaptic protein expression specifically within dendritic spines.

">An Open-Source Joystick Platform for Investigating Forelimb Motor Control, Auditory-Motor Integration, and Value-Based Decision-Making in Head-Fixed Mice</a></h4>

              
                Investigation of neural processes underlying motor control requires behavioral readouts that capture the richness of actions, including both categorical (choice-based) information and motor execution (kinematics). We present an open-source platform for behavioral training of head-fixed mice that combines a stationary or retractable forelimb-based joystick, sound-presentation system, capacitive lick sensor, and water reward dispenser. The setup allows for the creation of multiple behavioral paradigms, two of which are highlighted here: a two-alternative forced-choice auditory-motor discrimination paradigm, and a two-armed bandit value-based decision-making task. In the auditory-motor paradigm, mice learn to report high or low frequency tones by pushing or pulling the joystick. In the value-based paradigm, mice learn to push or pull the joystick based on the history of rewarded trials. In addition to reporting categorical choices, this setup provides a rich dataset of motor parameters that reflect components of the underlying learning and decision processes in both of these tasks. These kinematic parameters (including joystick speed and displacement, Frechet similarity of trajectories, tortuosity, angular standard deviation, and movement vigor) provide key additional insights into the motor execution of choices that are not as readily assessed in other paradigms. The systems flexibility of task design, joystick readout, and ease of construction represent an advance compared to currently available manipulandum tasks in mice. We provide detailed schematics for constructing the setup and protocols for behavioral training using both paradigms, with the hope that this open-source resource is readily adopted by neuroscientists interested in mechanisms of sensorimotor integration, motor control, and choice behavior.

">Functional recovery of adult brain tissue arrested in time during cryopreservation by vitrification</a></h4>

              
                Cryopreserving adult brain tissue is challenging due to damage from ice formation, and traditional freezing methods fail to maintain neural architecture and function. Vitrification offers a promising alternative but has not been surveyed in the brain. Here, we demonstrate near-physiological recovery of adult mouse hippocampal slices after vitrification. Key features of this cognitive hub are preserved, including structural integrity, metabolic responsiveness, neuronal excitability, and synaptic transmission and plasticity. Notably, hippocampal long-term potentiation was well preserved, indicating that the cellular machinery of learning and memory remains operational. These findings extend the knowledge of brain recovery after hypothermic shutdown to recovery after complete cessation of molecular mobility through vitrification. This suggests that brain tissue can be arrested in time and reactivated, opening avenues for potential clinical applications.

">Chronic chemogenetic slow-wave sleep enhancement in mice.</a></h4>

              
                While epidemiological associations and brief studies of sleep effects in human disease have been conducted, rigorous long-term studies of sleep manipulations and in animal models are needed to establish causation and to understand mechanisms. We have previously developed a mouse model of acute slow-wave-sleep (SWS) enhancement using chemogenetic activation of parafacial zone GABAergic neurons (PZGABA) in the parvicellular reticular formation of the pontine brainstem. However, it was unknown if SWS could be enhanced chronically in this model. In the present study, mice expressing the chemogenetic receptor hM3Dq in PZGABA were administered daily with one of three chemogenetic ligands, clozapine N-oxide (CNO), deschloroclozapine (DCZ) and compound 21 (C21), and sleep-wake phenotypes were analyzed using electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG). We found that SWS time is increased for three hours, and at the same magnitude for at least six months. This phenotype is associated with an increase of slow wave activity (SWA) of similar magnitude throughout the 6-month dosing period. Interestingly, at the end of the 6-month dosing period, SWA remains increased for at least a week. This study validates a mouse model of chronic SWS enhancement that will allow mechanistic investigations into how SWS promotes physiological function and prevents diseases. The approach of a rotating schedule of three chemogenetic ligands may be broadly applicable in chemogenetic studies that require chronic administration.

">Co-Conservation of Synaptic Gene Expression and Circuitry in Collicular Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain sensorimotor hub, is anatomically and functionally similar across vertebrates, but how its cell types have evolved is unclear. Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, we compared the SC molecular and cellular organization in mice, tree shrews, and humans. Despite over 96 million years of evolutionary divergence, we identified ~30 consensus neuronal subtypes, including Cbln2+ neurons that form the SC-pulvinar circuit in mice and tree shrews. Synapse-related genes were among the most conserved, unlike neocortex, suggesting co-conservation of synaptic genes and circuitry. In contrast, cilia-related genes diverged significantly across species, highlighting the potential importance of the neuronal primary cilium in SC evolution. Additionally, we identified a novel inhibitory SC neuron in tree shrews and humans but not mice. Our findings reveal that the SC has evolved by conserving neuron subtypes, synaptic genes, and circuitry, while diversifying ciliary gene expression and an inhibitory neuron subtype.

">Resolving inconsistent effects of tDCS on learning using a homeostatic structural plasticity model</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly used to modulate motor learning. Current polarity and intensity, electrode montage, and application before or during learning had mixed effects. Both Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity were proposed to account for the observed effects, but the explanatory power of these models is limited. In a previous modeling study, we showed that homeostatic structural plasticity (HSP) can explain long-lasting after-effects of tDCS and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The interference between motor learning and tDCS, which are both based on HSP in our model, is a candidate mechanism to resolve complex and seemingly contradictory experimental observations. We implemented motor learning and tDCS in a spiking neural network subject to HSP. The anatomical connectivity of the engram induced by motor learning was used to quantify the impact of tDCS on motor learning. We demonstrated with modeling that transcranial direct current stimulation applied before learning had weak modulatory effects. It led to a small reduction in connectivity if it was applied uniformly. When applied during learning, targeted anodal stimulation significantly strengthened the engram, while targeted cathodal or uniform stimulation weakened it. Applied after learning, targeted cathodal, but not anodal, tDCS boosted engram connectivity. Strong tDCS would distort the engram structure if not applied in a targeted manner. Our model explained both Hebbian and homeostatic phenomena observed in human tDCS experiments by assuming memory strength positively correlates with engram connectivity. This includes applications with different polarity, intensity, electrode montage, and timing relative to motor learning. The HSP model provides a promising framework for unraveling the dynamic interaction between learning and transcranial DC stimulation.

">Deficient Executive Control in Transformer Attention</a></h4>

              
                Although transformers in the large language models (LLMs) effectively implement a self-attention mechanism that has revolutionized natural language processing, they lack an explicit implementation of executive control of attention found in humans which is essential for resolving conflicts and selecting relevant information in the presence of competing stimuli, and is critical for adaptive behavior. To investigate this limitation in LLMs, we employed the classic color Stroop task that is widely regarded as the gold standard for testing executive control of attention. Our results revealed a typical conflict effect of better performance in terms of accuracy in the congruent condition (e.g., naming the ink color of the word RED) compared to incongruent condition (e.g., naming the ink color of the word RED), which is similar to human performance, in short sequences. However, as sequence length increased, the performance degraded toward chance levels on the incongruent trials despite maintaining excellent performance on congruent trials and near-perfect word reading ability. These findings demonstrate that while transformer attention mechanisms can achieve human-comparable performance in smaller contexts, they are fundamentally limited in their capacity for conflict resolution across extended contexts. This study suggests that incorporating executive control mechanisms akin to those in biological attention could be crucial for achieving more general reasoning and reliable performance toward artificial general intelligence.

">Homeostatic bidirectional plasticity in Upbound and Downbound micromodules of the olivocerebellar system</a></h4>

              
                Olivocerebellar learning is highly adaptable, unfolding over minutes to weeks depending on the task. However, the stabilizing mechanisms of the synaptic dynamics necessary for ongoing learning remain unclear. We constructed a model to examine plasticity dynamics under stochastic input and investigate the impact of inferior olive (IO) reverberations on Purkinje cell (PCs) activity and synaptic plasticity. We explored Upbound and Downbound cerebellar micromodules, which are organized loops of IO neurons, cerebellar nuclei neurons and microzones of PCs characterized by their unique molecular profiles and different levels of baseline firing. Our findings show synaptic weight convergence followed by stability of synaptic weights. In line with their relatively low and high intrinsic firing, we observed that Upbound and Downbound PCs have a propensity for potentiation and depression, respectively, with both PC types reaching stability at differential levels of overall strength of their parallel-fiber (PF) inputs. The oscillations and coupling of IO neurons participating in the Upbound and Downbound modules determine at which frequency band PFs can be stabilized optimally. Our results indicate that specific frequency components drive IO resonance and synchronicity, which, in turn, regulate temporal patterning across Upbound and Downbound zones, orchestrating their plasticity dynamics.

">Erythropoietin decreases apoptosis and promotes Schwann cell repair and phagocytosis following nerve crush injury in mice</a></h4>

              
                After peripheral nerve trauma, insufficient clearance of phagocytic debris significantly hinders nerve regeneration. Without sufficient myelin debris clearance, Schwann cells (SCs) undergo increased apoptosis, impairing functional recovery. There is no treatment for peripheral nerve crush injury (PNCI). Erythropoietin (EPO) is an FDA-approved drug for anemia, which may help in the treatment of PNCI by transdifferentiating resident SCs into repair SCs (rSCs) and enhancing phagocytosis to facilitate the removal of cellular debris. For the first time, we conducted bulk RNA sequencing on mice with calibrated sciatic nerve crush injuries (SNCIs) on days 3, 5, and 7 post-SNCI to uncover transcriptomic changes with and without EPO treatment. We found EPO altered several biological pathways and associated genes, particularly those involved in cell apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, phagocytosis, myelination, and neurogenesis. We validated the effects of EPO on SNCI on early (days 3/5) and intermediate (day 7) post-SNCI, and found EPO treatment reduced apoptosis (TUNEL), and enhanced SC repair (c-Jun and p75-NTR), proliferation (Ki67), and the phagocytosis of myelin debris by rSCs at crush injury sites. This improvement corresponded with an enhanced sciatic functional index (SFI). We also confirmed these findings in-vitro. EPO significantly enhanced SC repair during early de-differentiation, marked by high c-Jun and p75-NTR protein levels, and later re-differentiation with high EGR2 and low c-Jun and p75-NTR levels. These changes occurred under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stress at 24 and 72h, respectively, compared to LPS treatment alone. Under LPS stress, EPO also significantly increased rSCs proliferation and phagocytosis of myelin or dead SCs. In conclusion, our findings support EPO may enhance the function of rSCs in debris clearance as a basis for its possible use in treating nerve trauma.

">The Effects of Acute Trazodone Administration on Sleep in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives: Trazodone is an antidepressant with robust hypnotic effects, frequently prescribed off-label to treat insomnia. Trazodone has gained recent attention in the context of neurodegenerative diseases because sleep has been proposed as a novel target for disease-modifying therapeutics. Preclinical research in rodents examining the effects of trazodone on sleep is limited, so here we aimed to develop a translationally-focused protocol to study the sleep-promoting effects of trazodone in mice. Methods: We investigated the effects of voluntary oral trazodone administration at doses of 0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 60 mg/kg on sleep in C57BL/6J mice (n = 15; females = 6; age 10-13 months). Mice were dosed with trazodone for 6 consecutive nights, while being recorded with intracranially implanted 2-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyography (EMG). EEG/EMG recordings were analyzed for time spent in each vigilance state and power spectra. Results: A single dose of trazodone, administered prior to the onset of the 12-h rest phase, dose-dependently increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and delta power during NREM sleep, at the expense of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These effects on sleep persisted after six consecutive days of dosing, albeit to a lesser extent. Conclusion: We have validated a novel voluntary oral administration protocol for trazodone use in mice and have shown that trazodone effectively promotes NREM in mice. Our novel protocol will be useful for future research investigating the effects of trazodone on sleep in mouse models of disease.

">Motor cortical beta power reflects adaptation to task constraints</a></h4>

              
                The amplitude of beta oscillations over motor cortical regions (beta power; 13-30 Hz) is used as a marker of motor function for various applications, including bradykinesia assessment in Parkinson's disease and brain-computer interface control. However, the impact of beta power changes on movement execution remains unclear, as beta power has been alternately associated with motor vigor and motor adaptation. The present study aimed to address this issue through two experiments (EXP1 and EXP2, 60 participants in total). In each experiment, participants were trained to down- and up-regulate beta power recorded over motor regions with electroencephalography, through real-time feedback, before executing a motor task (force task in EXP1, speed task in EXP2) in order to probe the effects of beta power changes on motor function. In EXP1, downregulation of beta power was associated with increased force exertion, but it did not significantly affect movement time nor reaction time. In EXP2, downregulation of beta power was associated with faster movements when instructed to move quickly and, conversely, slower movements when instructed to move slowly. Thus, the impact of online changes in beta power on motor execution specifically relied on task constraints, with a negative linear relationship linking beta power and motor adaptation. These findings demonstrate that beta power better predicts motor adaptation than strength of motor output, thereby highlighting the importance of considering environmental constraints for beta power-based applications.

                We present lateral habenula (LHb) neural data that display a variety of bursting patterns, with two dominant types and a third one that appears as a mix of the other two. We analyse these patterns using elementary statistical tools and characterise them from the perspective of average frequency during the burst and burst duration, which yields two main categories. We then propose an idealised multiple-timescale dynamical model that captures the two main types of bursting patterns observed in the data, namely square-wave and parabolic bursting, as well as the intermediate mixed-type (also termed triangular) bursting. We identify a special point in parameter space, termed saddle-node homoclinic, which acts as an organising center to distinguish between the two main bursting patterns. Finally, we relate the bursting categories inherent to the model and those identified through statistical analysis, discussing their possible convergence and limitations.

                Multiphoton microscopy serves as an essential tool for high-resolution imaging of the living mouse brain. To facilitate optical access to the brain during imaging, the cranial window surgery is commonly used. However, this procedure restricts physical access above the imaging area and hinders the direct delivery of imaging agents and drugs. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a cannula delivery system that enables the implantation of a low-profile cannula nearly parallel to the brain surface at angles as shallow as 8 degrees, while maintaining compatibility with multiphoton microscopy. To validate this approach, we perform direct infusion and imaging of various fluorescent cell markers in the brain. Additionally, we successfully demonstrate tracking of degenerating neurons over time in Alzheimer's disease mice using Fluoro-Jade C. Furthermore, we show longitudinal imaging of brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen using a phosphorescent oxygen sensor. Our developed technique should enable a wide range of new longitudinal imaging studies in the mouse brain.

">Development of a floxed Gabbr2 gene allows for widespread conditional disruption of GABBR2 and recapitulates the phenotype of germline Gabbr2 knockout mice</a></h4>

              
                GABBR1 and GABBR2 are widely expressed in the brain and genetic inhibition of their function leads to widespread neurologic dysfunction and premature death in mice. Given that GABBR1 and GABBR2 heterodimerize to form a functional receptor, global knockout of GABBR1 or GABBR2 results in a similar phenotype, characterized by spontaneous epileptiform activity, hyperlocomotor activity, hyperalgesia, impaired memory and premature death. It is now known that both GABBR1 and GABBR2 are expressed in a variety of tissues outside the nervous system and that GABA-B receptors can heterodimerize with other class C GPCRs, including the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Studies in vitro have demonstrated that interactions with GABBR1 and GABBR2 can alter CaSR signaling in human embryonic kidney cells and breast cancer cells. The neurologic consequences of global loss of function of GABBR1 or GABBR2 has made it difficult to study the effects of loss of GABBR function in other organs. While a conditional knockout for GABBR1 is available, the GABBR2 gene had not been "floxed". We have used CRISPR to insert loxP sites into the GABBR2 locus in mice. These mice are normal at baseline but when bred with mice expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the ubiquitously expressed Actin gene promoter, they recapitulate the phenotype of global GABBR2 knockout mice. Phenotypic changes through the brain, including the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Evidence of abnormal neuronal function, increase cell death, and changes in neuronal architecture are seen throughout the brain of CRISPR knockout mice. These mice should be useful tools to study cell type-specific loss of GABBR2 function in the brain and other organs.

">A synaptic-astrocytic proteomic signature associated with synaptopathy in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Synapse loss is the greatest correlate of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and offers a therapeutic avenue alongside disease-modifying therapies. However, the events preceding synapse loss in the human condition have not been well characterised. In this study, we describe a pseudotemporal profile of alterations in the synaptic proteome prior to excitatory synapse loss in human post-mortem brain AD tissue using synapse proteomics and synaptome mapping techniques. In a region with early-stage disease pathology, the most predominant changes were pre-synaptic and featured changes in metabolism and exocytosis. In a mid-stage disease state, alongside initial synapse loss, there was a dominance of inhibitory synaptic changes. In a region with late-stage disease pathology and profound synapse loss, post-synaptic changes were most prevalent with a range of canonical synaptic transmission pathways reduced and differential excitatory synapse subtype pathology. Synapse loss was associated with changes in astrocytic proteins which were enriched for those at peri-synaptic astrocytic processes, including an upregulation of complement activation and endocytosis; a signature that differed from the astrocyte cytosolic proteome. Taken together, this provides evidence of a cascade of events leading to synapse loss with multiple points for therapeutic intervention to alleviate cognitive decline in AD. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD056052.

">Standardised TruAI automated quantification of intracellular neuromelanin granules in human brain tissue sections</a></h4>

              
                Aims: To standardise and automate the quantitation of human-unique neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons in post-mortem tissue sections from healthy individuals at different ages to understand any changes in these granules with age. Methods: 5-6m thick fixed and paraffin-embedded transverse midbrain tissue sections were supplied from 47 cases from three brain banks following ethics approvals. Sections were prepared and automated digital images acquired. Standardisation and automation of the quantification of neuromelanin granules was performed using the TruAI feature of the Olympus VS200 desktop platform. Comparisons between stained and unstained sections as well as correlations with age were performed. Results: The automated platform reliably identified both stained and unstained intracellular and extracellular neuromelanin granules, showing high reproducibility in measurements across laboratories using different tissue processing methods. Extracellular neuromelanin granules were significantly smaller than intracellular neuromelanin granules. Sections processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining impacted on size and colour of both neuromelanin and the neurons containing neuromelanin. Hematoxylin made neuromelanin bluer and the increased tissue processing made the intracellular area occupied by neuromelanin smaller in younger people. There was an increase in neuromelanin optical density and colour change (more brown) with age. Conclusions: The TruAI automated platform reliably quantifies individual neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons. Extracellular neuromelanin is considerably smaller in size than intracellular neuromelanin, and intracellular neuromelanin changes its properties with age. The darkening and colour change of intracellular neuromelanin suggests an increase in eumelanin over time in healthy individuals. These changes can be reliably identified using the automated platform.

">Regionally specific resting-state beta neural power predicts brain injury and symptom recovery in adolescents with concussion: a longitudinal study</a></h4>

              
                Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in adolescents. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies (primarily reporting on adult males) have demonstrated abnormal resting-state (RS) brain activity in mTBI. The present study sought to identify RS abnormalities in male and female adolescents with mTBI (no previous mTBI and no previous DSM-5 diagnosis) identified from an outpatient specialty care concussion program setting as a basis for evaluating potential clinical utility. Visit 1 MEG RS data were obtained from 46 adolescents with mTBI (mean age: 15.4 years, 25 females) within 4 months of a mTBI (mTBI acute to sub-acute period) as well as from 34 typically developing (TD) controls (mean age: 14.8 years; 17 females) identified from the local community. Visit 2 RS data (follow-up ~4.3 months after Visit 1; mTBI sub-chronic period) were obtained from 36 mTBI (19 females) and 29 TD (14 females) of those participants. Source-space RS neural activity was examined from 4 to 56 Hz. Visit 1 t-tests showed that group differences were largest in the beta range (16-30 Hz; mTBI < TD), with Visit 2 whole-brain linear mixed model (LMM) analyses examining beta-band group differences as a function of Visit. A main effect of Group indicated Visit 1 and 2 beta-band group differences in midline superior frontal gyrus, right temporal pole, and right central sulcus (all mTBI < TD). The group effects were large (Cohen's d values 0.75 to 1.31). Of clinical significance in the mTBI group, a decrease in mTBI symptoms from Visit 1 to 2 was associated with an increase in beta power in 4 other brain regions. Present findings suggest that RS beta power has potential as a measure and perhaps as a mechanism of clinical recovery in adolescents with mTBI.

	<p>Recovery from anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) induces bilateral functional and physiological adaptations. Neurophysiologic measures of motor control have focused on the involved knee joint, limiting understanding regarding the extent of bilateral neural adaptations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate differences in neural activity during uninvolved-limb motor control after ACLR compared to healthy controls. Methods: Fifteen participants with left ACLR (8 female and 7 male, 21.53 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.7 years, 173.22 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.0 cm, 72.15 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.1 kg, Tegner 7.40 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.1, 43.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 33.1 mo. post-surgery, 2 patellar tendon, and 13 hamstring) and 15 matched controls (8 female, 23.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.7 years, 174.92 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.7 cm, 72.14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 15.4 kg, Tegner 7.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.0) participated. Neural activity was evaluated using functional magnetic resonance imaging on a 3T Siemens Magnetom scanner during four 30-s cycles of a right (uninvolved) knee flexion-extension task paced with a metronome (1.2 Hz) and was completed interspersed with 30 s of rest. A significance threshold of p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 was used for all analyses, cluster corrected for multiple comparisons, and z-thresholds of &amp;amp;gt;3.1 (subject level), and &amp;amp;gt;2.3 (group level). Results: The ACLR group had greater neural activity in one statistically significant cluster corresponding to the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (834 voxels, z = 3.81, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01 multiple comparisons corrected) compared to controls. Conclusions: These data indicate a potential contribution to uninvolved-knee neuromuscular deficits after injury and support the limitations of using the uninvolved side as a clinical reference. Uninvolved knee motor control after ACLR may require greater cognitive demand. Clinicians should be aware that the uninvolved limb might also demonstrate whole brain alterations limiting clinical inference from functional symmetry.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent studies indicate extensive shared white matter (WM) abnormalities between bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ). However, the heterogeneity of WM in BD in terms of the presence of psychosis remains a critical issue for exploring the boundaries between BD and SZ. Previous studies comparing WM microstructures in psychotic and nonpsychotic BDs (PBD and NPBD) have resulted in limited findings, probably due to subtle changes, emphasizing the need for further investigation. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging measures were obtained from 8 individuals with PBD, 8 with NPBD, and 22 healthy controls (HC), matched for age, gender, handedness, and educational years. Group comparisons were conducted using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). The most significant voxels showing differences between PBD and HC in the TBSS analyses were defined as a TBSS-ROI and subsequently analyzed. Results: Increased radial diffusivity (RD) in PBD compared to NPBD (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.006; d = 1.706) was observed in TBSS-ROI, distributed in the confined regions of some WM tracts, including the body of the corpus callosum (bCC), the left genu of the CC (gCC), and the anterior and superior corona radiata (ACR and SCR). Additionally, NPBD exhibited significant age-associated RD increases (R2 = 0.822, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), whereas the greater RD observed in PBD compared to NPBD remained consistent across middle age. Conclusions: Preliminary findings from this small sample suggest severe frontal WM disconnection in the anterior interhemispheric communication, left fronto-limbic circuits, and cortico-striatal-thalamic loop in PBD compared to NPBD. While these results require replication and validation in larger and controlled samples, they provide insights into the pathophysiology of PBD, which is diagnostically located at the boundary between BD and SZ.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Individuals with chronic agrammatic aphasia demonstrate real-time sentence processing difficulties at the lexical and structural levels. Research using time-sensitive measures, such as priming and eye-tracking, have associated these difficulties with temporal delays in accessing semantic representations that are needed in real time during sentence structure building. In this study, we examined the real-time processing effort linked to sentence processing in individuals with aphasia and neurotypical, age-matched control participants as measured through pupil reactivity (i.e., pupillometry). Specifically, we investigated whether a semantically biased lexical cue (i.e., adjective) influences the processing effort while listening to complex noncanonical sentences. Methods: In this eye-tracking while listening study (within-subjects design), participants listened to sentences that either contained biased or unbiased adjectives (e.g., venomous snake vs. voracious snake) while viewing four images, three related to nouns in the sentence and one unrelated, but a plausible match for the unbiased adjective. Pupillary responses were collected every 17 ms throughout the entire sentence. Results: While age-matched controls demonstrated increased pupil response throughout the course of the sentence, individuals with aphasia showed a plateau in pupil response early on in the sentence. Nevertheless, both controls and individuals with aphasia demonstrated reduced processing effort in the biased adjective condition. Conclusions: Individuals with aphasia are sensitive to lexical&amp;amp;ndash;semantic cues despite impairments in real-time lexical activation during sentence processing.</p>

	<p>Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric condition with a lifetime prevalence of 2&amp;amp;ndash;3%. It significantly burdens quality of life and is associated with substantial economic and disease burdens. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and high-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered the first-line treatments for OCD. Approximately two-thirds of patients with Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Disorder (OCD) exhibit inadequate responses to current standard therapies, thus lacking adequate therapy, resulting in a loss of quality of life and huge economic burdens. Repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, safe, and well-tolerated intervention that modulates prefrontal cortical circuits involved in OCD. A previous systematic review explored the therapeutic effects of rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) area in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. It showed that the application of high-frequency and low-frequency (LF) rTMS to the dlPFC region yielded controversial post-treatment Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Scale) findings due to factors such as small sample sizes, short-term study durations, and variations in rTMS protocols. Objectives: Thus, we propose a theoretical protocol based on previous findings to assess better the effect of LF rTMS for treatment-resistant OCD patients. Methods: We will recruit patients with moderate to severe OCD and limited response to previous treatments from in- and outpatient clinics. We will use fMRI for precious localization of the right dlPFC and application of 1 Hz stimulation of in total 2000 pulses with three times 40 s inter-train intervals 5 days a week, in 6 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome will be the mean reduction in Y-BOCS at the end of this study. Conclusions: This study highlights rTMS&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential to reform OCD treatment, accentuate safety, accessibility, clinical integration, and future research foundations.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study examined the differences in brain volume and cortical thickness among individuals with normal cognition (NC) and those with NCDs, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The aim was to identify the brain parameters supporting clinical decision-making for NCDs. Method: A total of 116 participants were categorized into dementia, MCI, and NC groups, and their brain scans using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were processed and automatedly analyzed with FreeSurfer to obtain the absolute brain volume, volume normalized by intracranial volume (ICV), and cortical thickness. Patients with dementia exhibited a significantly smaller brain volume and cortical thickness than the MCI and NC groups. Results: The left amygdala/ICV ratio demonstrated excellent performance in diagnosing early NCDs, with a cutpoint of &amp;amp;le;0.089, providing 83.30% sensitivity, 84.20% specificity, and 83.82% accuracy. For MCI, a cutpoint of &amp;amp;le;0.099 for the left amygdala/ICV yielded 96.70% sensitivity, 83.30% specificity, and 88.46% accuracy. Conclusions: The findings suggested that reductions in brain volume and cortical thickness correlate with cognitive decline. Utilizing FreeSurfer and MRI data, particularly the left amygdala/ICV ratio, may serve as a valuable biomarker for the early identification of individuals at risk for developing NCDs.</p>

	<p>Background: Different lateral and postero-lateral cranial approaches to the petroclival region and to the mid-upper brain stem have been described so far, some of which require extensive osseous demolition and possible damage of neurovascular structures. Neuronavigational systems are now extensively available for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation to assist the surgeons in choosing the optimally invasive approach for each pathology. Herein, we describe a detailed navigation-augmented morphometric analysis to bring insight into the usefulness of an anterior petrosectomy (AP) to handle lesions in the petroclival region. Methods: Eight cadaveric, silicone injected heads were used. A total of 14 approaches (AP, n = 8; retrosigmoid, RS, n = 6) using a standard microsurgical dissection technique were performed. All specimens had preoperative CT and MRI scans, as well as a post-dissection CT. The neuronavigational system was used for distance measurements, craniotomy sizes and surgical corridor volumes, for each approach. Results: The distance from the skull surface to the petrous apex was significantly shorter in the AP approach when compared with the RS (46.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.9 mm versus 71.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.8 mm, respectively, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Although the craniotomy size was not different, the volume of the surgical corridor was significantly larger with the AP approach (21.31 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.91 cm3 vs. 13.39 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.8 cm3). The AP approach increased the length of the basilar artery exposure from 6.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 mm (obtained with a standard subtemporal approach) to 22.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 mm (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: The surgical corridor to the petroclival region achieved by virtue of an AP was significantly larger and featured shorter working distances, resulting in a higher degree of surgical freedom. Although significant individual anatomical variations of fundamental neurovascular and bony structures were found, these difficulties were overcome by careful pre- and intraoperative use of neuronavigation.</p>

                <p>Sensory experience and learning are thought to be associated with plasticity of neocortical circuits. Repetitive sensory stimulation can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of cortical excitatory synapses in anesthetized mice; however, it is unclear if these phenomena are associated with sustained changes in activity during wakefulness. Here we used time-lapse, calcium imaging of layer (L) 2/3 neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), in awake male mice, to assess the effects of a bout of rhythmic whisker stimulation (RWS) at a frequency by which rodents sample objects. We found that RWS induced a 1&nbsp;h increase in whisker-evoked L2/3 neuronal activity in most cells. This was not observed for whiskers functionally connected to distant cortical columns. We also found that RWS could heterogeneously recruit or suppress whisker-evoked activity in different populations of neurons. Vasoactive intestinal-peptide&ndash;expressing (VIP) interneurons, which promote plasticity through disinhibition of pyramidal neurons, were found to exclusively elevate activity during RWS. These findings indicate that cortical neurons&rsquo; representation of sensory input can be modulated over hours through repetitive sensory stimulation, which may be gated by activation of disinhibitory circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/4/e2214232024?rss=1">Multivariate Pattern Analysis of EEG Reveals Neural Mechanism of Naturalistic Target Processing in Attentional Blink</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human brain has inherent limitations in consciously processing visual information. When individuals monitor a rapid sequence of images for detecting two targets, they often miss the second target (T2) if it appears within a short time frame of 200&ndash;500 ms after the first target (T1), a phenomenon known as the attentional blink (AB). The neural mechanism behind the AB remains unclear, largely due to the use of simplistic visual items such as letters and digits in conventional AB experiments, which differ significantly from naturalistic vision. This study employs advanced multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of human electroencephalography (EEG) data (including 17 females and 18 males) to explore the neural representations associated with target processing within a naturalistic paradigm under conditions where AB does or does not occur. Our MVPA analysis successfully decoded the identity of target images from EEG data. Moreover, in the AB condition, characterized by a limited time between targets, T1 processing coincided with T2 processing, resulting in the suppression of late representational markers of both T1 and T2. Conversely, in the condition with longer inter-target interval, neural representations endured for a longer duration. These findings suggest that the AB can be attributed to the suppression of neural representations in the later stages of target processing.</p>

                <p>We appraise other people&rsquo;s emotions by combining multiple sources of information, including somatic facial/body reactions and the surrounding context. Wealthy literature revealed how people take into account contextual information in the interpretation of facial expressions, but the mechanisms mediating such influence still need to be duly investigated. Across two experiments, we mapped the neural representations of distinct (but comparably unpleasant) negative states, pain, and disgust, as conveyed by naturalistic facial expressions or contextual sentences. Negative expressions led to shared activity in the fusiform gyrus and superior temporal sulcus. Instead, pain contexts recruited the supramarginal, postcentral, and insular cortex, whereas disgust contexts triggered the temporoparietal cortex and hippocampus/amygdala. When pairing the two sources of information together, we found a higher likelihood of classifying an expression according to the sentence preceding it. Furthermore, networks specifically involved in processing contexts were re-enacted whenever a face followed said context. Finally, the perigenual medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) showed increased activity for consistent (vs inconsistent) face-context pairings, suggesting that it integrates state-specific information from the two sources. Overall, our study reveals the heterogeneous nature of face-context information integration, which operates both according to a state-general and state-specific principle, with the latter mediated by the perigenual medial prefrontal cortex.</p>

                <p>Eph/ephrin signaling is crucial for organizing retinotopic maps in vertebrates. Unlike other EphAs, which are expressed in the embryonic ventral retina, EphA4 is found in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer at perinatal stages, and its role in mammalian visual system development remains unclear. Using classic in vitro stripe assays, we demonstrate that, while RGC axons are repelled by ephrinB2, they grow on ephrinB1 stripes through EphA4-mediated adhesion. In vivo, retinal axons from EphA4-deficient mice from either sex show impaired arborization in the medial, but not lateral, regions of the superior colliculus that express ephrinB1. Gain-of-function experiments further reveal that ephrinB1-mediated adhesion depends on EphA4 tyrosine kinase activity but it is independent of its sterile alpha motif. Together, our findings suggest that EphA4/ephrinB1 forward signaling likely facilitates adhesion between retinal axon terminals and cells in the medial colliculus, contributing to the establishment of proper connectivity within the visual system.</p>

                <p>In mammals, the central circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which transmits circadian information to other brain regions and regulates the timing of sleep and wakefulness. Neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), particularly those producing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin, are key regulators of sleep and wakefulness. Although the SCN receives nonphotic input from other brain regions, the mechanisms of functional input from the LH to the SCN remain poorly understood. Here, we show that orexin and MCH peptides influence the circadian period within the SCN of both sexes. When these neurons are ablated, the circadian behavioral rhythms are lengthened under constant darkness. Using anterograde and retrograde tracing, we found that orexin and MCH neurons project to the SCN. Furthermore, the application of these peptides to cultured SCN slices shortened circadian rhythms and reduced intracellular cAMP levels. Additionally, pharmacological reduction of intracellular cAMP levels similarly shortened the circadian period in SCN slices. These findings suggest that orexin and MCH peptides from the LH contribute to the modulation of the circadian period in the SCN.</p>

                <p>Rhythm perception and synchronization to periodicity hold fundamental neurodevelopmental importance for language acquisition, musical behavior, and social communication. Rhythm is omnipresent in the fetal auditory world and newborns demonstrate sensitivity to auditory rhythmic cues. During the last trimester of gestation, the brain begins to respond to auditory stimulation and to code the auditory environment. When and how during this period do the neural capacities for rhythm processing develop? We conducted a cross-sectional study in 46 neonates (24 male) born between 27 and 35 weeks gestational age (wGA), measuring their neural responses to auditory rhythms with high-density electroencephalography during sleep. We developed measures to evaluate neural synchronization to nested rhythmic periodicities, including the fast isochronous beat and slower metrical (beat grouping) structures. We show that neural synchronization to beat and meter becomes stronger with increasing GA, converging on small phase differences between stimulus and neural responses near term, similar to those observed in adults. Dividing the cohort into subpopulations born before and after 33 wGA revealed that both younger and older groups showed neural synchronization to the fast periodicity related to the isochronous beat, whereas only the older group showed significant neural synchronization to the slower meter frequencies related to beat groupings, suggesting that encoding of nested periodicities arrives during late gestation. Together, our results shed light on the rapid evolution of neural coding of external hierarchical auditory rhythms during the third trimester of gestation, starting from the age when the thalamocortical axons establish the first synapses with the cortical plate.</p>

                <p>The mammalian striatum is divided into two types of anatomical structures: the island-like, &mu;-opioid receptor (MOR)-rich striosome compartment and the surrounding matrix compartment. Both compartments have two types of spiny projection neurons (SPNs), dopamine receptor D1 (D1R)-expressing direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) and dopamine receptor D2 (D2R)-expressing indirect pathway SPNs. These compartmentalized structures have distinct roles in the development of movement disorders, although the functional significance of the striosome compartment for motor control and dopamine regulation remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the roles of striosome in locomotion and dopamine dynamics in freely moving mice. We targeted striosomal MOR-expressing neurons with male MOR-CreER mice, which express tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under MOR promoter, and Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus vector. The targeted neuronal population consisted mainly of dSPNs. We found that the Gq-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic stimulation of striatal MOR-expressing neurons caused a decrease in the number of contralateral rotations and total distance traveled. Wireless fiber photometry with a genetically encoded dopamine sensor revealed that chemogenetic stimulation of striatal MOR-expressing neurons suppressed dopamine signals in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. Furthermore, the decrease in mean dopamine signal and the reduction of transients were associated with ipsilateral rotational shift and decrease of average speed, respectively. Thus, a subset of striosomal dSPNs inhibits contralateral rotation, locomotion, and dopamine release in contrast to the role of pan-dSPNs. Our results suggest that striatal MOR-expressing neurons have distinct roles in motor control and dopamine regulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/4/e0755242024?rss=1">Multitasking Practice Eliminates Modality-Based Interference by Separating Task Representations in Sensory Brain Regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The debate on the neural basis of multitasking costs evolves around neural overlap between concurrently performed tasks. Recent evidence suggests that training-related reductions in representational overlap in fronto-parietal brain regions predict multitasking improvements. Cognitive theories assume that overlap of task representations may lead to unintended information exchange between tasks (i.e., crosstalk). Modality-based crosstalk was suggested as a source for multitasking costs in multisensory settings. Robust findings of increased costs for certain modality mappings may be explained by crosstalk between the stimulus modality in one task and sensory action consequences in the concurrently performed task. Whether modality-based crosstalk emerges from representational overlap in general fronto-parietal multitasking regions or modality-specific regions is not known yet. In this functional neuroimaging study, we investigate neural overlap during multitasking performance in humans, focusing on modality compatibility by employing multivariate pattern analysis and modality-specific practice interventions in three groups (total <I>N</I> = 54, 24 females). We observed significant differences between modality compatible and modality incompatible single-task representations, specifically in the auditory cortex but not in fronto-parietal regions. Notably, improved auditory decoding accuracy related to modality incompatible tasks was predictive of performance gains in the corresponding dual task along with complete elimination of modality-specific dual-task costs. This predictive relationship was evident only in the group practicing modality incompatible mappings, suggesting that specific practice on task sets with modality overlap influenced both neural representations and subsequent multitasking performance. This study contributes to the integration of cognitive theory and neuroscience and the role of task representations in dual-task interference.</p>

                <p>NMDA-type glutamate receptors are heterotetrameric complexes composed of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. The precise composition of the GluN2 subunits determines the channel's biophysical properties and influences its interaction with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and signaling molecules involved in synaptic physiology and plasticity. The precise regulation of NMDAR subunit composition at synapses is crucial for proper synaptogenesis, neuronal circuit development, and synaptic plasticity, a cellular model of memory formation. In the forebrain during early development, NMDARs contain solely the GluN2B subunit, which is necessary for proper synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In rodents, GluN2A subunit expression begins in the second postnatal week, replacing GluN2B-containing NMDARs at synapses in an activity- or sensory experience-dependent process. This switch in NMDAR subunit composition at synapses alters channel properties and reduces synaptic plasticity. The molecular mechanism regulating the switch remains unclear. We have investigated the role of activity-dependent internalization of GluN2B-containing receptors in shaping synaptic NMDAR subunit composition. Using molecular, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches in cultured organotypic hippocampal slices from rats of both sexes, we show that the process of incorporating GluN2A-containing NMDAR receptors requires activity-dependent internalization of GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Interestingly, blockade of GluN2A synaptic incorporation was associated with impaired potentiation of AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission, suggesting a potential coupling between the trafficking of AMPARs into synapses and that of GluN2A-containing NMDARs. These insights contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic trafficking of glutamate receptors and synaptic plasticity. They may also have implications for therapeutic strategies targeting NMDAR function in neurological disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/4/e0969242024?rss=1">Spatial Mapping of Activity Changes across Sensory Areas Following Visual Deprivation in Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Loss of a sensory modality triggers global adaptation across brain areas, allowing the remaining senses to guide behavior more effectively. There are specific synaptic and circuit plasticity observed across many sensory areas, which suggests potential widespread changes in activity. Here we used a cFosTRAP2 mouse line to drive tdTomato (tdT) expression in active cells to spatially map the extent of activity changes in various sensory areas in adult mice of both sexes following two modes of visual deprivation. We found that in the primary visual cortex (V1), both dark exposure (DE) and enucleation (EN) caused an initial loss of active cells followed by a partial rebound, which occurred relatively more in the superficial layers. A similar pattern was observed in the secondary visual cortex, especially in the lateral areas (V2L). The spared primary sensory cortices adapted distinctly. In the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1BF), there was a change in the density of active cells dependent on the duration and the mode of visual deprivation. In the primary auditory cortex (A1), there was a relative reduction in the density of active cells in the superficial layers without a significant change in the overall density. There were minimal changes in the active cell density in the secondary cortices of the spared senses and the multisensory retrosplenial cortex (RSP). Our results are consistent with cross-modal recruitment of the deprived visual cortex and compensatory plasticity in the spared primary sensory cortices that can support enhanced processing and refinement of the spared senses.</p>

                <p>Layer 4 (L4) of rabbit V1 contains fast-spike GABAergic interneurons (suspected inhibitory interneurons, SINs) that receive potent synaptic input from the LGN and generate fast, local feedforward inhibition. These cells display receptive fields with overlapping ON/OFF subregions, nonlinear spatial summation, very broad orientation/directional tuning, and high spontaneous and visually driven firing rates. Fast-spike interneurons are also found in Layer 5 (L5), which receives a much sparser input from the LGN, but the response properties and thalamocortical connectivity of L5 SINs are relatively unstudied. Here, we study L5 SINs in awake rabbits (both sexes) and compare their response properties with previously studied SINs of L4. We also assess thalamocortical connectivity of L5 SINs, examining cross-correlation of retinotopically aligned LGN&ndash;SIN spike trains and L5 SIN responses to electrical stimulation of the LGN. These analyses confirmed that many L5 SINs, like L4 SINs, receive a strong, fast monosynaptic drive from the LGN. Moreover, these LGN-connected L5 SINs had response properties similar to those of L4 SINs and were predominantly found in the upper half of L5. In contrast, L5 SINs with longer synaptic latencies to LGN stimulation displayed (1) sharper orientation tuning, (2) longer visual response latencies, (3) lower spontaneous and (4) visually driven firing rates, and (5) were found in the deeper half of L5. We suggest that the long-latency synaptic responses in such L5 SINs reflect a multisynaptic intracortical pathway that generates a different constellation of response properties than seen in L5 SINs that are driven directly by LGN input.</p>

                <p>The cAMP-response element&ndash;binding protein (CREB) transcription factor controls the expression of the neuronal immediate early genes c<I>-fos</I>, <I>Arc</I>, and <I>Bdnf</I> and is essential for long-lasting synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. Despite this critical role, there is still ongoing debate regarding the synaptic excitation&ndash;transcription (E&ndash;T) coupling mechanisms mediating CREB activation in the nucleus. Here we employed optical uncaging of glutamate to mimic synaptic excitation of distal dendrites in conjunction with simultaneous imaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and transcriptional reporter gene expression to elucidate CREB E&ndash;T coupling mechanisms in hippocampal neurons cultured from both male and female rats. Using this approach, we found that CREB-dependent transcription was engaged following dendritic stimulation of <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) only when Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals propagated to the soma via subsequent activation of L-type voltage&ndash;gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels resulting in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAP kinase signaling to sustain CREB phosphorylation in the nucleus. In contrast, dendrite-restricted Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated by NMDARs failed to stimulate CREB-dependent transcription. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent kinase&ndash;mediated signaling pathways that may transiently contribute to CREB phosphorylation following stimulation were ultimately dispensable for downstream CREB-dependent transcription and c-Fos induction. These findings emphasize the essential role that L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels play in rapidly relaying signals over long distances from synapses located on distal dendrites to the nucleus to control gene expression.</p>

                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                Background/Aim To examine the clinical correlation of p16 expression with Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers and lymphatic invasion in OPSCC patients in terms of clinical status at presentation, subsequent progression, and survival. Methods Tissue blocks of biopsy-proven Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma were subjected to Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for evaluating the expression of p16, e-cadherin, vimentin and podoplanin. This expression pattern was correlated with the demographic details, treatment response and survival patterns. Results 60 patients were finally available for evaluation in this study. Prevalence of HPV infection in our study was found to be 11.7%. E-cadherin expression was found in all HPV-associated patients whereas vimentin was not expressed in any of these. 71.4% patients had low Podoplanin expression and 85.7% had low lymphatic vessel count. Among the HPV- associated patients, 85.8% had T3-T4 stage, 100% had N2-N3 disease and 95% had stage IV disease. It was also found that p16-positive patients had significantly higher 1-year Overall survival (OS) (80%, p=0.045), higher 1-year Progression-free survival (PFS) (60%) and higher 1-year Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) (75%) when compared to p16-negative patients. Conclusion Prevalence of HPV infection was found to be similar to that of previous studies conducted in India. As previous literature suggests, the HPV-positive patients in our study presented with advanced nodal disease at presentation and thereby, an advanced overall stage. Further follow-up of these patients including their treatment details, determination of possible prognostic markers, and evaluation of their survival parameters can be done which can help in modifying the existing treatment modalities as HPV-associated OPSCC are known to have better prognosis according to literature.

                Background Nurses and healthcare professionals employed in correctional and forensic mental health settings encounter unique challenges in the care of their patients due to custodial and restrictive environments. Regions within the Middle East, such as the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, have recently experienced exponential economic and healthcare infrastructure development. Mental health has been prioritized for development by recent legislation and practice that incorporate the development of specialist forensic psychiatry services that mediate the need for specialized nurses and allied healthcare staff. Traditionally, forensic care has been provided by general services. The need to progress specialist forensic services with a focus on multidisciplinary staff that seeks to develop safer communities, enhance care, and support the criminal justice system. Methods This review article aims to provide a foundation for the nuances of forensic staff through social constructionism. We adopted the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005). The use of a scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content, and outcomes to position the reader to the theoretical construct that society can be seen as existing in both objective and subjective reality. Discussion This paper argues for the preparedness of thought understood through social constructionism and demonstrates that it is envisaged that any frequently repeated action becomes cast into a pattern that can be reproduced without much effort. The interconnectedness between the themes of addiction, deviance, and crime allows for a holistic overview and improved understanding for care providers and this was achieved through bio-psychosocial model. Conclusion Through the emergence of these complex forms of knowledge, deviance within the lives of patients can be better understood by the emerging professions employed in the emerging forensic healthcare services within the Middle East. These individuals are carefully and dutifully navigating the cultural complexities of mental illness, addictions, and associated deviant behavior.

                Background The human ear is unique to individuals, and ear prints, like fingerprints, are discrete enough to distinguish identical twins. Therefore, the external ear could be used to identify both living and deceased individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the stature and sexual dimorphism of the external ear using various morphometric parameters and morphological features for forensic identification. Methods This study included 40 participants (20 males and 20 females). Participants were between the age of 18-25yrs. Measurements were taken with the subject’s head in the Frankfort horizontal plane. 18 measurements were taken like ear length and width, lobule height and width, concha length and width, tragus length, morphological ear length, helical mastoid distal length, thickness of ear lobe, auricular inclination angle, antihelical take off angle, concha mastoid angle, auricular index, lobular index, concha index, ear attachment length index and conchal bowl depth on external ear were taken and the morphological features like shape of ear, ear lobe, darwin’s tubercle and ear tragus, attachment of ear lobe and form of helix of both the right and left ears were noted. A digital Vernier caliper was used to measure all parameters. The angles were measured using a goniometer. Normal distribution was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For normally distributed parameters, an independent t-test was used, and for non-normally distributed parameters, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare sexes. To compare the right and left parameters, independent t-tests (for normally distributed data) and Mann-Whitney U tests (for non-normally distributed data) were applied. Sex determination and stature estimation were performed using logistic regression analysis. Results In males and females, the most common shape was oval, and the ear lobe was free. The most common shape of the ear lobe in males was arched, while in females, it was triangular. In males and females, the most common form of the helix was the concave marginal. In males, the most common shape of the tragus was round, whereas in females, it was long. In males and females, the most common shape of Darwin’s tubercle was enlarged. It was seen that the right lobe width showed perfect separation, indicating its potential as an extremely reliable predictor. It was noted that in females, the strongest correlation with height was with the ear inclination angle on both sides. Conclusion The results of this study can help forensic anthropologists identify the sex and stature of a person from various ear measurements.

                Memory consolidation requires rapid energy supply to neurons.

This mechanism coordinates just-in-time glial energy delivery in response to dynamic neuronal needs.

                Chemotherapy treatment can significantly increase the survival of patients with cancer, but it also causes collateral damage in the body that can lead to treatment dose reductions and can reduce patient quality of life. One understudied side effect of chemotherapy is circadian disruption, which is associated with lasting biological and behavioral toxicities. Mechanisms of how chemotherapy alters circadian rhythms remain largely unknown, although leveraging rodent models may provide insights into causes and consequences of this disruption. Here, we review physiological, molecular, and behavioral evidence of central and peripheral circadian disruption in various rodent models of chemotherapy and discuss possible mechanisms driving these circadian disruptions. Overall, restoring circadian rhythms following treatment-induced disruptions may be a novel target by which to improve the health and quality of life of survivors.

                The precise organization of the complex set of synaptic proteins at the nanometer scale is crucial for synaptic transmission. At the heart of this nanoscale architecture lies the nanocolumn. This aligns presynaptic neurotransmitter release with a high local density of postsynaptic receptor channels, thereby optimizing synaptic strength. Although synapses exhibit diverse protein compositions and nanoscale organizations, the role of structural diversity in the notable differences observed in synaptic physiology remains poorly understood. In this review we examine the current literature on the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of nanocolumns, as well as their role in modulating various aspects of synaptic transmission. We also discuss how the reorganization of nanocolumns contributes to functional dynamics in both synaptic plasticity and pathology.

                The evolution of vertebrates from protochordate ancestors marked the beginning of the gradual transition to predatory lifestyles. Enabled by the acquisition of multipotent neural crest and cranial placode cell populations, vertebrates developed an elaborate peripheral nervous system, equipped with paired sense organs, which aided in adaptive behaviors and ultimately, successful colonization of diverse environmental niches. Underpinning the enduring success of vertebrates is the highly adaptable nature of the peripheral nervous system, which is enabled by the exceptional malleability of the neural crest and placode developmental programs. Here, we explore the embryonic origins of the vertebrate senses from the neural crest and cranial placodes and discuss the evolutionary trajectory of the senses in the context of adaptation to novel environments.

                In this issue of Neuron, Ruggiero et al. demonstrate that hippocampal networks maintain a stable mean firing rate despite unstable individual units. This homeostatic control operates through NMDAR-eEF2K-BDNF signaling in parvalbumin interneurons. Their findings highlight a mechanism by which cellular machinery maintains emergent network properties, bridging molecular mechanisms with network-level computation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88652">Multi-study fMRI outlooks on subcortical BOLD responses in the stop-signal paradigm</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the functional network underlying response inhibition in the human brain, particularly the role of the basal ganglia in successful action cancellation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approaches have frequently used the stop-signal task to examine this network. We merge five such datasets, using a novel aggregatory method allowing the unification of raw fMRI data across sites. This meta-analysis, along with other recent aggregatory fMRI studies, does not find evidence for the innervation of the <i>hyperdirect</i> or <i>indirect</i> cortico-basal-ganglia pathways in successful response inhibition. What we do find, is large subcortical activity profiles for <i>failed stop</i> trials. We discuss possible explanations for the mismatch of findings between the fMRI results presented here and results from other research modalities that have implicated nodes of the basal ganglia in successful inhibition. We also highlight the substantial effect smoothing can have on the conclusions drawn from task-specific general linear models. First and foremost, this study presents a proof of concept for meta-analytical methods that enable the merging of extensive, unprocessed, or unreduced datasets. It demonstrates the significant potential that open-access data sharing can offer to the research community. With an increasing number of datasets being shared publicly, researchers will have the ability to conduct meta-analyses on more than just summary data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90841">Multisensory integration operates on correlated input from unimodal transient channels</a></h4>

              
                Audiovisual information reaches the brain via both sustained and transient input channels, representing signals’ intensity over time or changes thereof, respectively. To date, it is unclear to what extent transient and sustained input channels contribute to the combined percept obtained through multisensory integration. Based on the results of two novel psychophysical experiments, here we demonstrate the importance of the transient (instead of the sustained) channel for the integration of audiovisual signals. To account for the present results, we developed a biologically inspired, general-purpose model for multisensory integration, the multisensory correlation detectors, which combines correlated input from unimodal transient channels. Besides accounting for the results of our psychophysical experiments, this model could quantitatively replicate several recent findings in multisensory research, as tested against a large collection of published datasets. In particular, the model could simultaneously account for the perceived timing of audiovisual events, multisensory facilitation in detection tasks, causality judgments, and optimal integration. This study demonstrates that several phenomena in multisensory research that were previously considered unrelated, all stem from the integration of correlated input from unimodal transient channels.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94902">A double dissociation between semantic and spatial cognition in visual to default network pathways</a></h4>

              
                Processing pathways between sensory and default mode network (DMN) regions support recognition, navigation, and memory but their organisation is not well understood. We show that functional subdivisions of visual cortex and DMN sit at opposing ends of parallel streams of information processing that support visually mediated semantic and spatial cognition, providing convergent evidence from univariate and multivariate task responses, intrinsic functional and structural connectivity. Participants learned virtual environments consisting of buildings populated with objects, drawn from either a single semantic category or multiple categories. Later, they made semantic and spatial context decisions about these objects and buildings during functional magnetic resonance imaging. A lateral ventral occipital to fronto-temporal DMN pathway was primarily engaged by semantic judgements, while a medial visual to medial temporal DMN pathway supported spatial context judgements. These pathways had distinctive locations in functional connectivity space: the semantic pathway was both further from unimodal systems and more balanced between visual and auditory-motor regions compared with the spatial pathway. When semantic and spatial context information could be integrated (in buildings containing objects from a single category), regions at the intersection of these pathways responded, suggesting that parallel processing streams interact at multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy to produce coherent memory-guided cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91716">Deficiency of orexin receptor type 1 in dopaminergic neurons increases novelty-induced locomotion and exploration</a></h4>

              
                Orexin signaling in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra promotes locomotion and reward processing, but it is not clear whether dopaminergic neurons directly mediate these effects. We show that dopaminergic neurons in these areas mainly express orexin receptor subtype 1 (Ox1R). In contrast, only a minor population in the medial ventral tegmental area express orexin receptor subtype 2 (Ox2R). To analyze the functional role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons, we deleted Ox1R specifically in dopamine transporter-expressing neurons of mice and investigated the functional consequences. Deletion of Ox1R increased locomotor activity and exploration during exposure to novel environments or when intracerebroventricularely injected with orexin A. Spontaneous activity in home cages, anxiety, reward processing, and energy metabolism did not change. Positron emission tomography imaging revealed that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons affected distinct neural circuits depending on the stimulation mode. In line with an increase of neural activity in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) of Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, we found that dopaminergic projections innervate the LPGi in regions where the inhibitory dopamine receptor subtype D2 but not the excitatory D1 subtype resides. These data suggest a crucial regulatory role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration.

">Tool-use brain representations are independent of the acting body part and motor experience</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor system is broadly organized somatotopically. However, an action-type organization has also been found: a division based on action-type independent of acting body parts has been shown for reaching and grasping actions. Does this generalization extend to non-ethological actions? Here, we examined fMRI responses for tool-use actions that participants performed with their hands or feet. We additionally tested individuals born without hands to control for hand motor imagery when performing foot actions. We show that the primary sensorimotor cortices have hand and foot selectivity, consistent with a somatotopic organization. In contrast, higher-level motor areas within the tool-use network, such as the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and superior parietal cortices, showed a shared preference for tool-use independent of the executing body part and sensorimotor experience. Multivariate decoding of action-type in these areas generalized between controls' hand and foot and was successful in individuals born without hands. Finally, the temporal dynamics pattern in primary and association areas carried effector-specific and action-type information, respectively. Altogether, we show that the tool-use network in motor association areas represents higher-order action information beyond concrete motor parameters associated with specific effectors, and regardless of hand motor experience. This suggests that an action-type, effector-independent organization extends beyond ethological actions, supporting a hierarchical organization in the action domain. Further, it shows that functional organization in congenital handlessness is based on the hierarchical organization of the intact cortex.

">Demonstrating the need for long inter-stimulus intervals when studying the post-movement beta rebound following a simple button press</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary movements reliably elicit event-related synchronization of oscillatory neuronal rhythms in the beta (15-30 Hz) range immediately following movement offset, as measured by magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG). This response has been termed the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). While early work on the PMBR advocated for long inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) - arguing that the PMBR might persist for several seconds - these concerns have since fallen by the wayside, with many recent studies employing very short (< 5 s) ISIs. In this work we interrogated sensor-level MEG time courses in 635 individuals who participated in a cued button-pressing paradigm as part of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) project. We focussed on a subset of trials in which button presses were separated by at least 15 seconds and, using curve modelling and Bayesian inference, estimated the point at which beta power returned to baseline levels. We show that beta power takes around 4-5 seconds to return to baseline levels following movement. These results have important implications for experimental design. The PMBR is ubiquitously defined relative to a preceding baseline period; we argue that short ISIs preclude true baseline estimation and, in turn, accurate estimation of PMBR magnitude. We recommend that future studies targeting the PMBR use ISIs of at least 7-5 seconds for beta power to return to baseline, plus a 1-2 second period for proper baseline estimation. Further work is needed to clarify PMBR duration in the context of different sensorimotor paradigms and clinical populations.

">Large Animal Epilepsy Model Platform: Kainic Acid Porcine Model of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Translational animal models are essential for advancing neuromodulation therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy. Large animal epilepsy models that accommodate implantable neuromodulation devices designed for humans are needed to advance electrical brain stimulation and sensing applicaitons. We establish a kainic acid (KA) porcine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) for pre-clinical research and development of novel stimulating therapies. Methods: We developed a platform integrating MRI-guided stereotactic electrode and chemotoxin delivery with intraoperative and long-term electrophysiology monitoring. Six domestic pigs underwent MRI-guided stereotactic implantation of bilateral hippocampal (HPC) and anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) electrodes, followed by KA infusion into the right HPC. Local field potential (LFP) monitoring was conducted intraoperatively with a bedside workstation and chronically with an implantable neural sensing and recording (INSR) device designed for human use. Cresyl violet staining, commonly used to visualize neurons, was used to assess the neuropathophysiological effect of the KA infusion. Results: KA infusion led to the emergence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), acute status epilepticus (SE), and spontaneous seizure activity. Acute IEDs and electrographic SE was observed in all cases, with two pigs euthanized due to uncontrolled seizures. Of the surviving four pigs, spontaneous IEDs were detected in all, and spontaneous seizures within 2 weeks were observed in three. Seizures in freely behaving animals varied from subclinical events to focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Single pulse evoked response potentials (SPEP) measured in two pigs demonstrated functional connectivity between ANT and HPC circuits. Neuronal disorganization and loss, both major components of mTLE neuropathology were observed. Significance: The KA-induced porcine mTLE model supports the feasibility of testing human neuromodulation devices and provides a translational platform for studying therapeutic electrical sensing and stimulation. In particular, the model should be useful for advancing automated seizure diaries, closed-loop and adaptive therapies targeting Papez circuit nodes.

">Sensorimotor adaptation reveals systematic biases in 3D perception.</a></h4>

              
                The existence of biases in visual perception and their impact on visually guided actions has long been a fundamental yet unresolved question. Evidence revealing perceptual or visuomotor biases has typically been disregarded because such biases in spatial judgments can often be attributed to experimental measurement confounds. To resolve this controversy, we leveraged the visuomotor systems adaptation mechanism -- triggered only by a discrepancy between visual estimates and sensory feedback -- to directly indicate whether systematic errors in perceptual and visuomotor spatial judgments exist. To resolve this controversy, we leveraged the adaptive mechanisms of the visuomotor system to directly reveal whether systematic biases or errors in perceptual and visuomotor spatial judgments exist. In a within-subject study (N=24), participants grasped a virtual 3D object with varying numbers of depth cues (single vs. multiple) while receiving haptic feedback. The resulting visuomotor adaptations and aftereffects demonstrated that the planned grip size, determined by the visually perceived depth of the object, was consistently overestimated. This overestimation intensified when multiple cues were present, despite no actual change in physical depth. These findings conclusively confirm the presence of inherent biases in visual estimates for both perception and action, and highlight the potential use of visuomotor adaptation as a novel tool for understanding perceptual biases.

">Mef2c Controls Postnatal Callosal Axon Targeting by Regulating Sensitivity to Ephrin Repulsion</a></h4>

              
                Cortical connectivity is contingent on ordered emergence of neuron subtypes followed by the formation of subtype-specific axon projections. Intracortical circuits, including long-range callosal projections, are crucial for information processing, but mechanisms of intracortical axon targeting are still unclear. We find that the transcription factor Myocyte enhancer factor 2-c (Mef2c) directs the development of somatosensory cortical (S1) layer 4 and 5 pyramidal neurons during embryogenesis. During early postnatal development, Mef2c expression shifts to layer 2/3 callosal projection neurons (L2/3 CPNs), and we find a novel function for Mef2c in targeting homotopic contralateral cortical regions by S1-L2/3 CPNs. We demonstrate, using functional manipulation of EphA-EphrinA signaling in Mef2c-mutant CPNs, that Mef2c downregulates EphA6 to desensitize S1-L2/3 CPN axons to EphrinA5-repulsion at their contralateral targets. Our work uncovers dual roles for Mef2c in cortical development: regulation of laminar subtype specification during embryogenesis, and axon targeting in postnatal callosal neurons.

">Multimodal Neuroimaging Reveals Distinct Characteristics of Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesias in de novo Parkinsons Disease Patients</a></h4>

              
                Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a significant treatment complication that affects a substantial proportion of Parkinsons disease (PD) patients. Our understanding of the neural basis of LID remains limited, partly due to the small sample sizes in existing neuroimaging studies. In this study, we utilized structural MRI data from the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, including de novo PD patients (104 non-dyskinetic for a least 3 years after diagnosis and 120 who developed dyskinesia) and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Additionally, we analyzed resting-state functional MRI data from a subset of these participants to investigate connectivity differences among the groups. Our analysis revealed no significant baseline volumetric differences between dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic PD patients. However, the thickness of frontal and sensorimotor cortices was significantly greater in dyskinetic patients. In the subcortical regions, vertex-based shape analysis identified localized surface growth in the left caudate and left pallidum, as well as surface morphology changes in the bilateral pallidum in dyskinetics. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger connectivity between the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, and sensory cortex in dyskinetic PD patients compared to non-dyskinetics. These findings suggest that specific morphological and functional changes in the motor cortical-basal ganglia circuitry of de novo PD patients may predispose them to LID over time. Additionally, the altered functional connectivity patterns reinstate the role of the inferior frontal gyrus in the pathophysiology of dyskinesia and suggest that it might be a suitable target for neuromodulatory interventions, consistent with previous reports.

	<p>Background: Approach and avoidance bias (AAB) describes automatic behavioral tendencies to react toward environmental stimuli regarding their emotional valence. Traditional setups have provided evidence but often lack ecological validity. The study of the AAB in naturalistic contexts has recently increased, revealing significant methodological challenges. This systematic review evaluates the use of virtual reality (VR) and real-world setups to study the AAB, summarizing methodological innovations and challenges. Methods: We systematically reviewed peer-reviewed articles employing VR and real-world setups to investigate the AAB. We analyzed experimental designs, stimuli, response metrics, and technical aspects to assess their alignment with research objectives and identify limitations. Results: This review included 14 studies revealing diverse methodologies, stimulus types, and novel behavioral responses, highlighting significant variability in design strategies and methodological coherence. Several studies used traditional reaction time measures yet varied in their application of VR technology and participant interaction paradigms. Some studies showed discrepancies between simulated and natural bodily actions, while others showcased more integrated approaches that preserved their integrity. Only a minority of studies included control conditions or acquired (neuro)physiological data. Conclusions: VR offers a potential ecological setup for studying the AAB, enabling dynamic and immersive interactions. Our results underscore the importance of establishing a coherent framework for investigating the AAB tendencies using VR. Addressing the foundational challenges of developing baseline principles that guide VR-based designs to study the AAB within naturalistic contexts is essential for advancing the AAB research and application. This will ultimately contribute to more reliable and reproducible experimental paradigms and develop effective interventions that help individuals recognize and change their biases, fostering more balanced behaviors.</p>

	<p>Background: Exercise addiction, marked by an inability to control exercise and associated with distress that clinically impairs daily activities, is a significant but underrecognized issue in physical activity and health. While its physiological, psychological, and behavioral aspects have been studied, the genetic basis of exercise addiction remains poorly understood, requiring further investigation. The present study conducted a genome-wide association study of exercise addiction among elite Turkish wrestlers. Methods: The sample comprised 67 male wrestlers (34 freestyle wrestlers and 33 Greco-Roman wrestlers). Exercise addiction was assessed using the Exercise Addiction Scale. Whole-genome genotyping was performed using DNA microarray. Results: Using a genome-wide approach (p &amp;amp;lt; 1.0 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;&amp;amp;#8309;), we identified six suggestively significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with exercise addiction status. Of these, the high-addiction alleles of five SNPs (PRDM10 rs74345126, near PTPRU rs72652685, HADHB rs6745226, XIRP2 rs17614860, and near GAREM2 rs1025542) have previously been associated with an increased risk of mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression or higher levels of physical activity. We also examined potential associations between the genetic markers previously linked to addiction-related traits such as obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder and cigarette smoking, and personality traits linked to negative emotions including neuroticism. Using this candidate gene approach (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), we identified three additional SNPs associated with exercise addiction in the same direction of association (DEFB135 rs4841662, BCL11A rs7599488, and CSRNP3 rs1551336). Conclusions: The present study provides preliminary evidence for the genetic basis of exercise addiction, highlighting specific SNPs that may play a role in the development of this condition among elite wrestlers.</p>

                Objectives Good oral hygiene measures are important for successful orthodontic treatment. They involve various types of mouthwashes which have been reported to cause alteration of mechanical properties of archwires. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a new kind of chlorine-dioxide-containing mouthwash on the mechanical properties and surface morphology of stainless steel orthodontic archwires against the already prevalent chlorhexidine mouthwash in the market. Method Group A – Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (study), Group B – Chlorine Dioxide mouthwash (study), and Group C – Artificial Saliva (control). 42 specimens of 5 cm long 19x25 inch SS archwires were immersed in each group equally. Post immersion, the frictional force was analyzed in the universal testing machine for each group using custom-made acrylic jigs for 10 specimens. The remaining 4 specimens from each group were sent for surface morphology evaluation using an atomic force microscope. Results Friction resistance evaluation for the archwires revealed a mean friction of 0.011 ± 0.0056 in Group A, 0.015 ± 0.0052 in Group B, and 0.010 ± 0.0067 in Group C. Results suggested that the static friction of Group C (control group) was found to be the least when compared with the experimental groups, although not producing statistically significant values. Surface roughness of archwires compared at a 10μm range revealed a mean roughness of 19.38 ± 0.82 in Group A, 25.39 ± 7.01 in Group B, and 16.65 ± 3.07 in Group C which shows there wasn’t any statistically significant difference in the mean roughness midst the three sets. Conclusion Chlorine dioxide and Chlorhexidine mouthwashes caused an increase in the frictional resistance of the archwires when compared to the control group. When measured at a range of 10μm the mean surface roughness did not differ across the control and the experimental groups.

                Background Cervical cancer poses a significant public health challenge, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Despite advancements in treatment, the disease remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Chemoradiation utilizing cisplatin has been the cornerstone therapy for locally advanced cervical cancer. Prognostic biomarkers, including hematological parameters, have emerged as valuable tools in guiding treatment decisions and predicting outcomes. Methodology Data from patients treated between January 2021 and June 2022 were analyzed. Demographic information, histopathology, pre-treatment blood parameters, treatment details, and response assessments were collected. The parameters assessed included hemoglobin levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and eosinophil albumin ratio (EAR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine optimal cut-off values for these biomarkers. Results Of the 140 patients included, the majority had squamous cell carcinoma (92%) and were at stage II or III. Complete response to treatment was observed in 86.4% of patients. Non-responders demonstrated significantly higher levels of hemoglobin, NLR, and EAR, along with lower PNI levels compared to responders. ROC analysis revealed cut-off values for hemoglobin (< 9.5), NLR (< 2.98), PLR (> 289.26), PNI (< 37.67), and EAR (< 49.63) associated with treatment response. Conclusion The study highlights the potential utility of pre-treatment blood parameters as predictive markers for treatment response in locally advanced cervical cancer. Lower hemoglobin, higher NLR, and EAR, along with reduced PNI, were associated with poorer treatment outcomes. Integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could aid in treatment planning and improve patient outcomes. Further validation and prospective studies are warranted to establish the role of these biomarkers in guiding personalized treatment strategies for cervical cancer patients.

                Abstract* Background Intensive care units (ICUs) are essential for patient recovery, but prolonged stays often result in complications like reduced mobility and muscle weakness. Aims This study examines current ICU rehabilitation practices in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through a web-based cross-sectional survey involving 80 physiotherapists from both public and private sectors. Methods The questionnaire, validated by experts with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84, explored various rehabilitation strategies. Most participants held bachelor’s degrees and had 2-5 years of experience. Results Over 96% required physician referrals for ICU physiotherapy sessions, and 75% noted that hospitals provided development programs to enhance skills. Respiratory therapy, joint mobilization, and electrical stimulation were the most commonly used interventions, while massage, continuous passive motion machines, and taping were less frequently applied. Among neonatal ICU patients, 85.7% of physiotherapists regularly performed passive range of motion exercises, and 69% consistently involved parents in the treatment plan. The results indicate a variety of practices among ICU physiotherapists in the UAE, with no clear adherence to standardized protocols. This lack of consistency may negatively affect patient care quality. Conclusion The study underscores the importance of implementing standardized rehabilitation protocols and enhancing patient education to improve outcomes in ICU settings.

It has been classically conjectured that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli. An important issue associated with this conjecture is the identification of the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task. We address this issue by using a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. This clustering procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus in order to build a model.

                <p>by Xiaojun Wu, MeiLu McDermott, Adam L MacLean</p>

Biological systems exhibit complex dynamics that differential equations can often adeptly represent. Ordinary differential equation models are widespread; until recently their construction has required extensive prior knowledge of the system. Machine learning methods offer alternative means of model construction: differential equation models can be learnt from data via model discovery using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and is limited in its ability to incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dynamics of a system, enabling the denoising of the data while simultaneously learning the latent dynamics. Simulations from the fitted neural network are then used to infer models using sparse regression. We show, via model selection, that model discovery using hybrid dynamical systems outperforms alternative approaches. We find it possible to infer models correctly up to high levels of biological noise of different types. We demonstrate the potential to learn models from sparse, noisy data in application to a canonical cell state transition using data derived from single-cell transcriptomics. Overall, this approach provides a practical framework for model discovery in biology in cases where data are noisy and sparse, of particular utility when the underlying biological mechanisms are partially but incompletely known.

                <p>by Meichen Fang, Gennady Gorin, Lior Pachter</p>

Single-cell transcriptomics experiments provide gene expression snapshots of heterogeneous cell populations across cell states. These snapshots have been used to infer trajectories and dynamic information even without intensive, time-series data by ordering cells according to gene expression similarity. However, while single-cell snapshots sometimes offer valuable insights into dynamic processes, current methods for ordering cells are limited by descriptive notions of “pseudotime” that lack intrinsic physical meaning. Instead of pseudotime, we propose inference of “process time” via a principled modeling approach to formulating trajectories and inferring latent variables corresponding to timing of cells subject to a biophysical process. Our implementation of this approach, called Chronocell, provides a biophysical formulation of trajectories built on cell state transitions. The Chronocell model is identifiable, making parameter inference meaningful. Furthermore, Chronocell can interpolate between trajectory inference, when cell states lie on a continuum, and clustering, when cells cluster into discrete states. By using a variety of datasets ranging from cluster-like to continuous, we show that Chronocell enables us to assess the suitability of datasets and reveals distinct cellular distributions along process time that are consistent with biological process times. We also compare our parameter estimates of degradation rates to those derived from metabolic labeling datasets, thereby showcasing the biophysical utility of Chronocell. Nevertheless, based on performance characterization on simulations, we find that process time inference can be challenging, highlighting the importance of dataset quality and careful model assessment.

                <p>by Peng Ren, Xuehua Cui, Xia Liang</p>

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration or death of neurons. The complexity of clinical symptoms and irreversibility of disease progression significantly affects individual lives, leading to premature mortality. The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases keeps increasing, yet the specific pathogenic mechanisms remain incompletely understood and effective treatment strategies are lacking. In recent years, convergent experimental evidence supports the “prion-like transmission” assumption that abnormal proteins induce misfolding of normal proteins, and these misfolded proteins propagate throughout the neural networks to cause neuronal death. To elucidate this dynamic process in vivo from a computational perspective, researchers have proposed three connectome-based biophysical models to simulate the spread of pathological proteins: the Network Diffusion Model, the Epidemic Spreading Model, and the agent-based Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model. These models have demonstrated promising predictive capabilities. This review focuses on the explanations of their fundamental principles and applications. Then, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of the models. Building upon this foundation, we introduce new directions for model optimization and propose a unified framework for the evaluation of connectome-based biophysical models. We expect that this review could lower the entry barrier for researchers in this field, accelerate model optimization, and thereby advance the clinical translation of connectome-based biophysical models.

<i>Gaussia</i> Luciferase (GLuc) is a renowned reporter protein that can catalyze the oxidation of coelenterazine (CTZ) and emit a bright light signal. GLuc comprises two consecutive repeats that form the enzyme body and a central putative catalytic cavity. However, deleting the C-terminal repeat only limited reduces the activity (over 30% residual luminescence intensity detectable), despite being a key part of the cavity. How does the remaining GLuc (tGLuc) catalyze CTZ? To address this question, we built a structural model of tGLuc by removing the C-terminal repeat from the resolved structure of intact GLuc, and verified that the cavity-forming component in GLuc remains stable and provides an open-mouth cavity in tGLuc during 500 ns MD simulations in water. Docking simulation and a followed umbrella sampling analysis further revealed that the cavity on tGLuc has a high affinity for CTZ, with a binding energy of up to -114 kJ/mol. Moreover, R76, a validated activity-critical amino acid residue, resides in the cavity and forms a stable hydrogen bond with CTZ. Then, we constructed a cluster model to examine the CTZ oxidation pathway in the cavity using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The result showed that the pathway consists of four elementary reactions, with the highest Gibbs energy barrier being 65.4 kJ/mol. Both intramolecular electron transfer and the convergence of S1/S0 potential energy surfaces occurred in the last elementary reaction, which was regarded as the reported Chemically-Initiated-Electron-Exchange-Luminescence (CIEEL) reaction. Geometry and wavefunction analysis on the pathway indicated that R76 plays a vital role in CTZ oxidation, which first anchors the environmental oxygen molecule and induces it to form a singlet biradical state, facilitating its attack on CTZ. Subsequently, R76 and the adjacent Q88, positioned near R76 through the tGLuc refolding process, stabilize the transition states and facilitate the emergence of radical electrons on CTZ at the onset of the CIEEL reaction, which contributes to the subsequent intramolecular electron transfer and the production of excited amide product. This study provides a comprehensive explanation of tGLuc’s catalytic mechanism. However, it is important to note that these findings are specific to tGLuc and may not extend to other CTZ-based luciferases, particularly those lacking arginine in their catalytic cavities, which likely operate via distinct mechanisms.

This study introduces a novel neuromechanical model employing a detailed spiking neural network to explore the role of axial proprioceptive sensory feedback, namely stretch feedback, in salamander locomotion. Unlike previous studies that often oversimplified the dynamics of the locomotor networks, our model includes detailed simulations of the classes of neurons that are considered responsible for generating movement patterns. The locomotor circuits, modeled as a spiking neural network of adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, are coupled to a three-dimensional mechanical model of a salamander with realistic physical parameters and simulated muscles. In open-loop simulations (i.e., without sensory feedback), the model replicates locomotor patterns observed in-vitro and in-vivo for swimming and trotting gaits. Additionally, a modular descending reticulospinal drive to the central pattern generation network allows to accurately control the activation, frequency and phase relationship of the different sections of the limb and axial circuits. In closed-loop swimming simulations (i.e. including axial stretch feedback), systematic evaluations reveal that intermediate values of feedback strength increase the tail beat frequency and reduce the intersegmental phase lag, contributing to a more coordinated, faster and energy-efficient locomotion. Interestingly, the result is conserved across different feedback topologies (ascending or descending, excitatory or inhibitory), suggesting that it may be an inherent property of axial proprioception. Moreover, intermediate feedback strengths expand the stability region of the network, enhancing its tolerance to a wider range of descending drives, internal parameters’ modifications and noise levels. Conversely, high values of feedback strength lead to a loss of controllability of the network and a degradation of its locomotor performance. Overall, this study highlights the beneficial role of proprioception in generating, modulating and stabilizing locomotion patterns, provided that it does not excessively override centrally-generated locomotor rhythms. This work also underscores the critical role of detailed, biologically-realistic neural networks to improve our understanding of vertebrate locomotion.

Coronaviruses express their structural and accessory genes via a set of subgenomic RNAs, whose synthesis is directed by transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) in the 5′ genomic leader and upstream of each body open reading frame. In SARS-CoV-2, the TRS has the consensus AAACGAAC; upon searching for emergence of this motif in the global SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we find that it evolves frequently, especially in the 3′ end of the genome. We show well-supported examples upstream of the Spike gene—within the nsp16 coding region of ORF1b—which is expressed during human infection, and upstream of the canonical Envelope gene TRS, both of which have evolved convergently in multiple lineages. The most frequent neo-TRS is within the coding region of the Nucleocapsid gene, and is present in virtually all viruses from the B.1.1 lineage, including the variants of concern Alpha, Gamma, Omicron and descendants thereof. Here, we demonstrate that this TRS leads to the expression of a novel subgenomic mRNA encoding a truncated C-terminal portion of Nucleocapsid, which is an antagonist of type I interferon production and contributes to viral fitness during infection. We observe distinct phenotypes when the Nucleocapsid coding sequence is mutated compared to when the TRS alone is ablated. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing evolutionary changes at the functional RNA level in addition to the amino acid level.

                <p>by Cas W. Coopmans, Helen de Hoop, Filiz Tezcan, Peter Hagoort, Andrea E. Martin</p>

Studies of perception have long shown that the brain adds information to its sensory analysis of the physical environment. A touchstone example for humans is language use: to comprehend a physical signal like speech, the brain must add linguistic knowledge, including syntax. Yet, syntactic rules and representations are widely assumed to be atemporal (i.e., abstract and not bound by time), so they must be translated into time-varying signals for speech comprehension and production. Here, we test 3 different models of the temporal spell-out of syntactic structure against brain activity of people listening to Dutch stories: an integratory bottom-up parser, a predictive top-down parser, and a mildly predictive left-corner parser. These models build exactly the same structure but differ in when syntactic information is added by the brain—this difference is captured in the (temporal distribution of the) complexity metric “incremental node count.” Using temporal response function models with both acoustic and information-theoretic control predictors, node counts were regressed against source-reconstructed delta-band activity acquired with magnetoencephalography. Neural dynamics in left frontal and temporal regions most strongly reflect node counts derived by the top-down method, which postulates syntax early in time, suggesting that predictive structure building is an important component of Dutch sentence comprehension. The absence of strong effects of the left-corner model further suggests that its mildly predictive strategy does not represent Dutch language comprehension well, in contrast to what has been found for English. Understanding when the brain projects its knowledge of syntax onto speech, and whether this is done in language-specific ways, will inform and constrain the development of mechanistic models of syntactic structure building in the brain.

A single exposure to a stressful event can result in enduring changes in behaviour. Long-term modifications in neuronal networks induced by stress are well explored but the initial steps leading to these alterations remain incompletely understood. In this study, we found that acute stress exposure triggers an immediate increase in the firing activity of calretinin-positive neurons in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT/CR+) that persists for several days in mice. This increase in activity had a causal role in stress-induced changes in spontaneous behaviour. Attenuating PVT/CR+ neuronal activity for only 1 h after the stress event rescued both the protracted increase in PVT/CR+ firing rate and the stress-induced behavioural alterations. Activation of the key forebrain targets (basolateral amygdala, prelimbic cortex, and nucleus accumbens) that mediate defensive behaviour has also been reduced by this post-stress inhibition. Reduction of PVT/CR+ cell activity 5 days later remained still effective in ameliorating stress-induced changes in spontaneous behaviour. The results demonstrate a critical role of the prolonged, post-stress changes in firing activity of PVT/CR+ neurons in shaping the behavioural changes associated with stress. Our data proposes a therapeutic window for intervention in acute stress-related disorders, offering potential avenues for targeted treatment strategies.

Bacteriophages infect gram-negative bacteria by attaching to molecules present on the bacterial surface, often lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Modification of LPS can lead to resistance to phage infection. In addition, LPS modifications can impact antibiotic susceptibility, allowing for phage–antibiotic synergism. The evolutionary mechanism(s) behind such synergistic interactions remain largely unclear. Here, we show that the presence of antibiotics can affect the evolution of resistance to phage infection, using phage ΦX174 and <i>Escherichia coli</i> C. We use a collection of 34 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> C LPS strains, each of which is resistant to ΦX174, and has either a “rough” or “deep rough” LPS phenotype. Growth of the bacterial strains with the deep rough phenotype is inhibited at low concentrations of chloramphenicol and, to a much lesser degree, gentamicin. Treating <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> C wild type with ΦX174 and chloramphenicol eliminates the emergence of mutants with the deep rough phenotype, and thereby slows the evolution of resistance to phage infection. At slightly lower chloramphenicol concentrations, phage resistance rates are similar to those observed at high concentrations; yet, we show that the diversity of possible mutants is much larger than at higher chloramphenicol concentrations. These data suggest that specific antibiotic concentrations can lead to synergistic phage–antibiotic interactions that disappear at higher antibiotic concentrations. Overall, we show that the change in survival of various ΦX174-resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> C mutants in the presence of antibiotics can explain the observed phage–antibiotic synergism.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections drive one in 20 new cancer cases, exerting a particularly high burden on women. Most anogenital HPV infections are cleared in less than two years, but the underlying mechanisms that favour persistence in around 10% of women remain largely unknown. Notwithstanding, it is precisely this information that is crucial for improving treatment, screening, and vaccination strategies. To understand viral and immune dynamics in non-persisting HPV infections, we set up an observational longitudinal cohort study with frequent on-site visits for biological sample collection. We enrolled 189 women aged from 18 to 25 and living in the area of Montpellier (France) between 2016 and 2020. We performed 974 on-site visits for a total of 1,619 months of follow-up. We collected data on virus load, local immune cell populations, local concentrations of cytokines, and circulating antibody titres. Using hierarchical Bayesian statistical modelling to simultaneously analyse the data from 164 HPV infections from 76 participants, we show that in two months after infection, HPV viral load in non-persisting infections reaches a plateau that lasts on average for 13 to 20 months (95% credibility interval) and is then followed by a rapid clearance phase. This first description of the dynamics of HPV infections comes with the identification of immune correlates associated with infection clearance, especially gamma-delta T cells and CXCL10 concentration. A limitation of this study on HPV kinetics is that many infection follow-ups are censored. Furthermore, some immune cell populations are difficult to label because cervical immunity is less well characterised than systemic immunity. These results open new perspectives for understanding the frontier between acute and chronic infections, and for controlling HPV-associated diseases, as well as for research on human cancers of infectious origin.
