                Huang et al. identify a feedback loop where caspase-1 cleaves MST1, enhancing its activity. Activated MST1 phosphorylates ASC at Ser58, disrupting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This negative feedback restrains inflammasome hyperactivation and reduces sepsis in vivo, highlighting MST1 cleavage as a potential therapeutic target for inflammation control.

">A brain-specific microRNA, miR-1000, regulates lipid homeostasis via Neuropeptide-like precursor 1 in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Metabolism requires precise gene regulation to balance energy intake and expenditure for an organism's well-being, with misregulation often leading to metabolic syndromes. This study reveals that the brain-specific microRNA miR-1000 regulates fat storage by controlling the expression of a neuropeptide gene, Nplp1. Loss of miR-1000 increases Nplp1 expression, leading to higher body weight, increased fat storage, improved survival under food deprivation conditions, and a reduced overall lifespan in Drosophila. We further show that miR-1000 promotes fat storage upon feeding by regulating TAG synthesis and storage in lipid droplets, thereby playing a crucial role in metabolic regulation.

">Control of walking direction by descending and dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Animals need to fine-control the speed and direction of locomotion to navigate complex and dynamic environments. To achieve this, they integrate multimodal sensory inputs with their internal drive to constantly adjust their motor output. This integration involves the interplay of neuronal populations across different hierarchical levels along the sensorimotor axis - from sensory, central, and modulatory neurons in the brain to descending neurons and motor networks in the nerve cord. Here, we characterize two populations of neurons that control distinct aspects of walking on different hierarchical levels in Drosophila. First, we use in-vivo electrophysiological recordings to demonstrate that moonwalker descending neurons (MDN) integrate antennal touch to drive changes in walking direction from forward to backward. Second, we establish DopaMeander as an important component in the control of forward walking through a combination of optogenetic activation, silencing, connectomics, and in-vivo recordings. These dopaminergic modulatory neurons drive forward walking with increased turning, and the activity of individual neurons is correlated with ipsiversive turning. Hence, MDN and DopaMeander control opposite regimes of walking on different hierarchical levels. Computational models reveal that their activity predicts key parameters of spontaneous walking. Moreover, we find that both MDN and DopaMeander are gated out during flight. This suggests that neuronal populations across levels of control are modulated by the behavioral state to minimize cross-talk between motor programs.

">Acute EtOH enhances septohippocampal coordination but disrupts intrinsic hippocampal theta dynamics during foraging</a></h4>

              
                Theta oscillations - rhythmic patterns of synchronous activity within discrete brain regions - are known to support memory, navigation, and behavioral coordination, and are sensitive to pharmacological manipulation. Acute ethanol (EtOH) exposure has been shown to alter theta oscillations, but its effects on transient theta bursts and cross-regional coordination during naturalistic behavior remain unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the medial septum (MS), hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in freely foraging mice following intraperitoneal injection of EtOH (1.5 g/kg) or saline. We analyzed spectral power, theta burst dynamics, phase, and lag timing. Burst features from CA1 were used to train a machine learning classifier to predict session condition. EtOH impaired locomotion and reduced goal-directed behaviors, particularly early in the session. In CA1, theta power shifted toward lower frequencies and lagged coherence declined. EtOH increased the frequency but reduced the duration of theta bursts in CA1, and in MS, only burst count increased. EtOH enhanced the temporal alignment of MS-CA1 burst pairs. Phase-locking between CA1 and MS during coupled bursts remained present but showed altered structure. Our classifier achieved robust performance using burst features such as skew and entropy, and reliably distinguished treatment conditions. EtOH modulates septohippocampal dynamics by altering the timing and structure of theta bursts. These results suggest that burst-level features are sensitive markers of EtOH's circuit-level effects during naturalistic behavior.

">Human hippocampal ripples loosen medial prefrontal constraints to foster creative thinking</a></h4>

              
                Creative thinking often requires breaking away from dominant mental schemas to generate novel and useful ideas. Yet how the human brain relaxes schematic constraints to enable creativity remains unclear. Using human intracranial EEG recordings, we found that moments of creative idea generation were accompanied by increased hippocampal ripple events, a concurrent reduction in ripple-triggered high-frequency activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and greater divergence of ripple-triggered mPFC activity patterns from the typical, schema-like task state. These effects followed a dorsal-ventral gradient within the mPFC and were most pronounced in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), a region heavily involved in schematic representation. Together, our findings suggest that hippocampal ripples can transiently disengage medial prefrontal schema constraints, thereby promoting more flexible and creative thinking.

">Normal aging impacts the extent and diversity of neural plasticity induced in the mouse brain with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an attractive tool to promote healthy brain ageing in older adults and treat age-related neurological conditions. Despite its popularity, the neurological processes and plasticity mechanisms altered by rTMS in the aged brain, and where these changes occur in the brain are unknown. Furthermore, it is not known why different rTMS protocols induce different changes in the aged brain, or why rTMS is less effective in older adults compared to younger adults. Using spatial transcriptomics, we uncovered that rTMS primarily acts on genes related to synaptic plasticity in both cortical and subcortical circuits in aged mice, but the specific changes were dependent on the brain region and even down to individual cortical layers in the motor and somatosensory cortices. Comparing our results from aged mice to young adult mice revealed that rTMS acts on a larger variety of neural plasticity mechanisms in the young adult brain, and that rTMS was less effective at altering gene expression related to neural plasticity in the aged brain, but this varied between brain regions and the protocol of rTMS applied. These findings provide a comprehensive map of the mechanisms altered by rTMS across the aged brain and highlight the need to consider the effect of ageing when optimising rTMS protocols for older populations.

">Spatial transcriptomic profiling uncovers the molecular effects of the neurotoxicant polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the brains of adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Environmental toxicants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are highly stable synthetic organic compounds that are present in air, water, and soil. PCBs have been identified in post-mortem human brains of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a possible link between environmental factors and disease risk. Research has revealed an association between PCB exposure and cognitive decline. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate how PCB mixtures relevant to humans affect brain function and cognition. To investigate the effects of PCBs on memory and transcriptomic profiles, we exposed adult male C57BL/6J mice orally to a synthetic PCB mixture daily. After seven weeks of exposure, the mice were assessed in a spatial object recognition task (SOR) to evaluate long-term spatial memory. Our findings showed that mice exposed to PCBs exhibited deficits in long-term spatial memory. To examine the molecular effects of PCB on the brain, we used a spatial transcriptomics technique to analyze gene expression changes in five brain regions: the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, caudal putamen, and fiber tracts. Our analysis of spatial gene expression revealed the molecular signatures influenced by PCB in these susceptible brain regions of mice. Network analysis suggests that these changes are associated with higher chlorinated PCBs present in the brain. Additionally, we show that PCB exposure disrupts the expression of tight junction proteins, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, our results offer mechanistic insights into how PCB exposure affects brain function and cognition.

">MOTUM: a system for Motion Online Tracking Under MRI</a></h4>

              
                Attempts to implement realistic body-environment interactions during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments have developed expensive, hardly reproducible, and task-specific setups. Here, we introduce MOTUM (Motion Online Tracking Under MRI), a novel system that combines real-time kinematic tracking with immersive virtual reality, enabling participants to perform naturalistic movements inside the scanner. As a proof-of-concept, we tested MOTUM during a reach-to-grasp task with and without visual feedback of one's hand (N = 7). The system achieved high-fidelity motion tracking, induced an intense immersive experience, evoked expected sensorimotor brain activations, and maintained high fMRI data quality. Standard fMRI control metrics were below the critical threshold in 99% of volumes, indicating that participants' arm movements had minimal impact on head motion and data quality. While hand movements had little to no effect on brain activity, arm movements resulted in sparse spurious correlations that were easily controlled for. Critically, MOTUM allowed us to extract rich kinematic indices and link them directly to brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis. Parametric modulation analyses revealed that natural variations in movement dynamics significantly influenced neural responses in parietal, frontal, and occipital regions. In sum, MOTUM is a robust method to study motor control and beyond, enabling a new class of fMRI experiments that bridge ecological realism and experimental control, pushing current neuroimaging research towards real-life neuroscience.

                Methods for monitoring physiological changes in cellular Ca2+ levels have been in high demand for their utility in monitoring neuronal signaling. Recently, we introduced SCANR (Split-Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease Calcium-regulated Neuron Recorder), which reports on Ca2+ changes in cells through the binding of calmodulin and M13 to reconstitute an active TEV protease. First-generation SCANR marked all of the Ca2+ spikes that occur throughout the lifetime of the cell, but it did not have a mechanism for controlling the time window in which recording of physiological changes in Ca2+ occurred. Here, we explore both chemical and light-based strategies for controlling the time and place in which Ca2+ recording occurs. We describe the adaptation of six popular chemo- and opto-genetics methods for controlling protein activity and subcellular localization to the SCANR system. We report two successful strategies, one that leverages the LOV-J optogenetics system for sterically controlling protein interactions and another that employs chemogenetic manipulation of subcellular protein distribution using the FKBP/FRB rapamycin binding pair.

">Neural affect decoding from minimal spectrotemporal glimpses of voice signals</a></h4>

              
                Decoding affect information from voice signals is challenging in natural environments where noise masks the most diagnostic and discriminative acoustic voice information. The extent to which neural affect decoding is resilient against or vulnerable to extreme noise-masking of voice signals remains largely unknown. Here, we performed three experiments using an auditory bubble technique to randomly mask and unmask certain spectrotemporal voice features similar to natural noise masking. First, using psychoacoustic voice-in-noise testing, we observed that a substantial part of the full spectrotemporal space of voice signals contains diagnostic cues essential for accurate affect decoding, contributing to the partial robustness of the voice signals under noise masking. Affective voice signals (joy, aggression) were correctly identified from early broadband spectral and temporally extended high-frequency information. Neutral voices were primarily identified from low- to medium-level spectral information with high perceptual relevance near the voice offset. Second, using human neuroimaging, we mechanistically linked neural activity to minimal spectrotemporal patches that enable accurate affect classification from voice samples. A neural network composed of (sub-)cortical auditory and limbic nodes, fronto-insular regions, and vocal motor mirroring nodes supported the affective discrimination of voice signals. More specifically, activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala was mechanistically linked to correct affect decisions, as determined by a reverse brain-to-decision mapping approach. Thus, decoding affect from voice signals embedded in complex noise seems partially feasible, provided that the noise does not obscure the minimal diagnostic spectrotemporal information essential for engaging cortical and subcortical limbic affect decoding mechanisms.

">Satiety does not abolish Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer but accelerates devaluation in humans</a></h4>

              
                Environmental cues that predict palatable food can robustly drive behavior, override satiety signals and promote maladaptive eating habits. However, conventional human paradigms often fail to capture the dynamic interplay between hunger, satiety, and cue-induced behavioral actions. To address this, we built a novel automated dispenser synchronized with task events and integrated into an adapted human Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm to deliver real, consumable food rewards in real time, allowing participants to eat online and thereby induce satiation or sustain hunger. In one experiment, we manipulated food rewards by varying portion size and consumption timing. Large portions consumed immediately induced rapid satiation, whereas small, trial-by-trial portions kept participants non-satiated; correspondingly, large portions accelerated devaluation of the food reward, evidenced by a pronounced decline in instrumental responding, while small portions sustained cue-driven behavior over time. In a subsequent experiment, small, immediately consumed food rewards (which kept participants non-satiated) were directly compared with real-time monetary rewards. Although both reward types initially invigorated behavior, the motivational impact of monetary rewards declined quicker, suggesting that the absence of physiological feedback renders secondary reinforcers more vulnerable to rapid devaluation. These findings suggest that satiety accelerates, rather than abolishes, the influence of food-associated cues. The distinct temporal dynamics observed for food and monetary outcomes underscore the importance of real-time ingestion in human PIT paradigms, offering new insights into the mechanisms by which physiological states modulate cue-driven devaluation.

">Many-Two-One: Diverse Representations Across Visual Pathways Emerge from A Single Objective</a></h4>

              
                How the human brain supports diverse behaviours has been debated for decades. The canonical view divides visual processing into distinct "what" and "where/how" streams -- however, their origin and independence remain contested. Here, using deep neural network models that accurately predict hours of brain recordings, we computationally characterise how cortex processes dynamic vision. Despite the diversity of cortical regions and thereby supported tasks, we identify two fundamental computations that explain neural activity across visual cortex: object and appearance-free motion recognition. Strikingly, a single objective underlies both: these inherent computations in the brain emerge from optimising for understanding world dynamics, and their arrangement is highly distributed and smooth across cortex rather than strictly aligning with the two visual streams. Our results suggest that the human brain's ability to integrate complex information across seemingly distinct representational pathways may originate from the single goal of modelling the world.

">Non-invasive Stimulation of Contralateral Primary Motor Cortex Reduces the Amount of Skill Generalization to the Untrained Arm</a></h4>

              
                Successfully learned motor skills can generalize or transfer to the untrained arm. The neural substrate underlying such intermanual/interlimb generalization of newly acquired skill memory is unclear. Here, we focused on contralateral primary motor cortex (cM1) which is considered a key brain area for skill learning and memory consolidation. We probed the causal role of cM1 in intermanual skill generalization in a two-day study involving right-handed young individuals (n=31) who learned a novel motor skill reaching task. Immediately following (right-arm) learning, we delivered low-frequency (1Hz, 1800 pulses) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to target left cM1 in one group of individuals (n=15), while another group (n=16) served as an active control in which ipsilateral M1 (iM1) was targeted. On the same day we measured corticospinal excitability (CSE) to assess learning-induced and rTMS-induced neuroplastic changes occurring in the targeted M1s. Next day after 24-hours, both groups were tested for intermanual skill generalization (left-arm), followed by a brief test of intralimb retention (right-arm). Our results show that stimulating cM1, versus iM1, reduced the amount of generalization to the untrained arm on the next day, without affecting its (re)learning ability or the follow-up retention performance of the trained arm. Further, rTMS stimulation induced a net facilitation in CSE- with higher facilitation tending to correlate to lower generalization in a subset of high learners in cM1 group. Taken together, this study highlights the role of cM1 in skill generalization such that it seems to mediate the early transfer of learning to the untrained arm.

">C1q limits cystoid edema by maintaining basal beta-catenin-dependent signaling and blood-retina barrier function</a></h4>

              
                Macular edema (ME) causes significant vision impairment and occurs in several prevalent retinal diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR), choroidal neovascularization (CNV), retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis. Retinal edema typically results from dysfunction of the blood-retina barrier (BRB), which is associated with increased retinal expression of complement components. It is unclear whether the classical complement pathway has detrimental or protective roles in the context of BRB dysfunction. Here, we characterize Tspan12 KODBM (Disrupted Barrier Maintenance) mice, a new mouse model of cystoid edema based on genetically and pharmacologically manipulating beta-catenin-dependent norrin/frizzled4 (FZD4) signaling. We assess BRB function, cystoid edema, ERG, and microglia activation outcomes in an aging study with WT, C1qa KO, Tspan12 KODBM, and Tspan12 KODBM; C1qa KO compound mutant mice. Phenotypic analyses and cell-based experiments indicate that C1QA contributes to maintaining basal beta-catenin-dependent signaling and that the absence of C1QA exacerbates BRB dysfunction, cystoid edema, and neuroinflammation in Tspan12 KODBM; C1qa compound mutant mice. Activation of beta-catenin-dependent signaling by a FZD4/LRP5 agonist antibody modality achieves complete resolution of cystoid edema. This study shows that reducing or enhancing norrin/frizzled4 signaling can increase or decrease cystoid edema, respectively, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in ME. Furthermore, this study provides novel insights into the contribution of C1QA to BRB maintenance.

">Cocaine and Morphine Converge to Disrupt Chloride Homeostasis in Ventral Tegmental Area GABA Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Identifying shared neural mechanisms influenced by diverse classes of drugs of abuse is essential for understanding addiction and for developing broad-spectrum treatments for substance use disorders. Previous studies indicate that many drugs of abuse increase dopamine output from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) by altering the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto dopamine neurons, thereby promoting maladaptive plasticity within reward circuits. Here, we demonstrate in rats that acute injections of morphine and cocaine, but not saline, disrupt chloride homeostasis in VTA GABA neurons. This disruption is characterized by a depolarized GABAA reversal potential, impaired chloride extrusion, and posttranslational downregulation of the potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2. Although previous studies linked drug-induced posttranslational downregulation of KCC2 in the VTA to glucocorticoid receptor activation, we found that a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist did not prevent cocaine- and morphine-induced disruption of chloride homeostasis. Instead, our data show that dopamine receptor activation is both necessary and sufficient for these alterations. Notably, chloride homeostasis remains impaired 30 days after volitional morphine self-administration, indicating long-lasting plasticity. These findings complement previous work on nicotine and alcohol, suggesting a shared mechanism of inhibitory plasticity in the VTA following drug exposure. Given that chloride dysregulation in VTA GABA neurons influences downstream circuit function and promotes maladaptive behaviors associated with drug use, we propose KCC2 as a promising therapeutic target for substance use disorders.

">Activation of Endogenous Spinal Cord Stem Cell Mediates Recovery Induced by Olfactory Ensheathing Cell Transplantation Following Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to irreversible motor and sensory deficits and currently has no curative treatment. Among the various therapeutic strategies explored, cell transplantation, using either stem or differentiated cells, has been extensively studied. One of the most promising approaches involves the use of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which have demonstrated unique potential to promote functional recovery and tissue repair following SCI. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how OEC transplantation modulates endogenous spinal stem cells, with a particular focus on ependymal cells. Using inducible transgenic mouse lines and fate-mapping approaches, we show that OEC transplantation significantly enhances ependymal cell proliferation and self-renewal both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, OECs promote astrocytic differentiation of ependymal progeny, which express low levels of inhibitory molecules, suggesting a supportive role in creating a permissive scar microenvironment. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that OEC transplantation downregulates genes associated with axonal growth inhibition, thereby contributing to improved neuronal survival. Finally, by using a unique transgenic mouse model in which ependymal cell proliferation is genetically blocked, we demonstrate that the beneficial effects of OEC transplantation depend on ependymal cell activation. Together, these findings establish ependymal cells as essential mediators of the regenerative response induced by OECs. They also highlight a therapeutic strategy based on activating and modulating endogenous stem cells via the transient presence of non-integrating transplanted glial cells. This work contributes to our understanding of SCI repair and supports the clinical potential of OEC-based cell therapies.

">Integrated Multi-omics Prioritizes Ribosomal-targeting Omacetaxine Mepesuccinate for Optic Neuritis Therapy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Optic neuritis (ON), an acute demyelinating disorder often preceding multiple sclerosis, lacks therapies preventing neurodegeneration despite corticosteroid use. Methods: We combined GWAS (FinnGen cohort, finn-b-H7_OPTNEURITIS), immune-specific eQTL analysis (CAGE.sparse microglia/astrocytes), and network pharmacology. SMR-HEIDI filtering (p_HEIDI>0.05; FDR<0.05) validated causal genes. Results: 46 ON-associated genes identified, with HLA-DRB1 as top risk locus (OR=3.297, FDR<0.01).Functional enrichment revealed antigen presentation dysregulation (GO:0002483, FDR=0.0025) and phagosome activation (hsa04145, FDR=0.0468), confirming microglial-astrocytic pathology. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate prioritized as sole repurposing candidate (FDR=0.0467) targeting ribosomal proteins RPL3/RPL2-mechanistically linked to glial protein synthesis suppression in demyelination. Conclusions: This first multi-omics analysis of ON bridges HLA-mediated autoimmunity with repurposed ribosomal-targeted therapy, proposing omacetaxine for neuroprotection.

">Role of oligodendroglial ADAM10 in oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination and myelin maintenance</a></h4>

              
                In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes extend their processes to wrap axons to form myelin sheaths, ensuring saltatory conduction of action potentials and providing trophic support for the axon. Our previous work demonstrated that pharmacological activation of -secretase promotes myelin protection and remyelination after both ex vivo and in vivo demyelination. Based on these findings, the present study aims to investigate the role of oligodendroglial ADAM10 (OLA10; a member of the a-secretase family) in myelin development and maintenance. Using an inducible knockout mouse model for OLA10 (KOOL-A10), we demonstrated that OLA10 deficiency results in delayed maturation of OPC in primary culture, and altered myelination in primary neuron/glia co-culture. Furthermore, an induction of OLA10 deficiency in adult mice was associated with an alteration of myelin sheath thickness and long-term motor and cognitive deficit in males but not in females. Overall, our study highlights the subtle but significant role of ADAM10 expressed by oligodendrocytes in the formation and maintenance of the myelin over time, while emphasizing a sexual dimorphism that carries important relevance for current research.

">Developmental prosopagnosics have normal spatial integration in posterior ventral face-selective regions</a></h4>

              
                Population receptive field (pRF) mapping is an influential neuroimaging technique used to estimate the region of visual space modulating the response of a neuronal population. While pRF mapping has advanced our understanding of visual cortical organization, evidence linking variation in pRF properties to behavioral performance remains limited. One of the most compelling pRF-to-behavior relationships has emerged from research into developmental prosopagnosia (DP). Individuals with DP have severe deficits in facial identity recognition sometimes linked to diminished holistic processing of faces. This perceptual deficit could be explained at the neural level by abnormally small pRFs in face-selective regions that restrict spatial integration of the face information. This hypothesis is supported by data from a small group of DPs but needs to be rigorously evaluated in a larger sample. Here, we measured pRF properties in 20 individuals with DP and 20 controls using a stimulus designed to robustly activate both low- and high-level visual areas. Consistent with previous studies, DPs exhibited weaker face selectivity in core ventral face-selective areas. Crucially, however, across the visual processing hierarchy - from early visual cortex, to intermediate visual areas, and face-selective areas - DPs and controls exhibited remarkable similarity in pRF properties, including pRF size, visual field coverage, and the distribution of pRF centers. Using a larger sample and the latest methods for mapping and modeling pRFs, these results challenge theories attributing DP to reduced spatial integration in face-selective regions. This underscores the need to explore alternative neural mechanisms of DP and to re-evaluate links between pRF properties and behavior more broadly.

">Developmental time course of social touch, parvalbumin interneurons, perineuronal nets and Mef2c expression reveals a sensitive period of somatosensory cortex development in prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                Social touch facilitates our attachment to others, especially early in life, which may be linked to the maturation of parvalbumin interneurons (PVI) in the somatosensory cortex (S1). These neurons respond to social touch, mature in a sensory experience-dependent manner, and influence both somatosensory processing and social behavior in models of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are an ideal rodent model for studying these concepts since they engage in a species-typical social touch called huddling. This study first showed that over development from juvenile to adult, same-sex siblings huddled less and explored more. Next, we tracked two markers of plasticity indicative of PVI maturation, extracellular perineuronal nets (PNNs) and nuclear transcription factor Myocyte enhancing factor 2C (Mef2c) across seven developmental timepoints. We found that, while PV expression in S1 was stable by P21, PNNs and Mef2c continued to shift afterwards, indicating a protracted development. Four unique clusters of PVIs converge during development between P14-P21, suggesting a sensitive period of PVI development. Finally, to determine environmental factors affecting these processes, environmental enrichment between P21-P28 led to accelerated PVI maturation. This developmental mapping provides a particularly salient model to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cortical and social development.

">Functional Dissociation in the Developing Superior Temporal Lobe: Language and Theory of Mind</a></h4>

              
                Language and theory of mind (ToM; the ability to infer others' mental states) are both crucial for human communication and yet their developmental origins are unclear. Are their neural substrates distinct within the superior temporal lobe (STL) but with opposing lateralization, as in adults? Or do they emerge from common neural substrates during development, perhaps in homologous regions originally involved in more basic social processing? Here we investigate the development of this functional dissociation, and the dissociation of their underlying connectivity fingerprints in a large cohort of children (ages 4-9 years, n=58 sessions) and adults (n=29). We demonstrate for the first time that children show distinct patterns of neural specificity for language and ToM in STL, just like adults. Children show no evidence of developmental 'disentangling' cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Finally, children's connectivity fingerprints predicting future language or ToM activation are almost identical to concurrent fingerprints and are largely non-overlapping across domains. While linguistic and ToM processing undergo continued neural specialization to reach the mature adult-like state, they are distinct remarkably early in human development. Our results challenge the idea that language develops from neural processors common for social communication and instead support distinct neural origins of these mental domains.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Reinterpretation is one of the primary reappraisal tactics crucial for psychological well-being in emotion regulation (ER). However, it remains unclear how preparatory brain activity influences the temporal dynamics of ER during reinterpretation. Thirty-four young adults involving an adapted ER task, downregulated their negative emotional experiences through reinterpretation. Strategy preparation nearly aligns with strategy use during reactive ER, while preparation precedes use during proactive ER. Behavioral data showed that reactive ER was more effective than proactive ER. Event-related potential (ERP) and decoding results revealed that goal representation engaged attentional resources to maintain regulatory information and suppress irrelevant interference during preparation. This intensive resource allocation may impair the working memory capacity, thereby reducing the regulatory effect in proactive ER. In contrast, reactive ER, unhindered by the preparation stage, preserved sufficient cognitive resources to adaptively re-engage in ER as necessary. Overall, preparation not only influenced the timing of ER but also impeded strategy use. The regulatory effect was determined by the brain activation patterns observed during the regulation stage.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by the partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum, the largest white matter bundle connecting the cerebral hemispheres. The default-mode network comprises bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions that exhibit correlated activity at rest. Previous studies show that individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum show overall preserved default-mode network functional connectivity, suggesting compensatory mechanisms for maintaining bilaterally correlated activity. In this study, we aimed to explore white matter pathways that support default-mode network-related networks in 15 children with agenesis of the corpus callosum and 27 typically developing controls, using combined diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging. A seed-based and dynamic functional connectivity approach enabled us to examine default-mode network spatial and temporal properties and their white matter substrates. While spatial default-mode network patterns were similar across groups, we found differences in temporal dynamics of 1 network and in white matter–default-mode network correspondence. These differences were either observed in white matter tracts directly associated with complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum or in white matter tracts such as the fornix and the anterior and posterior commissures, which have been previously implicated in neuroplasticity in agenesis of the corpus callosum. Our findings show that default-mode network dynamics can remain functionally preserved despite significant white matter alterations.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The frontal eye fields (FEFs) are critically involved in voluntary shifts of attention by sending top-down signals to posterior cortices to modulate local alpha-band activity. However, the exact temporo-spatial dynamics of this process are still unclear. Here, we investigated how covert shifts of attention and associated modulations of posterior alpha power are affected after FEF inhibition by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Neither right nor left FEF disruption impaired attention task performance. This absence of behavioral effects seems to be related to the here employed long cue-target intervals, giving the attention system sufficient time to compensate (across trials) for the TMS insult. Alpha power modulation was quantified both in the entire cue-target interval, and in two additional time windows: after cue presentation (early) and before target appearance (late). TMS effects on alpha power clearly differed across time windows, being strongest in the early time window. The reduced TMS effect in the late window might reflect recovery/compensation employed by the attention system, possibly explaining the lack of TMS-induced behavioral effects. These results are in line with a central role of the FEF in the control of visuospatial attention and support the notion of compensation mechanisms in cognitive brain systems in the temporal domain.</span>

                <p>There is a growing imperative to understand the neurophysiological impact of our rapidly changing and diverse technological, social, chemical, and physical environments. To untangle the multidimensional and interacting effects requires data at scale across diverse populations, taking measurement out of a controlled lab environment and into the field. Electroencephalography (EEG), which has correlates with various environmental factors as well as cognitive and mental health outcomes, has the advantage of both portability and cost-effectiveness for this purpose. However, with numerous field researchers spread across diverse locations, data quality issues and researcher idle time due to insufficient participants can quickly become unmanageable and expensive problems. In programs we have established in India and Tanzania, we demonstrate that with appropriate training, structured teams, and daily automated analysis and feedback on data quality, nonspecialists can reliably collect EEG data alongside various survey and assessments with consistently high throughput and quality. Over a 30&nbsp;week period, research teams were able to maintain an average of 25.6 participants per week, collecting data from a diverse sample of 7,933 participants ranging from Hadzabe hunter-gatherers to office workers. Furthermore, data quality, computed on the first 5,831 records using two common methods, PREP and FASTER, was comparable to benchmark datasets from controlled lab conditions. Altogether this resulted in a cost per participant of under $50, a fraction of the cost typical of such data collection, opening up the possibility for large-scale programs particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

                <p>Previous research suggests that stress predisposes individuals to develop substance use disorders by disrupting the brain processing of rewards. Yet, how stressful experiences disrupt the brain processing of reward-related cues at the neuronal level is poorly understood. Intermittent social defeat (ISD) is a stress animal model that increases reward-seeking behavior, drug self-administration, and choice impulsivity up to several weeks after stress. We tested the hypothesis that ISD disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in key areas of the brain that regulate reward-seeking. We examined in vivo neuronal dynamics in response to reward cues in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) simultaneously, and longitudinally, in control and stressed Long&ndash;Evans male rats during a discriminative stimulus reward-seeking task. In the dmPFC, ISD decreased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1 and 15&nbsp;d after stress, which indicates a long-term degradation of outcome anticipation-related processing. In the VTA, ISD increased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1&nbsp;d after stress but decreased cue-evoked activity 15&nbsp;d after stress. Moreover, decoding analysis in single neurons and populations showed parallel increases and decreases in reward discrimination accuracy in the VTA which points to time-dependent changes in incentive salience after stress. These results demonstrate that ISD differently disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in the dmPFC and the VTA and identify novel neurofunctional signatures that underlie a higher predisposition to seek out rewards after stress.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity, gait initiation (GI), and freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recorded GI and STN local field potentials (LFPs) via externalized cables in 38 patients with PD (35 reporting FOG in daily life), both OFF- and ON-dopamine (DOPA). GI was also recorded in 24 age-matched controls. GI scores related to pace, rhythm, and balance were derived from kinetics, and FOG was identified using kinematics. We compared GI performance related to FOG and DOPA, and GI-LFP relationships between posterior-sensorimotor versus central-associative STN regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DOPA<sup>OFF</sup>, 12 patients with PD had FOG observed (FOG-OBS, 263 episodes), occurring at a mean of 8 steps after GI, and 26 had no FOG observed (NOBS; FOG-NOBS). GI pace scores were worse in FOG-OBS than in FOG-NOBS patients with PD, even when not followed by FOG, with weaker association with alpha/low-beta activity in the posterior STN. Although rhythm/balance scores were similar between groups, their association with low-beta activity was stronger in FOG-OBS patients, with rhythm correlating more in the central STN and balance in the posterior STN. GI was worse preceding imminent FOG, with disrupted low-beta GI-LFP associations and emergent high-beta correlations with reversed spatial distribution (pace/rhythm-posterior STN, balance-central). Dopamine improved pace, rhythm, and FOG, and partially restored STN activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results reveal 3 distinct GI patterns in patients with PD associated with absence, predisposition to, or imminent occurrence of FOG, with STN neuronal modulations differing dynamically between the posterior and central subregions. These markers could support developing adaptive DBS strategies tailored for episodic gait impairments. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Recent studies report reduced dementia risk following shingles vaccination, suggesting that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) latency contributes to neuroimmune vulnerability. We propose that subclinical VZV reactivation acts as a renewable peripheral immune stressor, amplifying microglial priming in aging brains. Shingles vaccination may suppress this viral reservoir, reducing cumulative inflammatory tone. In this opinion article we contrast this mechanism with trained immunity and highlight how pathogen-specific and systemic effects may converge. Finally, we discuss the role of innate phagocytosis and resolution, suggesting that impaired clearance, rather than activation alone, sustains neuroinflammatory risk. Vaccination may thus modulate innate responsiveness and preserve neuroimmune balance in later life.

                Microglial ADGRG1 drives a protective state in Alzheimer’s disease by activating the transcription factor MYC, which upregulates genes associated with homeostasis, phagocytosis, and lysosomal functions. This leads to increased Aβ clearance, improved neuronal health, and preserved cognitive function.

Strikingly, only one, SUGP1, did so, implicating SUGP1 loss from mutant spliceosomes as the sole driver of missplicing.

                Takemura et al. demonstrate that the birth process triggers the transformation of radial glia (RG)-to-postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) through calpain- and endocytosis-mediated fiber transection. Importantly, RG adhesion to endothelial cells via N-cadherin depends on birth timing; preterm birth disrupts this, impairing NSC morphology and reducing stemness in adulthood.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97125">Cingulate cortex shapes early postnatal development of social vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                The social dynamics of vocal behavior have major implications for social development in humans. We asked whether early life damage to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is closely associated with socioemotional regulation more broadly, impacts the normal development of vocal expression. The common marmoset provides a unique opportunity to study the developmental trajectory of vocal behavior and to track the consequences of early brain damage on aspects of social vocalizations. We created ACC lesions in neonatal marmosets and compared their pattern of vocalization to that of age-matched controls throughout the first 6 weeks of life. We found that while early life ACC lesions had little influence on the production of vocal calls, developmental changes to the quality of social contact calls and their associated sequential and acoustic characteristics were compromised. These animals made fewer social contact calls, and when they did, they were short, loud, and monotonic. We further determined that damage to ACC in infancy results in a permanent alteration in downstream brain areas known to be involved in social vocalizations, such as the amygdala and periaqueductal gray. Namely, in the adult, these structures exhibited diminished GABA immunoreactivity relative to control animals, likely reflecting disruption of the normal inhibitory balance following ACC deafferentation. Together, these data indicate that the normal development of social vocal behavior depends on the ACC and its interaction with other areas in the vocal network during early life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106284">Neocortical layer-5 tLTD relies on non-ionotropic presynaptic NMDA receptor signaling</a></h4>

              
                In the textbook view, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) act as coincidence detectors in Hebbian plasticity by fluxing Ca<sup>2+</sup> when simultaneously depolarized and glutamate bound. Hebbian coincidence detection requires that NMDARs be located postsynaptically, but enigmatic presynaptic NMDARs (preNMDARs) also exist. It is known that preNMDARs regulate neurotransmitter release, but precisely how remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that NMDARs can also signal non-ionotropically, without the need for Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. At synapses between developing visual cortex layer-5 (L5) pyramidal cells (PCs), preNMDARs rely on Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Rab3-interacting molecule 1αβ (RIM1αβ) to regulate evoked release during periods of high-frequency firing, but they signal non-ionotropically via c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) to regulate spontaneous release regardless of frequency. At the same synapses, timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) depends on preNMDARs but not on frequency. We, therefore, tested in juvenile mouse visual cortex if tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling. We found that tLTD at L5 PC→PC synapses was abolished by pre- but not postsynaptic NMDAR deletion, cementing the view that tLTD requires preNMDARs. In agreement with non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling, tLTD prevailed after channel pore blockade with MK-801, unlike tLTP. Homozygous RIM1αβ deletion did not affect tLTD, but wash-in of the JNK2 blocker SP600125 abolished tLTD. Consistent with a presynaptic need for JNK2, a peptide blocking the interaction between JNK2 and Syntaxin-1a (STX1a) abolished tLTD if loaded pre- but not postsynaptically, regardless of frequency. Finally, low-frequency tLTD was not blocked by the channel pore blocker MK-801, nor by 7-CK, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist at the co-agonist site. We conclude that neocortical L5 PC→PC tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling via JNK2/STX1a. Our study brings closure to long-standing controversy surrounding preNMDARs and highlights how the textbook view of NMDARs as ionotropic coincidence detectors in plasticity needs to be reassessed.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101327">A SMARTTR workflow for multi-ensemble atlas mapping and brain-wide network analysis</a></h4>

              
                In the last decade, activity-dependent strategies for labeling multiple immediate early gene ensembles in mice have generated unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval. However, few strategies exist for brain-wide mapping of multiple ensembles, including their overlapping population, and none incorporate capabilities for downstream network analysis. Here, we introduce a scalable workflow to analyze traditionally coronally sectioned datasets produced by activity-dependent tagging systems. Intrinsic to this pipeline is simple multi-ensemble atlas registration and statistical testing in R (SMARTTR), an R package which wraps mapping capabilities with functions for statistical analysis and network visualization, and support for import of external datasets. We demonstrate the versatility of SMARTTR by mapping the ensembles underlying the acquisition and expression of learned helplessness (LH), a robust stress model. Applying network analysis, we find that exposure to inescapable shock (IS), compared to context training, results in decreased centrality of regions engaged in spatial and contextual processing and higher influence of regions involved in somatosensory and affective processing. During LH expression, the substantia nigra emerges as a highly influential region that shows a functional reversal following IS, indicating a possible regulatory function of motor activity during helplessness. We also report that IS results in a robust decrease in reactivation activity across a number of cortical, hippocampal, and amygdalar regions, indicating suppression of ensemble reactivation may be a neurobiological signature of LH. These results highlight the emergent insights uniquely garnered by applying our analysis approach to multiple ensemble datasets and demonstrate the strength of our workflow as a hypothesis-generating toolkit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88598">Cell type-specific contributions to a persistent aggressive internal state in female Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Persistent internal states are important for maintaining survival-promoting behaviors, such as aggression. In female <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we have previously shown that individually activating either aIPg or pC1d cell types can induce aggression. Here we investigate further the individual roles of these cholinergic, sexually dimorphic cell types, and the reciprocal connections between them, in generating a persistent aggressive internal state. We find that a brief 30-second optogenetic stimulation of aIPg neurons was sufficient to promote an aggressive internal state lasting at least 10 minutes, whereas similar stimulation of pC1d neurons did not. While we previously showed that stimulation of pC1e alone does not evoke aggression, persistent behavior could be promoted through simultaneous stimulation of pC1d and pC1e, suggesting an unexpected synergy of these cell types in establishing a persistent aggressive state. Neither aIPg nor pC1d show persistent neuronal activity themselves, implying that the persistent internal state is maintained by other mechanisms. Moreover, inactivation of pC1d did not significantly reduce aIPg-evoked persistent aggression, arguing that the aggressive state did not depend on pC1d-aIPg recurrent connectivity. Our results suggest the need for alternative models to explain persistent female aggression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101526">No effect of additional education on long-term brain structure, a preregistered natural experiment in thousands of individuals</a></h4>

              
                Education is related to a wide variety of beneficial health, behavioral, and societal outcomes. However, whether education causes long-term structural changes in the brain remains unclear. A pressing challenge is that individuals self-select into continued education, thereby introducing a wide variety of environmental and genetic confounders. Fortunately, natural experiments allow us to isolate the causal impact of increased education from individual (and societal) characteristics. Here, we exploit a policy change in the UK (the 1972 ROSLA act) that increased the amount of mandatory schooling from 15 to 16 years of age to study the impact of education on long-term structural brain outcomes in the UK Biobank. Using regression discontinuity (RD) – a causal inference method – we find no evidence of an effect from an additional year of education on any structural neuroimaging outcomes. This null result is robust across modalities, regions, and analysis strategies. An additional year of education is a substantial cognitive intervention, yet we find no evidence for sustained experience-dependent plasticity. Our results provide a challenge for prominent accounts of cognitive or ‘brain reserve’ theories which identify education as a major protective factor to lessen adverse aging effects. Our preregistered findings are one of the first implementations of RD on neural data – opening the door for causal inference in population-based neuroimaging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106389">Population-level morphological analysis of paired CO2- and odor-sensing olfactory neurons in D. melanogaster via volume electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic morphology is a defining characteristic of neuronal subtypes. In <i>Drosophila</i>, heterotypic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing different receptors display diverse dendritic morphologies, but whether such diversity exists among homotypic ORNs remains unclear. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy on cryofixed tissues, we analyzed the majority of CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons (ab1C) and their odor-sensing neighbors (ab1D) in the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> antenna. Surprisingly, ab1C neurons featured flattened, sheet-like dendrites—distinct from the cylindrical branches typical of odor-sensing neurons—and displayed remarkable diversity, ranging from plain sheets to tube-like structures that enclose several neighboring dendrites, forming ‘dendrite-within-dendrite’ structures. Similarly, ab1D dendrites varied from simple, unbranched forms to numerously branched morphologies. These findings suggest that morphological heterogeneity is common even among homotypic ORNs, potentially expanding their functional adaptability and ranges of sensory physiological properties.

">Novel Gain of Function Mouse Model of KCNT1-Related Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                KCNT1-related epilepsy is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from de novo pathogenic variants in KCNT1 which encodes a sodium-gated potassium channel. These variants are associated with Epilepsy of Infancy with Migrating Focal Seizures (EIMFS) and Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (ADNFLE). At least 64 human KCNT1 variants have been reported, the majority are gain-of-function and each has unique electrophysiological and epileptic characteristics. A multi-disciplinary collaboration generated a novel mouse model (C57BL/6-Kcnt1em1Bryd) that carries the G269S variant corresponding to the human G288S variant located within the coding region of the channel pore. We characterized network excitability of cultured cortical neurons from all three genotypes, since many KCNT1 mouse models require homozygosity for seizure detection. Kcnt1+/G269S neurons exhibited sustained hyperexcitability and hypersynchronous bursting versus Kcnt1+/+ controls, while Kcnt1G269S/G269S neurons showed early excessive bursting followed by network collapse by 28 days-in-vitro, suggesting excitotoxicity. Therefore, behavioral comparisons were conducted between Kcnt1+/G269S and Kcnt1+/+ mice including developmental milestones, motor and cognitive abilities, respiratory physiology, and seizure susceptibility. Kcnt1+/G269S displayed no abnormal gross motor abilities, poor coordination, erratic breathing, and increased apneas, as functional outcome measures. Critically, Kcnt1+/G269S were more susceptible to thermal-induced seizures in early life. In summary, these data: (i) provide a novel mouse model of KCNT1-related epilepsy, (ii) provide strong in vitro evidence of neuronal hyperexcitability, (iii) illustrate early-life seizures as a functional outcome measure, and (iv) lay the groundwork for future analysis of neural activity in vivo and modeling circuit level dynamics in vitro, in vivo, and in silico.

">High-density, Identified Cell Recordings from Motor Cortex of Awake Behaving Macaques using 1024-channel SiNAPS-NHP Probes</a></h4>

              
                Objective/Background: Acquiring bioelectric signals from many single neurons in primate brain remains challenging. Chronic implants offer a reasonable channel count (~100) but sample only a small, fixed region of the cortex. Acutely inserted electrodes can sample from a wider region by making new penetrations each day. The aim of this study was to develop an active dense CMOS probe and experimental procedures to demonstrate acute large-scale single unit recordings from behaving monkeys. Methods: A single-shank CMOS probe was specifically designed for intracortical macaque recordings. The device is based on SiNAPS technology, with additional multiplexing circuits to minimize output lines. Synchronous sampling at 20 kHz/channel from >2k electrode-pixels is achieved with multiple probe systems. Experiments were performed in behaving macaques, achieving multiple day insertions in the motor cortex. Methods were developed to extract spontaneous spiking times of antidromically-identified neurons. Results: The probe (10.7 mm in length, 158 m in width, 50 m in thickness) provides a regular array of 1024 electrodes (14 x 14 m^2) arranged in 4 columns with an interelectrode pitch of 30 m. Dural penetration is eased by a small pilot hole; the optimized insertion procedure allows recordings from many different sites. Some cells were identified by antidromic activation as pyramidal tract neurons, which project to the spinal cord. Conclusion: This probe configuration can reach the anterior bank of the central sulcus, which contains many corticospinal cells that connect directly to motoneurons. Significance: This study is an important advance in the toolkit of primate neurophysiology.

">Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of post-mortem brain tissue reveals specific amino acid profile dysregulation in Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease patients</a></h4>

              
                Background: Combined metabolomic and HPLC-based analyses have identified significant metabolic alterations in serum and plasma amino acid levels of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, underscoring their potential as biomarkers. However, it remains unclear whether these biochemical changes also manifest within the central nervous system or are confined to peripheral metabolism, reflecting systemic metabolic disturbances. Methods: To address this issue, here we measured the levels of 44 different amino acids in post-mortem brain samples from MPTP-intoxicated, L-DOPA-treated monkeys and PD patients at different Braak Lewy body (LB) stages, compared to their respective controls, through targeted Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Results: In MPTP-intoxicated monkeys, UPLC-MS revealed significant elevations in GABA, citrulline, threonine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, glycine, and serine in the putamen, whereas we failed to detect alterations in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). In PD patients, caudate-putamen (CPu) analysis demonstrated consistent serine upregulation across Braak LB stages 3-4 and 6, with stage 6 specifically showing additional proline increases and phosphoethanolamine decreases. Notably, serine was the sole amino acid significantly altered in both the putamen of MPTP-intoxicated monkeys and the CPu of PD patients. No significant amino acid alterations were observed in the SFG of PD patients, mirroring the findings in monkeys. In contrast, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient SFG samples showed significant increases in tryptophan, phenylalanine, threonine, tyrosine, and methionine relative to controls. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that cerebral amino acid alterations in PD are region-specific and primarily localized to brain areas receiving nigrostriatal dopaminergic innervation. Moreover, the cortical amino acid profile in AD differs substantially from that in PD, suggesting disease-specific metabolic signatures in distinct neurodegenerative conditions.

">A thalamic circuit mechanism for stress-dependent modulation of REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is stress-sensitive and linked to cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex. Yet, the neuronal mechanisms connecting stress, REM sleep and cortical operations remain unclear. Here, we reveal that prefrontal cortical- and nucleus accumbens-projecting paraventricular thalamic neurons (PVTNAc) exhibit sleep-stage dependent activity and modulate cortical REM oscillation in response to stress. We found that PVTNAc bidirectionally modulate the REM-promoting medullary GABAergic signal, and thus, cortical theta oscillation during REM sleep in an activity-dependent manner, along with the excitation-inhibition balance observed during natural sleep stage transitions. While acute stress enhances REM sleep, repeated stress suppresses it through progressively increased PVTNAc activation. Notably, acute and chronic stimulation of PVTNAc recapitulates stress-induced bidirectional changes in REM sleep. Thus, PVTNAc neurons, by integrating stress and REM signals into forebrain activity, dynamically shape sleep architecture. Persistent elevation in this pathway disrupts REM sleep, thereby providing a mechanism through which stress alters prefrontal cortical processing and, ultimately, cognitive functions.

">A Semi-Automated, Parallelized, and Flexible Spatial Navigation Task for Rats</a></h4>

              
                Spatial navigation tasks for rodents have been an extremely useful tool for studying cognitive processes for decades, but are often laborious to administer, inefficient, and sensitive to experimenter-induced variability. To address these limitations, we have developed a parallelized maze system which runs four highly flexible maze environments simultaneously with automated reward delivery to reduce experimenter involvement, increase throughput, and streamline data collection. Further, our software tracks subject performance and manages the progression through a pre-set curriculum as subjects learn, reducing experimenter error and ensuring comparable learning curves across cohorts. Equipped with IR beam-break based reward ports, peristaltic pumps for liquid reward delivery, and overhead video tracking, our current maze accessories can be flexibly reconfigured to enable a vast array of behavioral tasks and support a wide range of important experimental questions. A pilot cohort of young (4-8 month) and aged (28-32 month) male rats demonstrates that this task enables the efficient training of a series of increasingly difficult visually cued and memory-dependent spatial navigation tasks which are likely to be sensitive to age-related changes.

">Volumetric Differences of Thalamic Nuclei are Associated with Post-Trauma Psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Previous investigations of whole thalamus and thalamic nuclei volumes in post-trauma psychopathology have been sparse, limited in scope, and yielded inconsistent results. To address this, volumetric estimates of whole thalamus and thalamic nuclei were obtained from structural brain MRI scans from 2,058 participants across 20 worldwide sites in the ENIGMA PTSD working group. Thalamic volumes were compared between trauma-exposed participants with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=238), major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=184), comorbid PTSD+MDD (n=618), and trauma-exposed control participants (n=1,018). PTSD and MDD symptom severity, PTSD symptom clusters, and childhood trauma were similarly examined for associations with thalamic volume. Participants with PTSD only compared to controls had smaller thalamic nuclei volumes in sensorimotor nuclei, including the parafascicular (Pf), ventral anterior magnocellular (VAmc), medial pulvinar (PuM), and anterior pulvinar (PuA) nuclei of the thalamus. MDD only and comorbid PTSD+MDD participants exhibited smaller mediodorsal thalamus volumes compared to controls. Overall PTSD and MDD symptom severity negatively correlated with the volume of the mediodorsal thalamus. A significant interaction between PTSD and MDD severity was found, such that MDD severity was positively associated with thalamic volume only among individuals with high PTSD severity. Avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD were positively associated with thalamic volume, while re-experiencing and negative mood/cognition symptoms were negatively associated with thalamic volume. Childhood physical and emotional abuse were positively and negatively associated with thalamic volume, respectively. Whole thalamus volume and volumes of the sensorimotor and limbic thalamus may play an important role in the development of PTSD and MDD in the aftermath of trauma exposure. The interaction between PTSD and MDD symptoms and contrasting effects across PTSD symptom clusters and types of childhood adversity suggests multiple neurobiological mechanisms are involved in shaping thalamic volume post-trauma.

">From Family Relationship to Regulation: Parent-Child Amygdala Activation Similarity is Linked to Prefrontal Recruitment and Youth Emotional Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Extensive research highlights the importance of parent-child similarity at psychological, behavioral, and physiological levels in fostering children's adaptation. While emerging studies have begun to explore neural similarity, little is known about the factors that influence parent-child neural similarity during adolescence or how such similarity may support youth emotional adaptation when coping with heightened uncertainty. The current study investigated the relations among family relationship quality, parent-youth neural similarity, and youth emotional adaptation using task-based fMRI. With 50 participants (25 parent-youth dyads; parent: Mage = 43.88 years, 72% female; youths: Mage = 11.16 years, 44% female), we found that higher parent-youth neural similarity in the amygdala activation patterns during emotionally uncertain situations was associated with better youths' emotional adaptation, as indicated by lower levels of anxiety and depression and higher resilience. This neural similarity mediated the beneficial effects of positive family relationships on youths' emotional adaptation. Additionally, amygdala activation similarity was associated with amygdala to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) connectivity during uncertainty in youth, revealed by generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses. This amygdala-dlPFC connectivity, in turn, was linked to better emotional adaptation in youth. Importantly, these findings were specific to uncertainty-related bottom-up processing, rather than effortful top-down regulation processing or responses to certain aversive stimuli. These findings offer new insight into how relational and neural factors jointly shape youth emotional adaptation, and suggest that parent-child neural similarity in the amygdala may serve as a mechanism for supporting implicit emotion regulation, helping youth cope with uncertain situations.

">Pain Expectations: the neural representations of predicted pain in self and others</a></h4>

              
                Predicting another's pain is a challenging decision. Predictive coding explains individual pain via top-down modulation, but its extension to vicarious pain is unknown. We tested neural representations of expected pain, uncertainty (risk), and their related errors for self versus other to assess predictive coding's explanatory power in decisions on another's pain. We hypothesized that the brain encodes expected pain, risk, and prediction errors for others, mirroring self-pain mechanisms within a predictive coding framework. Using model-based fMRI (n=33), individuals in dyads gambled on risky or certain pain relief; priced their choices; experienced or witnessed corollary pain, and rated the latter's intensity, alternating between deciding for themselves or another. Behaviorally, prosocial biases emerged in the form of greater risk aversion, higher pain relief valuation, and inflated ratings for others. Neurally, expected other-pain showed a graded representation (absent for self). Pain risk activated the dorsal striatum for both self and other, but more so for others. Pain surprise, but not signed prediction errors, elicited anterior insula activity in both targets. These findings show that predictive coding can characterize vicarious pain, suggesting that top-down priors influence decisions on another's expected and experienced pain. Importantly, the observed prosocial biases and enhanced neural processing of risk for others highlight that uncertainty exerts a stronger influence in other-regarding decision-making compared to self-regarding choice. These findings lead to significant implications for social interactions and clinical contexts involving surrogate decision-makers.

                Previous studies have demonstrated that exercise can influence motor skill learning. However, the specific components of learning primed by exercise remain unclear. This study examined the effect of a preceding bout of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on the acquisition of a novel motor skill. The investigation focused on whether improvement in skill across the session was attributable to online gains during active practice or offline rest periods between practice blocks. There was also exploration as to whether common polymorphisms of the BDNF and DRD2/ANKK1 genes that regulate plasticity, learning, and memory, influenced the relationship between exercise and motor learning. It was demonstrated that HIIT enhanced skill acquisition, but that the effects of HIIT priming were not specifically attributable to within-session online or offline learning processes. Contrary to research on overnight consolidation, there was no interaction between BDNF, nor DRD2/ANKK1 genotype, with exercise primed skill learning.

">Non-invasive brain stimulation protects cognitive impairment in i.c.v.STZ injected rats: role of adult neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer like dementia, neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction is known to the critical player in explaining the cognitive impairment. Adult neurogenesis, normally a chronic and quite process is explained to have potential in the field of Alzheimer therapy. Previous research on the non-invasive brain stimulation showed that controlling pattern of stimulation externally we can regulate/ entrain neuronal activity, possibly altering the structural changes in the circuit level. However, literature investigating if non-invasive brain stimulation could hold any potential to initiate process of adult neurogenesis are scarce. In the present study, with the use of behavioural, microscopic and biochemical tools we found that extremely low frequency magnetic field at an intensity of 17.96{micro}T with sinusoidal wave of 50Hz for 2hr daily for a period of two week in streptozotocin induced animal model of sporadic Alzheimer disease can cause improvement in spatial and reference memory, influencing their swimming strategy in water maze. Which is caused by stimulation in immature neural pluripotent stem cells, with additional redox balance and mitigation of glial aggravation in brain areas like olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These changes were accompanied by neuroprotection as observed in the granular layer of dentate gyrus. Taken together, present study explains plausible mechanism of action on protection of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease through non-invasive brain stimulation.

                <p>Neuroimaging data reveal that a functional locus ceruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system is critical in maintaining cognitive performance during aging. However, older adults show reduced LC integrity and altered functional connectivity, demonstrating both structural declines and dysfunction. The LC-NA system mediates mechanisms of attention processing and eye tracking studies have shown that older adults are slower and more distractible compared with young adults in visual search tasks. Prior studies have shown that mindfulness meditation modulates LC noradrenergic activity, increases gray matter volume in the brainstem, and improves attentional control. Thus, in a preregistered longitudinal study, we investigated whether 30&nbsp;d of guided mindfulness meditation using a mobile application improved attentional control measured with eye movements. We hypothesized that older adults would show greater benefits from the mindfulness intervention compared with young adults. In two oculomotor search tasks, we identified that guided mindfulness practice improved saccadic reaction times, but that other longitudinal benefits in goal-directed attentional control or distractibility by task-irrelevant salient stimuli may be from repeated practice. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for age differences in response to the mindfulness intervention between young, middle-aged, and older adults, nor among scores on mindfulness questionnaires. Our findings show that short-term mindfulness practice can modulate cognition, specifically with the speed of overt orienting of attention that may not be observable in self-report measures. This study is the first to show the utility of mindfulness on cognition using a highly reliable measure in eye movements and suggests future longer-term intervention studies may be warranted.</p>

                <p>Neuroscientists are increasingly initiating large-scale collaborations which bring together tens to hundreds of researchers. At this scale, such projects can tackle big challenges and engage diverse participants. Inspired by projects in mathematics, we set out to test the feasibility of widening access to such projects even further, by running a massively collaborative project in computational neuroscience. The key difference, with prior neuroscientific efforts, being that our entire project (code, results, and writing) was public from the outset, and that anyone could participate. To achieve this, we launched a public Git repository, with code for training spiking neural networks to solve a sound localization task via surrogate gradient descent. We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchronously through Git and synchronously at online workshops. Our hope was that the resulting range of participants would allow us to make discoveries that a single team would have been unlikely to find. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biological parameters, from time delays to membrane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localization in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. While our scientific results were not groundbreaking, our project demonstrates the potential for massively collaborative projects to transform neuroscience.</p>

With the availability of reliably predicted 3D-structures for essentially all known proteins, characterizing the entirety of compound-binding sites (binding pockets on proteins) has become a possibility. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze all compound-binding sites, i.e., the pocketomes, of eleven species from different kingdoms of life to discern evolutionary trends as well as to arrive at a global cross-species view of the pocketome universe. Computational binding site prediction was performed on all protein structures in each species as available from the AlphaFold database. The resulting set of potential binding sites was inspected for overlaps with known pockets and annotated with regard to the protein domains in which they are located. 2D-projection plots of all pockets embedded in a 128-dimensional feature space, and characterizing them with regard to selected physicochemical properties, provide informative, global pocketome maps that unveil differentiating features between pockets. Our study revealed a sub-linear scaling law of the number of unique binding sites relative to the number of unique protein structures per species. Thus, as proteome size increased during evolution and therefore potentially diversified, the number of distinct binding sites, reflecting potentially diversifying functions, grew less than proportionally. We discuss the biological significance of this finding as well as identify critical and unmet algorithmic challenges.

Mechanistic models of dynamic, interacting cell populations have yielded many insights into the growth and resolution of immune responses. Historically these models have described the behavior of pre-defined cell types based on small numbers of phenotypic markers. The ubiquity of deep phenotyping therefore presents a new challenge; how do we confront tractable and interpretable mathematical models with high-dimensional data? To tackle this problem, we studied the development and persistence of lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (TRM) in mice infected with influenza virus. We developed an approach in which dynamical model parameters and the population structure are inferred simultaneously. This method uses deep learning and stochastic variational inference and is trained on the single-cell flow-cytometry data directly, rather than on the kinetics of pre-identified clusters. We show that during the resolution phase of the immune response, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lung are phenotypically diverse, with subsets exhibiting highly distinct and time-dependent dynamics. TRM heterogeneity is maintained long-term by ongoing differentiation of relatively persistent Bcl-2<sup>hi</sup> CD4 and CD8 TRM subsets which resolve into distinct functional populations. Our approach yields new insights into the dynamics of tissue-localized immune memory, and is a novel basis for interpreting time series of high-dimensional data, broadly applicable to diverse biological systems.

Bacteria live in diverse communities, forming complex networks of interacting species. A central question in bacterial ecology is whether species engage in cooperative or competitive interactions. But this question often neglects the role of the environment. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic networks from two different open-access collections (AGORA and CarveMe) to assess pairwise interactions of different microbes in varying environmental conditions (provision of different environmental compounds). By computationally simulating thousands of environments for 10,000 pairs of bacteria from each collection, we found that most pairs were able to both compete and cooperate depending on the availability of environmental resources. This modeling approach allowed us to determine commonalities between environments that could facilitate the potential for cooperation or competition between a pair of species. Namely, cooperative interactions, especially obligate, were most common in less diverse environments. Further, as compounds were removed from the environment, we found interactions tended to degrade towards obligacy. However, we also found that on average at least one compound could be removed from an environment to switch the interaction from competition to facultative cooperation or vice versa. Together our approach indicates a high degree of plasticity in microbial interactions in response to the availability of environmental resources.

                <p>by De-fei Xiong, Yi-yang Zhang, Zhi-chao Wang, Yuan-ming Zheng, Han-qing Zhang, Gang Wang</p>

The detection of cytosolic viral nucleic acids via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) activates multiple signaling pathways, leading to the production of interferons (IFNs), which are essential for host survival during viral infection. Precise control of PRR gene expression is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. Here, we showed that Mediator complex subunit 23 (Med23) is required for the precise production of the innate immune receptor RIG-I in response to RNA virus infection. Med23 deficiency markedly enhances the production of IFN-I, proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both multiple cell lines (MEFs, RAW264.7 cells, and HeLa cells) and mouse primary macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] and peritoneal macrophages [PEMs]) infected with RNA virus VSV or stimulated with poly(I:C). Myeloid-specific Med23 knockout mice were generated to test the critical role of Med23 in host resistance to VSV infection in vivo. Mechanistically, Med23 interacts with the transcription factor forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) to negatively regulate RIG-I, thereby modulating IFN-I signaling. Collectively, these findings elucidate a previously unrecognized role of Med23 as a gatekeeper of the RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response and suggest a potential target for controlling viral infection.

Working memory (WM) is a fundamental cognitive function crucial adaptive behavior. The intricate interplay between the frontal cortex and striatum in governing WM maintenance and updating remains a central question. In this study, we employed optogenetics to demonstrate that inhibiting both dorsomedial striatum (DMS) D<sub>1</sub>R- and D<sub>2</sub>R-neurons enhances WM, while their activation impairs it across T-maze- and operant-based delayed-non-match-to-place (DNMTP) paradigms in mice. Notably, these neurons selectively modulate WM maintenance and retrieval, with no impact on encoding. Analysis through signal detection theory (SDT) revealed specific regulation of WM signal detection sensitivity, with no alterations in motivational or motor states during the operant DNMTP task. Interestingly, DMS D<sub>2</sub>R-neurons govern WM regulation under low cognitive load, switching to D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons as cognitive load increases. Activation of DMS D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons during the delay phase severely impairs WM under high cognitive load, a deficit rescued by optogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), or dopaminergic terminals in DMS. Additionally, treatment with the D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SCH39166, but not the D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist Sulpiride mitigates these impairments. Collectively, our findings propose a “relay” model wherein cognitive load-dependent WM control switches from DMS D<sub>2</sub>R- to D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons, offering nuanced, complementary, and inhibitory regulation of WM maintenance and retrieval. This study suggests potential strategies to enhance WM by promoting a suppressive state in DMS and to increase WM capacity through specific modulation of DMS D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons.

                <p>by Jeremy Mo, Hanyun Zhang, Alexander Swarbrick</p>

Cancer treatments often fall short of durable cures, yet most therapeutic strategies neglect the tumor stroma. A concerted effort is needed to understand, model, target and reprogram the tumor ‘soil’, recognizing its profound influence on cancer from tumorigenesis to therapy resistance.

Current anti-cancer treatments often neglect the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in resistance and progression. In this Perspective, the authors argue that better preclinical models, understanding of stromal heterogeneity and integration of TME assessments into drug development are needed to improve treatment efficacy.

                <p>by Ha Neul Lee, Julia C. Hardy, Emily H. Pool, Jin-Fan Zhang, Su Hyun Kim, William F. Buhl, Jessica G.H. Bruystens, Sohum Mehta, Susan S. Taylor, Jin Zhang</p>

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a ubiquitous second messenger, regulates a variety of cellular functions with high specificity. We previously showed that the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), RIα, undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate spatial compartmentalization of cAMP. However, how RIα LLPS regulates cellular function is largely unknown. Here, we identify the formation of RIα condensates in MIN6 β cells and reveal key roles for RIα LLPS in regulating β cell function. By combining CRISPR-based RIα knockout with an RIα mutant (Y122A) that exhibits defective cAMP-induced LLPS, we demonstrate that RIα LLPS drives cAMP compartmentalization to tune β cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP oscillation frequency, control insulin secretion, regulate CREB-mediated gene expression and prevent uncontrolled proliferation. Our data establish the Y122A mutant as a selective molecular tool for studying RIα LLPS and expand our understanding of the functional impact of LLPS-driven protein assemblies.

<p>During the non-breeding season, male green anoles display aggression that is regulated by the amygdala. Lesioning the amygdala led to a decrease in aggression, which was not observed in animals where the amygdala was missed or in saline controls. Also, plasma testosterone levels did not influence aggression in these males. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Aggression is a set of hostile behaviors expressed to defend and/or obtain resources. Although a social behavior network (SBN) has been postulated to explain the neural mechanisms underlying aggression, the extent of behavioral modulation by specific brain regions remains unclear. Additionally, the regulation of the SBN during the nonbreeding season (NBS) in seasonal breeders that express territorial aggression is still unknown. Thus, we aimed to study the role of one node of the SBN, the amygdala, in green anole lizards as this species displays dynamic changes in aggression, reduced testosterone levels, and increased number of neurons in the amygdala during the NBS compared to the breeding season. Male lizards were placed in a stereotactic apparatus and injected with either a neurotoxin (staurosporine) to damage the amygdala or saline as a control. These focal male lizards were also exposed to size-matched conspecifics before and 3 days after surgery to quantify aggressive behaviors. We found that partly damaging the amygdala significantly reduced aggression levels but did not affect their latency to initiate aggressive behaviors, providing support for the idea that the amygdala mediates aggression but not motivation in this species. Additionally, there was no relationship between aggression and plasma testosterone levels, suggesting that the nonbreeding aggression we measured was independent of plasma testosterone levels. These results indicate that the amygdala might play a significant role in the SBN to regulate NBS aggression and is not dependent on plasma testosterone levels.</p>

<p>The study shows that amacrine cells expressing the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) make up subpopulations of conventional and displaced amacrine cells. They include ON but not OFF starburst amacrine cells and multiple types of wide-field presumed GABAergic amacrine cells.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over 30 types of amacrine cells have been described in the primate retina, yet few are well characterized. Here, we investigated amacrine cells expressing the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the retinas of human, macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis, Macaca nemestrina</i>), and marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) monkeys using immunohistochemistry and intracellular injections, with a focus on displaced amacrine cells (dACs) in the ganglion cell layer. The spatial density of CaMKII-positive dACs decreases with the distance from the fovea, but in the peripheral temporal retina, the density of CaMKII-positive dACs nevertheless exceeds the density of retinal ganglion cells. In all species, CaMKII-positive dACs include cells expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) cells, but in the human retina, only 60% of the ON ChAT population is CaMKII-positive. Conversely, in the marmoset and the macaque, about 80% of ON ChAT cells co-express CaMKII, but only 55% of ON ChAT cells in humans do so. Intracellular injections of CaMKII-positive dACs with the lipophilic dye DiI revealed ON starburst and semilunar Type 3 cells in all three species, but in the human retina, at least three additional types were detected. In the inner nuclear layer, CaMKII is expressed by multiple populations of amacrine cells, which are distinguished based on their soma size and staining intensity, but OFF ChAT cells do not co-express CaMKII. We conclude that ON- and OFF-ChAT cells show distinct patterns of CaMKII expression and that the diversity of CaMKII-expressing dACs in humans is greater than that in marmoset or macaque retina.</p>

<p>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed injury-induced changes in neuronal metabolites in the primary motor cortex and lumbar cord enlargement of patients with spinal cord injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts spinal tracts and neuronal pathways, including those in the primary motor cortex (M1) and the lumbar cord enlargement (LCE) involved in motor control. This study sought to determine whether metabolite concentrations deviate between SCI and healthy controls (HC) in M1 and LCE using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and structural MRI, and if these correlate with clinical impairment. Sixteen chronic SCI (mean age: 54.7 ± 14.8y) and 19 HCs (mean age: 53.2 ± 18.8y) underwent <sup>1</sup>H-MRS to quantify metabolites along with T<sub>1</sub>- and T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted MRI to assess tissue structural changes. Associations between metabolic and structural changes and clinical impairment were also assessed. Patients showed significant atrophy in both white matter of the LCE (HC: 37.7 ± 4.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, SCI: 33.9 ± 3.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, Δ = −10.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.015) and gray matter (HC: 20.9 ± 2.1 mm<sup>2</sup>, SCI: 19.4 ± 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, Δ = −7.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.022). Total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) with respect to total creatine (tCr) was reduced in M1 of SCI (HC: 1.94 ± 0.21, SCI: 1.77 ± 0.14, ∆ = −8.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.006) and in the LCE (HC: 2.48 ± 0.76, SCI: 1.81 ± 0.80, ∆ = −27.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In conclusion, reduced tNAA/tCr in both the atrophied LCE and M1 suggests widespread neuronal changes including cell atrophy and/or cell loss after injury. These findings provide in vivo evidence for retrograde and trans-synaptic neurodegeneration, which may underline the atrophy observed in the motor system in SCI. Ultimately, this highlights the potential for metabolic and structural biomarkers to improve the monitoring of subtle neurodegeneration following SCI and to enhance future regenerative treatment strategies.</p>

                As a step toward human translation, Wang et al. demonstrate, without using contrast agents, the ability to map fine-scale cerebrovasculature (intracortical arterioles and venules) in vivo in primates using a human 7 T MRI scanner. This introduces a primate model for studying cerebral vascular architecture and hemodynamics in health and disease.

                Trinh et al. identify RNF13 as a pH- and Ca2+-dependent regulator of lysosomal positioning via ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ARL8B. They show that starvation or alkaline extracellular pH enhances RNF13 activity, while acidic intracellular pH suppresses it. This reveals a mechanism by which Ca2+ signaling and pH dynamics regulate lysosomal transport.

Neutrophil-derived serine proteases and IL-36R-dependent NETosis exacerbate lung pathogenesis, which can be ameliorated with protease inhibitors and IL-36R blockade.

                Macartney et al. characterize how male dietary macronutrients influence the proteome of brown adipose tissue, including inter-generational effects. The two clusters of proteins are correlated with BAT weight, including proteasome proteins and UCP1. Paternal dietary protein is inversely related to basigin expression in daughters, a protein important for normal BAT function.

                Xu et al. reveal a non-canonical mechanism that transduces the membrane-to-nucleus signal of auxin independent of the TIR1 pathway, uncovering a new layer of regulation in auxin signaling. Auxin promotes the GLP1-PTRE1 interaction, leading to PTRE1 retention at the plasma membrane and suppression of nuclear proteasome activity, thereby stabilizing Aux/IAA repressors.
