              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Fire-induced loss of the worlds most biodiverse forests in Latin America</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fire plays a dominant role in deforestation, particularly in the tropics, but the relative extent of transformations and influence of fire frequency on eventual forest loss remain unclear. Here, we analyze the frequency of fire and its influence on postfire forest trajectories between 2001 and 2018. We account for ~1.1% of Latin American forests burnt in 2002&ndash;2003 (8,465,850 ha). Although 40.1% of forests (3,393,250 ha) burned only once, by 2018, ~48% of the evergreen forests converted to other, primarily grass-dominated uses. While greater fire frequency yielded more transformation, our results reveal the staggering impact of even a single fire. Increasing fire frequency imposes greater risks of irreversible forest loss, transforming forests into ecosystems increasingly vulnerable to degradation. Reversing this trend is indispensable to both mitigate and adapt to climate change globally. As climate change transforms fire regimes across the region, key actions are needed to conserve Latin American forests.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Efferocytosis fuels malignant pleural effusion through TIMP1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) results from the capacity of several human cancers to metastasize to the pleural cavity. No effective treatments are currently available, reflecting our insufficient understanding of the basic mechanisms leading to MPE progression. Here, we found that efferocytosis through the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and MERTK led to the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by four distinct pleural cavity macrophage (M) subpopulations characterized by different metabolic states and cell chemotaxis properties. In turn, IL-10 acts on dendritic cells (DCs) inducing the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1). Genetic ablation of <I>Axl</I> and <I>Mertk</I> in Ms or IL-10 receptor in DCs or <I>Timp1</I> substantially reduced MPE progression. Our results delineate an inflammatory cascade&mdash;from the clearance of apoptotic cells by Ms, to production of IL-10, to induction of TIMP1 in DCs&mdash;that facilitates MPE progression. This inflammatory cascade offers a series of therapeutic targets for MPE.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">How social learning amplifies moral outrage expression in online social networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Moral outrage shapes fundamental aspects of social life and is now widespread in online social networks. Here, we show how social learning processes amplify online moral outrage expressions over time. In two preregistered observational studies on Twitter (7331 users and 12.7 million total tweets) and two preregistered behavioral experiments (<I>N</I> = 240), we find that positive social feedback for outrage expressions increases the likelihood of future outrage expressions, consistent with principles of reinforcement learning. In addition, users conform their outrage expressions to the expressive norms of their social networks, suggesting norm learning also guides online outrage expressions. Norm learning overshadows reinforcement learning when normative information is readily observable: in ideologically extreme networks, where outrage expression is more common, users are less sensitive to social feedback when deciding whether to express outrage. Our findings highlight how platform design interacts with human learning mechanisms to affect moral discourse in digital public spaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Dating correlated microlayers in oxalate accretions from rock art shelters: New archives of paleoenvironments and human activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxalate-rich mineral accretions, often found in rock shelters around the world, offer important opportunities for radiocarbon dating of associated rock art. Here, sample characterization and chemical pretreatment techniques are used to characterize the accretions, prescreen for evidence of open-system behavior, and address potential contamination. The results provide stratigraphically consistent sequences of radiocarbon dates in millimeter-scale laminated accretions, demonstrating their reliability for dating rock art, particularly symbolic markings commonly engraved into these relatively soft deposits. The age sequences are also consistent with correlations between distinctive patterns in the layer sequences visible in shelters up to 90 km apart in the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia, suggesting their synchronized formation is not entirely shelter specific but broadly controlled by variations in regional environmental conditions. Consequently, these accretions also offer potential as paleoenvironmental archives, with radiocarbon dating of layers in nine accretions indicating four, approximately synchronous growth intervals covering the past 43 ka.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Coral microbiome manipulation elicits metabolic and genetic restructuring to mitigate heat stress and evade mortality</a></h4>

              
                <p>Beneficial microorganisms for corals (BMCs) ameliorate environmental stress, but whether they can prevent mortality and the underlying host response mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we conducted omics analyses on the coral <I>Mussismilia hispida</I> exposed to bleaching conditions in a long-term mesocosm experiment and inoculated with a selected BMC consortium or a saline solution placebo. All corals were affected by heat stress, but the observed "post-heat stress disorder" was mitigated by BMCs, signified by patterns of dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation, lipid maintenance, and coral host transcriptional reprogramming of cellular restructuration, repair, stress protection, and immune genes, concomitant with a 40% survival rate increase and stable photosynthetic performance by the endosymbiotic algae. This study provides insights into the responses that underlie probiotic host manipulation. We demonstrate that BMCs trigger a dynamic microbiome restructuring process that instigates genetic and metabolic alterations in the coral host that eventually mitigate coral bleaching and mortality.</p>

                <p>We propose a new class of computer-generated holograms whose far-fields have designer-specified polarization response. We dub these Jones matrix holograms. We provide a simple procedure for their implementation using form-birefringent metasurfaces. Jones matrix holography generalizes a wide body of past work with a consistent mathematical framework, particularly in the field of metasurfaces, and suggests previously unrealized devices, examples of which are demonstrated here. In particular, we demonstrate holograms whose far-fields implement parallel polarization analysis and custom waveplate-like behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Single-electron spin resonance in a nanoelectronic device using a global field</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spin-based silicon quantum electronic circuits offer a scalable platform for quantum computation, combining the manufacturability of semiconductor devices with the long coherence times afforded by spins in silicon. Advancing from current few-qubit devices to silicon quantum processors with upward of a million qubits, as required for fault-tolerant operation, presents several unique challenges, one of the most demanding being the ability to deliver microwave signals for large-scale qubit control. Here, we demonstrate a potential solution to this problem by using a three-dimensional dielectric resonator to broadcast a global microwave signal across a quantum nanoelectronic circuit. Critically, this technique uses only a single microwave source and is capable of delivering control signals to millions of qubits simultaneously. We show that the global field can be used to perform spin resonance of single electrons confined in a silicon double quantum dot device, establishing the feasibility of this approach for scalable spin qubit control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Nanodissected elastically loaded clathrin lattices relax to increased curvature</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major endocytosis pathway for the specific internalization of large compounds, growth factors, and receptors. Formation of internalized vesicles from the flat plasma membrane is accompanied by maturation of cytoplasmic clathrin coats. How clathrin coats mature and the mechanistic role of clathrin coats are still largely unknown. Maturation models proposed clathrin coats to mature at constant radius or constant area, driven by molecular actions or elastic energy. Here, combining high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) imaging, HS-AFM nanodissection, and elasticity theory, we show that clathrin lattices deviating from the intrinsic curvature of clathrin form elastically loaded assemblies. Upon nanodissection of the clathrin network, the stored elastic energy in these lattices drives lattice relaxation to accommodate an ideal area-curvature ratio toward the formation of closed clathrin-coated vesicles. Our work supports that the release of elastic energy stored in curvature-frustrated clathrin lattices could play a major role in CME.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A two-step strategy for delivering particles to targets hidden within microfabricated porous media</a></h4>

              
                <p>The delivery of small particles into porous environments remains highly challenging because of the low permeability to the fluids that carry these colloids. Even more challenging is that the specific location of targets in the porous environment usually is not known and cannot be determined from the outside. Here, we demonstrate a two-step strategy to deliver suspended colloids to targets that are "hidden" within closed porous media. The first step serves to automatically convert any hidden targets into soluto-inertial "beacons," capable of sustaining long-lived solute outfluxes. The second step introduces the deliverable objects, which are designed to autonomously migrate against the solute fluxes emitted by the targets, thereby following chemical trails that lead to the target. Experimental and theoretical demonstrations of the strategy lay out the design elements required for the solute and the deliverable objects, suggesting routes to delivering colloidal objects to hidden targets in various environments and technologies.</p>

                <p>In recent years, lanthanum aluminate/strontium titanate (LAO/STO) heterointerfaces have been used to create a growing family of nanoelectronic devices based on nanoscale control of LAO/STO metal-to-insulator transition. The properties of these devices are wide-ranging, but they are restricted by nature of the underlying thick STO substrate. Here, single-crystal freestanding membranes based on LAO/STO heterostructures were fabricated, which can be directly integrated with other materials via van der Waals stacking. The key properties of LAO/STO are preserved when LAO/STO membranes are formed. Conductive atomic force microscope lithography is shown to successfully create reversible patterns of nanoscale conducting regions, which survive to millikelvin temperatures. The ability to form reconfigurable conducting nanostructures on LAO/STO membranes opens opportunities to integrate a variety of nanoelectronics with silicon-based architectures and flexible, magnetic, or superconducting materials.</p>

The present report shows that prebiotic oxidation of &alpha;-hydroxy carboxylates can be achieved by UV photolysis of a simple geochemical species (HS<sup>&ndash;</sup>), which leads to &alpha;-oxo carboxylates that feature in the Krebs cycle and glyoxylate shunt. Further reaction of these products leads to almost all intermediates of the Krebs cycle proper, succinate semialdehyde bypass, and glyoxylate shunt. Fumarate, the missing Krebs cycle component, and the required &alpha;-hydroxy carboxylates can be provided by a highly related hydrogen cyanide chemistry, which also provides precursors for amino acids, nucleotides, and phospholipids.</p>

                <p>While energy-structure-function (ESF) maps are a powerful new tool for in silico materials design, the cost of acquiring an ESF map for many properties is too high for routine integration into high-throughput virtual screening workflows. Here, we propose the next evolution of the ESF map. This uses parallel Bayesian optimization to selectively acquire energy and property data, generating the same levels of insight at a fraction of the computational cost. We use this approach to obtain a two orders of magnitude speedup on an ESF study that focused on the discovery of molecular crystals for methane capture, saving more than 500,000 central processing unit hours from the original protocol. By accelerating the acquisition of insight from ESF maps, we pave the way for the use of these maps in automated ultrahigh-throughput screening pipelines by greatly reducing the opportunity risk associated with the choice of system to calculate.</p>

                <p>The recruitment of Unc-51-like kinase and TANK-binding kinase 1 complexes is essential for Nuclear dot protein 52-mediated selective autophagy and relies on the specific association of NDP52, RB1-inducible coiled-coil protein 1, and Nak-associated protein 1 (5-azacytidine-induced protein 2, AZI2). However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we find that except for the NDP52 SKIP carboxyl homology (SKICH)/RB1CC1 coiled-coil interaction, the LC3-interacting region of NDP52 can directly interact with the RB1CC1 Claw domain, as that of NAP1 FIP200-binding region (FIR). The determined crystal structures of NDP52 SKICH/RB1CC1 complex, NAP1 FIR/RB1CC1 complex, and the related NAP1 FIR/Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein complex not only elucidate the molecular bases underpinning the interactions of RB1CC1 with NDP52 and NAP1 but also reveal that RB1CC1 Claw and Autophagy-related protein 8 family proteins are competitive in binding to NAP1 and NDP52. Overall, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the interactions of NDP52, NAP1 with RB1CC1 and ATG8 family proteins.</p>

                <p>The year 2020 brought unimaginable challenges in public health, with the confluence of the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires across the western United States. Wildfires produce high levels of fine particulate matter (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>). Recent studies reported that short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We acquired and linked publicly available daily data on PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and other confounders for 92 western U.S. counties that were affected by the 2020 wildfires. We estimated the association between short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> during the wildfires and the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We adjusted for several time-varying confounding factors (e.g., weather, seasonality, long-term trends, mobility, and population size). We found strong evidence that wildfires amplified the effect of short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> on COVID-19 cases and deaths, although with substantial heterogeneity across counties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic, Episodic Nicotine Alters Hypoglossal Motor Neuron Function at a Critical Developmental Time Point in Neonatal Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Developmental nicotine exposure (DNE), alters brainstem neurons that control breathing, including hypoglossal motor neurons (XIIMNs), which innervate the tongue. Here, we tested the hypothesis that chronic, episodic DNE (eDNE), which mimics nicotine replacement therapies such as e-cigarettes or nicotine gum, alters the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), XIIMN intrinsic properties, and tongue muscle function <I>in vivo</I> similar to what we have observed with a chronic, sustained exposure model. We delivered nicotine to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats through drinking water and studied pups of either sex in two age groups: postnatal day (P)1&ndash;P5 and P10&ndash;P12, which encompasses a critical period in brain development. At P1&ndash;P5, eDNE was associated with delayed recovery of nAChRs from desensitization; however, there were no changes in the magnitude of desensitization, XIIMN intrinsic properties, or tongue muscle function <I>in vivo.</I> By P10&ndash;P12, eDNE XIIMNs had lower peak firing frequencies in response to depolarizing current injection, larger delayed rectifier potassium currents, and continued to exhibit delayed nAChR recovery. Moreover, this age group exhibited a blunted and delayed tongue muscle response to nasal occlusion <I>in vivo</I>, indicating that changes to XIIMN intrinsic properties is an important mechanism behind this effect, as it is not produced by altered nAChR function alone. Together, these results show that eDNE alters XIIMNs and tongue muscle function during a critical period in brain development and that the specific effects of chronic nicotine exposure may be pattern dependent.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Interplay between COVID-19 vaccines and social measures for ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The development and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has provided the clearest path forward to eliminate community spread and thus end the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? Methods: We develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number Rt and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Results: Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. We then investigate the threat of localized outbreaks in low-vaccinated populations that have removed all social intervention mandates, and show that such populations could remain highly susceptible to major outbreaks particularly in the face of more easily transmissible variants.  Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex interplay involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extant social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.

                <p>by Kshitij Dwivedi, Michael F. Bonner, Radoslaw Martin Cichy, Gemma Roig</p>

The human visual cortex enables visual perception through a cascade of hierarchical computations in cortical regions with distinct functionalities. Here, we introduce an AI-driven approach to discover the functional mapping of the visual cortex. We related human brain responses to scene images measured with functional MRI (fMRI) systematically to a diverse set of deep neural networks (DNNs) optimized to perform different scene perception tasks. We found a structured mapping between DNN tasks and brain regions along the ventral and dorsal visual streams. Low-level visual tasks mapped onto early brain regions, 3-dimensional scene perception tasks mapped onto the dorsal stream, and semantic tasks mapped onto the ventral stream. This mapping was of high fidelity, with more than 60% of the explainable variance in nine key regions being explained. Together, our results provide a novel functional mapping of the human visual cortex and demonstrate the power of the computational approach.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Glycerol suppresses glucose consumption in trypanosomes through metabolic contest</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefan Allmann, Marion Wargnies, Nicolas Plazolles, Edern Cahoreau, Marc Biran, Pauline Morand, Erika Pineda, Hanna Kulyk, Corinne Asencio, Oriana Villafraz, Loïc Rivière, Emmanuel Tetaud, Brice Rotureau, Arnaud Mourier, Jean-Charles Portais, Frédéric Bringaud</p>

Microorganisms must make the right choice for nutrient consumption to adapt to their changing environment. As a consequence, bacteria and yeasts have developed regulatory mechanisms involving nutrient sensing and signaling, known as “catabolite repression,” allowing redirection of cell metabolism to maximize the consumption of an energy-efficient carbon source. Here, we report a new mechanism named “metabolic contest” for regulating the use of carbon sources without nutrient sensing and signaling. <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> is a unicellular eukaryote transmitted by tsetse flies and causing human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. We showed that, in contrast to most microorganisms, the insect stages of this parasite developed a preference for glycerol over glucose, with glucose consumption beginning after the depletion of glycerol present in the medium. This “metabolic contest” depends on the combination of 3 conditions: (i) the sequestration of both metabolic pathways in the same subcellular compartment, here in the peroxisomal-related organelles named glycosomes; (ii) the competition for the same substrate, here ATP, with the first enzymatic step of the glycerol and glucose metabolic pathways both being ATP-dependent (glycerol kinase and hexokinase, respectively); and (iii) an unbalanced activity between the competing enzymes, here the glycerol kinase activity being approximately 80-fold higher than the hexokinase activity. As predicted by our model, an approximately 50-fold down-regulation of the GK expression abolished the preference for glycerol over glucose, with glucose and glycerol being metabolized concomitantly. In theory, a metabolic contest could be found in any organism provided that the 3 conditions listed above are met.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methods and guidance on conducting, reporting, publishing and appraising living systematic reviews: a scoping review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The living systematic review (LSR) approach is based on an ongoing surveillance of the literature and continual updating. A few guidance documents address the conduct, reporting, publishing and appraisal of systematic reviews (SRs), but the methodology described is either not up-to date or not suitable for LSRs and misses additional LSR-specific considerations. The objective of this scoping review is to systematically collate methodological literature and guidance on how to conduct, report, publish and appraise the quality of LSRs. The scoping review will allow the mapping of the existing evidence on the topic to support LSRs authors seeking guidance and identify related gaps.  Methods: To achieve our objectives, we will conduct a scoping review to survey and evaluate existing evidence, using the standard scoping review methodology. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane using the OVID interface. The search strategy was developed by a researcher experienced in developing literature search strategies with the help of an information specialist. As for searching grey literature, we will seek existing guidelines and handbooks on LSRs from organizations that conduct evidence syntheses using the Lens.org website. Two review authors will extract and catalogue the study data on LSR methodological aspects into a standardized and pilot-tested data extraction form. The main categories will reflect proposed methods for (i) conducting LSRs, (ii) reporting of LSRs, (iii) publishing and (iv) appraising the quality of LSRs. Data synthesis and conclusion: By collecting these data from methodological surveys and papers, as well as existing guidance documents and handbooks on LSRs, we might identify specific issues and components lacking within current LSR methodology. Thus, the systematically obtained findings of the scoping review could be used as basis for the revision of existing methods tools on LSR, for instance a PRISMA statement extension for LSRs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Exploring the growth process of successors in long-lived small and medium-sized manufacturing companies: a qualitative study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Japan is the world's largest country in terms of the number of long-lived companies, the majority of which are family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises. On the other hand, many business owners will be retiring without successors, and the closure of these small and medium enterprises may have a significant impact on the future economy. The purpose of this study is to explore the growth process of successors in long-lived small and medium-sized manufacturing companies so that potential successors can know what they will experience as managers and be prepared for the future, and professionals who support successors can be provided with information on the growth process of successors to provide appropriate support. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six successors of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies that are more than half a century old. Their answers were analyzed using the modified grounded theory approach to construct a hypothetical model. Results: In total, 46 concepts, four categories, 17 subcategories, and one core category with an analysis result diagram were formed. The diagram shows the successors gained confidence in management through the dilemma between autonomy and constraint in the early stage of succession, which was found in previous research. Following the initial stage, the successors responded to the crisis caused by market constraints such as being stuck in a new market, unreasonable treatment from customers, and created autonomous strategies in their businesses. Conclusions: By experiencing repetitive crises, the successors tend to acquire new perspectives toward the naturally occurring crises. This change of premise by the successors is considered as the process of double-loop learning. Relationships inside and outside the company influence the generation of this viewpoint. From a long-term perspective, a sense of unity with employees, stable employment, and the pursuit of enjoyment constitute the successors' values in this model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An in vitro model for the cultivation of polymicrobial biofilms under continuous-flow conditions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often chronically colonised with a diverse array of bacterial and fungal species. However, little is known about the relative partitioning of species between the planktonic and biofilm modes of growth in the airways. Existing in vivo and in vitro models of CF airway infection are ill-suited for the long-term recapitulation of mixed microbial communities. Here we describe a simple, in vitro continuous-flow model for the cultivation of polymicrobial biofilms and planktonic cultures on different substrata. Our data provide evidence for inter-species antagonism and synergism in biofilm ecology. We further show that the type of substratum on which the biofilms grow has a profound influence on their species composition. This happens without any major alteration in the composition of the surrounding steady-state planktonic community. Our experimentally-tractable model enables the systematic study of planktonic and biofilm communities under conditions that are nutritionally reminiscent of the CF airway microenvironment, something not possible using any existing in vivo models of CF airway infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cyclic fatigue resistance of four different nickel-titanium instruments in an artificial canal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The objective of this study was to measure the number of cycles to fracture of four continuous or reciprocating rotary nickel-titanium instruments in different materials. Methods: A total of 40 nickel-titanium instruments were used for the present study. Instruments were divided into four groups (n=10): group 1, Revo-S SU; group 2, ProTaper Next X2; group 3, Reciproc R25; group 4, WaveOne Gold Primary. An artificial stainless-steel was used to test the cyclic fatigue of the instruments. The instruments were introduced into the stainless-steel canal, one at a time, until they reached the other end, then they were rotated inside the canal without in-out motion. The time from the beginning of instrument rotation until the occurrence of breakage was recorded. The number of rotated cycles to fracture of the instrument were calculated based on the revolutions per minute (rpm) of each instrument and the recorded rotated time. The mean number of cycles to fracture and standard deviations were calculated and statistically analysed. Results: The number of cycles to fracture of the Revo-S SU was the lowest, and that of the WaveOne Gold Primary was highest. Scanning electronic microscope images of fracture surfaces revealed the characteristics of fatigue. Conclusions: The number of cycles to fracture of the reciprocating WaveOne Gold Primary system was the highest amongst the tested instruments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Empowering young immigrant girls in Canada through the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum: A qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gender inequality is a global issue. In Canada, 70% of women experience some form of inequality in their lifetime. Immigrant adolescents in Canada make up a substantial proportion of newcomers, and immigrant girls face the threat of subjugation and oppression, which has a significant impact on their health, development, and economic outcomes as well as gender inequality. Research on girls’ empowerment and resilience-building programs and interventions is virtually nonexistent. In this project, we implemented the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum. The aim of this project was to engage and empower South Asian (SA) immigrant adolescent girls and to promote gender equality in Canada. Methods: This study utilized a qualitative descriptive design. Pre- and post-curriculum implementation focus group discussions were conducted. Results: A total of 16 adolescent girls ranging from 11 to 18 years of age participated in this study. The participants described challenges many young girls face in relation to gender inequality such as gender discrimination, gendered stereotyping, barriers to education, etc. The ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum allowed participants to highlight and reflect on the various problems faced by SA immigrant adolescents in their communities. The participants learned to examine these challenges through a variety of engaging activities to identify their root cause, effects and propose solutions to bring long-lasting change. The curriculum equipped them with useful tools such as decision-makers maps and advocacy skills to educate decision-makers by creating and delivering powerful messages influenced by personal stories and evidence-based literature.  Conclusion: The study provided significant insight into understanding the diverse challenges encountered by SA immigrant adolescent girls in Canada and linking them to the effectiveness of the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum. The girl-focused development programs that emphasize developing self-confidence, communication skills, problem-solving skills, and decision making are effective in empowering the socially deprived adolescent girls locally and in the global context.

                The K2P-type ion channel TRAAK, which is involved in action potential propagation, generates leak currents and is further activated by mechanical force. Rietmeijer, Sorum, et al. study TRAAK gain-of-function mutations, including those that cause the human neurodevelopmental FHEIG syndrome, and show that leak and mechanically gated openings have distinct structures and electrical properties.

                Matsumoto et al. uncover that cardinal direction selectivity emerges in retinal bipolar cell axon terminals. The selectivity is established de novo at the terminals by starburst amacrine cells, mediated by both cholinergic transmission and wide-field amacrine cells. The bipolar cells transmit tuned glutamate inputs to directional preference-matched ganglion cells.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Current tools to interrogate microglial biology</a></h4>

              
                Microglial cells perform a plethora of functions in the central nervous system (CNS), involving them in brain development, maintenance of homeostasis in adulthood, and CNS diseases. Significant technical advancements have prompted the development of novel systems adapted to analyze microglia with increasing specificity and intricacy. The advent of single-cell technologies combined with targeted mouse models has been decisive in deciphering microglia heterogeneity and dissecting microglial functions. However sophisticated these tools have become, clear limitations remain. Understanding their pitfalls and advantages ensures their correct application. Therefore, we provide a guide to the cutting-edge methods currently available to dissect microglial biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Patterns of within-host genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstructing transmission chains has become a major public health focus for many governments around the world. The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95.1% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within- and between-host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intracellular functions and motile properties of bi-directional kinesin-5 Cin8 are regulated by neck linker docking</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we analyzed intracellular functions and motile properties of neck-linker (NL) variants of the bi-directional <i>S. cerevisiae</i> kinesin-5 motor, Cin8. We also examined – by modeling – the configuration of H-bonds during NL docking. Decreasing the number of stabilizing H-bonds resulted in partially functional variants, as long as a conserved backbone H-bond at the N-latch position (proposed to stabilize the docked conformation of the NL) remained intact. Elimination of this conserved H-bond resulted in production of a non-functional Cin8 variant. Surprisingly, additional H-bond stabilization of the N-latch position, generated by replacement of the NL of Cin8 by sequences of the plus-end directed kinesin-5 Eg5, also produced a nonfunctional variant. In that variant, a single replacement of N-latch asparagine with glycine, as present in Cin8, eliminated the additional H-bond stabilization and rescued the functional defects. We conclude that exact N-latch stabilization during NL docking is critical for the function of bi-directional kinesin-5 Cin8.

                Climate change is dramatically changing ecosystem composition and productivity, leading scientists to consider the best approaches to map natural resistance and foster ecosystem resilience in the face of these changes. Here we present results from a large-scale experimental assessment of coral bleaching resistance, a critical trait for coral population persistence as oceans warm, in 221 colonies of the coral <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i> across 37 reefs in Palau. We find that bleaching resistant individuals inhabit most reefs but are found more often in warmer microhabitats. Our survey also found wide variation in symbiont concentration among colonies, and that colonies with lower symbiont load tended to be more bleaching resistant. By contrast, our data show that low symbiont load comes at the cost of lower growth rate, a tradeoff that may operate widely among corals across environments. Corals with high bleaching resistance have been suggested as a source for habitat restoration or selective breeding in order to increase coral reef resilience to climate change. Our maps show where these resilience corals can be found, but the existence of tradeoffs with heat resistance may suggest caution in unilateral use of this one trait in restoration.

                Cytoplasmic lipid droplets are highly dynamic storage organelles that are critical for cellular lipid homeostasis. While the molecular details of lipid droplet dynamics are a very active area of investigation, this work has been primarily performed in cultured cells. Taking advantage of the powerful transgenic and <i>in vivo </i>imaging opportunities available in zebrafish, we built a suite of tools to study lipid droplets in real-time from the subcellular to the whole organism level. Fluorescently tagging the lipid-droplet-associated proteins, perilipin 2 and perilipin 3, in the endogenous loci permits visualization of lipid droplets in the intestine, liver, and adipose tissue. Using these tools, we found that perilipin 3 is rapidly loaded on intestinal lipid droplets following a high-fat meal and later replaced by perilipin 2. These powerful new tools will facilitate studies on the role of lipid droplets in different tissues, under different genetic and physiological manipulations, and in a variety of human disease models.

Using DNA replication reactions reconstituted with purified proteins, we show Rad53 phosphorylation of Sld3/7 or Dbf4-dependent kinase blocks replication initiation whilst phosphorylation of Mrc1 or Mcm10 slows elongation. Mrc1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient to slow replication forks in complete reactions; Mcm10 phosphorylation can also slow replication forks, but only in the absence of unphosphorylated Mrc1. Mrc1 stimulates the unwinding rate of the replicative helicase, CMG, and Rad53 phosphorylation of Mrc1 prevents this. We show that a phosphorylation-mimicking Mrc1 mutant cannot stimulate replication <i>in vitro</i> and partially rescues the sensitivity of a <i>rad53</i> null mutant to genotoxic stress <i>in vivo</i>. Our results show that Rad53 protects replication forks in part by antagonising Mrc1 stimulation of CMG unwinding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sustained expression of unc-4 homeobox gene and unc-37/Groucho in postmitotic neurons specifies the spatial organization of the cholinergic synapses in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal cell fate determinants establish the identities of neurons by controlling gene expression to regulate neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity. However, it is not understood if neuronal cell fate determinants have postmitotic functions in synapse pattern formation. Here we identify a novel role for UNC-4 homeobox protein and its corepressor UNC-37/Groucho, in tiled synaptic patterning of the cholinergic motor neurons in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that <i>unc-4</i> is not required during neurogenesis but is required in the postmitotic neurons for proper synapse patterning. In contrast, <i>unc-37</i> is required in both developing and postmitotic neurons. The synaptic tiling defects of <i>unc-4</i> mutants are suppressed by <i>bar-1/β-catenin</i> mutation, which positively regulates the expression of <i>ceh-12/HB9</i>. Ectopic <i>ceh-12</i> expression partly underlies the synaptic tiling defects of <i>unc-4</i> and <i>unc-37</i> mutants. Our results reveal a novel postmitotic role of neuronal cell fate determinants in synapse pattern formation through inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

                The Patch-seq approach is a powerful variation of the patch-clamp technique that allows for the combined electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptomic characterization of individual neurons. To generate Patch-seq datasets at scale, we identified and refined key factors that contribute to the efficient collection of high-quality data. We developed patch-clamp electrophysiology software with analysis functions specifically designed to automate acquisition with online quality control. We recognized the importance of extracting the nucleus for transcriptomic success and maximizing membrane integrity during nucleus extraction for morphology success. The protocol is generalizable to different species and brain regions, as demonstrated by capturing multimodal data from human and macaque brain slices. The protocol, analysis and acquisition software are compiled at https://github.com/AllenInstitute/patchseqtools. This resource can be used by individual labs to generate data across diverse mammalian species and that is compatible with large publicly available Patch-seq datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep spindles, ripples, and interictal epileptiform discharges in the human anterior and mediodorsal thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Sleep spindles are major oscillatory components of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, reflecting hyperpolarization-rebound sequences of thalamocortical neurons, the inhibition of which is caused by the NREM-dependent activation of GABAergic neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. Reports suggest a link between sleep spindles and several forms of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) which are considered as expressions of pathological off-line neural plasticity in the central nervous system. Here we investigated the relationship between thalamic sleep spindles, IEDs and ripples in the anterior and mediodorsal nuclei (ANT and MD) of epilepsy patients. Whole-night LFP from the ANT and MD were co-registered with scalp EEG/polysomnography by using externalized leads in 15 epilepsy patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation protocol. Slow (~12 Hz) and fast (~14 Hz) sleep spindles were present in the human ANT and MD. Roughly, one third of thalamic sleep spindles were associated with IEDs or ripples. Both IED- and ripple-associated spindles were longer than pure spindles. IED-associated thalamic sleep spindles were characterized by broadband increase in thalamic and cortical activity, both below and above the spindle frequency range, whereas ripple-associated thalamic spindles exceeded pure spindles in terms of 80-200 Hz thalamic, but not cortical activity as indicated by time-frequency analysis. These result show that thalamic spindles coupled with IEDs are reflected at the scalp slow and beta-gamma oscillation as well. IED density during sleep spindles in the MD, but not in the ANT was identified as correlates of years spent with epilepsy, whereas no signs of pathological processes were correlated with measures of ripple and spindle association. Furthermore, the density of ripple-associated sleep spindles in the ANT showed a positive correlation with general intelligence. Our findings indicate the complex and multifaceted role of the human thalamus in sleep spindle-related physiological and pathological neural plasticity.

	<p>Drug addiction is thought to be driven by negative reinforcement, and it is thought that a shift from positive affect upon initial exposure to negative affect after chronic exposure to a drug is responsible for maintaining self-administration (SA) in addicted individuals. This can be modeled in rats by analyzing ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), a type of intraspecies communication indicative of affective state based on the frequency of the emission: calls in the 22 kHz range indicate negative affect, whereas calls in the 50 kHz range indicate positive affect. We employed a voluntary chronic, long-access model of fentanyl SA to analyze affective changes in the response to chronic fentanyl exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered either fentanyl (N = 7) or saline (N = 6) for 30 consecutive days and USVs were recorded at four different time points: the day before first SA session (PRE), the first day of SA (T01), the last day of SA (T30), and the first day of abstinence (ABS). At T01, the ratio of 50 to 22 kHz calls was similar between the fentanyl and saline groups, but at T30, the ratio differed between groups, with the fentanyl group showing significantly fewer 50 kHz calls and more 22 kHz calls relative to saline animals. These results indicate a shift toward a negative affect during drug use after chronic exposure to fentanyl and support negative reinforcement as a main driving factor of opioid addiction.</p>

	<p>Functional neuroimaging studies have highlighted the roles of three networks in processing language, all of which are typically left-lateralized: a ventral stream involved in semantics, a dorsal stream involved in phonology and speech production, and a more dorsal “multiple demand” network involved in many effortful tasks. As lateralization in all networks may be affected by life factors such as age, literacy, education, and brain pathology, we sought to develop a task paradigm with which to investigate the engagement of these networks, including manipulations to selectively emphasize semantic and phonological processing within a single task performable by almost anyone regardless of literacy status. In young healthy participants, we administered an auditory word monitoring task, in which participants had to note the occurrence of a target word within a continuous story presented in either their native language, Portuguese, or the unknown language, Japanese. Native language task performance activated ventral stream language networks, left lateralized but bilateral in the anterior temporal lobe. Unfamiliar language performance, being more difficult, activated left hemisphere dorsal stream structures and the multiple demand network bilaterally, but predominantly in the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that increased demands on phonological processing to accomplish word monitoring in the absence of semantic support may result in the bilateral recruitment of networks involved in speech perception under more challenging conditions.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent pediatric neurologic impairment and is associated with major mobility deficiencies. This has led to extensive investigations of the sensorimotor network, with far less research focusing on other major networks. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) of the main sensory networks (i.e., visual and auditory) and the sensorimotor network, and to link FC to the gait biomechanics of youth with CP. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we first identified the sensorimotor, visual and auditory networks in youth with CP and neurotypical controls. Our analysis revealed reduced FC among the networks in the youth with CP relative to the controls. Notably, the visual network showed lower FC with both the sensorimotor and auditory networks. Furthermore, higher FC between the visual and sensorimotor cortices was associated with larger step length (r = 0.74, pFDR = 0.04) in youth with CP. These results confirm that CP is associated with functional brain abnormalities beyond the sensorimotor network, suggesting abnormal functional integration of the brain’s motor and primary sensory systems. The significant association between abnormal visuo-motor FC and gait could indicate a link with visuomotor disorders in this patient population.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which can affect 65 million patients worldwide. Recently, network based analyses have been of great help in the investigation of seizures. Now graph theory is commonly applied to analyze functional brain networks, but functional brain networks are dynamic. Methods based on graph theory find it difficult to reflect the dynamic changes of functional brain network. In this paper, an approach to extracting features from brain functional networks is presented. Dynamic functional brain networks can be obtained by stacking multiple functional brain networks on the time axis. Then, a tensor decomposition method is used to extract features, and an ELM classifier is introduced to complete epilepsy prediction. In the prediction of epilepsy, the accuracy and F1 score of the feature extracted by tensor decomposition are higher than the degree and clustering coefficient. The features extracted from the dynamic functional brain network by tensor decomposition show better and more comprehensive performance than degree and clustering coefficient in epilepsy prediction.</p>

                As we comprehend narratives, our attentional engagement fluctuates over time. Despite theoretical conceptions of narrative engagement as emotion-laden attention, little empirical work has characterized the cognitive and neural processes that comprise subjective engagement in naturalistic contexts or its consequences for memory. Here, we relate fluctuations in narrative engagement to patterns...

                <p>The origin of human metaplastic states and their propensity for cancer is poorly understood. Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus is a common metaplastic condition that increases the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and its cellular origin is enigmatic. To address this, we harvested tissues spanning the gastroesophageal junction from healthy and diseased donors, including isolation of esophageal submucosal glands. A combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling, in silico lineage tracing from methylation, open chromatin and somatic mutation analyses, and functional studies in organoid models showed that Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus originates from gastric cardia through c-MYC and HNF4A-driven transcriptional programs. Furthermore, our data indicate that esophageal adenocarcinoma likely arises from undifferentiated Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus cell types even in the absence of a pathologically identifiable metaplastic precursor, illuminating early detection strategies.</p>

                <p>CRISPR-associated transposition systems allow guide RNA&ndash;directed integration of a single DNA cargo in one orientation at a fixed distance from a programmable target sequence. We used cryo&ndash;electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define the mechanism that underlies this process by characterizing the transposition regulator, TnsC, from a type V-K CRISPR-transposase system. In this scenario, polymerization of adenosine triphosphate&ndash;bound TnsC helical filaments could explain how polarity information is passed to the transposase. TniQ caps the TnsC filament, representing a universal mechanism for target information transfer in Tn7/Tn7-like elements. Transposase-driven disassembly establishes delivery of the element only to unused protospacers. Finally, TnsC transitions to define the fixed point of insertion, as revealed by structures with the transition state mimic ADP&bull;AlF<SUB>3</SUB>. These mechanistic findings provide the underpinnings for engineering CRISPR-associated transposition systems for research and therapeutic applications.</p>

                <p>The oomycete <I>Phytophthora infestans</I> is a damaging crop pathogen and a model organism to study plant-pathogen interactions. We report the discovery of a family of copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) in plant pathogenic oomycetes and its role in plant infection by <I>P. infestans</I>. We show that LPMO-encoding genes are up-regulated early during infection and that the secreted enzymes oxidatively cleave the backbone of pectin, a charged polysaccharide in the plant cell wall. The crystal structure of the most abundant of these LPMOs sheds light on its ability to recognize and degrade pectin, and silencing the encoding gene in <I>P. infestans</I> inhibits infection of potato, indicating a role in host penetration. The identification of LPMOs as virulence factors in pathogenic oomycetes opens up opportunities in crop protection and food security.</p>

                <p>Harnessing the potential wide-ranging quantum science applications of molecules will require control of their interactions. Here, we used microwave radiation to directly engineer and tune the interaction potentials between ultracold calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules. By merging two optical tweezers, each containing a single molecule, we probed collisions in three dimensions. The correct combination of microwave frequency and power created an effective repulsive shield, which suppressed the inelastic loss rate by a factor of six, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The demonstrated microwave shielding shows a general route to the creation of long-lived, dense samples of ultracold polar molecules and evaporative cooling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Chemically recyclable thermoplastics from reversible-deactivation polymerization of cyclic acetals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Identifying plastics capable of chemical recycling to monomer (CRM) is the foremost challenge in creating a sustainable circular plastic economy. Polyacetals are promising candidates for CRM but lack useful tensile strengths owing to the low molecular weights produced using current uncontrolled cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) methods. Here, we present reversible-deactivation CROP of cyclic acetals using a commercial halomethyl ether initiator and an indium(III) bromide catalyst. Using this method, we synthesize poly(1,3-dioxolane) (PDXL), which demonstrates tensile strength comparable to some commodity polyolefins. Depolymerization of PDXL using strong acid catalysts returns monomer in near-quantitative yield and even proceeds from a commodity plastic waste mixture. Our efficient polymerization method affords a tough thermoplastic that can undergo selective depolymerization to monomer.</p>

                <p>Accretion disks around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei produce continuum radiation at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. Physical processes in the accretion flow lead to stochastic variability of this emission on a wide range of time scales. We measured the optical continuum variability observed in 67 active galactic nuclei and the characteristic time scale at which the variability power spectrum flattens. We found a correlation between this time scale and the black hole mass extending over the entire mass range of supermassive black holes. This time scale is consistent with the expected thermal time scale at the ultraviolet-emitting radius in standard accretion disk theory. Accreting white dwarfs lie close to this correlation, suggesting a common process for all accretion disks.</p>

                <p>Molecular time trees indicating that embryophytes originated around 500 million years ago (Ma) during the Cambrian are at odds with the record of fossil plants, which first appear in the mid-Silurian almost 80 million years later. This time gap has been attributed to a missing fossil plant record, but that attribution belies the case for fossil spores. Here, we describe a Tremadocian (Early Ordovician, about 480 Ma) assemblage with elements of both Cambrian and younger embryophyte spores that provides a new level of evolutionary continuity between embryophytes and their algal ancestors. This finding suggests that the molecular phylogenetic signal retains a latent evolutionary history of the acquisition of the embryophytic developmental genome, a history that perhaps began during Ediacaran-Cambrian time but was not completed until the mid-Silurian (about 430 Ma).</p>

The coexistence of magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity, together with the crystal structure of this material, suggests that a distinctive set of symmetries, magnetic properties, and topology underlie the superconducting state. Here, we report observations of a nonzero polar Kerr effect and of two transitions in the specific heat upon entering the superconducting state, which together suggest that the superconductivity in UTe<SUB>2</SUB> is characterized by a two-component order parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. These data place constraints on the symmetries of the order parameter and inform the discussion on the presence of topological superconductivity in UTe<SUB>2</SUB>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Boridene: Two-dimensional Mo4/3B2-x with ordered metal vacancies obtained by chemical exfoliation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Extensive research has been invested in two-dimensional (2D) materials, typically synthesized by exfoliation of van der Waals solids. One exception is MXenes, derived from the etching of constituent layers in transition metal carbides and nitrides. We report the experimental realization of boridene in the form of single-layer 2D molybdenum boride sheets with ordered metal vacancies, Mo<SUB>4/3</SUB>B<SUB>2-x</SUB>T<SUB>z</SUB> (where T<SUB>z</SUB> is fluorine, oxygen, or hydroxide surface terminations), produced by selective etching of aluminum and yttrium or scandium atoms from 3D in-plane chemically ordered (Mo<SUB>2/3</SUB>Y<SUB>1/3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>AlB<SUB>2</SUB> and (Mo<SUB>2/3</SUB>Sc<SUB>1/3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>AlB<SUB>2</SUB> in aqueous hydrofluoric acid.

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Lifetime mobility of an Arctic woolly mammoth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Little is known about woolly mammoth (<I>Mammuthus primigenius</I>) mobility and range. Here we use high temporal resolution sequential analyses of strontium isotope ratios along an entire 1.7-meter-long tusk to reconstruct the movements of an Arctic woolly mammoth that lived 17,100 years ago, during the last ice age. We use an isotope-guided random walk approach to compare the tusk&rsquo;s strontium and oxygen isotope profiles to isotopic maps. Our modeling reveals patterns of movement across a geographically extensive range during the animal&rsquo;s ~28-year life span that varied with life stages. Maintenance of this level of mobility by megafaunal species such as mammoth would have been increasingly difficult as the ice age ended and the environment changed at high latitudes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Daily energy expenditure through the human life course</a></h4>

              
                <p>Total daily energy expenditure ("total expenditure") reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, but its trajectory over the life course is poorly studied. We analyzed a large, diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. Total expenditure increased with fat-free mass in a power-law manner, with four distinct life stages. Fat-free mass&ndash;adjusted expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to ~50% above adult values at ~1 year; declines slowly to adult levels by ~20 years; remains stable in adulthood (20 to 60 years), even during pregnancy; then declines in older adults. These changes shed light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the life span.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">High-fat diet-induced colonocyte dysfunction escalates microbiota-derived trimethylamine N-oxide</a></h4>

              
                <p>A Western-style, high-fat diet promotes cardiovascular disease, in part because it is rich in choline, which is converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by the gut microbiota. However, whether diet-induced changes in intestinal physiology can alter the metabolic capacity of the microbiota remains unknown. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, we show that chronic exposure to a high-fat diet escalates <I>Escherichia coli</I> choline catabolism by altering intestinal epithelial physiology. A high-fat diet impaired the bioenergetics of mitochondria in the colonic epithelium to increase the luminal bioavailability of oxygen and nitrate, thereby intensifying respiration-dependent choline catabolism of <I>E. coli</I>. In turn, <I>E. coli</I> choline catabolism increased levels of circulating trimethlamine <I>N</I>-oxide, which is a potentially harmful metabolite generated by gut microbiota.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Structural and functional ramifications of antigenic drift in recent SARS-CoV-2 variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited against the receptor binding site (RBS) of the spike protein of wild-type severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are generally less effective against recent variants of concern. RBS residues Glu<sup>484</sup>, Lys<sup>417</sup>, and Asn<sup>501</sup> are mutated in variants first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). We analyzed their effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding, as well as the effects of two of these mutations (K417N and E484K) on nAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients. Binding and neutralization of the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2), which can both bind the RBS in alternative binding modes, are abrogated by K417N, E484K, or both. These effects can be structurally explained by their extensive interactions with RBS nAbs. However, nAbs to the more conserved, cross-neutralizing CR3022 and S309 sites were largely unaffected. The results have implications for next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies.</p>

                <p>The emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that are resistant to therapeutic antibodies highlights the need for continuing discovery of broadly reactive antibodies. We identified four receptor binding domain&ndash;targeting antibodies from three early-outbreak convalescent donors with potent neutralizing activity against 23 variants, including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.526, and B.1.617 VOCs. Two antibodies are ultrapotent, with subnanomolar neutralization titers [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<SUB>50</SUB>) 0.3 to 11.1 nanograms per milliliter; IC<SUB>80</SUB> 1.5 to 34.5 nanograms per milliliter). We define the structural and functional determinants of binding for all four VOC-targeting antibodies and show that combinations of two antibodies decrease the in vitro generation of escape mutants, suggesting their potential in mitigating resistance development.</p>

                <p>Capturing the heterogeneous phenotypes of microbial populations at relevant spatiotemporal scales is highly challenging. Here, we present par-seqFISH (parallel sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization), a transcriptome-imaging approach that records gene expression and spatial context within microscale assemblies at a single-cell and molecule resolution. We applied this approach to the opportunistic pathogen <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, analyzing about 600,000 individuals across dozens of conditions in planktonic and biofilm cultures. We identified numerous metabolic- and virulence-related transcriptional states that emerged dynamically during planktonic growth, as well as highly spatially resolved metabolic heterogeneity in sessile populations. Our data reveal that distinct physiological states can coexist within the same biofilm just several micrometers away, underscoring the importance of the microenvironment. Our results illustrate the complex dynamics of microbial populations and present a new way of studying them at high resolution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor redux: Discovery of accessories opens therapeutic vistas</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) acts in part through a family of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs), which mediate diverse physiological processes including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and sensory transduction. Pharmacologically, nAChRs are responsible for tobacco addiction and are targeted by medicines for hypertension and dementia. Nicotinic AChRs were the first ion channels to be isolated. Recent studies have identified molecules that control nAChR biogenesis, trafficking, and function. These nAChR accessories include protein and chemical chaperones as well as auxiliary subunits. Whereas some factors act on many nAChRs, others are receptor specific. Discovery of these regulatory mechanisms is transforming nAChR research in cells and tissues ranging from central neurons to spinal ganglia to cochlear hair cells. Nicotinic AChR&ndash;specific accessories also enable drug discovery on high-confidence targets for psychiatric, neurological, and auditory disorders.</p>

                Background: Substance abuse by medical students poses a significant risk not only on their personal life but also on their professional life by putting their patients at risk. Our study aims to find out the prevalence of substance abuse and factors associated with it among medical students. Methods: A descriptive, online-questionnaire based, cross-sectional study was carried out at Gandaki Medical College, a medical school in Gandaki Province of Nepal. Whole sampling technique was used. SPSS-25.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for analyzing demographic and substance abuse related variables. Chi square and Fishers exact test was used to find out if any differences existed in substance abuse by demographic characteristics. Results: Among 420 eligible participants, 219 participated in the survey (response rate: 52.2%). Alcohol was the most commonly used substance with overall lifetime prevalence of 58% followed by cigarette smoking and illegal drug abuse at 21.9% and 13.7%, respectively. The abuse of substances was significantly higher (p<0.05) in males, who were offered substances by friends, and amongst study participants who worked with an intoxicated colleague. The most common reason for substance abuse was “For pleasure, curiosity or to go along with friends” (23%, n=18). Major and minor dysfunction due to alcohol abuse was reported by 8(3.7%) and 33(15.1%) participants, while the same dysfunctions due to drug abuse were reported by 1(0.5%) and 14(6.4%) participants, respectively. Conclusions: The prevalence of substance abuse was high among medical students and was found to be associated with male gender, if offer of substances were made by friends, and amongst those who worked with an intoxicated colleague. This problem of substance abuse among medical students should be addressed timely as failing to do so might have serious consequences on the healthcare system of the country.

                <p>by Vincent Rocher, Matthieu Genais, Elissar Nassereddine, Raphael Mourad</p>

DNA is a complex molecule carrying the instructions an organism needs to develop, live and reproduce. In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered that DNA is composed of two chains forming a double-helix. Later on, other structures of DNA were discovered and shown to play important roles in the cell, in particular G-quadruplex (G4). Following genome sequencing, several bioinformatic algorithms were developed to map G4s in vitro based on a canonical sequence motif, G-richness and G-skewness or alternatively sequence features including k-mers, and more recently machine/deep learning. Recently, new sequencing techniques were developed to map G4s in vitro (G4-seq) and G4s in vivo (G4 ChIP-seq) at few hundred base resolution. Here, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (DeepG4) to map cell-type specific active G4 regions (<i>e.g</i>. regions within which G4s form both in vitro and in vivo). DeepG4 is very accurate to predict active G4 regions in different cell types. Moreover, DeepG4 identifies key DNA motifs that are predictive of G4 region activity. We found that such motifs do not follow a very flexible sequence pattern as current algorithms seek for. Instead, active G4 regions are determined by numerous specific motifs. Moreover, among those motifs, we identified known transcription factors (TFs) which could play important roles in G4 activity by contributing either directly to G4 structures themselves or indirectly by participating in G4 formation in the vicinity. In addition, we used DeepG4 to predict active G4 regions in a large number of tissues and cancers, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for researchers.

Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are a leading cause of acute respiratory infection hospitalization in children, yet little is known about how dose, strain, tissue tropism, and individual heterogeneity affects the processes driving growth and clearance kinetics. Longitudinal measurements are possible by using reporter Sendai viruses, the murine counterpart of HPIV 1, that express luciferase, where the insertion location yields a wild-type (rSeV-luc(M-F*)) or attenuated (rSeV-luc(P-M)) phenotype. Bioluminescence from individual animals suggests that there is a rapid increase in expression followed by a peak, biphasic clearance, and resolution. However, these kinetics vary between individuals and with dose, strain, and whether the infection was initiated in the upper and/or lower respiratory tract. To quantify the differences, we translated the bioluminescence measurements from the nasopharynx, trachea, and lung into viral loads and used a mathematical model together a nonlinear mixed effects approach to define the mechanisms distinguishing each scenario. The results confirmed a higher rate of virus production with the rSeV-luc(M-F*) virus compared to its attenuated counterpart, and suggested that low doses result in disproportionately fewer infected cells. The analyses indicated faster infectivity and infected cell clearance rates in the lung and that higher viral doses, and concomitantly higher infected cell numbers, resulted in more rapid clearance. This parameter was also highly variable amongst individuals, which was particularly evident during infection in the lung. These critical differences provide important insight into distinct HPIV dynamics, and show how bioluminescence data can be combined with quantitative analyses to dissect host-, virus-, and dose-dependent effects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bistability in fatty-acid oxidation resulting from substrate inhibition</a></h4>

In this study we demonstrated through analytic considerations and numerical studies that the mitochondrial fatty-acid β-oxidation can exhibit bistable-hysteresis behavior. In an experimentally validated computational model we identified a specific region in the parameter space in which two distinct stable and one unstable steady state could be attained with different fluxes. The two stable states were referred to as low-flux (disease) and high-flux (healthy) state. By a modular kinetic approach we traced the origin and causes of the bistability back to the distributive kinetics and the conservation of CoA, in particular in the last rounds of the β-oxidation. We then extended the model to investigate various interventions that may confer health benefits by activating the pathway, including (i) activation of the last enzyme MCKAT via its endogenous regulator p46-SHC protein, (ii) addition of a thioesterase (an acyl-CoA hydrolysing enzyme) as a safety valve, and (iii) concomitant activation of a number of upstream and downstream enzymes by short-chain fatty-acids (SCFA), metabolites that are produced from nutritional fibers in the gut. A high concentration of SCFAs, thioesterase activity, and inhibition of the p46Shc protein led to a disappearance of the bistability, leaving only the high-flux state. A better understanding of the switch behavior of the mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation process between a low- and a high-flux state may lead to dietary and pharmacological intervention in the treatment or prevention of obesity and or non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational identification and experimental characterization of preferred downstream positions in human core promoters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by René Dreos, Anna Sloutskin, Nati Malachi, Diana Ideses, Philipp Bucher, Tamar Juven-Gershon</p>

Metazoan core promoters, which direct the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), may contain short sequence motifs termed core promoter elements/motifs (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>. the TATA box, initiator (Inr) and downstream core promoter element (DPE)), which recruit Pol II via the general transcription machinery. The DPE was discovered and extensively characterized in <i>Drosophila</i>, where it is strictly dependent on both the presence of an Inr and the precise spacing from it. Since the <i>Drosophila</i> DPE is recognized by the human transcription machinery, it is most likely that some human promoters contain a downstream element that is similar, though not necessarily identical, to the <i>Drosophila</i> DPE. However, only a couple of human promoters were shown to contain a functional DPE, and attempts to computationally detect human DPE-containing promoters have mostly been unsuccessful. Using a newly-designed motif discovery strategy based on Expectation-Maximization probabilistic partitioning algorithms, we discovered preferred downstream positions (PDP) in human promoters that resemble the <i>Drosophila</i> DPE. Available chromatin accessibility footprints revealed that <i>Drosophila</i> and human Inr+DPE promoter classes are not only highly structured, but also similar to each other, particularly in the proximal downstream region. Clustering of the corresponding sequence motifs using a neighbor-joining algorithm strongly suggests that canonical Inr+DPE promoters could be common to metazoan species. Using reporter assays we demonstrate the contribution of the identified downstream positions to the function of multiple human promoters. Furthermore, we show that alteration of the spacing between the Inr and PDP by two nucleotides results in reduced promoter activity, suggesting a spacing dependency of the newly discovered human PDP on the Inr. Taken together, our strategy identified novel functional downstream positions within human core promoters, supporting the existence of DPE-like motifs in human promoters.

Navigation of fast migrating cells such as amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i> and immune cells are tightly associated with their morphologies that range from steady polarized forms that support high directionality to those more complex and variable when making frequent turns. Model simulations are essential for quantitative understanding of these features and their origins, however systematic comparisons with real data are underdeveloped. Here, by employing deep-learning-based feature extraction combined with phase-field modeling framework, we show that a low dimensional feature space for 2D migrating cell morphologies obtained from the shape stereotype of keratocytes, <i>Dictyostelium</i> and neutrophils can be fully mapped by an interlinked signaling network of cell-polarization and protrusion dynamics. Our analysis links the data-driven shape analysis to the underlying causalities by identifying key parameters critical for migratory morphologies both normal and aberrant under genetic and pharmacological perturbations. The results underscore the importance of deciphering self-organizing states and their interplay when characterizing morphological phenotypes.

A mathematical model for the COVID-19 pandemic spread, which integrates age-structured Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased dynamics with real mobile phone data accounting for the population mobility, is presented. The dynamical model adjustment is performed via Approximate Bayesian Computation. Optimal lockdown and exit strategies are determined based on nonlinear model predictive control, constrained to public-health and socio-economic factors. Through an extensive computational validation of the methodology, it is shown that it is possible to compute robust exit strategies with realistic reduced mobility values to inform public policy making, and we exemplify the applicability of the methodology using datasets from England and France.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational method for identifying an optimal combination of existing drugs to repair the action potentials of SQT1 ventricular myocytes</a></h4>

Mutations are known to cause perturbations in essential functional features of integral membrane proteins, including ion channels. Even restricted or point mutations can result in substantially changed properties of ion currents. The additive effect of these alterations for a specific ion channel can result in significantly changed properties of the action potential (AP). Both AP shortening and AP prolongation can result from known mutations, and the consequences can be life-threatening. Here, we present a computational method for identifying new drugs utilizing combinations of existing drugs. Based on the knowledge of theoretical effects of existing drugs on individual ion currents, our aim is to compute optimal combinations that can ‘repair’ the mutant AP waveforms so that the baseline AP-properties are restored. More specifically, we compute optimal, combined, drug concentrations such that the waveforms of the transmembrane potential and the cytosolic calcium concentration of the mutant cardiomyocytes (CMs) becomes as similar as possible to their wild type counterparts after the drug has been applied. In order to demonstrate the utility of this method, we address the question of computing an optimal drug for the short QT syndrome type 1 (SQT1). For the SQT1 mutation N588K, there are available data sets that describe the effect of various drugs on the mutated K<sup>+</sup> channel. These published findings are the basis for our computational analysis which can identify optimal compounds in the sense that the AP of the mutant CMs resembles essential biomarkers of the wild type CMs. Using recently developed insights regarding electrophysiological properties among myocytes from different species, we compute optimal drug combinations for hiPSC-CMs, rabbit ventricular CMs and adult human ventricular CMs with the SQT1 mutation. Since the ‘composition’ of ion channels that form the AP is different for the three types of myocytes under consideration, so is the composition of the optimal drug.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evaluation and comparison of multi-omics data integration methods for cancer subtyping</a></h4>

Computational integrative analysis has become a significant approach in the data-driven exploration of biological problems. Many integration methods for cancer subtyping have been proposed, but evaluating these methods has become a complicated problem due to the lack of gold standards. Moreover, questions of practical importance remain to be addressed regarding the impact of selecting appropriate data types and combinations on the performance of integrative studies. Here, we constructed three classes of benchmarking datasets of nine cancers in TCGA by considering all the eleven combinations of four multi-omics data types. Using these datasets, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten representative integration methods for cancer subtyping in terms of accuracy measured by combining both clustering accuracy and clinical significance, robustness, and computational efficiency. We subsequently investigated the influence of different omics data on cancer subtyping and the effectiveness of their combinations. Refuting the widely held intuition that incorporating more types of omics data always produces better results, our analyses showed that there are situations where integrating more omics data negatively impacts the performance of integration methods. Our analyses also suggested several effective combinations for most cancers under our studies, which may be of particular interest to researchers in omics data analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Structures of the mycobacterial membrane protein MmpL3 reveal its mechanism of lipid transport</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chih-Chia Su, Philip A. Klenotic, Meng Cui, Meinan Lyu, Christopher E. Morgan, Edward W. Yu</p>

The mycobacterial membrane protein large 3 (MmpL3) transporter is essential and required for shuttling the lipid trehalose monomycolate (TMM), a precursor of mycolic acid (MA)-containing trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and mycolyl arabinogalactan peptidoglycan (mAGP), in <i>Mycobacterium</i> species, including <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>. However, the mechanism that MmpL3 uses to facilitate the transport of fatty acids and lipidic elements to the mycobacterial cell wall remains elusive. Here, we report 7 structures of the <i>M</i>. <i>smegmatis</i> MmpL3 transporter in its unbound state and in complex with trehalose 6-decanoate (T6D) or TMM using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography. Combined with calculated results from molecular dynamics (MD) and target MD simulations, we reveal a lipid transport mechanism that involves a coupled movement of the periplasmic domain and transmembrane helices of the MmpL3 transporter that facilitates the shuttling of lipids to the mycobacterial cell wall.

Conserving and managing biodiversity in the face of ongoing global change requires sufficient evidence to assess status and trends of species distributions. Here, we propose novel indicators of biodiversity data coverage and sampling effectiveness and analyze national trajectories in closing spatiotemporal knowledge gaps for terrestrial vertebrates (1950 to 2019). Despite a rapid rise in data coverage, particularly in the last 2 decades, strong geographic and taxonomic biases persist. For some taxa and regions, a tremendous growth in records failed to directly translate into newfound knowledge due to a sharp decline in sampling effectiveness. However, we found that a nation’s coverage was stronger for species for which it holds greater stewardship. As countries under the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework renew their commitments to an improved, rigorous biodiversity knowledge base, our findings highlight opportunities for international collaboration to close critical information gaps.

The number of species on Earth is highly uncertain. A recent study has suggested that there are less than 2 million prokaryotic species on Earth; this Formal Comment suggests instead that there are more likely hundreds of millions or billions of species, and that the majority of these are bacteria associated with insects and other animals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Whole genome sequencing of colonies derived from cannabis flowers and the impact of media selection on benchmarking total yeast and mold detection tools [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis products are subjected to microbial testing for human pathogenic fungi and bacteria. These testing requirements often rely on non-specific colony forming unit (CFU/g) specifications without clarity on which medium, selection or growth times are required. We performed whole genome sequencing to assess the specificity of colony forming units (CFU) derived from three different plating media: Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), PDA with chloramphenicol and Dichloran Rose Bengal with chloramphenicol (DRBC). Methods: Colonies were isolated from each medium type and their whole genomes sequenced to identify the diversity of microbes present on each medium selection. Fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS3) and Bacterial 16S RNA(16S) quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) were performed, to correlate these CFUs with fungi- and bacterial- specific qPCR. Results: Each plating medium displayed a ten-fold difference in CFU counts. PDA with chloramphenicol showed the highest diversity and the highest concordance with whole genome sequencing. According to ITS3 and 16S qPCR confirmed with whole genome sequencing, DRBC under counted yeast and mold while PDA without chloramphenicol over counted CFUs due to bacterial growth without selection. Conclusions: Colony Forming Unit regulations lack specificity. Each medium produces significant differences in CFU counts. These are further dependent on subjective interpretation, failure to culture most microbes, and poor selection between bacteria and fungi. Given the most human pathogenic microbes found on cannabis are endophytes which culture fails to detect, molecular methods offer a solution to this long-standing quantification problem in the cannabis testing field.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Future land use change simulations for the Lepelle River Basin using Cellular Automata Markov model with Land Change Modeller-generated transition areas [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Land cover/land cover (LULC) change is one of the major contributors to global environmental and climate variations. The ability to predict future LULC is crucial for environmental engineers, civil engineers, urban designers, and natural resources managers for planning activities. Methods: TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modelling System and ArcGIS Pro 2.8 were used to process LULC data for the region of the Lepelle River Basin (LRB) of South Africa. Driver variables such as population density, slope, elevation as well as the Euclidean distances of cities, roads, highways, railroads, parks and restricted areas, towns to the LRB in combination with LULC data were analysed using the Land Change Modeller (LCM) and Cellular-Automata Markov (CAM) model. Results: The results reveal an array of losses (-) and gains (+) for certain LULC classes in the LRB by the year 2040: natural vegetation (+8.5%), plantations (+3.5%), water bodies (-31.6%), bare ground (-8.8%), cultivated land (-29.3%), built-up areas (+10.6%) and mines (+14.4%). Conclusions: The results point to the conversion of land uses from natural to anthropogenic by 2040. These changes also highlight how the potential losses associated with resources such as water that will negatively impact society and ecosystem functioning in the LRB by exacerbating water scarcity driven by climate change. This modelling study provides a decision support system for the establishment of sustainable land resource utilization policies in the LRB.

     alt="The complex synaptic pathways onto a looming-detector neuron revealed using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy"/>
<p>We traced two trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons, in separate larval locusts from their synapses with the LGMD1 in the lobula complex (LOX) through the second optic chiasm (OCH2) back into the medulla. In the medulla, we found not only downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron but also a feedback loop with TmA neurons making outputs and receiving inputs.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of locusts to detect looming stimuli and avoid collisions or predators depends on a neuronal circuit in the locust's optic lobe. Although comprehensively studied for over three decades, there are still major questions about the computational steps of this circuit. We used fourth instar larvae of <i>Locusta migratoria</i> to describe the connection between the lobula giant movement detector 1 (LGMD1) neuron in the lobula complex and the upstream neuropil, the medulla. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the connecting neurons termed trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons and their synaptic connectivity. This enabled us to trace neurons over several hundred micrometers between the medulla and the lobula complex while identifying their synapses. We traced two different TmA neurons, each from a different individual, from their synapses with the LGMD in the lobula complex up into the medulla and describe their synaptic relationships. There is not a simple downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron onto these TmA neurons; there is also a feedback loop in place with TmA neurons making outputs as well as receiving inputs. More than one type of neuron shapes the signal of the TmA neurons in the medulla. We found both columnar and trans-columnar neurons connected with the traced TmA neurons in the medulla. These findings indicate that there are computational steps in the medulla that have not been included in models of the neuronal pathway for looming detection.</p>

     alt="Morphological and neurochemical characterization of glycinergic neurons in laminae I-IV of the mouse spinal dorsal horn"/>
<p>Glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I-II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. Based on dendritic morphology, we divided them into three and six groups in laminae I-II and III-IV, respectively. At least one type of neurons in laminae III-IV may project its axon into laminae I-II. We also provided experimental evidence indicating that there are glycine-only neurons and axon terminals in laminae I-II. The glycine-only neurons may express RORβ and/or RET, but there might be other neurochemical markers which are still awaiting identification.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A growing body of experimental evidence shows that glycinergic inhibition plays vital roles in spinal pain processing. In spite of this, however, our knowledge about the morphology, neurochemical characteristics and synaptic relations of glycinergic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn is very limited. The lack of this knowledge makes our understanding about the specific contribution of glycinergic neurons to spinal pain processing quite vague. Here we investigated the morphology and neurochemical characteristics of glycinergic neurons in laminae I-IV of the spinal dorsal horn using a GlyT2::CreERT2-tdTomato transgenic mouse line. Confirming previous reports, we show that glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I-II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. First in the literature, we provide experimental evidence indicating that in addition to neurons in which glycine co-localizes with GABA, there are glycinergic neurons in laminae I-II that do not express GABA and can thus be referred to as glycine-only neurons. According to the shape and size of cell bodies and dendritic morphology, we divided the tdTomato labelled glycinergic neurons into three and six morphological groups in laminae I-II and laminae III-IV, respectively. We also demonstrate that most of the glycinergic neurons co-express neuronal nitric oxide synthase, parvalbumin, the receptor tyrosine kinase RET and the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor β (RORβ) but there might be others that need further neurochemical characterization. The present findings may foster our understanding about the contribution of glycinergic inhibition to spinal pain processing.</p>

                Rhoades et al. show that patients acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a distinct nasal microbiome marked by an increase in bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and accompanied by a robust inflammatory host transcriptional response. This provides a potential explanation for the high rate of bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LMO2 is essential to maintain the ability of progenitors to differentiate into T-cell lineage in mice</a></h4>

              
                Notch signaling primarily determines T-cell fate. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of T-lineage potential in pre-thymic progenitors remain unclear. Here, we established two murine <i>Ebf1</i>-deficient pro-B cell lines, with and without T-lineage potential. The latter expressed lower levels of <i>Lmo2</i>; their potential was restored via ectopic expression of <i>Lmo2</i>. Conversely, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>Lmo2</i> resulted in the loss of the T-lineage potential. Introduction of <i>Bcl2</i> rescued massive cell death of Notch-stimulated pro-B cells without efficient LMO2-driven <i>Bcl11a</i> expression but was not sufficient to retain their T-lineage potential. Pro-B cells without T-lineage potential failed to activate <i>Tcf7</i> due to DNA methylation; <i>Tcf7</i> transduction restored this capacity. Moreover, direct binding of LMO2 to the <i>Bcl11a</i> and <i>Tcf7</i> loci was observed. Altogether, our results highlight LMO2 as a crucial player in the survival and maintenance of T-lineage potential in T-cell progenitors via the regulation of the expression of <i>Bcl11a</i> and <i>Tcf7</i>.
