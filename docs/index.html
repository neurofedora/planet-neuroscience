              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine-dependent cAMP dynamics in basal amygdala glutamatergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic inputs to basal amygdala (BA) instruct learning of motivational salience. Here, we investigated the dynamics of dopamine release and downstream signaling during multiple salient events occurring within tens of seconds. We established in vitro and in vivo real-time tracking and manipulation of cAMP - a key intracellular plasticity signal downstream of dopamine receptor activation. Optogenetically-evoked release of dopamine drove proportional increases in cAMP in almost all BA glutamatergic neurons, suggesting widespread actions of dopamine across neurons preferring positive or negative valence. These cAMP responses decayed more slowly than dopamine release, potentially extending the window of plasticity. cAMP levels accumulated following direct photostimulation of cAMP but not repeated stimulation of dopamine axons, due to potent depression of dopamine release. cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) responses to repeated appetitive or aversive stimuli also exhibited pronounced depression. Thus, history-dependent dynamics of dopamine and cAMP may regulate learning of temporally clustered, salient stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A critical role of brain network architecture in a continuum model of autism spectrum disorders spanning from healthy individuals with genetic liability to individuals with ASD</a></h4>

              
                Studies have shown cortical alterations in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as well as in individuals with high polygenic risk for ASD. An important addition to the study of altered cortical anatomy is the investigation of the underlying brain network architecture that may reveal brain-wide mechanisms in ASD and in polygenic risk for ASD. Such an approach has been proven useful in other psychiatric disorders by revealing that brain network architecture shapes (to an extent) the disorder-related cortical alterations. This study uses data from a clinical dataset: 560 male subjects (266 individuals with ASD and 294 healthy individuals, CTL, mean age at 17.2 years) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database, and data of 391 healthy individuals (207 males, mean age at 12.1 years) from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics database. ASD-related cortical alterations (group difference, ASD-CTL, in cortical thickness) and cortical correlates of polygenic risk for ASD were assessed, and then statistically compared with structural connectome-based network measures (such as hubs) using spin permutation tests. Next, we investigated whether polygenic risk for ASD could be predicted by network architecture by building machine-learning based prediction models, and whether the top predictors of the model were identified as disease epicenters of ASD. We observed that ASD-related cortical alterations as well as cortical correlates of polygenic risk for ASD implicated cortical hubs more strongly than non-hub regions. We also observed that age progression of ASD-related cortical alterations and cortical correlates of polygenic risk for ASD implicated cortical hubs more strongly than non-hub regions. Further investigation revealed that structural connectomes predicted polygenic risk for ASD (r=0.30, p<0.0001), and two brain regions (the left inferior parietal and left suparmarginal) with top predictive connections were identified as disease epicenters of ASD. Our study highlights a critical role of network architecture in a continuum model of ASD spanning from healthy individuals with genetic risk to individuals with ASD. Our study also highlights the strength of investigating polygenic risk scores in addition to multi-modal neuroimaging measures to better understand the interplay between genetic risk and brain alterations associated with ASD.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Direct synaptic excitation between hilar mossy cells revealed with a targeted voltage sensor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dentate gyrus not only gates the flow of information into the hippocampus, it also integrates and processes this information. Mossy cells (MCs) are a major type of excitatory neuron strategically located in the hilus of the dentate gyrus where they can contribute to this processing through networks of synapses with inhibitory neurons and dentate granule cells. Some prior work has suggested that MCs can form excitatory synapses with other MCs, but the role of these synapses in the network activity of the dentate gyrus has received little attention. Here, we investigated synaptic inputs to MCs in mouse hippocampal slices using a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) targeted to MCs by Cre-lox technology. This enabled optical recording of voltage changes from multiple MCs simultaneously. Stimulating granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells activated well-established inputs to MCs and elicited synaptic responses as expected. However, the weak blockade of MC responses to granule cell layer stimulation by DCG-IV raised the possibility of another source of excitation. To evaluate synapses between MCs as this source, single MCs were stimulated focally. Stimulation of one MC above its action potential threshold evoked depolarizing responses in neighboring MCs that depended on glutamate receptors. Short latency responses of MCs to other MCs did not depend on release from granule cell axons. However, granule cells did contribute to the longer latency responses of MCs to stimulation of other MCs. Thus, MCs transmit their activity to other MCs both through direct synaptic coupling and through polysynaptic coupling with dentate granule cells. MC–MC synapses can redistribute information entering the dentate gyrus and thus shape and modulate the electrical activity underlying hippocampal functions such as navigation and memory, as well as excessive excitation during seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The color phi phenomenon: Not so special, after all?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lars Keuninckx, Axel Cleeremans</p>

We show how anomalous time reversal of stimuli and their associated responses can exist in very small connectionist models. These networks are built from dynamical toy model neurons which adhere to a minimal set of biologically plausible properties. The appearance of a “ghost” response, temporally and spatially located in between responses caused by actual stimuli, as in the phi phenomenon, is demonstrated in a similar small network, where it is caused by priming and long-distance feedforward paths. We then demonstrate that the color phi phenomenon can be present in an echo state network, a recurrent neural network, without explicitly training for the presence of the effect, such that it emerges as an artifact of the dynamical processing. Our results suggest that the color phi phenomenon might simply be a feature of the inherent dynamical and nonlinear sensory processing in the brain and in and of itself is not related to consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A hydro-osmotic coarsening theory of biological cavity formation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mathieu Le Verge-Serandour, Hervé Turlier</p>

Fluid-filled biological cavities are ubiquitous, but their collective dynamics has remained largely unexplored from a physical perspective. Based on experimental observations in early embryos, we propose a model where a cavity forms through the coarsening of myriad of pressurized micrometric lumens, that interact by ion and fluid exchanges through the intercellular space. Performing extensive numerical simulations, we find that hydraulic fluxes lead to a self-similar coarsening of lumens in time, characterized by a robust dynamic scaling exponent. The collective dynamics is primarily controlled by hydraulic fluxes, which stem from lumen pressures differences and are dampened by water permeation through the membrane. Passive osmotic heterogeneities play, on the contrary, a minor role on cavity formation but active ion pumping can largely modify the coarsening dynamics: it prevents the lumen network from a collective collapse and gives rise to a novel coalescence-dominated regime exhibiting a distinct scaling law. Interestingly, we prove numerically that spatially biasing ion pumping may be sufficient to position the cavity, suggesting a novel mode of symmetry breaking to control tissue patterning. Providing generic testable predictions, our model forms a comprehensive theoretical basis for hydro-osmotic interaction between biological cavities, that shall find wide applications in embryo and tissue morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inter-trial effects in priming of pop-out: Comparison of computational updating models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fredrik Allenmark, Ahu Gokce, Thomas Geyer, Artyom Zinchenko, Hermann J. Müller, Zhuanghua Shi</p>

In visual search tasks, repeating features or the position of the target results in faster response times. Such inter-trial ‘priming’ effects occur not just for repetitions from the immediately preceding trial but also from trials further back. A paradigm known to produce particularly long-lasting inter-trial effects–of the target-defining feature, target position, and response (feature)–is the ‘priming of pop-out’ (PoP) paradigm, which typically uses sparse search displays and random swapping across trials of target- and distractor-defining features. However, the mechanisms underlying these inter-trial effects are still not well understood. To address this, we applied a modeling framework combining an evidence accumulation (EA) model with different computational updating rules of the model parameters (i.e., the drift rate and starting point of EA) for different aspects of stimulus history, to data from a (previously published) PoP study that had revealed significant inter-trial effects from several trials back for repetitions of the target color, the target position, and (response-critical) target feature. By performing a systematic model comparison, we aimed to determine which EA model parameter and which updating rule for that parameter best accounts for each inter-trial effect and the associated <i>n</i>-back temporal profile. We found that, in general, our modeling framework could accurately predict the <i>n</i>-back temporal profiles. Further, target color- and position-based inter-trial effects were best understood as arising from redistribution of a limited-capacity weight resource which determines the EA rate. In contrast, response-based inter-trial effects were best explained by a bias of the starting point towards the response associated with a previous target; this bias appeared largely tied to the position of the target. These findings elucidate how our cognitive system continually tracks, and updates an internal predictive model of, a number of separable stimulus and response parameters in order to optimize task performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Insights into the dynamic trajectories of protein filament division revealed by numerical investigation into the mathematical model of pure fragmentation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Magali Tournus, Miguel Escobedo, Wei-Feng Xue, Marie Doumic</p>

The dynamics by which polymeric protein filaments divide in the presence of negligible growth, for example due to the depletion of free monomeric precursors, can be described by the universal mathematical equations of ‘pure fragmentation’. The rates of fragmentation reactions reflect the stability of the protein filaments towards breakage, which is of importance in biology and biomedicine for instance in governing the creation of amyloid seeds and the propagation of prions. Here, we devised from mathematical theory inversion formulae to recover the division rates and division kernel information from time dependent experimental measurements of filament size distribution. The numerical approach to systematically analyze the behaviour of pure fragmentation trajectories was also developed. We illustrate how these formulae can be used, provide some insights on their robustness, and show how they inform the design of experiments to measure fibril fragmentation dynamics. These advances are made possible by our central theoretical result on how the length distribution profile of the solution to the pure fragmentation equation aligns with a steady distribution profile for large times.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Learning brain dynamics for decoding and predicting individual differences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joyneel Misra, Srinivas Govinda Surampudi, Manasij Venkatesh, Chirag Limbachia, Joseph Jaja, Luiz Pessoa</p>

Insights from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), as well as recordings of large numbers of neurons, reveal that many cognitive, emotional, and motor functions depend on the multivariate interactions of brain signals. To <i>decode</i> brain dynamics, we propose an architecture based on recurrent neural networks to uncover distributed spatiotemporal signatures. We demonstrate the potential of the approach using human fMRI data during movie-watching data and a continuous experimental paradigm. The model was able to learn spatiotemporal patterns that supported 15-way movie-clip classification (∼90%) at the level of brain regions, and binary classification of experimental conditions (∼60%) at the level of voxels. The model was also able to learn individual differences in measures of fluid intelligence and verbal IQ at levels comparable to that of existing techniques. We propose a dimensionality reduction approach that uncovers low-dimensional trajectories and captures essential informational (i.e., classification related) properties of brain dynamics. Finally, <i>saliency</i> maps and lesion analysis were employed to characterize brain-region/voxel importance, and uncovered how dynamic but consistent changes in fMRI activation influenced decoding performance. When applied at the level of voxels, our framework implements a dynamic version of multivariate pattern analysis. Our approach provides a framework for visualizing, analyzing, and discovering dynamic spatially distributed brain representations during naturalistic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The N-terminal domain of RfaH plays an active role in protein fold-switching</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pablo Galaz-Davison, Ernesto A. Román, César A. Ramírez-Sarmiento</p>

The bacterial elongation factor RfaH promotes the expression of virulence factors by specifically binding to RNA polymerases (RNAP) paused at a DNA signal. This behavior is unlike that of its paralog NusG, the major representative of the protein family to which RfaH belongs. Both proteins have an N-terminal domain (NTD) bearing an RNAP binding site, yet NusG C-terminal domain (CTD) is folded as a β-barrel while RfaH CTD is forming an α-hairpin blocking such site. Upon recognition of the specific DNA exposed by RNAP, RfaH is activated via interdomain dissociation and complete CTD structural rearrangement into a β-barrel structurally identical to NusG CTD. Although RfaH transformation has been extensively characterized computationally, little attention has been given to the role of the NTD in the fold-switching process, as its structure remains unchanged. Here, we used Associative Water-mediated Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM) molecular dynamics to characterize the transformation of RfaH, spotlighting the sequence-dependent effects of NTD on CTD fold stabilization. Umbrella sampling simulations guided by native contacts recapitulate the thermodynamic equilibrium experimentally observed for RfaH and its isolated CTD. Temperature refolding simulations of full-length RfaH show a high success towards α-folded CTD, whereas the NTD interferes with βCTD folding, becoming trapped in a β-barrel intermediate. Meanwhile, NusG CTD refolding is unaffected by the presence of RfaH NTD, showing that these NTD-CTD interactions are encoded in RfaH sequence. Altogether, these results suggest that the NTD of RfaH favors the α-folded RfaH by specifically orienting the αCTD upon interdomain binding and by favoring β-barrel rupture into an intermediate from which fold-switching proceeds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">On the inference of complex phylogenetic networks by Markov Chain Monte-Carlo</a></h4>

For various species, high quality sequences and complete genomes are nowadays available for many individuals. This makes data analysis challenging, as methods need not only to be accurate, but also time efficient given the tremendous amount of data to process. In this article, we introduce an efficient method to infer the evolutionary history of individuals under the multispecies coalescent model in networks (MSNC). Phylogenetic networks are an extension of phylogenetic trees that can contain <i>reticulate</i> nodes, which allow to model complex biological events such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization and introgression. We present a novel way to compute the likelihood of <i>biallelic</i> markers sampled along genomes whose evolution involved such events. This likelihood computation is at the heart of a Bayesian network inference method called SnappNet, as it extends the Snapp method inferring evolutionary trees under the multispecies coalescent model, to networks. SnappNet is available as a package of the well-known beast 2 software.
Recently, the MCMC_BiMarkers method, implemented in PhyloNet, also extended Snapp to networks. Both methods take biallelic markers as input, rely on the same model of evolution and sample networks in a Bayesian framework, though using different methods for computing priors. However, SnappNet relies on algorithms that are exponentially more time-efficient on non-trivial networks. Using simulations, we compare performances of SnappNet and MCMC_BiMarkers. We show that both methods enjoy similar abilities to recover simple networks, but SnappNet is more accurate than MCMC_BiMarkers on more complex network scenarios. Also, on complex networks, SnappNet is found to be extremely faster than MCMC_BiMarkers in terms of time required for the likelihood computation. We finally illustrate SnappNet performances on a rice data set. SnappNet infers a scenario that is consistent with previous results and provides additional understanding of rice evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Transformational entrepreneurship and its effect on readiness for change, psychological capital, and employee performance: evidence from an Indonesian bank [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Continuing failures of financial capitalism across borders have led corporation to develop a more balanced economic growth model of transformational entrepreneurship that emphasises both short-term economic and longer-term social impacts. The model encourages entrepreneurial activities that bring major changes in the related markets and industries, as well as changes in society and culture. At the corporate level, transformational entrepreneurship prepares employees for any potential changes induced by a dynamic environment; it also improves the psychological capital of individual employees, and effective transformational entrepreneurship can eventually accelerate performance. The purpose of this study is to investigate (1) the direct and indirect effects of transformational entrepreneurship on readiness for change, psychological capital and employee performance, and (2) how the effects to readiness for change and psychological capital influence employee performance. The study data were collected using questionnaires completed by employees in 257 branches of a state-owned bank with locations throughout Indonesia. The data were analysed using the structural equation model. The results show that transformational entrepreneurship significantly and positively influences readiness for change, psychological capital, and employee performance and that readiness for change and psychological capital significantly and positively influences employee performance. Additionally, the effect of transformational entrepreneurship on employee performance is more significant if it is related to psychological capital than to readiness for change or to aspects of employee performance unrelated to transformational entrepreneurship. These findings enrich our understanding of transformational entrepreneurship and its value related to the direct and indirect effects on variables such as readiness for change, psychological capital and employee performance.

                Introduction Communicating science is one of the main steps in the research process. However, the method of communication must be aligned with the audience for the message. This is especially evident in institutions that promote teaching, research, and extension, especially when considering joint actions that promote a dialogue between themselves and the community. Methods In light of this need, this study was conducted with the aim of analyzing the main documents guiding the policies and institutional actions related to research at the two federal institutes based in the state of Goiás/Brazil: Institution A and Institution B and proposing ways to include scientific dissemination as a mediator of the research consolidation process. This is a bibliographic, documentary study with a descriptive, qualitative approach based on a case study. Results and Discussion The analyses indicate that research must be consolidated as institutional policy and that a policy to encourage research must be implemented. This has yet to be achieved at these institutions, although scientific dissemination is explicitly addressed by institutional documents guiding the development and dissemination of pedagogical practices, especially in teaching and extension. Scientific journalism and scientific dissemination are mediators and facilitators of this endeavor.

                Non-pharmaceutical interventions for veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder are becoming a more popular way to address some of the social and personal needs identified by this group. Horticultural therapy or growing and eating food together provides several ways to increase mood, improve nutritional status, reduce loneliness and reduce the physical health impacts of mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder. In this paper we will discuss some of the issues people living with post-traumatic stress disorder might face. We will also provide an overview of the therapeutic effects of these approaches and how they will be applied in a locally identified group.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests in motor dysfunction, non-motor symptoms, and eventual dementia (PDD). Neuropathological hallmarks include nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, Lewy body (LB) pathology, and neuroinflammation. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a primary component of LBs, is implicated in PD pathogenesis, accumulating and aggregating in both familial and sporadic PD. However, as α-syn pathology is often comorbid with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles in PDD, it is still unclear whether α-syn is the primary cause of neurodegeneration in sporadic PDD. We aimed to determine how the absence of α-syn would affect PDD manifestation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IFN-β knockout (<i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>) mice spontaneously develop progressive behavior abnormalities and neuropathology resembling PDD, notably with α-syn<sup>+</sup> LBs. We generated <i>Ifnb/Snca</i> double knockout (DKO) mice and evaluated their behavior and neuropathology compared with wild-type (Wt), <i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>
<i>,</i> and <i>Snca</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> mice using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, immunoblots, qPCR, and modification of neuronal signaling.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>Ifnb/Snca</i> DKO mice developed all clinical PDD-like behavioral manifestations induced by IFN-β loss. Independently of α-syn expression, lack of IFN-β alone induced Aβ plaques, pTau tangles, and LB-like Aβ<sup>+</sup>/pTau<sup>+</sup> inclusion bodies and neuroinflammation. IFN-β loss caused significant elevated glial and neuronal TNF-α and neuronal TNFR1, associated with neurodegeneration. Restoring neuronal IFN-β signaling or blocking TNFR1 rescued caspase 3/t-BID-mediated neuronal-death through upregulation of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub> and lowered intraneuronal Aβ and pTau accumulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings increase our understanding of PD pathology and suggest that targeting α-syn alone is not sufficient to mitigate disease. Targeting specific aspects of neuroinflammation, such as aberrant neuronal TNF-α/TNFR1 or IFN-β/IFNAR signaling, may attenuate disease.</p>

                <p>Patients with epilepsy report that sleep deprivation is a common trigger for breakthrough seizures. The basic mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. In the Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model of epilepsy, daily sleep deprivation indeed exacerbated seizures though these effects were lost after the 3<sup>rd</sup> day. Sleep deprivation also accelerated mortality in ~52% of Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, not observed in controls. Voltage-clamp experiments on the day after recovery from sleep deprivation showed reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells in epileptic Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our results suggest that sleep deprivation is detrimental to seizures and survival, possibly due to reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Proteostatic regulation in neuronal compartments</a></h4>

              
                Neurons continuously adapt to external cues and challenges, including stimulation, plasticity-inducing signals and aging. These adaptations are critical for neuronal physiology and extended survival. Proteostasis is the process by which cells adjust their protein content to achieve the specific protein repertoire necessary for cellular function. Due to their complex morphology and polarized nature, neurons possess unique proteostatic requirements. Proteostatic control in axons and dendrites must be implemented through regulation of protein synthesis and degradation in a decentralized fashion, but at the same time, it requires integration, at least in part, in the soma.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inequalities in the distribution of National Institutes of Health research project grant funding</a></h4>

              
                Previous reports have described worsening inequalities of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. We analyzed Research Project Grant data through the end of Fiscal Year 2020, confirming worsening inequalities beginning at the time of the NIH budget doubling (1998-2003), while finding that trends in recent years have reversed for both investigators and institutions, but only to a modest degree. We also find that career-stage trends have stabilized, with equivalent proportions of early-, mid-, and late-career investigators funded from 2017 to 2020. The fraction of women among funded PIs continues to increase, but they are still not at parity. Analyses of funding inequalities show that inequalities for investigators, and to a lesser degree for institutions, have consistently been greater within groups (i.e., within groups by career stage, gender, race, and degree) than between groups.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional independence of endogenous µ- and δ-opioid receptors co-expressed in cholinergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) normally function as monomers, although evidence from heterologous expression systems suggests they may sometimes form homodimers and/or heterodimers. This study aims to evaluate possible functional interplay of endogenous µ- and d-Opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) in mouse neurons. Detecting GPCR dimers in native tissues however has been challenging. Previously, MORs and DORs co-expressed in transfected cells have been reported to form heterodimers, and their possible co-localization in neurons has been studied in knock-in mice expressing genetically engineered receptors fused to fluorescent proteins. Here we find that single cholinergic neurons in the mouse striatum endogenously express both MORs and DORs. The receptors on neurons from live brain slices were fluorescently labeled in live brain slices with a ligand-directed labeling reagent, NAI-A594. The selective activation of MORs and DORs, with DAMGO (µ-agonist) and deltorphin (d-agonist) inhibited spontaneous firing in all cells examined. In the continued presence of agonist, the firing rate returned to baseline as the result of receptor desensitization with the application of deltorphin but was less observed with the application of DAMGO. In addition, agonist-induced internalization of DORs but not MORs was detected. When MORs and DORs were activated simultaneously with [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin, desensitization of MORs was facilitated but internalization was not increased. Together, these results indicate that while MORs and DORs are expressed in single striatal cholinergic interneurons, the two receptors function independently.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dual expression of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 promotes transformation of adult cochlear supporting cells into outer hair cells</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) are essential for hearing. Severe hearing impairment follows OHC degeneration. Previous attempts at regenerating new OHCs from cochlear supporting cells (SCs) have been unsuccessful, notably lacking expression of the key OHC motor protein, Prestin. Thus, regeneration of Prestin+ OHCs represents a barrier to restore auditory function <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we reported the successful <i>in vivo</i> conversion of adult mouse cochlear SCs into Prestin+ OHC-like cells through the concurrent induction of two key transcriptional factors known to be necessary for OHC development: <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Ikzf2</i>. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed the upregulation of 729 OHC genes and downregulation of 331 SC genes in OHC-like cells. The resulting differentiation status of these OHC-like cells was much more advanced than previously achieved. This study thus established an efficient approach to induce the regeneration of Prestin+ OHCs, paving the way for <i>in vivo </i>cochlear repair via SC transdifferentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LIN37-DREAM prevents DNA end resection and homologous recombination at DNA double-strand breaks in quiescent cells</a></h4>

              
                DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) is thought to be restricted to the S- and G<sub>2</sub>- phases of the cell cycle in part due to 53BP1 antagonizing DNA end resection in G<sub>1</sub>-phase and non-cycling quiescent (G<sub>0</sub>) cells. Here, we show that LIN37, a component of the DREAM transcriptional repressor, functions in a 53BP1-independent manner to prevent DNA end resection and HR in G<sub>0</sub> cells. Loss of LIN37 leads to the expression of HR proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51, and promotes DNA end resection in G<sub>0</sub> cells even in the presence of 53BP1. In contrast to 53BP1-deficiency, DNA end resection in LIN37-deficient G<sub>0</sub> cells depends on BRCA1 and leads to RAD51 filament formation and HR. LIN37 is not required to protect DNA ends in cycling cells at G<sub>1</sub>-phase. Thus, LIN37 regulates a novel 53BP1-independent cell phase-specific DNA end protection pathway that functions uniquely in quiescent cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Environmental fluctuations reshape an unexpected diversity-disturbance relationship in a microbial community</a></h4>

              
                Environmental disturbances have long been theorized to play a significant role in shaping the diversity and composition of ecosystems. However, an inability to specify the characteristics of a disturbance experimentally has produced an inconsistent picture of diversity-disturbance relationships (DDRs). Here, using a high-throughput programmable culture system, we subjected a soil-derived bacterial community to dilution disturbance profiles with different intensities (mean dilution rates), applied either constantly or with fluctuations of different frequencies. We observed an unexpected U-shaped relationship between community diversity and disturbance intensity in the absence of fluctuations. Adding fluctuations increased community diversity and erased the U-shape. All our results are well-captured by a Monod consumer resource model, which also explains how U-shaped DDRs emerge via a novel 'niche flip' mechanism. Broadly, our combined experimental and modeling framework demonstrates how distinct features of an environmental disturbance can interact in complex ways to govern ecosystem assembly and offers strategies for reshaping the composition of microbiomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal regulated ire-1-dependent mRNA decay controls germline differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the molecular events that regulate cell pluripotency versus acquisition of differentiated somatic cell fate is fundamentally important. Studies in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> demonstrate that knockout of the germline-specific translation repressor <i>gld-1</i> causes germ cells within tumorous gonads to form germline-derived teratoma. Previously we demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress enhances this phenotype to suppress germline tumor progression(Levi-Ferber et al., 2015). Here, we identify a neuronal circuit that non-autonomously suppresses germline differentiation and show that it communicates with the gonad via the neurotransmitter serotonin to limit somatic differentiation of the tumorous germline. ER stress controls this circuit through regulated inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1)-dependent mRNA decay of transcripts encoding the neuropeptide FLP-6. Depletion of FLP-6 disrupts the circuit’s integrity and hence its ability to prevent somatic-fate acquisition by germline tumor cells. Our findings reveal mechanistically how ER stress enhances ectopic germline differentiation and demonstrate that regulated Ire1-dependent decay can affect animal physiology by controlling a specific neuronal circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Concerted conformational dynamics and water movements in the ghrelin G protein-coupled receptor</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing support for water molecules playing a role in signal propagation through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, exploration of the hydration features of GPCRs is still in its infancy. Here, we combined site-specific labeling with unnatural amino acids to molecular dynamics to delineate how local hydration of the ghrelin receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is rearranged upon activation. We found that GHSR is characterized by a specific hydration pattern that is selectively remodeled by pharmacologically distinct ligands and by the lipid environment. This process is directly related to the concerted movements of the transmembrane domains of the receptor. These results demonstrate that the conformational dynamics of GHSR are tightly coupled to the movements of internal water molecules, further enhancing our understanding of the molecular bases of GPCR-mediated signaling.

                In developing vertebrate neurons, a neurite is formed by more than a hundred microtubules. While individual microtubules are dynamic, the microtubule array itself has been regarded as stationary. Using live cell imaging in combination with photoconversion techniques and pharmacological manipulations, we uncovered that the microtubule array flows retrogradely within neurites to the soma. This microtubule retrograde flow drives cycles of microtubule density, a hallmark of the fluctuating state before axon formation. Shortly after axon formation, microtubule retrograde flow slows down in the axon, which stabilizes microtubule density cycles and thereby functions as a molecular wedge to enable axon extension. We propose microtubule retrograde flow and its specific slowdown in the axon to be the long-sought mechanism to single one neurite out to drive neuronal polarization.

                The main aim of this study was to determine sex differences in central and peripheral fatigue produced by a sustained isometric exercise of ankle plantar flexors in healthy young adults. Ten males and fourteen females performed a sustained isometric ankle exercise until task failure. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque (plantarflexion), voluntary activation level (using the twitch interpolation technique), and twitch contractile properties (twitch peak torque, twitch half relaxation time, and low frequency fatigue index) were measured before, immediately after, and throughout a recovery period (1, 2, 5, and 10 min) following the exercise protocol in order to characterize neuromuscular fatigue. Fatigue had a significant effect (p {pound} 0.05) on all dependent variables. Other than for the maximal voluntary contraction torque, where males showed a greater fatigue-related decrease than females, males and females showed generally similar changes with fatigue. Altogether, our findings indicate no major differences in central or peripheral fatigue mechanisms between males and females to explain a somewhat greater fatigability in males.

                Due to the widespread access to, and implementation of, combination antiretroviral therapy, individuals perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are living into adolescence and adulthood. Perinatally infected adolescents living with HIV-1 (pALHIV) are plagued by progressive, chronic neurocognitive impairments; the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these deficits, however, remains understudied. A longitudinal experimental design from postnatal day (PD) 30 to PD 180 was utilized to establish the development of pyramidal neurons, and associated dendritic spines, from layers II-III of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Three putative neuroinflammatory markers (i.e., IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF-) were evaluated early in development (i.e., PD 30) as a potential mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunction in the mPFC. Constitutive expression of HIV-1 viral proteins induced prominent neurodevelopmental alterations, independent of biological sex, in pyramidal neurons from layers II-III of the mPFC. Specifically, HIV-1 transgenic rats exhibited prominent deficits in dendritic and synaptic pruning, a developmental decrease in synaptic connectivity, and an age-related decline in synaptic efficacy. Examination of dendritic spine morphology revealed an age-related population shift towards a more immature dendritic spine phenotype in HIV-1 transgenic animals. There was no compelling evidence for neuroinflammation in the mPFC during early development. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying chronic neurocognitive impairments in pALHIV may afford a key target for innovative therapeutics and cure strategies; an urgent need given the growing population of pALHIV.

                Understanding of the relationship between cellular function and molecular composition holds a key to next-generational therapeutics but requires measurement of all types of molecules in cells. Developments in sequencing enabled semi-routine measurement of single-cell genomes and transcriptomes, but analytical tools are scarce for detecting diverse proteins in tissue-embedded cells. To bridge this gap for neuroscience research, we report the integration of patch-clamp electrophysiology with subcellular shot-gun proteomics by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Recording of electrical activity permitted identification of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Ca. 20-50% of the neuronal soma content, containing an estimated 100 pg of total protein, was aspirated into the patch pipette filled with ammonium bicarbonate. About ~1 pg of somal protein, or ~0.25% of the total cellular proteome, was analyzed on a custom-built capillary electrophoresis (CE) high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS). A series of experiments were conducted to systematically enhance detection sensitivity through refinements in sample processing and detection, allowing us to quantify ~275 different proteins from somal aspirate-equivalent protein digests. From single neurons, patch-clamp proteomics of the soma quantified 91, 80, and 95 different proteins from 3 different dopaminergic neurons, or 157 proteins in total. Quantification revealed detectable proteomic differences between the somal protein samples. Analysis of canonical knowledge predicted rich interaction networks between the proteins. The integration of patch-clamp electrophysiology with subcellular CE-HRMS proteomics expands the analytical toolbox of neuroscience.

                Individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exhibit an increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric comorbities (e.g., apathy) relative to their seronegative counterparts. Given the profound functional consequences associated with apathy, conceptualizing the multidimensional neuropsychiatric syndrome, and associated neural mechanisms, following chronic HIV-1 viral protein exposure remains a critical need. HIV-1 associated apathy was examined by quantifying goal-directed behaviors, indexed using voluntary wheel running, during the diurnal and nocturnal cycle. Apathetic behaviors in the HIV-1 Tg rat were characterized by a profound decrease in the number of running bouts during both the diurnal and nocturnal cycle, supporting a prominent deficit in the self-initiation of spontaneous behaviors. Additionally, HIV-1 Tg animals exhibited a decreased reinforcing efficacy of voluntary wheel running during the nocturnal cycle. Following the completion of voluntary wheel running, synaptic dysfunction in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was examined as a potential neural mechanism underlying HIV-1 associated apathy. HIV-1 Tg animals displayed prominent synaptic dysfunction in MSNs of the NAc, characterized by decreased synaptic connectivity and a population shift towards an immature dendritic spine phenotype relative to control animals. Synaptic dysfunction accounted for 42.0% to 68.5% of the variance in the number of running bouts affording a key neural mechanism underlying the self-initiation of spontaneous behaviors. The establishment of a fundamental neural mechanism underlying apathy affords a key target for the development of novel therapeutics and cure strategies for affective alterations associated with HIV-1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human spindle variability</a></h4>

              
                In humans, sleep spindles are 10-16 Hz oscillations lasting approximately 0.5-2 s. Spindles, along with cortical slow oscillations, facilitate memory consolidation by enabling synaptic plasticity. Early recordings of spindles at the scalp found anterior channels had overall slower frequency than central-posterior channels. This robust, topographical finding led to dichotomizing spindles as slow versus fast, modeled as two distinct spindle generators in frontal versus posterior cortex. Using a large dataset of intracranial sEEG recordings (n=20, 365 bipolar recordings), we show that the difference in spindle frequency between frontal and parietal channels is comparable to the variability in spindle frequency within the course of individual spindles, across different spindles recorded by a given site, and across sites within a given region. Thus, fast and slow spindles only capture average differences that obscure a much larger underlying overlap in frequency. Furthermore, differences in mean frequency are only one of several ways that spindles differ. For example, compared to parietal, frontal spindles are smaller, tend to occur after parietal when both are engaged, and show a larger decrease in frequency within-spindles. However, frontal and parietal spindles are similar in being longer, less variable, and more widespread than occipital, temporal, and Rolandic spindles. These characteristics are accentuated in spindles which are highly phase-locked to posterior hippocampal spindles. We propose that rather than a strict parietal-fast/frontal-slow dichotomy, spindles differ continuously and quasi-independently in multiple dimensions, with variability due about equally to within-spindle, within-region and between-region factors.

                Uncovering cognitive representations is an elusive goal that is increasingly pursued using the reverse correlation method. Employing reverse correlation often entails collecting thousands of stimulus-response pairs from human subjects, a burdensome task that limits the feasibility of many such studies. This methodological barrier can potentially be overcome using recent advances in signal processing designed to improve sampling efficiency, specifically compressive sensing. Here, compressive sensing is shown to be directly compatible with reverse correlation, and a trio of simulations are performed to demonstrate that compressive sensing can improve the accuracy of reconstructed representations while dramatically reducing the required number of samples. This work concludes by outlining the potential of compressive sensing to improve representation reconstruction throughout the field of neuroscience and beyond.

                Neural activity has been implicated in the motility and outgrowth of glial cell processes throughout the central nervous system. Here we explore this phenomenon in Muller glia, which are specialized radial astroglia that are the predominant glial type of the vertebrate retina. Muller glia extend fine filopodia-like processes into retinal synaptic layers, in similar fashion to brain astrocytes and radial glia which exhibit perisynaptic processes. Using two-photon volumetric imaging, we found that during the second postnatal week, Muller glial processes were highly dynamic, with rapid extensions and retractions that were mediated by cytoskeletal rearrangements. During this same stage of development, retinal waves led to increases in cytosolic calcium within Muller glial lateral processes and stalks. These comprised distinct calcium compartments, distinguished by variable participation in waves, timing, and sensitivity to an M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. However, we found that motility of lateral processes was unaffected by the presence of pharmacological agents that enhanced or blocked wave-associated calcium transients. Finally, we found that mice lacking normal cholinergic waves in the first postnatal week also exhibited normal Muller glial process morphology. Hence, outgrowth of Muller glial lateral processes into synaptic layers is determined by factors that are independent of neuronal activity.

                The ability to encode and update information about individuals is critical for lasting social relationships. Although the hippocampus is important for social recognition memory, its underlying neural representations remain elusive. Here we investigate the neural codes mediating social recognition and learning by examining social odor recognition and associative odor-reward learning in mice. We performed high-resolution calcium imaging from the hippocampal CA2 region of awake head-fixed mice, as CA2 is necessary for social recognition memory. We find that CA2 encodes specific neural representations of novel social odors that are further refined during associative odor-reward learning. Optogenetic silencing of CA2 impairs the formation of reward associations. Furthermore, CA2 population activity represents odors in a geometry that enables abstract representations of social versus non-social odors. Thus, CA2 distinguishes multiple forms of olfactory stimuli to enhance the learning of social odors and associations, which are poised to serve as substrates of social memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic exposure to odors at naturally occurring concentrations triggers limited plasticity in early stages of Drosophila olfactory processing</a></h4>

              
                In insects and mammals, chronic exposure to odors at high concentrations in early life alters olfactory function, but the role of odor experience-dependent plasticity in more naturalistic contexts is less clear. We investigated olfactory plasticity in the Drosophila antennal lobe by exposing flies to odors at concentrations that are typically encountered in natural odor sources. These stimuli also strongly and selectively activated only a single class of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) input, facilitating the investigation of input-specific plasticity. Overall, chronic exposure to three such odors elicited limited plasticity in the odor responses of second-order projection neurons (PNs). Exposure to some odors elicited mild increases in PN responses to weak stimuli, extending the lower bound of the dynamic range of PN signaling. When present, plasticity was observed broadly in multiple PN types and thus was not selective for PNs receiving direct input from the chronically active ORNs. Chronic E2-hexenal exposure did not affect PN intrinsic properties, local inhibitory innervation, ORN responses, or ORN-PN synaptic strength, but modestly increased broad lateral excitation evoked by some odors. These results show that PN odor coding is only mildly affected by strong persistent activation of a single olfactory input and highlight the stability of early stages of insect olfactory processing to significant perturbations in the sensory environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Central hormone-sensitive lipase is located at synapses and is necessary for normal memory performance in mice</a></h4>

              
                Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is mainly present in the adipose tissue where it hydrolyses diacylglycerol. Although brain expression of HSL has been reported, its presence in different cellular compartments is uncertain, and its role in regulating brain lipid metabolism remains hitherto unexplored. We propose that HSL has a role in regulating the availability of bioactive lipids necessary for adequate neuronal function. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that dampening HSL activity leads to brain dysfunction. We found HSL protein and activity throughout all the mouse brain, localised in neurons and especially enriched in synapses. HSL null mice were then analysed using a battery of behavioural tests. Relative to wild-type littermates, HSL null mice showed impaired short- and long-term memory, but preserved exploratory behaviours. Molecular analysis of the cortex and hippocampus showed increased expression of genes involved in glucose utilization in the hippocampus but not cortex of HSL null mice compared to controls. Lipidomics analyses indicated an impact of HSL deletion on the profile of bioactive lipids, including endocannabinoids and eicosanoids that are known to modulate neuronal activity, cerebral blood blow and inflammation processes. Accordingly, mild increases in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggest low grade inflammation in HSL null mice compared to littermates. We conclude that HSL has a homeostatic role in maintaining pools of lipids that are needed for brain function. It remains to be tested, however, whether the recruitment of HSL for the synthesis of these lipids occurs during increased neuronal activity, or whether HSL participates in neuroinflammatory responses.

                Pubertal maturation aids development of emotion, cognition, and reproduction. We investigated transcriptional dynamics in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a hypothalamic center for reproductive behaviors, in male and female mice at single-cell resolution (scRNAseq) during puberty. Defined subsets of neurons expressing Slc32a1 and Esr1 (Vgat+ Esr1+) were the most transcriptionally dynamic compared to other cell types throughout puberty. These cell type specific transcriptional progressions towards adulthood were bidirectionally controlled by the levels of circulating testosterone and estradiol. Selective deletion of Esr1 in Slc32a1-expressing cells in the MPOA prior to puberty arrested transcriptional progression and revealed a sexually dimorphic gene-regulatory network governed by Esr1. Deletion of Esr1 in Vgat+ cells prevented the development of mating behavior in both sexes. These analyses reveal both sexually common and dimorphic transcriptional progressions during puberty as well as their regulatory mechanisms, which have important implications towards understanding adaptative and maladaptive processes governing adolescent brain development.

                Significance: Mayer waves are spontaneous oscillations in arterial blood pressure that can mask cortical hemodynamic responses associated with neural activity of interest. Aim: To characterize the properties of oscillations in the fNIRS signal generated by Mayer waves in a large sample of fNIRS recordings. Further, we aim to determine the impact of short-channel correction for the attenuation of these unwanted signal components. Approach: Mayer wave oscillation parameters were extracted from 310 fNIRS measurements using the Fitting Oscillations & One-Over-F (FOOOF) method to compute normative values. The effect of short-channel correction on Mayer wave oscillation power was quantified on 222 measurements. The practical benefit of the short-channel correction approach for reducing Mayer waves and improving response detection was also evaluated on a subgroup of 17 fNIRS measurements collected during a passive auditory speech detection experiment. Results: Mayer wave oscillations had a mean frequency of 0.108 Hz, bandwidth of 0.075 Hz, and power of 3.5 M2/Hz. The distribution of oscillation signal power was positively skewed, with some measurements containing large Mayer waves. Short-channel correction significantly reduced the amplitude of these undesired signals; greater attenuation was observed for measurements containing larger Mayer wave oscillations. Conclusions: A robust method for quantifying Mayer wave oscillations in the fNIRS signal spectrum was presented and used to provide normative parameterization. Short-channel correction is recommended as an approach for attenuating Mayer waves, particularly in participants with large oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of V3 neurons in speed-dependent interlimb coordination during locomotion in mice</a></h4>

              
                Speed-dependent interlimb coordination allows animals to maintain stable locomotion under different circumstances. We have previously demonstrated that a subset of spinal V3 neurons contributes to stable locomotion by mediating mutual excitation between left and right lumbar rhythm generators (RGs). Here, we expanded our investigation to the V3 neurons involved in ascending long propriospinal interactions (aLPNs). Using retrograde tracing, we revealed a subpopulation of lumbar V3 aLPNs with contralateral cervical projections. V3OFF mice, in which all V3 neurons were silenced, had a significantly reduced maximal locomotor speed, were unable to move using stable trot, gallop, or bound, and predominantly used lateral-sequence walk. To understand the functional roles of V3 aLPNs, we adapted our previous model of spinal circuitry controlling quadrupedal locomotion (Danner et al., 2017), by incorporating diagonal V3 aLPNs mediating inputs from each lumbar RG to the contralateral cervical RG. The updated model reproduces our experimental results and suggests that locally projecting V3 neurons, mediating left-right interactions within lumbar and cervical cords, promote left-right synchronization necessary for gallop and bound, whereas the V3 aLPNs promote synchronization between diagonal fore and hind RGs necessary for trot. The model proposes the organization of spinal circuits available for future experimental testing.

                The pupillary light response is an important automatic physiological response that optimises light reaching the retina. Recent work has shown that the pupil also adjusts in response to illusory brightness and a range of cognitive functions, however, it remains unclear what exactly drives these endogenous changes. Here we show that the imagery pupillary light response correlates with objective measures of sensory imagery strength. Further, the trial-by-trial phenomenological vividness of visual imagery is tracked by the imagery pupillary light response. We also demonstrated that there was no evidence for an imagery pupillary light response in a group of individuals without visual imagery (aphantasia), however, they did show perceptual pupil light responses and pupil dilation with larger cognitive load. Our results provide evidence that the pupillary light response indexes the sensory strength of visual imagery and also provides the first physiological validation of aphantasia.

                Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during post-learning sleep is known to enhance motor memory consolidation but the underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. Here, we confirm the beneficial effect of auditory TMR on motor performance. At the neural level, TMR enhanced slow waves (SW) characteristics. Additionally, greater TMR-related phase-amplitude coupling between slow (0.3-2 Hz) and sigma (12-16 Hz) oscillations after the SW peak was related to higher TMR effect on performance. Importantly, sounds that were not associated to learning strengthened SW-sigma coupling at the SW trough and the increase in sigma power nested in the trough of the potential evoked by these unassociated sounds was related to the TMR benefit. Altogether, our data suggest that, depending on their precise temporal coordination during post learning sleep, slow and sigma oscillations play a crucial role in either memory reinstatement or protection against irrelevant information; two processes that critically contribute to motor memory consolidation.

                Humans vary greatly in their motor learning abilities, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie this variability. Recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that large-scale neural dynamics inhabit a low-dimensional subspace or manifold, and that learning is constrained by this intrinsic manifold architecture. Here we asked, using functional MRI, whether subject-level differences in neural excursion from manifold structure can explain differences in learning across participants. We had subjects perform a sensorimotor adaptation task in the MRI scanner on two consecutive days, allowing us to assess their learning performance across days, as well as continuously measure brain activity. We find that the overall neural excursion from manifold activity in both cognitive and sensorimotor brain networks is associated with differences in subjects' patterns of learning and relearning across days. These findings suggest that off-manifold activity provides an index of the relative engagement of different neural systems during learning, and that intersubject differences in patterns of learning and relearning across days are related to reconfiguration processes in cognitive and sensorimotor networks during learning.

                We are utilizing an adult penetrating traumatic brain injury (PTBI) model in Drosophila to investigate regenerative mechanisms after damage to the central brain. We focused on cell proliferation as an early event in the regenerative process. To identify candidate pathways that may trigger cell proliferation following PTBI, we utilized RNA-Seq. We find that transcript levels for components of both Toll and Immune Deficiency (Imd) innate immunity pathways are rapidly and highly upregulated post-PTBI. We then tested mutants for the NF-{kappa}B transcription factors of the Toll and Imd pathways, Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) and Relish (Rel) respectively. We find that loss of either or both Dif and Rel results in loss of cell proliferation after injury. We then tested canonical downstream targets of Drosophila innate immune signaling, the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and find that they are not required for cell proliferation following PTBI. This suggests that there are alternative targets of Toll and Imd signaling that trigger cell division after injury. Furthermore, we find that while AMP levels are substantially elevated after PTBI, their levels revert to near baseline within 24 hours. Finally, we identify tissue-specific requirements for Dif and Rel. Taken together, these results indicate that the innate immunity pathways play an integral role in the regenerative response. Innate immunity previously has been implicated as both a potentiator and an inhibitor of regeneration. Our work suggests that modulation of innate immunity may be essential to prevent adverse outcomes. Thus, this work is likely to inform future experiments to dissect regenerative mechanisms in higher organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Riemannian geometry of functional connectivity matrices for multi-site attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder data harmonization</a></h4>

              
                The use of multi-site datasets in neuroimaging provides neuroscientists with more statistical power to perform their analyses. However, it has been shown that imaging-site introduces a variability in the data that cannot be attributed to biological sources. In this work, we show that functional connectivity matrices derived from resting-state multi-site data contain a significant imaging-site bias. To this aim, we exploited the fact that functional connectivity matrices belong to the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices, making possible to operate on them with Riemannian geometry. We hereby propose a geometry-aware harmonization approach, Rigid Log-Euclidean Translation, that accounts for this site bias. Moreover, we adapted other Riemannian-geometric methods designed for other domain adaptation tasks, and compared them to our proposal. Based on our results, Rigid Log-Euclidean Translation of multi-site functional connectivity matrices seems the most suitable method in a clinical setting. This represents an advance with respect to previous functional connectivity data harmonization approaches, which do not respect the geometric constraints imposed by the underlying structure of the manifold. In particular, when applying our proposed method on data from the ADHD-200 dataset, a multi-site dataset built for the study of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, we obtained results that display a remarkable correlation with established pathophysiological findings and, therefore, represent a substantial improvement when compared to the non-harmonization analysis. Thus, we present evidence supporting that harmonization should be extended to other functional neuroimaging datasets, and provide a simple geometric method to address it.

                Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex disease affecting many facets of movement, especially gait abnormalities such as shuffling and freezing of gait. The nigrostriatal pathways of the basal ganglia are traditionally targeted by existing therapies; however, other pathways may be more relevant to gait, such as the pedunculopontine nucleus and the zona incerta (ZI). The A13 nucleus may be such a target as it has emerged as an area of interest in dopamine motor function. Yet, this area remains understudied compared to other dopamine nuclei, especially in animal models of PD. In 6-OHDA mice, we found a reduction in locomotion in the open field and gait dysfunction during treadmill tests. Medial ZI dopamine cells, containing the A13 nucleus, were preserved following 6-OHDA, in contrast to a marked reduction in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons. There was extensive remodelling of the A13 afferent and efferent connectome following nigrostriatal lesions. Afferent input patterns displayed a marked reduction in cross-correlation across brain regions in 6-OHDA mice, while efferent projections showed an increase. In a human PD patient with advanced gait dysfunction we found that the A13 nucleus was preserved, suggesting that remodelling could also occur in humans. This work points to the A13 region as a potential therapeutic target in PD.

                Neuronal populations code similar concepts by similar activity patterns across the human brain's networks supporting language comprehension. However, it is unclear to what extent such meaning-to-symbol mapping reflects statistical distributions of symbol meanings in language use, as quantified by word co-occurrence frequencies, or, rather, experiential information thought to be necessary for grounding symbols in sensorimotor knowledge. Here we asked whether integrating distributional semantics with human judgments of grounded sensorimotor semantics better approximates the representational similarity of conceptual categories in the brain, as compared with each of these methods used separately. We examined the similarity structure of activation patterns elicited by action- and object-related concepts using multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) of fMRI data. The results suggested that a semantic vector integrating both sensorimotor and distributional information yields best category discrimination on the cognitive-linguistic level, and explains the corresponding activation patterns in left posterior inferior temporal cortex. In turn, semantic vectors based on detailed visual and motor information uncovered category-specific similarity patterns in fusiform and angular gyrus for object-related concepts, and in motor cortex, left inferior frontal cortex (BA 44), and supramarginal gyrus for action-related concepts.

                Sudden changes in the sensory environment are frequently perceived as threats and may provoke defensive behavioral states. One such state is tonic immobility, a conserved defensive strategy characterized by a powerful suppression of movement and motor reflexes. Tonic immobility has been associated with multiple brainstem regions and cell types, but the underlying circuit is not known. Here, we demonstrate that a strong vibratory stimulus evokes tonic immobility in larval zebrafish defined by suppression of exploratory locomotion and sensorimotor responses. Using a circuit-breaking screen and targeted neuron ablations we show that cerebellar granule cells and a cluster of glutamatergic ventral prepontine neurons (vPPNs) that express key stress-associated neuropeptides are critical components of the circuit that suppresses movement. The complete sensorimotor circuit transmits information from primary sensory neurons through the cerebellum to vPPNs to regulate reticulospinal premotor neurons. These results show that cerebellar regulation of a neuropeptide-rich prepontine structure governs a conserved and ancestral defensive behavior that is triggered by inescapable threat.

                Camera images can encode large amounts of visual information of an animal and its environment, enabling high fidelity 3D reconstruction of the animal and its environment using computer vision methods. Most systems, both markerless (e.g. deep learning based) and marker-based, require multiple cameras to track features across multiple points of view to enable such 3D reconstruction. However, such systems can be expensive and are challenging to set up in small animal research apparatuses. We present an open-source, marker-based system for tracking the head of a rodent for behavioral research that requires only a single camera with a potentially wide field of view. The system features a lightweight visual target and computer vision algorithms that together enable high-accuracy tracking of the six-degree-of-freedom position and orientation of the animal's head. The system, which only requires a single camera positioned above the behavioral arena, robustly reconstructs the pose over a wide range of head angles (360 degrees in yaw, and approximately +/-120 degrees in roll and pitch). Experiments with live animals demonstrate that the system can reliably identifyrat head position and orientation. Evaluations using a commercial optical tracker device show that the system achieves accuracy that rivals commercial multi-camera systems. Our solution significantly improves upon existing monocular marker-based tracking methods, both in accuracy and in allowable range of motion. The proposed system enables the study of complex behaviors by providing robust, fine-scale measurements of rodent head motions in a wide range of orientations.

                Neural mass models such as the Jansen-Rit system provide a practical framework for representing and interpreting electrophysiological activity (1-6) in both local and global brain models (7). However, they are only partly derived from first principles. While the post-synaptic potential dynamics in NMM are inferred from data and can be grounded on diffusion physics (8-10), Freeman's "wave to pulse" sigmoid function (11-13) is used to transduce mean population membrane potential into firing rate rests on a weaker theoretical standing. On the other hand, Montbrio et al (14, 15) derive an exact mean-field theory from a quadratic integrate and fire neuron model under some simplifying assumptions (MPR), connecting microscale neural mechanisms and meso/macroscopic phenomena. The MPR model can be seen to replace Freeman's sigmoid function with a pair of differential equations for the mean membrane potential and firing rate variables, providing a mechanistic interpretation of NMM semi-empirical sigmoid parameters. In doing so, it sheds light on the mechanisms behind enhanced network response to weak but uniform perturbations: in the exact mean-field theory, intrinsic population connectivity modulates the steady-state firing rate transfer function in a monotonic manner, with increasing self-connectivity leading to higher firing rates. This provides a plausible mechanism for the enhanced response of densely connected networks to weak, uniform inputs such as the electric fields produced by non-invasive brain stimulation. Finally, we complete the MPR model by adding the equations for delayed post-synaptic currents, bringing together the MPR and NMM formalisms into a unified exact mean-field theory (NMM2) displaying rich dynamical features. As an example, we analyze the dynamics of a single population model, and a model of two coupled populations with a simple excitation-inhibition (E-I) architecture, showing it displays rich dynamics with limit cycles, period doubling, bursting behavior, and enhanced sensitivity to external inputs.

                Sensory responses of cortical neurons are more discriminable when evoked on a baseline of desynchronized spontaneous activity, but cortical desynchronization has not generally been associated with more accurate perceptual decisions. Here we show that mice perform more accurate auditory judgements when activity in the auditory cortex is elevated and desynchronized before stimulus onset, but only if the previous trial was an error, and that this relationship is occluded if previous outcome is ignored. We confirmed that the outcome-dependent effect of brain state on performance is neither due to idiosyncratic associations between the slow components of either signal, nor to the existence of specific cortical states evident only after errors. Instead, errors appear to gate the effect of cortical state fluctuations on discrimination accuracy. Neither facial movements nor pupil size during the baseline were associated with accuracy, but they were predictive of measures of responsivity, such as the probability of not responding to the stimulus or of responding prematurely. These results suggest that the functional role of cortical state on behavior is dynamic and constantly regulated by performance monitoring systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor learning in reaching tasks leads to homogenization of task space error distribution</a></h4>

              
                A human arm, up to the wrist, is often modelled as a redundant 7 degree-of-freedom serial robot. Despite its inherent nonlinearity, we can perform point-to-point reaching tasks reasonably fast and with reasonable accuracy in the presence of external disturbances and noise. In this work, we take a closer look at the task space error during point-to-point reaching tasks and learning during an external force-field perturbation. From experiments and quantitative data, we confirm a directional dependence of the peak task space error with certain directions showing larger errors than others at the start of a force-field perturbation, and the larger errors are reduced with repeated trials implying learning. The analysis of the experimental data further shows that a) the distribution of the peak error is made more uniform across directions with trials and the error magnitude and distribution approaches the value when no perturbation is applied, b) the redundancy present in the human arm is used more in the direction of the larger error, and c) homogenization of the error distribution is not seen when the reaching task is performed with the non-dominant hand. The results support the hypothesis that not only magnitude of task space error, but the directional dependence is reduced during motor learning and the workspace is homogenized possibly to increase the control efficiency and accuracy in point-to-point reaching tasks. The results also imply that redundancy in the arm is used to homogenize the workspace, and additionally since the bio-mechanically similar dominant and non-dominant arms show different behaviours, the homogenizing is actively done in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep spindles track cortical learning patterns for memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation, the transformation of labile memory traces into stable long-term representations, is facilitated by post-learning sleep. Computational and biophysical models suggest that sleep spindles may play a key mechanistic role for consolidation, igniting structural changes at cortical sites involved in prior learning. Here we tested the resulting prediction that spindles are most pronounced over learning-related cortical areas and that the extent of this learning-spindle overlap predicts behavioural measures of memory consolidation. Using high-density scalp Electroencephalography (EEG) and Polysomnography (PSG) in healthy volunteers, we first identified cortical areas engaged during a temporospatial associative memory task (power decreases in the alpha/beta frequency range, 6-20 Hz). Critically, we found that participant-specific topographies (i.e., spatial distributions) of post-learning sleep spindle amplitude correlated with participant-specific learning topographies. Importantly, the extent to which spindles tracked learning patterns further predicted memory consolidation across participants. Our results provide empirical evidence for a role of post-learning sleep spindles in tracking learning networks, thereby facilitating memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity of fMRI using differential covariance predicts structural connectivity and behavioral reaction times</a></h4>

              
                Recordings from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) reflect the influence of pathways between brain areas. A wide range of methods have been proposed to measure this functional connectivity (FC), but the lack of ''ground truth'' has made it difficult to systematically validate them. Most measures of FC produce connectivity estimates that are symmetrical between brain areas. Differential covariance (dCov) is an algorithm for analyzing FC with directed graph edges. Applied to synthetic datasets, dCov-FC was more effective than covariance and partial correlation in reducing false positive connections and more accurately matching the underlying structural connectivity. When we applied dCov-FC to resting state fMRI recordings from the human connectome project (HCP) and anesthetized mice, dCov-FC accurately identified strong cortical connections from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) in individual humans and viral tract tracing in mice. In addition, those HCP subjects whose rs-fMRI were more integrated, as assessed by a graph-theoretic measure, tended to have shorter reaction times in several behavioral tests. Thus, dCov-FC was able to identify anatomically verified connectivity that yielded measures of brain integration causally related to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glial TGFβ activity promotes axon survival in peripheral nerves</a></h4>

              
                Axons can represent the majority of the volume of a neuron and are energetically very demanding. Specialized glia ensheathe axons and are believed to support axon function and maintenance throughout life, but molecular details of glia-neuron support mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we identify a collection of secreted and transmembrane genes that are required in glia for long-term axon survival in vivo. We show that key components of the TGF{beta} superfamily are required cell-autonomously in glia for peripheral nerve maintenance, although their loss does not disrupt glial morphology. We observe age-dependent neurodegeneration in the absence of glial TGF{beta} signaling that can be rescued by genetic blockade of Wallerian degeneration. Our data argue that glial TGF{beta} signaling normally acts to promote axon survival and suppress neurodegeneration.

	<p>Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are considered common facilitating factors, along with other infections, in triggering febrile seizures (FS). The main purpose of our study was to identify specific inflammatory patterns of UTI cases from other infections in a specific cluster, using a combination of inflammatory biomarkers to differentiate UTIs from other bacterial diseases triggering FS. Method: This prospective study included a number of 136 patients with 197 distinct FS events, from patients hospitalized in the Pediatric Clinical Hospital Sibiu, among which 10.2% were diagnosed with UTIs. Results: In one-third of the patients with UTIs (20 cases), the symptoms were limited to fever and FS. Using two-step cluster analysis, a distinct UTI inflammatory pattern has emerged: highest platelet values (PLT), median value 331 × 103/mm3 and intermediate C-reactive protein (CRP), median value 15 mg/dL, platelet distribution width (PDW), median value 9.65%, platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR), median value 14.45%, mean platelet volume (MPV), median value 8.60 fL and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte values (NLR), median value 3.64. Furthermore, higher PDW (median value 12.25%), P-LCR (median value 28.55%), MPV (median value 10.40 fL), CRP (median value 74.00 mg/dL) and NLR values (median value 4.11) were associated mainly (85.7%) with bacterial lower respiratory infections. UTIs were highly unlikely in these patients with significantly increased CRP values and normal values of platelet indices. Conclusions: Considering the nonspecific clinical picture of UTIs at an early age, to optimize the management of FS, a fast diagnosis of UTI is mandatory. The analysis of the inflammatory biomarker clusters (rather than individual parameters) correlated with urine leukocyte and nitrite stick evaluation for specific age groups could help in identifying even oligosymptomatic UTIs patients. The study limitation (20 UTI cases) recommends future multicentric trials on larger datasets to validate the model.</p>

	<p>Music perception deficits are common following acquired brain injury due to stroke, epilepsy surgeries, and aneurysmal clipping. Few studies have examined these deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI), resulting in an under-diagnosis in this population. We aimed to 1) compare TBI patients to controls on pitch and rhythm perception during the acute phase; 2) determine whether pitch and rhythm perception disorders co-occur; 3) examine lateralization of injury in the context of pitch and rhythm perception; and 4) determine the relationship between verbal short-term memory (STM) and pitch and rhythm perception. Music perception was examined using the Scale and Rhythm tests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia, in association with CT scans to identify lesion laterality. Verbal short-term memory was examined using Digit Span Forward. TBI patients had greater impairment than controls, with 43% demonstrating deficits in pitch perception, and 40% in rhythm perception. Deficits were greater with right hemisphere damage than left. Pitch and rhythm deficits co-occurred 31% of the time, suggesting partly dissociable networks. There was a dissociation between performance on verbal STM and pitch and rhythm perception 39 to 42% of the time (respectively), with most individuals (92%) demonstrating intact verbal STM, with impaired pitch or rhythm perception. The clinical implications of music perception deficits following TBI are discussed.</p>

	<p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), the early detection of disease activity or progression is key to inform treatment changes and could be supported by digital tools. We present a novel CE-marked and FDA-cleared digital care management platform consisting of (1) a patient phone/web application and healthcare professional portal (icompanion) including validated symptom, disability, cognition, and fatigue patient-reported outcomes; and (2) clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantifications (icobrain ms). We validate both tools using their ability to detect (sub)clinical disease activity (known-groups validity) and real-world data insights. Surveys showed that 95.6% of people with MS (PwMS) were interested in using an MS app, and 98.2% were interested in knowing about MRI changes. The icompanion measures of disability (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and symptoms (p = 0.005) and icobrain ms MRI parameters were sensitive to (sub)clinical differences between MS subtypes. icobrain ms also decreased intra- and inter-rater lesion count variability and increased sensitivity for detecting disease activity/progression from 24% to 76% compared to standard radiological reading. This evidence shows PwMS’ interest, the digital care platform’s potential to improve the detection of (sub)clinical disease activity and care management, and the feasibility of linking different digital tools into one overarching MS care pathway.</p>

	<p>Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have been accumulating adverse psychological symptoms due to the closure of educational centers and the need to adapt to different teaching modalities. Methods: Medline and PubMed were searched for studies on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and burn-out in teachers, published from 1 December 2019 to 15 June 2021. Results: In total, eight studies were included in this study. The results show that teachers report levels of anxiety (17%), depression (19%), and stress (30%). In Asia, there has been more anxiety compared to other continents. Overall, anxiety has been higher among teachers in schools compared to universities. However, stress levels have been higher among teachers in universities compared to schools. Statistically, there were no significant differences regarding gender and age in any of the symptoms. Conclusions: The results suggest that teachers at different educational levels are experiencing adverse psychological symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that anxiety levels vary between different countries. However, more international studies are needed to fully understand the impact of the pandemic on teachers’ mental health.</p>

	<p>Sleep problems have a bi-directional impact on the daytime performance of children, parental well-being, and overall family functioning in the general population. Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at a high risk of sleep problems, yet the relationship between sleep problems, adaptive functioning, and family stress in children with DS is not well documented. We examined the relationship between sleep (i.e., duration and quality) and child and parent/family functioning. Sixty-six children with DS wore an actigraph for a week to assess their sleep duration and sleep efficiency. Their parents completed ratings on child sleep duration and parasomnias, child adaptive functioning, parental depression and sleep, and family stress. The parents’ reports of their children’s sleep duration were associated with parental depressive symptoms. The parents’ reports of their children’s restless sleep behaviors were associated with poorer performances in child-compliant/calm behaviors, worse parental sleep, and negative parental feelings and sibling relationships. The findings from actigraph measures of the children’s sleep demonstrated that greater sleep efficiency was associated with greater child adaptive functioning and fewer parental depressive symptoms. The study findings provide preliminary evidence that sleep problems are related to child adaptive functioning, parental functioning, and family stress in children with DS.</p>

	<p>Objective: There is limited literature comparing the uniportal full endoscopic posterolateral transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion outside-in approach (ETLIF (O)) with the inside-out approach (ETLIF (I)). Methods: Radiological evaluation was performed on disc height restoration and coronal wedging angle, and operation time (inferior articular process resection time/total operation time) and clinical evaluation were made. Result: 48 cases of inside-out and 38 cases of outside-in cases were included. Compared to inside-out, the outside-in approach had significantly less operative time required to resect inferior articular process: 36.55 ± 10.37, and total operative time: 87.45 ± 20.14 min compared to 49.83 ± 23.97 and 102.56 ± 36.53 min, respectively, for the inside-out approach, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Compared to the preoperative state, both cohorts achieved significant improvement of VAS and ODI at post-operative 1 week, 3 months and at final follow up. Both cohorts achieved statistically significant increased disc height with 5.00 ± 2.87 mm, 5.49 ± 2.33 mm and statistically significant improvement in coronal wedge angle with 1.76 ± 1.63°, 3.24 ± 2.92° in the inside-out and outside-in approaches respectively. Conclusions: Complete removal of inferior articular process is the key part of endoscopic fusion with two methods that can be applied: an inside-out approach or an outside-in approach. Comparing both techniques, the outside-in approach has a shorter operative time required for inferior articular process resection and total length of operation with similar good clinical and radiological outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obligate insect social parasites evolve traits to effectively locate and then exploit their hosts, whereas hosts have complex social behavioral repertoires, which include sensory recognition to reject potential conspecific intruders and heterospecific parasites. While social parasite and host behaviors have been studied extensively, less is known about how their sensory systems function to meet their specific selective pressures. Here, we compare investment in visual and olfactory brain regions in the paper wasp <i>Polistes dominula,</i> and its obligate social parasite <i>P. sulcifer,</i> to explore the link among sensory systems and brain, and behavior. Our results show relative significant volumetric differences between these two closely-related species, consistent with their very different life-histories. Social parasites show proportionally larger optic lobes and central complex to likely navigate long-distance migrations and unfamiliar landscapes to locate the specific species of hosts they usurp. Contrastingly, hosts have larger antennal lobes and calyces of the mushroom bodies compared with social parasites, as predicted by their sensory means to maintain social cohesion via olfactory signals, allocate colony tasks, forage, and recognize con- and heterospecific intruders. Our present work suggests how this tradeoff between visual and olfactory brain regions may facilitate different sensory adaptations needed to perform social and foraging tasks by the host, including recognition of parasites, or to fly long distances and successful host localizing by the social parasite.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Bilateral convergence of external stimuli is a common feature of vertebrate sensory systems. This convergence of inputs from the bilateral receptive fields allows higher order sensory perception, such as depth perception in the vertebrate visual system and stimulus localization in the auditory system. The functional role of such bilateral convergence in the olfactory system is unknown. To test whether each olfactory bulb (OB) contributes a separate piece of olfactory information, and whether information from the bilateral OB is integrated, we synchronized the activation of OBs with blue light in mice expressing ChIEF in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and behaviorally assessed the relevance of dual OBs in olfactory perception. Our findings suggest that each OB contributes separate components of olfactory information, and the mice integrate the bilaterally synchronized olfactory information for olfactory identity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Laser Capture Microdissection of Single Neurons with Morphological Visualization Using Fluorescent Proteins Fused to Transmembrane Proteins</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gene expression analysis in individual neuronal types helps in understanding brain function. Genetic methods expressing fluorescent proteins are widely used to label specific neuronal populations. However, because cell type specificity of genetic labeling is often limited, it is advantageous to combine genetic labeling with additional methods to select specific cell/neuronal types. Laser capture microdissection is one of such techniques with which one can select a specific cell/neuronal population based on morphological observation. However, a major issue is the disappearance of fluorescence signals during the tissue processing that is required for high-quality sample preparation. Here, we developed a simple, novel method in which fluorescence signals are preserved. We use genetic labeling with fluorescence proteins fused to transmembrane proteins, which shows highly stable fluorescence retention and allows for the selection of fluorescent neurons/cells based on morphology. Using this method in mice, we laser-captured neuronal somata and successfully isolated RNA. We determined that ~100 cells are sufficient to obtain a sample required for downstream applications such as quantitative PCR. Capability to specifically microdissect targeted neurons was demonstrated by an ~10-fold increase in mRNA for fluorescent proteins in visually identified neurons expressing the fluorescent proteins compared with neighboring cells not expressing it. We applied this method to validate virus-mediated single-cell knockout, which showed up to 92% reduction in knocked-out gene RNA compared with wild-type neurons. This method using fluorescent proteins fused to transmembrane proteins provides a new, simple solution to perform gene expression analysis in sparsely labeled neuronal/cellular populations, which is especially advantageous when genetic labeling has limited specificity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Reciprocal Changes in Voltage-Gated Potassium and Subthreshold Inward Currents Help Maintain Firing Dynamics of AVPV Kisspeptin Neurons during the Estrous Cycle</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Kisspeptin-expressing neurons in the anteroventral-periventricular nucleus (AVPV) are part of a neural circuit generating the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge. This process is estradiol-dependent and occurs on the afternoon of proestrus in female mice. On proestrus, AVPV kisspeptin neurons express more kisspeptin and exhibit higher frequency action potentials and burst firing compared with diestrus, which is characterized by a pulsatile rather than a prolonged surge of GnRH secretion. We hypothesized changes in voltage-gated potassium conductances shape activity profiles of these cells in a cycle-dependent manner. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of GFP-identified AVPV kisspeptin neurons in brain slices from diestrous and proestrous mice revealed three subcomponents of the voltage-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> current: fast-transient slow-transient, and residual. During proestrus, the V<SUB>50</SUB> of inactivation of the fast-transient current was depolarized and the amplitude of the slow-transient component was reduced compared with diestrus; the residual component was consistent across both stages. Computational models were fit to experimental data, including published estrous-cycle effects on other voltage-gated currents. Computer simulations suggest proestrus-typical K<sup>+</sup> currents are suppressive compared with diestrus. Interestingly, larger T-type, persistent-sodium, and hyperpolarization-activated currents during proestrus compensate for this suppressive effect while also enabling postinhibitory rebound bursting. These findings suggest modulation of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and multiple subthreshold depolarizing currents across the negative to positive feedback transition maintain AVPV kisspeptin neuron excitability in response to depolarizing stimuli. These changes also enable firing in response to hyperpolarization, providing a net increase in neuronal excitability, which may contribute to activation of this population leading up to the preovulatory GnRH surge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Using citation tracking for systematic literature searching - study protocol for a scoping review of methodological studies and a Delphi study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Up-to-date guidance on comprehensive study identification for systematic reviews is crucial. According to current recommendations, systematic searching should combine electronic database searching with supplementary search methods. One such supplementary search method is citation tracking. It aims at collecting directly and/or indirectly cited and citing references from "seed references". Tailored and evidence-guided recommendations concerning the use of citation tracking are strongly needed. Objective: We intend to develop recommendations for the use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics. Our study will be guided by the following research questions: What is the benefit of citation tracking for systematic literature searching for health-related topics? Which methods, citation indexes, and other tools are used for citation tracking? What terminology is used for citation tracking methods? Methods: Our study will have two parts: a scoping review and a Delphi study. The scoping review aims at identifying methodological studies on the benefit and use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics with no restrictions on study design, language, and publication date. We will perform database searching in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection, two information science databases, web searching, and contact experts in the field. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection. We will conduct direct backward and forward citation tracking on included articles. Data from included studies will be extracted using a prespecified extraction sheet and presented in both tabular and narrative form. The results of the scoping review will inform the subsequent Delphi study through which we aim to derive consensus recommendations for the future practice and research of citation tracking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hospital quality monitoring and evaluation system using linked spreadsheets on Microsoft SharePoint [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Establishment of a systematic way of measurement and utilization of indicators for improvement is one of the most challenging issues in monitoring and evaluation of indicators in healthcare settings. In realizing these fundamental challenges, we designed a monitoring and evaluation system incorporating a hospital-wide quality variance report (QVR) system using linked Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets on Microsoft SharePoint®. Methods Indicators were determined at the departmental/unit level in line with the institutional goals, departmental functions, quality expectations, inputs/outputs, clinical priorities, compliance to policies/procedures/protocols/guidelines/pathways as well as in response to gaps in service delivery picked during root cause analyses. The sample design was determined in accordance with the characteristics of the population. Drawing of sample units was done using a simple random sampling technique without replacement or systematic random sampling. The indicator’s monitoring was enhanced visually by allocating colour codes based on performance across the months and quarters. The action plan tab consisted of a platform that aids in documenting corrective actions arising from the performance reviews. Results and discussion The QVR reporting system ensured a standardized format of monitoring throughout the institution with a reduced turnaround time from data collection to analysis. Further, continuity of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was guaranteed even if an individual left the institution.  The analysis of the QVR allowed hospital-wide trending on cross-cutting indicators with consequent ease of communication to multiple stakeholders.  The automation has saved time and increased accuracy which has enhanced credible engagements during quality meetings. Conclusions Use of this system greatly enhanced quality performance monitoring in the hospital, identification of major bottlenecks that warranted hospital-wide projects or departmental-level projects. The QVR system enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of quality monitoring from data collection through to performance reviews. The QVR structure allows for customized development of an M&E database application software.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Differential contribution to gene expression prediction of histone modifications at enhancers or promoters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mar González-Ramírez, Cecilia Ballaré, Francesca Mugianesi, Malte Beringer, Alexandra Santanach, Enrique Blanco, Luciano Di Croce</p>

The ChIP-seq signal of histone modifications at promoters is a good predictor of gene expression in different cellular contexts, but whether this is also true at enhancers is not clear. To address this issue, we develop quantitative models to characterize the relationship of gene expression with histone modifications at enhancers or promoters. We use embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which contain a full spectrum of active and repressed (poised) enhancers, to train predictive models. As many poised enhancers in ESCs switch towards an active state during differentiation, predictive models can also be trained on poised enhancers throughout differentiation and in development. Remarkably, we determine that histone modifications at enhancers, as well as promoters, are predictive of gene expression in ESCs and throughout differentiation and development. Importantly, we demonstrate that their contribution to the predictive models varies depending on their location in enhancers or promoters. Moreover, we use a local regression (LOESS) to normalize sequencing data from different sources, which allows us to apply predictive models trained in a specific cellular context to a different one. We conclude that the relationship between gene expression and histone modifications at enhancers is universal and different from promoters. Our study provides new insight into how histone modifications relate to gene expression based on their location in enhancers or promoters.

Mathematical models are powerful tools in HIV epidemiology, producing quantitative projections of key indicators such as HIV incidence and prevalence. In order to improve the accuracy of predictions, such models need to incorporate a number of behavioural and biological heterogeneities, especially those related to the sexual network within which HIV transmission occurs. An individual-based model, which explicitly models sexual partnerships, is thus often the most natural type of model to choose. In this paper we present PopART-IBM, a computationally efficient individual-based model capable of simulating 50 years of an HIV epidemic in a large, high-prevalence community in under a minute. We show how the model calibrates within a Bayesian inference framework to detailed age- and sex-stratified data from multiple sources on HIV prevalence, awareness of HIV status, ART status, and viral suppression for an HPTN 071 (PopART) study community in Zambia, and present future projections of HIV prevalence and incidence for this community in the absence of trial intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Probing T-cell response by sequence-based probabilistic modeling</a></h4>

With the increasing ability to use high-throughput next-generation sequencing to quantify the diversity of the human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, the ability to use TCR sequences to infer antigen-specificity could greatly aid potential diagnostics and therapeutics. Here, we use a machine-learning approach known as Restricted Boltzmann Machine to develop a sequence-based inference approach to identify antigen-specific TCRs. Our approach combines probabilistic models of TCR sequences with clone abundance information to extract TCR sequence motifs central to an antigen-specific response. We use this model to identify patient personalized TCR motifs that respond to individual tumor and infectious disease antigens, and to accurately discriminate specific from non-specific responses. Furthermore, the hidden structure of the model results in an interpretable representation space where TCRs responding to the same antigen cluster, correctly discriminating the response of TCR to different viral epitopes. The model can be used to identify condition specific responding TCRs. We focus on the examples of TCRs reactive to candidate neoantigens and selected epitopes in experiments of stimulated TCR clone expansion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Relaxing restrictions at the pace of vaccination increases freedom and guards against further COVID-19 waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simon Bauer, Sebastian Contreras, Jonas Dehning, Matthias Linden, Emil Iftekhar, Sebastian B. Mohr, Alvaro Olivera-Nappa, Viola Priesemann</p>

Mass vaccination offers a promising exit strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as vaccination progresses, demands to lift restrictions increase, despite most of the population remaining susceptible. Using our age-stratified SEIRD-ICU compartmental model and curated epidemiological and vaccination data, we quantified the rate (relative to vaccination progress) at which countries can lift non-pharmaceutical interventions without overwhelming their healthcare systems. We analyzed scenarios ranging from immediately lifting restrictions (accepting high mortality and morbidity) to reducing case numbers to a level where test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) programs efficiently compensate for local spreading events. In general, the age-dependent vaccination roll-out implies a transient decrease of more than ten years in the average age of ICU patients and deceased. The pace of vaccination determines the speed of lifting restrictions; Taking the European Union (EU) as an example case, all considered scenarios allow for steadily increasing contacts starting in May 2021 and relaxing most restrictions by autumn 2021. Throughout summer 2021, only mild contact restrictions will remain necessary. However, only high vaccine uptake can prevent further severe waves. Across EU countries, seroprevalence impacts the long-term success of vaccination campaigns more strongly than age demographics. In addition, we highlight the need for preventive measures to reduce contagion in school settings throughout the year 2021, where children might be drivers of contagion because of them remaining susceptible. Strategies that maintain low case numbers, instead of high ones, reduce infections and deaths by factors of eleven and five, respectively. In general, policies with low case numbers significantly benefit from vaccination, as the overall reduction in susceptibility will further diminish viral spread. Keeping case numbers low is the safest long-term strategy because it considerably reduces mortality and morbidity and offers better preparedness against emerging escape or more contagious virus variants while still allowing for higher contact numbers (freedom) with progressing vaccinations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Basis profile curve identification to understand electrical stimulation effects in human brain networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kai J. Miller, Klaus-Robert Müller, Dora Hermes</p>

Brain networks can be explored by delivering brief pulses of electrical current in one area while measuring voltage responses in other areas. We propose a convergent paradigm to study brain dynamics, focusing on a single brain site to observe the average effect of stimulating each of many other brain sites. Viewed in this manner, visually-apparent motifs in the temporal response shape emerge from adjacent stimulation sites. This work constructs and illustrates a data-driven approach to determine characteristic spatiotemporal structure in these response shapes, summarized by a set of unique “basis profile curves” (BPCs). Each BPC may be mapped back to underlying anatomy in a natural way, quantifying projection strength from each stimulation site using simple metrics. Our technique is demonstrated for an array of implanted brain surface electrodes in a human patient. This framework enables straightforward interpretation of single-pulse brain stimulation data, and can be applied generically to explore the diverse milieu of interactions that comprise the connectome.

                Background: Synthetic engineering of bacteria to produce industrial products is a burgeoning field of research and application. In order to optimize genome design, designers need to understand which genes are essential, which are optimal for growth, and locations in the genome that will be tolerated by the organism when inserting engineered cassettes. Methods: We present a pan-genome based method for the identification of core regions in a genome that are strongly conserved at the species level. Results: We show that the core regions determined by our method contain all or almost all essential genes. This demonstrates the accuracy of our method as essential genes should be core genes. We show that we outperform previous methods by this measure. We also explain why there are exceptions to this rule for our method. Conclusions: We assert that synthetic engineers should avoid deleting or inserting into these core regions unless they understand and are manipulating the function of the genes in that region. Similarly, if the designer wishes to streamline the genome, non-core regions and in particular low penetrance genes would be good targets for deletion. Care should be taken to remove entire cassettes with similar penetrance of the genes within cassettes as they may harbor toxin/antitoxin genes which need to be removed in tandem. The bioinformatic approach introduced here saves considerable time and effort relative to knockout studies on single isolates of a given species and captures a broad understanding of the conservation of genes that are core to a species.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Challenges on diagnosis and therapy of malignant adrenal oncocytic neoplasm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adrenal masses are common incidental findings, most of which are benign and non-functional. Malignant adrenal tumors, however, differ from their benign counterpart and confer poor prognosis. In addition, the oncocytic variants of these tumors present challenges to clinicians owing to their unique biologic behavior and rarity. Case presentation: We present a case report of a 61-year-old male with a T2N0M0 adrenocortical oncocytic neoplasm of the right adrenal gland. The patient complained of worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with a right adrenal mass after an abdominal CT-scan examination two weeks before. Subsequently, the patient underwent open adrenalectomy due to a history of abdominal surgery. Due to unique oncocytic biologic behavior, we used the Lin–Weiss–Bisceglia criteria to predict a malignancy instead of the Weiss system. We only found one malignant criterion, which showed a small tumor invasion on the vascular bed on one histopathological section. Thus, we diagnosed it as malignant adrenocortical oncocytic neoplasm. Furthermore, the PET Scan showed no residual mass or pathological metabolic activity on the tumor bed and metastatic sign. Conclusions: The diagnosis of the malignant oncocytic adrenal case is based on the histopathological criteria. Based on this case, we suggest a thorough histopathological examination to determine malignant criteria in adrenal neoplasm cases.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">7T MRI Differentiates Remyelinated from Demyelinated Multiple Sclerosis Lesions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To noninvasively assess myelin status in chronic white matter lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), we developed and evaluated a simple classification scheme based on T1 relaxation time maps derived from 7-tesla postmortem and in vivo MRI.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the MP2RAGE MRI sequence, we classified 36 lesions from 4 postmortem MS brains as “long-T1,” “short-T1,” and “mixed-T1” by visual comparison to neocortex. Within these groups, we compared T1 times to histologically derived measures of myelin and axons. We performed similar analysis of 235 chronic lesions with known date of onset in 25 MS cases in vivo and in a validation cohort of 222 lesions from 66 MS cases, investigating associations with clinical and radiological outcomes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Postmortem, lesions classified qualitatively as long-T1, short-T1, and mixed-T1 corresponded to fully demyelinated, fully remyelinated, and mixed demyelinated/remyelinated lesions, respectively (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). Demyelination (rather than axon loss) dominantly contributed to initial T1 prolongation. We observed lesions with similar characteristics in vivo, allowing manual classification with substantial interrater and excellent intrarater reliability. Short-T1 lesions were most common in the deep white matter, whereas long-T1 and mixed-T1 lesions were prevalent in the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and were much more likely to have paramagnetic rims suggesting chronic inflammation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Older age at the time of lesion formation portended less remyelination (<i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>7-tesla T1 mapping with MP2RAGE, a clinically available MRI method, allows qualitative and quantitative classification of chronic MS lesions according to myelin content, rendering straightforward the tracking of lesional myelination changes over time. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Resource Description Framework reification for trustworthiness in knowledge graphs [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge graph (KG) publishes machine-readable representation of knowledge on the Web. Structured data in the knowledge graph is published using Resource Description Framework (RDF) where knowledge is represented as a triple (subject, predicate, object). Due to the presence of erroneous, outdated or conflicting data in the knowledge graph, the quality of facts cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the provenance of knowledge can assist in building up the trust of these knowledge graphs. In this paper, we have provided an analysis of popular, general knowledge graphs Wikidata and YAGO4 with regard to the representation of provenance and context data. Since RDF does not support metadata for providing provenance and contextualization, an alternate method, RDF reification is employed by most of the knowledge graphs. Trustworthiness of facts in knowledge graph can be enhanced by the addition of metadata like the source of information, location and time of the fact occurrence. Wikidata employs qualifiers to include metadata to facts, while YAGO4 collects metadata from Wikidata qualifiers. RDF reification increases the magnitude of data as several statements are required to represent a single fact. However, facts in Wikidata and YAGO4 can be fetched without using reification. Another limitation for applications that uses provenance data is that not all facts in these knowledge graphs are annotated with provenance data. Structured data in the knowledge graph is noisy. Therefore, the reliability of data in knowledge graphs can be increased by provenance data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the method and the extent of the addition of metadata of two prominent KGs, Wikidata and YAGO4.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptualizing an inquiry-based lingua-cultural learning through telecollaborative exchanges [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, telecollaboration has been gaining popularity among scholars, teachers, and students engaged in foreign language education because it facilitates the use of Internet-mediated communication tools to connect language and culture learners in geographically distant locations. Telecollaboration, as currently viewed in academic and classroom settings, places greater emphasis on the development of learners’ intercultural communicative competence. The problem with this approach is that this process may not consider the possibility that learners engaged in online intercultural exchanges could have limited or no knowledge about certain aspects of their own lingua-culture. We argue that, for learners to effectively share lingua-cultural knowledge with their online peers abroad, there must be a framework that supports the construction of learners’ own intra-cultural knowledge to provide a solid foundation for intercultural learning and communication. In this paper, we develop an inquiry-based model of telecollaboration incorporating both inquiry and online exchange based on the inquiry cycle, which includes engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation. This paper builds a case for the application of inquiry-based telecollaboration in a real classroom environment, which could not only help learners obtain and eventually share more authentic, deeper knowledge about their lingua-culture, but also promote informed intercultural exchange.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sequence diversity and evolution of infectious bursal disease virus in Iraq [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) is a highly infectious disease which causes huge economic losses to the poultry industry due to the direct impact of the illness and indirect consequences such as decreasing the general immunity of the flock, leaving it naive to other diseases. In Iraq, IBD is highly prevalent despite vaccination programs, yet studies on sequence diversity of the causative virus are still rare.  Methods: A sample from Bursa of Fabricius from an IBD outbreak in a flock in the city of Najaf in Iraq was smeared on an FTA card. Amplicons of targeted regions in VP1 and VP2 genes were generated and sequenced. Sequences were then compared with other local and global sequences downloaded from GenBank repositories. Sequence alignment and DNA sequence analyses were achieved using MUSCLE, UGENE and MEGAx software. The molecular clock and sequence evolutionary analyses were applied using MEGAx tools.  Results: The strain sequenced in this study belongs to a very virulent Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (vvIBDV) as the DNA and phylogenetic analysis of VP1 and VP2 gene sequences showed a mutual clustering with similar sequences belonging to vvIBDV genogroup 3. Analyses of the hyper variable region of VP2 gene (hvVP2) of IBDV isolates from Iraq indicates a presence of sequence diversity. Interestingly, the two vaccine strains Ventri IBDV Plus and ABIC MB71 that showed the highest sequence similarity to the local isolates in the hvVP2 region are not used in vaccination routine against IBDV in Iraq.  Conclusion: Sequences of vvIBDV in Iraq are diverse. Remarkably, some of the available vaccine strains show high sequence similarity with local strains in Iraq; however, they are not included in the routine vaccination programs. Analysis of more samples involving more geographical regions is needed to draw a detailed map of antigenic diversity of IBDV in Iraq.

                Human accelerated regions (HARs) are the fastest-evolving regions of the human genome. By interrogating the in vitro enhancer activity and in vivo epigenetic landscapes of more than 3,100 HARs during human neurodevelopment, we demonstrate that nearly half of all HARs act as neurodevelopmental enhancers. Further, we demonstrate PPP1R17 to be a putative HAR-regulated gene likely involved in human-specific cortical neurodevelopment.

                Videos of animal behavior are used to quantify researcher-defined behaviors-of-interest to study neural function, gene mutations, and pharmacological therapies. Behaviors-of-interest are often scored manually, which is time-consuming, limited to few behaviors, and variable across researchers. We created DeepEthogram: software that uses supervised machine learning to convert raw video pixels into an ethogram, the behaviors-of-interest present in each video frame. DeepEthogram is designed to be general-purpose and applicable across species, behaviors, and video-recording hardware. It uses convolutional neural networks to compute motion, extract features from motion and images, and classify features into behaviors. Behaviors are classified with above 90% accuracy on single frames in videos of mice and flies, matching expert-level human performance. DeepEthogram accurately predicts rare behaviors, requires little training data, and generalizes across subjects. A graphical interface allows beginning-to-end analysis without end-user programming. DeepEthogram's rapid, automatic, and reproducible labeling of researcher-defined behaviors-of-interest may accelerate and enhance supervised behavior analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ascorbic acid supports ex vivo generation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells from circulating hematopoietic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) constitute a rare type of immune cell with multifaceted functions, but their potential use as a cell-based immunotherapy is challenged by the scarce cell numbers that can be extracted from blood. Here, we systematically investigate culture parameters for generating pDCs from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using optimized conditions combined with implementation of HSPC pre-expansion, we generate an average of 465 million HSPC-derived pDCs (HSPC-pDCs) starting from 100,000 cord blood-derived HSPCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such protocol allows HSPC-pDC generation from whole blood HSPCs, and these cells display a pDC phenotype and function. Using GMP compliant medium, we observe a remarkable loss of TLR7/9 responses, which is rescued by ascorbic acid supplementation. Ascorbic acid induces transcriptional signatures associated with pDC-specific innate immune pathways suggesting an undescribed role of ascorbic acid for pDC functionality. This constitutes the first protocol for generating pDCs from whole blood, and lay the foundation for investigating HSPC-pDCs for cell-based immunotherapy.

                Although different animal species often exhibit extensive variation in many behaviors, typically scientists examine one or a small number of behaviors in any single study. Here, we propose a new framework to simultaneously study the evolution of many behaviors. We measured the behavioral repertoire of individuals from six species of fruit flies using unsupervised techniques and identified all stereotyped movements exhibited by each species. We then fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to estimate the intra- and inter-species behavioral covariances, and, by using the known phylogenetic relationships among species, we estimated the (unobserved) behaviors exhibited by ancestral species. We found that much of intra-specific behavioral variation has a similar covariance structure to previously described long-time scale variation in an individual’s behavior, suggesting that much of the measured variation between individuals of a single species in our assay reflects differences in the status of neural networks, rather than genetic or developmental differences between individuals. We then propose a method to identify groups of behaviors that appear to have evolved in a correlated manner, illustrating how sets of behaviors, rather than individual behaviors, likely evolved. Our approach provides a new framework for identifying co-evolving behaviors and may provide new opportunities to study the mechanistic basis of behavioral evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq uncovers shared and distinct axes of variation in dorsal LGN neurons in mice, non-human primates, and humans</a></h4>

              
                Abundant evidence supports the presence of at least three distinct types of thalamocortical (TC) neurons in the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, the brain region that conveys visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). Different types of TC neurons in mice, humans, and macaques have distinct morphologies, distinct connectivity patterns, and convey different aspects of visual information to the cortex. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these cell types, and how these relate to differences in dLGN between human, macaque, and mice, we profiled gene expression in single nuclei and cells using RNA-sequencing. These efforts identified four distinct types of TC neurons in the primate dLGN: magnocellular (M) neurons, parvocellular (P) neurons, and two types of koniocellular (K) neurons. Despite extensively documented morphological and physiological differences between M and P neurons, we identified few genes with significant differential expression between transcriptomic cell types corresponding to these two neuronal populations. Likewise, the dominant feature of TC neurons of the adult mouse dLGN is high transcriptomic similarity, with an axis of heterogeneity that aligns with core vs. shell portions of mouse dLGN. Together, these data show that transcriptomic differences between principal cell types in the mature mammalian dLGN are subtle relative to the observed differences in morphology and cortical projection targets. Finally, alignment of transcriptome profiles across species highlights expanded diversity of GABAergic neurons in primate versus mouse dLGN and homologous types of TC neurons in primates that are distinct from TC neurons in mouse.

                Many spinal circuits dedicated to locomotor control have been identified in the developing zebrafish. How these circuits operate together to generate the various swimming movements during development remains to be clarified. In this study, we iteratively built models of developing zebrafish spinal circuits coupled to simplified musculoskeletal models that reproduce coiling and swimming movements. The neurons of the models were based upon morphologically or genetically identified populations in the developing zebrafish spinal cord. We simulated intact spinal circuits as well as circuits with silenced neurons or altered synaptic transmission to better understand the role of specific spinal neurons. Analysis of firing patterns and phase relationships helped identify possible mechanisms underlying the locomotor movements of developing zebrafish. Notably, our simulations demonstrated how the site and the operation of rhythm generation could transition between coiling and swimming. The simulations also underlined the importance of contralateral excitation to multiple tail beats. They allowed us to estimate the sensitivity of spinal locomotor networks to motor command amplitude, synaptic weights, length of ascending and descending axons, and firing behaviour. These models will serve as valuable tools to test and further understand the operation of spinal circuits for locomotion.

                Neural circuits carry out complex computations that allow animals to evaluate food, select mates, move toward attractive stimuli, and move away from threats. In insects, the subesophageal zone (SEZ) is a brain region that receives gustatory, pheromonal, and mechanosensory inputs and contributes to the control of diverse behaviors, including feeding, grooming, and locomotion. Despite its importance in sensorimotor transformations, the study of SEZ circuits has been hindered by limited knowledge of the underlying diversity of SEZ neurons. Here, we generate a collection of split-GAL4 lines that provides precise genetic targeting of 138 different SEZ cell types in adult <i>D. melanogaster</i>, comprising approximately one third of all SEZ neurons. We characterize the single cell anatomy of these neurons and find that they cluster by morphology into six supergroups that organize the SEZ into discrete anatomical domains. We find that the majority of local SEZ interneurons are not classically polarized, suggesting rich local processing, whereas SEZ projection neurons tend to be classically polarized, conveying information to a limited number of higher brain regions. This study provides insight into the anatomical organization of the SEZ and generates resources that will facilitate further study of SEZ neurons and their contributions to sensory processing and behavior.

                The histone modification H3K27me3 plays a central role in Polycomb-mediated epigenetic silencing. H3K27me3 recruits and allosterically activates Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which adds this modification to nearby histones, providing a read/write mechanism for inheritance through DNA replication. However, for some PRC2 targets, a purely histone-based system for epigenetic inheritance may be insufficient. We address this issue at the Polycomb target <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, as a narrow nucleation region of only ~three nucleosomes within <i>FLC</i> mediates epigenetic state switching and subsequent memory over many cell cycles. To explain the memory’s unexpected persistence, we introduce a mathematical model incorporating extra protein memory storage elements with positive feedback that persist at the locus through DNA replication, in addition to histone modifications. Our hybrid model explains many features of epigenetic switching/memory at <i>FLC</i> and encapsulates generic mechanisms that may be widely applicable.

                The chloroplast proteome contains thousands of different proteins that are encoded by the nuclear genome. These proteins are imported into the chloroplast via the action of the TOC translocase and associated downstream systems. Our recent work has revealed that the stability of the TOC complex is dynamically regulated by the ubiquitin-dependent chloroplast-associated protein degradation (CHLORAD) pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the TOC complex is also regulated by the SUMO system. <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutants representing almost the entire SUMO conjugation pathway can partially suppress the phenotype of <i>ppi1</i>, a pale-yellow mutant lacking the Toc33 protein. This suppression is linked to increased abundance of TOC proteins and improvements in chloroplast development. Moreover, data from molecular and biochemical experiments support a model in which the SUMO system directly regulates TOC protein stability. Thus, we have identified a regulatory link between the SUMO system and the chloroplast protein import machinery.

                Human running features a spring-like interaction of body and ground, enabled by elastic tendons that store mechanical energy and facilitate muscle operating conditions to minimize the metabolic cost. By experimentally assessing the operating conditions of two important muscles for running, the soleus and vastus lateralis, we investigated physiological mechanisms of muscle work production and muscle force generation. We found that the soleus continuously shortened throughout the stance phase, operating as work generator under conditions that are considered optimal for work production: high force-length potential and high enthalpy efficiency. The vastus lateralis promoted tendon energy storage and contracted nearly isometrically close to optimal length, resulting in a high force-length-velocity potential beneficial for economical force generation. The favorable operating conditions of both muscles were a result of an effective length and velocity-decoupling of fascicles and muscle-tendon unit, mostly due to tendon compliance and, in the soleus, marginally by fascicle rotation.

                Triple-drug therapies have transformed HIV from a fatal condition to a chronic one. These therapies should prevent HIV drug resistance evolution, because one or more drugs suppress any partially resistant viruses. In practice, such therapies drastically reduced, but did not eliminate, resistance evolution. In this article, we reanalyze published data from an evolutionary perspective and demonstrate several intriguing patterns about HIV resistance evolution - resistance evolves (1) even after years on successful therapy, (2) sequentially, often via one mutation at a time and (3) in a partially predictable order. We describe how these observations might emerge under two models of HIV drugs varying in space or time. Despite decades of work in this area, much opportunity remains to create models with realistic parameters for three drugs, and to match model outcomes to resistance rates and genetic patterns from individuals on triple-drug therapy. Further, lessons from HIV may inform other systems.

                Learning to be safe is central for adaptive behaviour when threats are no longer present. Detecting the absence of an expected threat is key for threat extinction learning and an essential process for the behavioural treatment of anxiety related disorders. One possible mechanism underlying extinction learning is a dopaminergic mismatch signal that encodes the absence of an expected threat. Here we show that such a dopamine-related pathway underlies extinction learning in humans. Dopaminergic enhancement via administration of L-DOPA (vs. Placebo) was associated with reduced retention of differential psychophysiological threat responses at later test, which was mediated by activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that was specific to extinction learning. L-DOPA administration enhanced signals at the time-point of an expected, but omitted threat in extinction learning within the nucleus accumbens, which were functionally coupled with the ventral tegmental area and the amygdala. Computational modelling of threat expectancies further revealed prediction error encoding in nucleus accumbens that was reduced when L-DOPA was administered. Our results thereby provide evidence that extinction learning is influenced by L-DOPA and provide a mechanistic perspective to augment extinction learning by dopaminergic enhancement in humans.

                Concussion is associated with a myriad of deleterious immediate and long-term consequences. Yet the molecular mechanisms and genetic targets promoting the selective vulnerability of different neural subtypes to dysfunction and degeneration remain unclear. Translating experimental models of blunt force trauma in <i>C. elegans</i> to concussion in mice, we identify a conserved neuroprotective mechanism in which reduction of mitochondrial electron flux through complex IV suppresses trauma-induced degeneration of the highly vulnerable dopaminergic neurons. Reducing cytochrome C oxidase function elevates mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, which signal through the cytosolic hypoxia inducing transcription factor, <i>Hif1a</i>, to promote hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDHE1α. This critical enzyme initiates the Warburg shunt, which drives energetic reallocation from mitochondrial respiration to astrocyte-mediated glycolysis in a neuroprotective manner. These studies demonstrate a conserved process in which glycolytic preconditioning suppresses Parkinson-like hypersensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to trauma-induced degeneration via redox signaling and the Warburg effect.

                Tissue-resident intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes (T-IEL) patrol the gut and have important roles in regulating intestinal homeostasis. T-IEL include both induced T-IEL, derived from systemic antigen-experienced lymphocytes, and natural IEL, which are developmentally targeted to the intestine. While the processes driving T-IEL development have been elucidated, the precise roles of the different subsets and the processes driving activation and regulation of these cells remain unclear. To gain functional insights into these enigmatic cells, we used high-resolution, quantitative mass spectrometry to compare the proteomes of induced T-IEL and natural T-IEL subsets, with naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from lymph nodes. This data exposes the dominant effect of the gut environment over ontogeny on T-IEL phenotypes. Analyses of protein copy numbers of &gt;7000 proteins in T-IEL reveal skewing of the cell surface repertoire towards epithelial interactions and checkpoint receptors; strong suppression of the metabolic machinery indicating a high energy barrier to functional activation; upregulated cholesterol and lipid metabolic pathways, leading to high cholesterol levels in T-IEL; suppression of T cell antigen receptor signalling and expression of the transcription factor TOX, reminiscent of chronically activated T cells. These novel findings illustrate how T-IEL integrate multiple tissue-specific signals to maintain their homeostasis and potentially function.

                    structural and functional connectivity, serving as the model input, from MRI
                    data influence modeling results. Here, we study the influence from one major
                    element: the brain parcellation scheme that reduces the dimensionality of brain
                    networks by grouping thousands of voxels into a few hundred brain regions. We
                    show graph-theoretical statistics derived from the empirical data and modeling
                    results exhibiting a high heterogeneity across parcellations. Furthermore, the
                    network properties of empirical brain connectomes explain the lion’s
                    share of the variance in the modeling results with respect to the parcellation
                    variation. Such a clear-cut relationship is not observed at the subject-resolved
                    level per parcellation. Finally, the graph-theoretical statistics of the
                    simulated connectome correlate with those of the empirical functional
                    connectivity across parcellations. However, this relation is not one-to-one, and
                    its precision can vary between models. Our results imply that network properties
                    of both empirical connectomes can explain the goodness-of-fit of whole-brain
                    models to empirical data at a global group level but not at a single-subject
                    level, which provides further insights into the personalization of whole-brain
                    models.</span>

                    transcranial neurostimulation predict metamemory sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Metamemory involves the ability to correctly judge the accuracy of our memories.
                    The retrieval of memories can be improved using transcranial electrical
                    stimulation (tES) during sleep, but evidence for improvements to metamemory
                    sensitivity is limited. Applying tES can enhance sleep-dependent memory
                    consolidation, which along with metamemory requires the coordination of activity
                    across distributed neural systems, suggesting that examining functional
                    connectivity is important for understanding these processes. Nevertheless,
                    little research has examined how functional connectivity modulations relate to
                    overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. Here, we developed a closed-loop
                    short-duration tES method, time-locked to up-states of ongoing slow-wave
                    oscillations, to cue specific memory replays in humans. We measured
                    electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence changes following stimulation pulses,
                    and characterized network alterations with graph theoretic metrics. Using
                    machine learning techniques, we show that pulsed tES elicited network changes in
                    multiple frequency bands, including increased connectivity in the theta band and
                    increased efficiency in the spindle band. Additionally, stimulation-induced
                    changes in beta-band path length were predictive of overnight changes in
                    metamemory sensitivity. These findings add new insights into the growing
                    literature investigating increases in memory performance through brain
                    stimulation during sleep, and highlight the importance of examining functional
                    connectivity to explain its effects.</span>

                    called connectome, whose nodes correspond to parcels from a predefined brain
                    atlas. The edges of the graph encode the strength of the axonal connectivity
                    between regions of the atlas that can be estimated via diffusion magnetic
                    resonance imaging (MRI) tractography. Herein, we aim to provide a novel
                    perspective on the problem of choosing a suitable atlas for structural
                    connectivity studies by assessing how robustly an atlas captures the network
                    topology across different subjects in a homogeneous cohort. We measure this
                    robustness by assessing the alignability of the connectomes, namely the
                    possibility to retrieve graph matchings that provide highly similar graphs. We
                    introduce two novel concepts. First, the graph Jaccard index (GJI), a graph
                    similarity measure based on the well-established Jaccard index between sets; the
                    GJI exhibits natural mathematical properties that are not satisfied by previous
                    approaches. Second, we devise WL-align, a new technique for aligning connectomes
                    obtained by adapting the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph-isomorphism test. We
                    validated the GJI and WL-align on data from the Human Connectome Project
                    database, inferring a strategy for choosing a suitable parcellation for
                    structural connectivity studies. Code and data are publicly available.</span>

                    magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) studies. However, most SCNs have been
                    constructed by a unitary marker that is insensitive for discriminating different
                    disease phases. The aim of this study was to devise a novel regional radiomics
                    similarity network (R2SN) that could provide more comprehensive information in
                    morphological network analysis. R2SNs were constructed by computing the Pearson
                    correlations between the radiomics features extracted from any pair of regions
                    for each subject (AAL atlas). We further assessed the small-world property of
                    R2SNs, and we evaluated the reproducibility in different datasets and through
                    test-retest analysis. The relationships between the R2SNs and general

                    (intraclass correlation coefficient &gt; 0.7). In addition, the small-word

                    activity with local excitatory–inhibitory balance in neuronal
                    populations. However, how underlying neurotransmitter kinetics associated with
                    E–I balance govern resting-state spontaneous brain dynamics remains
                    unknown. Understanding the mechanisms by virtue of which fluctuations in
                    neurotransmitter concentrations, a hallmark of a variety of clinical conditions,
                    relate to functional brain activity is of critical importance. We propose a
                    multiscale dynamic mean field (MDMF) model—a system of coupled
                    differential equations for capturing the synaptic gating dynamics in excitatory
                    and inhibitory neural populations as a function of neurotransmitter kinetics.
                    Individual brain regions are modeled as population of MDMF and are connected by
                    realistic connection topologies estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data.
                    First, MDMF successfully predicts resting-state functional connectivity. Second,
                    our results show that optimal range of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter
                    concentrations subserve as the dynamic working point of the brain, that is, the

                    blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals. Third, for predictive validity the network

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We propose that the application of network theory to established psychological
                    personality conceptions has great potential to advance a biologically plausible
                    model of human personality. Stable behavioral tendencies are conceived as
                    personality “traits.” Such traits demonstrate considerable
                    variability between individuals, and extreme expressions represent risk factors
                    for psychological disorders. Although the psychometric assessment of personality
                    has more than hundred years tradition, it is not yet clear whether traits indeed
                    represent “biophysical entities” with specific and dissociable
                    neural substrates. For instance, it is an open question whether there exists a

                    personality factors and the organizational properties of traitlike brain

                    this article will point out how network neuroscience can enhance our
                    understanding about human personality. We will examine the importance of

                    from each discipline itself and their combination are discussed and potential
                    solutions are developed. We close by outlining future trends and by discussing

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This work presents a novel strategy for classifying neurons, represented by nodes
                    of a directed graph, based on their circuitry (edge connectivity). We assume a
                    stochastic block model (SBM) in which neurons belong together if they connect to
                    neurons of other groups according to the same probability distributions.
                    Following adjacency spectral embedding of the SBM graph, we derive the number of
                    classes and assign each neuron to a class with a Gaussian mixture model-based
                    expectation maximization (EM) clustering algorithm. To improve accuracy, we
                    introduce a simple variation using random hierarchical agglomerative clustering
                    to initialize the EM algorithm and picking the best solution over multiple EM
                    restarts. We test this procedure on a large
                        (≈2<sup>12</sup>–2<sup>15</sup> neurons), sparse, biologically
                    inspired connectome with eight neuron classes. The simulation results
                    demonstrate that the proposed approach is broadly stable to the choice of
                    embedding dimension, and scales extremely well as the number of neurons in the
                    network increases. Clustering accuracy is robust to variations in model
                    parameters and highly tolerant to simulated experimental noise, achieving
                    perfect classifications with up to 40% of swapped edges. Thus, this
                    approach may be useful to analyze and interpret large-scale brain connectomics
                    data in terms of underlying cellular components.</span>

                    breadth based on brain functional networks</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The quantification of human brain functional (re)configurations across varying
                    cognitive demands remains an unresolved topic. We propose that such functional
                    configurations may be categorized into three different types: (a) network
                    configural breadth, (b) task-to task transitional reconfiguration, and (c)
                    within-task reconfiguration. Such functional reconfigurations are rather subtle
                    at the whole-brain level. Hence, we propose a mesoscopic framework focused on
                    functional networks (FNs) or communities to quantify functional
                    (re)configurations. To do so, we introduce a 2D network morphospace that relies
                    on two novel mesoscopic metrics, trapping efficiency (TE) and exit entropy (EE),
                    which capture topology and integration of information within and between a
                    reference set of FNs. We use this framework to quantify the network configural
                    breadth across different tasks. We show that the metrics defining this
                    morphospace can differentiate FNs, cognitive tasks, and subjects. We also show
                    that network configural breadth significantly predicts behavioral measures, such
                    as episodic memory, verbal episodic memory, fluid intelligence, and general
                    intelligence. In essence, we put forth a framework to explore the cognitive
                    space in a comprehensive manner, for each individual separately, and at
                    different levels of granularity. This tool that can also quantify the FN

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elucidating the neural mechanisms of Learning-to-Learn</a></h4>

              
                Learning-to-learn, a progressive acceleration of learning while solving a series of similar problems, represents a core process of knowledge acquisition that draws attention in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. To investigate its underlying brain mechanism, we trained a recurrent neural network model on arbitrary sensorimotor mappings. The network displayed an exponential speedup in learning. The neural substrate of a schema emerges within a low-dimensional subspace of population activity. Its reuse in new problems facilitates learning by limiting connection weight changes. Since the population trajectory of a recurrent network produces behavior, learning is determined by the vector field changes. We propose a novel analysis of weight-driven vector field changes, which showed that novel stimuli in new problems can distort the schema representation. Weight changes eliminate such distortions and improve the invariance of the reused representations in future learning. The accumulation of such weight changes across problems underlies the learning-to-learn dynamics.

                APOE variants present the strongest association with sporadic Alzheimers Disease. APOE is also highly expressed during neurodevelopment in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and has been shown to be neuroprotective in infancy and gestation. We explored other lipid metabolism genes to determine whether they show a similar neurodevelopmental expression trajectory and are associated with neurodegeneration. APOE was by far the most highly expressed of the lipid metabolism genes in the CNS. Two other genes, Apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1) Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase (GLUL, also known as glutamine synthetase), co-clustered with Apolipoprotein E (APOE) in its developmental trajectory in late gestation through early childhood. These three genes highlight brain structures and developmental time-windows distinct from other lipid metabolism genes. In the CNS they are primarily expressed in astrocytes and are implicated in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration.

                Since speech is a continuous stream with no systematic boundaries between words, how do pre-verbal infants manage to discover words? A proposed solution is that they might use the transitional probability between adjacent syllables, which drops at word boundaries. Here, we tested the limits of this mechanism by increasing the size of the word-unit to 4 syllables, and its automaticity by testing asleep neonates. Using markers of statistical learning in neonates' EEG, compared to adult' behavioral performances in the same task, we confirmed that statistical learning is automatic enough to be efficient even in sleeping neonates. But we also revealed that : 1) Successfully tracking transition probabilities in a sequence is not sufficient to segment it 2) Prosodic cues, as subtle as subliminal pauses, enable to recover segmenting capacities 3) Adults' and neonates' capacities are remarkably similar despite the difference of maturation and expertise. Finally, we observed that learning increased the similarity of neural responses across infants, providing a new neural marker to monitor learning. Thus, from birth, infants are equipped with adult-like tools, allowing to extract small coherent word-like units within auditory streams, based on the combination of statistical analyses and prosodic cues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diffusion MRI Anisotropy in the Cerebral Cortex is Determined by Unmyelinated Tissue Features</a></h4>

              
                The diffusion of water molecules through the brain is constrained by tissue and cellular substructure, which imposes an anisotropy that can be measured through diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). In the white matter, myelinated axons strongly shape diffusion anisotropy; however, in gray matter the determinants of dMRI signals remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the histological tissue properties underlying dMRI anisotropy and diffusivity in the cerebral cortex of the marmoset monkey. We acquired whole brain ex vivo dMRI data designed for high signal-to-noise at ultra-high (150m) resolution. We compared the MRI to myelin- and Nissl-stained histological sections obtained from the scanned brain. We found that dMRI anisotropy corresponds most strongly not with cortical myelin content, but rather with the microscale anisotropy of tissue features, most notably those unmyelinated features highlighted by Nissl staining. The results suggest that dMRI anisotropy in gray matter derives from the organization of unmyelinated neurites, which are known to be affected by neurodegenerative diseases.

                Model-based data analysis of whole-brain dynamics links the observed data to model parameters in a network of neural masses. In recent years a special focus was placed on the role of regional variance of model parameters for the emergent activity. Such analyses however depend on the properties of the employed neural mass model, which is often obtained through a series of major simplifications or analogies. Here we propose a data-driven approach where the neural mass model needs not to be specified. Building on the recent progresses in identification of dynamical systems with neural networks, we propose a method to infer from the functional data both the neural mass model representing the regional dynamics as well as the region- and subject-specific parameters, while respecting the known network structure. We demonstrate on two synthetic data sets that our method is able to recover the original model parameters, and that the trained generative model produces dynamics resembling the training data both on the regional level and on the whole-brain level. The present approach opens a novel way to the analysis of resting-state fMRI with possible applications in understanding the changes of whole-brain dynamics during aging or in neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signal neutrality, scalar property, and collapsing boundaries as consequences of a learned multi-time scale strategy</a></h4>

              
                Experiments and models in perceptual decision-making point to a key role of an integration process that accumulates sensory evidence over time. We endow a probabilistic agent comprising several such integrators with widely spread time scales and let it learn, by trial-and-error, to weight the different filtered versions of a noisy signal. The agent discovers a strategy markedly different from the literature "standard", according to which a decision made when the accumulated evidence hits a predetermined threshold. The agent instead decides during fleeting windows corresponding to the alignment of many integrators, akin to a majority vote. This strategy presents three distinguishing signatures. 1) Signal neutrality: a marked insensitivity to the signal coherence in the interval preceding the decision, as also observed in experiments. 2) Scalar property: the mean of the response times varies glaringly for different signal coherences, yet the shape of the distribution stays largely unchanged. 3) Collapsing boundaries: the agent learns to behave as if subject to a non-monotonic urgency signal, reminiscent in shape of the theoretically optimal. These three characteristics, which emerge from the interaction of a multi-scale learning agent with a highly volatile environment, are hallmarks, we argue, of an optimal decision strategy in challenging situations. As such, the present results may shed light on general information-processing principles leveraged by the brain itself.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glass Half Full: Preserved Anatomical Bypasses Predict Variance in Language Functions After Stroke</a></h4>

              
                The severity of post-stroke aphasia is related to damage to white matter connections. However, neural signaling can route not only through direct connections, but also along multi-step network paths. When brain networks are damaged by stroke, paths can bypass around the damage to restore communication. The shortest network paths between regions could be the most efficient routes for mediating bypasses. We examined how shortest-path bypasses after left hemisphere strokes were related to language performance. Regions within and outside of the canonical language network could be important in aphasia recovery. Therefore, we innovated methods to measure the influence of bypasses in the whole brain. Distinguishing bypasses from all residual shortest paths is difficult without pre-stroke imaging. We identified bypasses by finding shortest paths in subjects with stroke that were longer than those observed in the average network of the most reliably observed connections in age-matched controls. We tested whether features of those bypasses predicted scores in four orthogonal dimensions of language performance derived from a factor analysis of a battery of language tasks. The features were the length of each bypass in steps, and how many bypasses overlapped on each individual direct connection. We related these bypass features to language factors using grid-search cross-validated Support Vector Regression, a technique that extracts robust relationships in high-dimensional data analysis. We discovered that the length of bypasses reliably predicted variance in lexical production (R2 = .576) and auditory comprehension scores (R2 = .164). Bypass overlaps reliably predicted variance in Lexical Production scores (R2 = .247). The predictive elongation features revealed that bypass efficiency along the dorsal stream and ventral stream were most related to Lexical Production and Auditory Comprehension, respectively. Among the predictive bypass overlaps, increased bypass routing through the right hemisphere putamen was negatively related to lexical production ability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Real-time visualization of mRNA synthesis during memory formation in live animals</a></h4>

              
                Memories are thought to be encoded in populations of neurons called memory trace or engram cells. However, little is known about the dynamics of these cells because of the difficulty in real-time monitoring of them over long periods of time in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we present a genetically-encoded RNA indicator (GERI) mouse for intravital chronic imaging of endogenous Arc mRNA - a popular marker for memory trace cells. We used our GERI to identify Arc-positive neurons in real time without the delay associated with reporter protein expression in conventional approaches. We found that the Arc-positive neuronal populations rapidly turned over within two days in the hippocampal CA1 region, whereas ~4% of neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) consistently expressed Arc following contextual fear conditioning and repeated memory retrievals. Dual imaging of GERI and a calcium indicator in CA1 of mice navigating a virtual reality environment revealed that only the population of neurons expressing Arc during both encoding and retrieval exhibited relatively high calcium activity in a context-specific manner. This in vivo RNA imaging approach opens the possibility of unraveling the dynamics of the neuronal population underlying various learning and memory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prolonged tonic pain in healthy humans enhances functional connectivity of descending pain modulation networks involving the amygdala, periaqueductal gray and parabrachial nucleus to cortical sensory-discriminative areas</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Resting state functional connectivity (FC) is widely used to assess functional brain alterations in patients with chronic pain. However, reports of FC changes accompanying tonic pain in pain-free persons is rare. A brain network disrupted during chronic pain is a network we term the Descending Pain Modulatory Network (DPMN). Here, we evaluate the effect of tonic pain on FC of this network: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala (AMYG), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and parabrachial nuclei (PBN). Methods: In 50 pain-free participants (30F), we induced tonic pain using a capsaicin-heat pain model. We used functional MRI to measure resting BOLD signal during pain-free rest where participants experienced warmth and tonic pain where participants experienced the same temperature thermode combined with capsaicin. We evaluated FC from ACC, AMYG, PAG, and PBN with correlation of self-report pain intensity with FC during both states. We hypothesized tonic pain would disrupt FC dyads within the DPMN. We used partial correlation to determine FC correlated with pain intensity and BOLD signal. Results: Of hypothesized FC dyads, PAG and subgenual ACC was weakly disrupted during tonic pain (F=3.34; p=0.074; pain-free>pain d=0.25). sgACC-PAG FC became positively related to pain intensity (R=0.38; t=2.81; p=0.007). Right PBN-PAG FC during pain-free rest positively correlated with subsequently experienced pain (R=0.44; t=3.43; p=0.001). During tonic pain, FC of this connection was abolished (paired t=-3.17; p=0.0026). During pain-free rest, FC between left AMYG and right superior parietal lobule and caudate nucleus were positively correlated with subsequent pain. During tonic pain, FC between left AMYG and right inferior temporal and superior frontal gyri negatively correlated with pain. Subsequent pain positively correlated with right AMYG FC and right claustrum; left and right primary visual cortex; right middle temporal gyrus and right temporo-occipitoparietal junction. Finally, subsequent pain positively correlated with PAG FC and left cerebellum, left dorsolateral prefrontal, right posterior cingulate cortex and paracentral lobule, inferior parietal lobule, medial precuneus and PBN. Conclusion: We demonstrate 1) tonic pain weakly disrupts of sgACC-PAG FC; 2) sgACC-PAG tonic pain FC positively correlates with pain; 3) right PBN-PAG FC predicts subsequent pain and is abolished during tonic pain. Finally, we reveal PAG- and right AMYG-anchored networks which predict intensity of tonic pain. Our findings suggest specific connectivity patterns within the DPMN at rest predict experienced pain and are modulated by tonic pain. These nodes and their functional modulation may reveal new therapeutic targets for neuromodulation and biomarkers to guide interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optical and computational dissection of emergent prefrontal rewiring to encode fear memory</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex regulates various emotional behaviors and memories, and prefrontal dysfunction can trigger psychiatric disorders. While untangling the internal network may provide clues to the neural architecture underlying such disorders, it is technically difficult due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the network. Here we propose an optical and computational dissection of the internal prefrontal network based on chronic two-photon imaging and a sparse modeling algorithm, which enabled the discrimination of newly emerged neuronal ensembles specifically encoding conditioned fear responses. Further graphical modeling revealed that neurons responding to the unconditioned stimulus during fear conditioning became a core of the ensembles with an enhanced capability for pattern completion, demonstrating the activity dependent rewiring upon the associative learning.
