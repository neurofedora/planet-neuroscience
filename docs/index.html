              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connecting Covert Attention and Visual Perception to the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Alpha Band Activity, Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC), and Functional Connectivity using Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA)</a></h4>

              
                Some evidence suggests that alpha activity is directly related to the baseline firing rate of sensory neurons which alters the probability of responding to a stimulus. Other evidence points to alpha indirectly modulating cortical excitability through its interactions with gamma oscillations. A third possibility is that alpha-based functional connectivity better explains attentional modulation and perceptual responses. To test this, alpha amplitude, CFC, and functional connectivity measures were extracted from EEG data recorded while participants performed a cued orientation perception task. Using pre-target data, the spatiotemporal activity of each metric was submitted to a SVM classifier to determine which activity pattern best distinguished trials with covert attention from trials without. The same metrics were submitted to SVR to find the activity that best predicted task performance. Results indicate the best metric for classifying trials with and without covert attention was alpha amplitude. This indicates that, prior to target onset, alpha amplitude alone is most sensitive to the presence of covert attention. In contrast, none of the metrics were strong predictors of task performance. Overall, our results support the idea that alpha activity is directly related to changes in the baseline firing rate of sensory neurons which changes responsiveness but not performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peripheral ghrelin administration prevents the behavioral effects of restraint stress in mice: possible implication of PVNCRH neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Ghrelin is a gut-derived hormone secreted during conditions of negative caloric balance. It acts as a critical modulator of feeding, increasing food intake and affecting several physiological systems such as metabolism, behavior, and the control of endocrine and autonomic functions. Previous studies showed that ghrelin participates in the stress response, acting on hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PVNCRH neurons). In the present study, we investigated the effects of ghrelin administration on the behavioral responses to restraint stress in mice. In their homecage, C57Bl6 mice in basal conditions expressed the behaviors of surveying, walking, rearing, grooming, and, to a lesser extent, digging, climbing, and freezing. Restraint stress increased the time spent in grooming without significant changes in other behaviors. Ghrelin administration did not affect behavior in control mice, but it reversed the effect of restraint stress on grooming. Chemogenetic activation of PVNCRH neurons by clozapine N-Oxide (CNO) administration in hM3Dq DREADD mice increased grooming, while ghrelin mitigated this effect. In addition, CNO administration decreased walking and rearing, both in the presence or absence of ghrelin. Food intake was increased by ghrelin administration, however, it was not affected by stress or CNO. These results indicate that ghrelin decreases the activity of PVNCRH neurons, partially preventing the behavioral effects of restraint stress. The inhibitory input to PVNCRH neurons probably arrives from other nuclei, since GABAergic neurons were not identified in the PVN neurons of these mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing social: A neural signature for conscious perception of social interactions</a></h4>

              
                Percepts of ambiguous information are subjective and depend on observers' traits and mental states. Social information is some of the most ambiguous content we encounter in our daily lives, yet in experimental contexts, percepts of social interactions-i.e., whether an interaction is present and if so, the nature of that interaction-are often dichotomized as correct or incorrect based on experimenter-assigned labels. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of conscious social perception using a large dataset in which neurotypical individuals viewed animations of geometric shapes during fMRI and indicated whether they perceived a social interaction or random motion. Critically, rather than experimenter-assigned labels, we used observers' own reports of "Social" or "Non-social" to classify percepts and characterize brain activity, including leveraging a particularly ambiguous animation perceived as "Social" by some observers but "Non-social" by others to control for visual input. Observers were biased toward perceiving information as social (versus non-social), and activity across much of the brain was higher during animations ultimately perceived as social. Using "Unsure" reports, we identified several regions that responded parametrically to perceived socialness. Neural responses to social versus nonsocial content diverged early both in time and in the cortical hierarchy. Lastly, individuals with higher internalizing trait scores showed both a higher response bias towards social and an inverse relationship with activity in default-mode and limbic regions while scanning for social information. Findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of using observer reports to study percepts of social interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The encoding of touch by somatotopically aligned dorsal column subdivisions</a></h4>

              
                The somatosensory system decodes a range of tactile stimuli to generate a coherent sense of touch. Discriminative touch of the body depends on signals conveyed from peripheral mechanoreceptors to the brain via the spinal cord dorsal column and its brainstem target the dorsal column nuclei (DCN). Models of somatosensation emphasize that fast-conducting low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) innervating the skin drive the DCN. However, post-synaptic dorsal column neurons (PSDCs) within the spinal cord dorsal horn also collect mechanoreceptor signals and form a second major input to the DCN. The significance of PSDCs and their contributions to the coding of touch have remained unclear since their discovery. Here, we show that direct LTMR inputs to the DCN convey vibrotactile stimuli with high temporal precision, whereas PSDCs primarily encode touch onset and the intensity of sustained contact into the high force range. LTMR and PSDC signals topographically re-align in the DCN to preserve precise spatial detail. Different DCN neuron subtypes have specialized responses that are generated by unique combinations of LTMR and PSDC inputs. Thus, signals encoding different tactile features are conveyed by subdivisions of the dorsal column pathway and differentially converge in the DCN to generate unique ascending signals suited to distinct sensory processing streams.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A developmental pathway for epithelial-to-motoneuron transformation in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Motoneurons and motoneuron-like pancreatic beta cells arise from radial glia and ductal cells, both tube-lining progenitors that share molecular regulators. To uncover programs underlying motoneuron formation, we studied a similar, cell-division-independent transformation of the C. elegans tube-lining Y cell into the PDA motoneuron. We find that lin-12/Notch acts through ngn-1/Ngn and its regulator hlh-16/Olig to control transformation timing. lin-12 loss blocks transformation, while lin-12(gf) promotes precocious PDA formation. Early basal expression of both ngn-1/Ngn and hlh-16/Olig depends on sem-4/Sall and egl-5/Hox. Later, coincident with Y-cell morphological changes, ngn-1/Ngn expression is upregulated in a sem-4/Sall and egl-5/Hox-dependent but hlh-16/Olig-independent manner. Subsequently, Y-cell retrograde extension forms an anchored process priming PDA axon extension. Extension requires ngn-1-dependent expression of the cytoskeleton organizers UNC-119, UNC-44/ANK, and UNC-33/CRMP, which also, unexpectedly, activate PDA terminal-gene expression. Our findings reveal key cell-division-independent regulatory events leading to motoneuron generation, suggesting a conserved pathway for epithelial-to-motoneuron/motoneuron-like differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of place cell remapping by scopolamine during aversive learning</a></h4>

              
                We performed in-vivo calcium imaging of hippocampal place cells in freely behaving rats (n=14) to investigate whether the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist scopolamine, which is known to impair aversive learning, also disrupts place cell remapping that occurs during such learning. CA1 neurons were imaged using a large-field-of view version of the UCLA miniscope (MiniLFOV) while rats performed a shock avoidance task on a rectangular maze. Drug-free avoidance training and extinction caused place cells to remap near the shocked location, in accordance with prior studies. Systemic pre-training injections of scopolamine (1 mg/kg) did not impair immediate shock avoidance, and also did not disrupt spatial tuning properties or shock-evoked responses of place cells during training. However, the drug impaired 48 h retention of avoidance and also prevented place cells from remapping near the shocked location. In addition, when rats navigated the maze on scopolamine, CA1 population vectors showed degraded between-session similarity with drug-free maze visits on prior days, suggesting that mAChR antagonism acutely degraded the fidelity with which stored hippocampal representations were retrieved. Based upon these results, we propose that scopolamine causes amnesia by degrading the dynamics of hippocampal memory retrieval at the population level, thereby shielding stored memory representations from being modified by experience to encode new memories of events that occur under the influence of the drug.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Dynamics of Interoceptive Attention and Awareness: A Within-Participant fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the representation of the body's internal state, serves as a foundation for emotion, motivation, and wellbeing. Yet despite its centrality in human experience, the neural mechanisms of interoception are poorly understood. The Interoceptive/Exteroceptive Attention Task (IEAT) is a novel neuroimaging paradigm that compares behavioral tracking of the respiratory cycle (Active Interoception) to tracking of a visual stimulus (Active Exteroception). Twenty-two healthy participants attended two separate scanning sessions (N=44 scans) during a randomized control trial of Mindful Awareness in Body-oriented Therapy (MABT). Compared to Active Exteroception, Active Interoception led to widespread cortical deactivation. Greater self-reported interoceptive awareness (MAIA scale) predicted sparing from deactivation along the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left lateral prefrontal cortex. The right insula- typically described as a primary interoceptive cortex- was only specifically implicated by its deactivation during a paced respiration condition (Active Matching), relative to both Active Exteroception and Interoception. Instead, psychophysiological interaction analysis characterized Active Interoception as promoting greater ACC connectivity with lateral frontal and parietal regions commonly referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network. By comparing attention between highly accessible interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli, these findings recast interoceptive attention as broadly inhibitory, linking greater interoceptive awareness to spared cortical inhibition within well-characterized attentional networks. In contrast to a literature that relates detection of liminal signals such as the heartbeat to anterior insula activity, attention towards accessible body sensations such as the breath may lead to a context of cortical inhibition in which sensory signals from the body may be better discerned.

                In this study, we used an oddball EEG bicycle paradigm to study how changes in urban environments elicit changes in EEG markers. Participants completed an auditory oddball task while riding in three different cycling lane environments. A low traffic condition where participants rode in a fully separated bike lane alongside a quiet residential street, an intermediate traffic condition where participants rode alongside a busy residential street in a painted lane, and a heavy traffic condition where participants rode alongside fast/heavy traffic on a shared-use path. Relative to the low traffic, heavy traffic was associated with faster reaction time and a trend towards reduced accuracy, and increased N1 amplitude evoked by the standard tones. We attribute this difference in N1 amplitude to different attentional demands evoked by the different traffic conditions. In this fashion, heavy traffic requires greater auditory filtering. Furthermore, we found no differences in P3 amplitude associated with the traffic conditions. We discuss the implications of mobile paradigms to study attention in real-world settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transmembrane protein 184B (TMEM184B) promotes expression of synaptic gene networks in the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimers Disease (AD) and other dementias, hippocampal synaptic dysfunction and loss contribute to the progression of memory impairment. Recent analysis of human AD transcriptomes has provided a list of gene candidates that may serve as drivers of disease. One such candidate is the membrane protein TMEM184B. To evaluate whether TMEM184B contributes to neurological impairment, we asked whether loss of TMEM184B in mice causes gene expression or behavior alterations, focusing on the hippocampus. Because one major risk factor for AD is age, we compared young adult (5-month-old) and aged (15-month-old) wild type and Tmem184b-mutant mice to assess the dual contributions of age and genotype. TMEM184B loss altered expression of pre- and post-synaptic transcripts by 5 months and continued through 15 months, specifically affecting genes involved in synapse assembly and neural development. Wnt-activated enhancer elements were enriched among differentially expressed genes, suggesting an intersection with this pathway. Few differences existed between young adult and aged mutants, suggesting that transcriptional effects of TMEM184B loss are relatively constant. To understand how TMEM184B disruption may impact behaviors, we evaluated memory using the novel object recognition test and anxiety using the elevated plus maze. Young adult Tmem184b-mutant mice show normal object discrimination, suggesting a lack of memory impairment at this age. However, mutant mice showed decreased anxiety, a phenotype seen in neurodevelopmental disorders. Taken together, our data suggest that TMEM184B is required for proper synaptic gene expression and function but may not be causal for AD and related dementias.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ADAM10 pharmacological inhibition modifies the expression of components of the dopaminergic system</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is a primary neurotransmitter associated with memory formation, emotional control, reward processing and other higher order mental functions. Altered dopamine signaling is implied in several neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease. Age-related memory decline often presents itself with spectrum of overtly behavioral responses in patients diagnosed with Alzheimers disease, thus suggesting that an alteration of dopaminergic transmission could account for the psychotic symptoms observed along the pathology. Since less sAPP production due to reduced -secretase activity is a direct contributor of compromised neuroprotection and can impart higher vulnerability to cellular insults, we explored the impact of specific inhibition of ADAM10, the main neuronal -secretase, on dopamine system components in cultured human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We found that dopamine receptor D4 protein levels were dose-dependently down regulated by GI254023X, but not by the ADAM17-specific inhibitor TAPI-0. We then established that GI254023X operates at a transcriptional levels. Furthermore, we showed that GI254023X treatment also significantly increased the levels of active PKA as well as the transcription of the dopamine-degrading enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase, monoamine oxidase A and monoamine oxidase B. Altogether, our data propose that ADAM10 inhibition modulates the dopaminergic system to possibly trigger psychosis in Alzheimers disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DLPFC-tDCS unable to modulate mind-wandering propensity nor underlying functional or effective brain connectivity.</a></h4>

              
                There is conflicting evidence over the ability to modulate mind-wandering propensity with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC-tDCS). Here, 20 participants received 20-minutes of anodal and sham DLPFC-tDCS while in the MRI scanner, in two separate sessions (counterbalanced). In each session, they completed two runs of a sustained attention to response task (before and during tDCS), which included probes recording subjective responses of mind-wandering. We assessed the effects of tDCS on behavioural responses as well as functional and effective dynamics, via dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) and dynamic causal modelling analyses over regions of the default mode, salience and executive control networks. Behavioural results provided substantial evidence in support of no effect of tDCS on task performance nor mind-wandering propensity. Similarly, we found no effect of tDCS on frequency (how often) or dwell time (time spent) of underlying brain states nor effective connectivity. Overall, our results suggest that DLPFC-tDCS is unable to modulate mind-wandering propensity or influence underlying brain function. This expands previous behavioural replication failures in suggesting that DLPFC-tDCS may not lead to even subtle (i.e., under a behavioural threshold) changes in brain activity during self-generated cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 limits dopamine D1 receptor signaling in the striatum and biases against heavy persistent alcohol drinking</a></h4>

              
                The transition from hedonic alcohol drinking to problematic drinking is a hallmark of alcohol use disorder that occurs only in a subset of drinkers. This transition is known to require long-lasting changes in the synaptic drive and the activity of striatal neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptor (D1R). The molecular mechanisms that generate vulnerability in some individuals to undergo the transition are less understood. Here, we report that the Parkinson's-related protein leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) modulates striatal D1R function to affect the behavioral response to alcohol and the likelihood that mice transition to heavy, persistent alcohol drinking. Deletion of the Lrrk2 gene specifically from D1R-expressing neurons potentiates D1R signaling at the cellular and synaptic level, enhancing alcohol-related behaviors and drinking. Mice with cell-specific deletion of Lrrk2 are more prone to heavy alcohol drinking and consumption is insensitive to punishment. These findings identify a novel role for LRRK2 function in the striatum in promoting resilience against heavy and persistent alcohol drinking.

	<p>Our brain continuously interacts with the body as we engage with the world. Although we are mostly unaware of internal bodily processes, such as our heartbeats, they may be influenced by and in turn influence our perception and emotional feelings. Although there is a recent focus on understanding cardiac interoceptive activity and interaction with brain activity during emotion processing, the investigation of cardiac&amp;amp;ndash;brain interactions with more ecologically valid naturalistic emotional stimuli is still very limited. We also do not understand how an essential aspect of emotions, such as context familiarity, influences affective feelings and is linked to statistical interaction between cardiac and brain activity. Hence, to answer these questions, we designed an exploratory study by recording ECG and EEG signals for the emotional events while participants were watching emotional movie clips. Participants also rated their familiarity with the stimulus on the familiarity scale. Linear mixed effect modelling was performed in which the ECG power and familiarity were considered as predictors of EEG power. We focused on three brain regions, including prefrontal (PF), frontocentral (FC) and parietooccipital (PO). The analyses showed that the interaction between the power of cardiac activity in the mid-frequency range and the power in specific EEG bands is dependent on familiarity, such that the interaction is stronger with high familiarity. In addition, the results indicate that arousal is predicted by cardiac&amp;amp;ndash;brain interaction, which also depends on familiarity. The results support emotional theories that emphasize context dependency and interoception. Multimodal studies with more realistic stimuli would further enable us to understand and predict different aspects of emotional experience.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-range alpha-synchronisation as control signal for BCI: A feasibility study</a></h4>

              
                Shifts in spatial attention are associated with variations in alpha-band (, 8-14 Hz) activity, specifically in inter-hemispheric imbalance. The underlying mechanism is attributed to local -synchronisation, which regulates local inhibition of neural excitability, as well as fronto-parietal synchronisation reflecting long-range communication. The direction-specific nature of this neural correlate brings forward its potential as a control signal in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). In the present study we explored whether long-range -synchronisation presents lateralised patterns dependent on voluntary attention orienting, and whether these patterns can be picked up at single-trial level to provide a control signal for active BCI. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from a cohort of healthy adults (n = 10) while performing a covert visuospatial attention (CVSA) task. The data show lateralised patterns of -band phase coupling between frontal and parieto-occipital regions after target presentation, replicating previous findings. This pattern, however, was not evident during the cue-target orienting interval, the ideal time window for BCI. Furthermore, decoding the direction of attention trial-by-trial from cue-locked synchronisation with support vector machine (SVM) was at chance-level. The present findings suggest limitations of EEG to detect long-range -synchronisation in attentional orienting at the single-trial and, thus, its limitation as a reliable signal for BCI control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Taste cues elicit prolonged modulation of feeding behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Taste cues regulate immediate feeding behavior, but their ability to modulate future behavior has been less well-studied. Pairing one taste with another can modulate subsequent feeding responses through associative learning, but this requires simultaneous exposure to both stimuli. We investigated whether exposure to one taste modulates future responses to other tastes even when they do not overlap in time. Using Drosophila, we found that brief exposure to sugar enhanced future feeding responses, whereas bitter exposure suppressed them. This modulation relies on neural pathways distinct from those that acutely regulate feeding or mediate learning-dependent changes. Sensory neuron activity was required not only during initial taste exposure but also afterward, suggesting that ongoing sensory activity may maintain experience-dependent changes in downstream circuits. Thus, the brain stores a memory of each taste stimulus after it disappears, enabling animals to integrate information as they sequentially sample different taste cues that signal local food quality.

                Microelectrode arrays (MEA) hold great promise for a broad range of applications that require reliable char-acterization of the growth and function of neurons in culture. Widespread adoption of this platform depends on analytical methods to extract meaning from highly variable and noisy observations. In analyzing a comprehensive database of MEA recordings, we discovered that 22% of the electrodes presented systematic patterns of under- or non-detection of spike activity. Going undetected, principal components analysis (PCA) of these data reveal trends that would have lead to incorrect biological interpretations. We fully document these defective or biased electrodes, and distinguish two forms of defectiveness, via rep-resentations that aid in detecting them. We also showcase our approach for analyzing these data that permit for post-analytic review and correction. Repeating our PCA on cleaned data, we discover a more complex interplay of biological variability. Finally, we make a case for transparency in data reporting and propose best practices for experimental and analysis phases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differences in non-linearities determine retinal cell types</a></h4>

              
                Classifying neurons in different types is still an open challenge. In the retina, recent works have taken advantage of the ability to record a large number of cells to classify ganglion cells into different types based on functional information. While the first attempts in this direction used the receptive field properties of each cell to classify them, more recent approaches have proposed to cluster ganglion cells directly based on their response to standard stimuli. These two approaches have not been compared directly. Here we recorded the responses of a large number of ganglion cells and compared two methods for classifying them into types, one based on the receptive field properties, and the other one using their responses to standard stimuli. We show that the stimulus based approach allows separating more types than the receptive field-based method, leading to a better classification. This better granularity is due to the fact that the stimulus-based method takes into account not only the linear part of ganglion cell function, but also non-linearities. A careful characterization of non-linear processing is thus key to allow functional classification of sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unifying model for three forms of contextual modulation including feedback input from higher visual areas</a></h4>

              
                Neural responses to a localized visual stimulus are modulated by the content of its surrounding. This phenomenon manifests in several forms of contextual modulation, including three interrelated properties of the visual cortex: surround suppression, inverse response and surround facilitation. We devise a unified biologically realistic circuit model accounting for all these phenomena and show that i) surround suppression in L2/3 is only partially due to the recruitment of lateral inhibition; ii) long-range feedback projections are necessary for inverse response and iii) the width of the response profile in the feedback layer determines inverse size tuning. The model predicts the modulations induced by silencing somatostatin-expressing cells or higher visual areas or changing the stimulus contrast. These predictions are consistent with the experimental observations when available and can be tested in existing setups otherwise. We then show the robustness of the identified mechanisms in a model with three interneuron subclasses, built to fit the classical responses and able to predict inverse size-tuning curves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A topography-based predictive framework for naturalistic viewing fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has shown great interest in understanding individual differences in complex brain function under naturalistic viewing (NV) conditions. However, methods specifically designed for achieving this goal remain limited. Here, we propose a novel approach, called TOpography-based Predictive Framework (TOPF), to investigate individual differences in evoked brain activity on NV fMRI data. Specifically, TOPF identifies individual-specific evoked activity topographies in a data-driven manner and examines their behavioural relevance using a machine learning predictive framework. Our results show that these topographies successfully predict individual phenotypes across cognition, emotion and personality on unseen subjects, and the identified predictive brain regions are neurobiologically interpretable. Further, the prediction accuracy exceeds that of the commonly-used functional connectivity-based features. Conceptually, we highlight the importance of examining multivariate evoked activity patterns for studying brain-behaviour relationships. In summary, we provide a powerful tool for understanding individual differences and brain-behaviour relationships on NV fMRI data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced memory precision in older age is associated with functional and structural differences in the angular gyrus</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence indicates decreased fidelity of mnemonic representations to play a role in age-related episodic memory deficits, yet the brain mechanisms underlying such reductions remain unexplored. Using functional and structural neuroimaging and a continuous report task we examined how changes in two key nodes of the posterior-medial memory network, the hippocampus and the angular gyrus, might underpin loss of memory precision in older age. An age-related reduction in activity reflecting successful memory retrieval was observed in the hippocampus, whereas activity associated with graded variation in memory precision was decreased in the angular gyrus. Grey matter volume of the angular gyrus further predicted individual differences in memory precision in older age, beyond variation in successful memory retrieval. These findings highlight the importance of functional and structural integrity of the angular gyrus in constraining memory precision in older age, advancing current understanding of hippocampal and parietal contributions to age-related episodic memory decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High frequency DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of nucleus accumbens dopamine D2 receptor-containing neurons attenuates cocaine reinstatement in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous work indicated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens shell in male rats attenuated reinstatement of cocaine seeking, an animal model of craving. However, the potential differential impact of DBS on specific populations of neurons to drive the suppression of cocaine seeking is unknown. Medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens are differentiated by expression of dopamine D1 receptors (D1DRs) or D2DRs, activation of which promotes or inhibits cocaine-related behaviors, respectively. The advent of transgenic rat lines expressing Cre recombinase selectively in D1DR-containing or D2DR-containing neurons, when coupled with Cre-dependent virally mediated gene transfer of channelrhodopsin (ChR2), enabled mimicry of DBS in a selective subpopulation of neurons during complex tasks. Hypothesis: We tested the hypothesis that high frequency DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D1DR-containing neurons in the accumbens shell would potentiate, whereas stimulation of D2DR-containing neurons in the accumbens shell would attenuate, cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Results: Results indicated that high frequency, DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D2DR-containing neurons attenuated reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male rats, whereas DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D1DR-containing neurons did not alter cocaine-primed reinstatement. Surprisingly, DBS-like optogenetic stimulation did not alter reinstatement of cocaine seeking in female rats. In rats which only expressed eYFP, intra-accumbens optogenetic stimulation did not alter cocaine reinstatement relative to sham stimulation, indicating that the effect of DBS-like stimulation to attenuate cocaine reinstatement is mediated specifically by ChR2 rather than consequent to prolonged light delivery. Conclusions: These results suggest that DBS of the accumbens attenuates cocaine-primed reinstatement in male rats through the selective manipulation of D2DR-containing neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An essential experimental control for functional connectivity mapping with optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                To establish functional connectivity between two candidate neurons that might form a circuit element, a common approach is to activate an optogenetic tool such as Chrimson in the candidate pre-synaptic neuron and monitor fluorescence of the calcium-sensitive indicator GCaMP in a candidate post-synaptic neuron. While performing such experiments, we found that low levels of leaky Chrimson expression can lead to strong artifactual GCaMP signals in presumptive postsynaptic neurons even when Chrimson is not intentionally expressed in any particular neurons. Withholding all-trans retinal, the chromophore required as a co-factor for Chrimson response to light, eliminates GCaMP signal but does not provide an experimental control for leaky Chrimson expression. Leaky Chrimson expression appears to be an inherent feature of current Chrimson transgenes, since artifactual connectivity was detected with Chrimson transgenes integrated into three different genomic locations (two insertions tested in larvae; a third insertion tested in the adult fly). These false-positive signals may complicate the interpretation of functional connectivity experiments. We illustrate how a no-Gal4 negative control improves interpretability of functional connectivity assays. We also propose a simple but effective procedure to identify experimental conditions that minimize potentially incorrect interpretations caused by leaky Chrimson expression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The right inferior frontal gyrus as pivotal node and effective regulator of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical response inhibition circuit in humans</a></h4>

              
                The involvement of specific basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in response inhibition has been extensively mapped in animal models. However, the pivotal nodes and directed casual regulation within this inhibitory circuit in humans remains controversial. Here, we capitalize on the recent progress in robust and biologically plausible directed causal modelling (DCM-PEB) and a large response inhibition dataset (n=218; 104 males) acquired with concomitant functional fMRI to determine key nodes, their causal regulation and modulation via biological variables (sex) and inhibitory performance in the inhibitory circuit encompassing the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), caudate nucleus (rCau), globus pallidum (rGP) and thalamus (rThal). The entire neural circuit exhibited high intrinsic connectivity and response inhibition critically increased causal projections from the rIFG to both rCau and rThal. Direct comparison further demonstrated that response inhibition induced an increasing rIFG inflow and increased the causal regulation of this region over the rCau and rThal. In addition, sex and performance influenced the architecture of the regulatory circuits such that women displayed increased rThal self-inhibition and decreased rThal to GP modulation, while better inhibitory performance was associated with stronger rThal to rIFG communication. Furthermore, control analyses did not reveal a similar key communication in a left lateralized model. Together these findings indicate a pivotal role of the rIFG as input and causal regulator of subcortical response inhibition nodes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development and validation of an expanded antibody toolset that captures alpha-synuclein pathological diversity in Lewy body diseases</a></h4>

              
                The abnormal aggregation and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the brain is a defining hallmark of synucleinopathies. An increasing number of studies show that aSyn in pathological aggregates exists as a complex mixture of various post-translationally modified forms and conformations. The distribution of these different species changes during disease progression and varies among the different synucleinopathies. Current approaches for detecting aSyn in human tissues and disease models rely on a limited set of antibodies that have not been thoroughly assessed for their ability to capture the diversity of aSyn proteoforms and aggregation states, and thus are unlikely to provide a complete estimation of aSyn pathology in the brain. To address these challenges, we developed, validated, and characterized an expanded set of antibodies that target different sequences and post-translational modifications (PTMs) along the entire length of aSyn, and recognize all conformations of the protein (monomers, oligomers and fibrils). We demonstrate that the use of multiple antibodies targeting different regions on aSyn is necessary to reveal the heterogeneity of aSyn pathology in human Lewy body disease (LBD) brains, and in neuronal and animal models of aSyn aggregation and inclusion formation. We also present, for the first time, the profiling of aSyn pathology using antibodies against all its key post-translationally modified forms across sporadic and familial LBDs. The antibody validation pipeline we describe here paves the way for a more systematic investigation of the diversity of aSyn pathology in the human brain and peripheral tissues, and in cellular and animal models of synucleinopathies.

                To elucidate the role of the basal ganglia during REM sleep movements in Parkinson's disease (PD) we recorded pallidal neural activity from four PD patients. Unlike desynchronization commonly observed during wakeful movements, beta oscillations (13-35 Hz) synchronized during REM sleep movements; furthermore, high-frequency oscillations (150-350 Hz) synchronized during movement irrespective of sleep-wake states. Our results demonstrate differential engagement of the basal ganglia during REM sleep and awake movements.

	<p>Recent studies demonstrated that pyroptosis plays a crucial role in shaping the tumor-immune microenvironment. However, the influence of pyroptosis on lower-grade glioma regarding immunotherapy and targeted therapy is still unknown. This study analyzed the variations of 33 pyroptosis-related genes in lower-grade glioma and normal tissues. Our study found considerable genetic and expression alterations in heterogeneity among lower-grade gliomas and normal brain tissues. There are two pyroptosis phenotypes in lower-grade glioma, and they exhibited differences in cell infiltration characteristics and clinical characters. Then, a PyroScore model using the lasso-cox method was constructed to measure the level of pyroptosis in each patient. PyroScore can refine the lower-grade glioma patients with a stratified prognosis and a distinct tumor immune microenvironment. Pyscore may also be an effective factor in predicting potential therapeutic benefits. In silico analysis showed that patients with a lower PyroScore are expected to be more sensitive to targeted therapy and immunotherapy. These findings may enhance our understanding of pyroptosis in lower-grade glioma and might help optimize risk stratification for the survival and personalized management of lower-grade glioma patients.</p>

	<p>Gait deficits are often persistent after stroke, and current rehabilitation methods do not restore normal gait for everyone. Targeted methods of focused gait therapy that meet the individual needs of each stroke survivor are needed. Our objective was to develop and test a combination protocol of simultaneous brain stimulation and focused stance phase training for people with chronic stroke (&amp;amp;gt;6 months). We combined Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with targeted stance phase therapy using Virtual Reality (VR)-assisted treadmill training and overground practice. The training was guided by motor learning principles. Five users (&amp;amp;gt;6 months post-stroke with stance phase gait deficits) completed 10 treatment sessions. Each session began with 30 min of VR-assisted treadmill training designed to apply motor learning (ML)-based stance phase targeted practice. During the first 15 min of the treadmill training, bihemispheric tDCS was simultaneously delivered. Immediately after, users completed 30 min of overground (ML)-based gait training. The outcomes included the feasibility of protocol administration, gait speed, Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), paretic limb stance phase control capability, and the Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer for lower extremity coordination (FMLE). The changes in the outcome measures (except the assessments of stance phase control capability) were calculated as the difference from baseline. Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed after 10 treatment sessions in gait speed (0.25 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.11 m/s) and FGA (4.55 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.08 points). Statistically significant improvements were observed in TUG (2.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.81 s) and FMLE (4.08 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.82 points). A 10-session intervention combining tDCS and ML-based task-specific gait rehabilitation was feasible and produced clinically meaningful improvements in lower limb function in people with chronic gait deficits after stroke. Because only five users tested the new protocol, the results cannot be generalized to the whole population. As a contribution to the field, we developed and tested a protocol combining brain stimulation and ML-based stance phase training for individuals with chronic stance phase deficits after stroke. The protocol was feasible to administer; statistically and/or clinically significant improvements in gait function across an array of gait performance measures were observed with this relatively short treatment protocol.</p>

                Background:  Unintended pregnancy predisposes women of child-bearing age to risk factors like maternal deaths, poor child outcomes, mental illness because of stress, risky abortion, and vertical transmission of HIV. According to the Kenya Demographic Health Survey in 2014, 34% of the pregnancies were unintended and in the year 2020 it rose to 41.9% (Monitoring, 2020).  Determinants of unintended pregnancy among women attending antenatal clinics in Kenya is diverse and is poorly understood due to no representative information. The objective of the study was to determine the factors associated with unintended pregnancy among women attending antenatal clinic particularly their individual factors, family planning practices and health facility-based factors. Method:  A cross-sectional study design. Data was collected using a structured administered questionnaire from 227 participants. The proportion and determinants of unintended pregnancy was derived using bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions.  Results: In this study, a third (29.9%) of the pregnant women reported that their existing gravidity was unintended. Individual factors such as age less than 25 years [AOR 8.1 (95% CI 1.4-48.6)), p=0.001], use of contraceptive method [AOR 7.9 (95% CI 2.5-25.0), p<0.001] and the woman being the sole decision-maker on when to get pregnant [AOR 3.8 (95% CI 1.3-11.2), p=0.014] were significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. Conclusion: The study area had quite a significant proportion of unintended pregnancy underscoring the need for health facilities to enhance targeted contraceptive counselling during antenatal and postnatal clinics. Reinforcing effective utilization of family planning services in the pursuit to decrease unintended pregnancy not only in Nairobi but also in Kenya.

                <p>by Justin Dean, Evan Goldberg, Franziska Michor</p>

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, but mortality can be reduced by detecting tumors earlier so that treatment is initiated at a less aggressive stage. The tradeoff between costs associated with screening and its benefit makes the decision of whom to screen and when a challenge. To enable comparisons across screening strategies for any cancer type, we demonstrate a mathematical modeling platform based on the theory of queuing networks designed for quantifying the benefits of screening strategies. Our methodology can be used to design optimal screening protocols and to estimate their benefits for specific patient populations. Our method is amenable to exact analysis, thus circumventing the need for simulations, and is capable of exactly quantifying outcomes given variability in the age of diagnosis, rate of progression, and screening sensitivity and intervention outcomes. We demonstrate the power of this methodology by applying it to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Our approach estimates the benefits that various novel screening programs would confer to different patient populations, thus enabling us to formulate an optimal screening allocation and quantify its potential effects for any cancer type and intervention.

                <p>by Trystan Leng, Edward M. Hill, Robin N. Thompson, Michael J. Tildesley, Matt J. Keeling, Louise Dyson</p>

Rapid testing strategies that replace the isolation of close contacts through the use of lateral flow device tests (LFTs) have been suggested as a way of controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission within schools that maintain low levels of pupil absences. We developed an individual-based model of a secondary school formed of exclusive year group bubbles (five year groups, with 200 pupils per year) to assess the likely impact of strategies using LFTs in secondary schools over the course of a seven-week half-term on transmission, absences, and testing volume, compared to a policy of isolating year group bubbles upon a pupil returning a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. We also considered the sensitivity of results to levels of participation in rapid testing and underlying model assumptions. While repeated testing of year group bubbles following case detection is less effective at reducing infections than a policy of isolating year group bubbles, strategies involving twice weekly mass testing can reduce infections to lower levels than would occur under year group isolation. By combining regular testing with serial contact testing or isolation, infection levels can be reduced further still. At high levels of pupil participation in lateral flow testing, strategies replacing the isolation of year group bubbles with testing substantially reduce absences, but require a high volume of testing. Our results highlight the conflict between the goals of minimising within-school transmission, minimising absences and minimising testing burden. While rapid testing strategies can reduce school transmission and absences, they may lead to a large number of daily tests.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A phenomenological computational model of the evoked action potential fitted to human cochlear implant responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ángel Ramos-de-Miguel, José M. Escobar, David Greiner, Domingo Benítez, Eduardo Rodríguez, Albert Oliver, Marcos Hernández, Ángel Ramos-Macías</p>

There is a growing interest in biomedical engineering in developing procedures that provide accurate simulations of the neural response to electrical stimulus produced by implants. Moreover, recent research focuses on models that take into account individual patient characteristics.
We present a phenomenological computational model that is customized with the patient’s data provided by the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) for simulating the neural response to electrical stimulus produced by the electrodes of cochlear implants (CIs). The model links the input currents of the electrodes to the simulated ECAP.
Potentials and currents are calculated by solving the quasi-static approximation of the Maxwell equations with the finite element method (FEM). In ECAPs recording, an active electrode generates a current that elicits action potentials in the surrounding auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). The sum of these action potentials is registered by other nearby electrode. Our computational model emulates this phenomenon introducing a set of line current sources replacing the ANFs by a set of virtual neurons (VNs). To fit the ECAP amplitudes we assign a suitable weight to each VN related with the probability of an ANF to be excited. This probability is expressed by a cumulative beta distribution parameterized by two shape parameters that are calculated by means of a differential evolution algorithm (DE). Being the weights function of the current density, any change in the design of the CI affecting the current density produces changes in the weights and, therefore, in the simulated ECAP, which confers to our model a predictive capacity.
The results of the validation with ECAP data from two patients are presented, achieving a satisfactory fit of the experimental data with those provided by the proposed computational model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discovering sparse control strategies in neural activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Edward D. Lee, Xiaowen Chen, Bryan C. Daniels</p>

Biological circuits such as neural or gene regulation networks use internal states to map sensory input to an adaptive repertoire of behavior. Characterizing this mapping is a major challenge for systems biology. Though experiments that probe internal states are developing rapidly, organismal complexity presents a fundamental obstacle given the many possible ways internal states could map to behavior. Using <i>C. elegans</i> as an example, we propose a protocol for systematic perturbation of neural states that limits experimental complexity and could eventually help characterize collective aspects of the neural-behavioral map. We consider experimentally motivated small perturbations—ones that are most likely to preserve natural dynamics and are closer to internal control mechanisms—to neural states and their impact on collective neural activity. Then, we connect such perturbations to the local information geometry of collective statistics, which can be fully characterized using pairwise perturbations. Applying the protocol to a minimal model of <i>C. elegans</i> neural activity, we find that collective neural statistics are most sensitive to a few principal perturbative modes. Dominant eigenvalues decay initially as a power law, unveiling a hierarchy that arises from variation in individual neural activity and pairwise interactions. Highest-ranking modes tend to be dominated by a few, “pivotal” neurons that account for most of the system’s sensitivity, suggesting a sparse mechanism of collective control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Uncertainty–guided learning with scaled prediction errors in the basal ganglia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Moritz Moeller, Sanjay Manohar, Rafasl Bogacz</p>

To accurately predict rewards associated with states or actions, the variability of observations has to be taken into account. In particular, when the observations are noisy, the individual rewards should have less influence on tracking of average reward, and the estimate of the mean reward should be updated to a smaller extent after each observation. However, it is not known how the magnitude of the observation noise might be tracked and used to control prediction updates in the brain reward system. Here, we introduce a new model that uses simple, tractable learning rules that track the mean and standard deviation of reward, and leverages prediction errors scaled by uncertainty as the central feedback signal. We show that the new model has an advantage over conventional reinforcement learning models in a value tracking task, and approaches a theoretic limit of performance provided by the Kalman filter. Further, we propose a possible biological implementation of the model in the basal ganglia circuit. In the proposed network, dopaminergic neurons encode reward prediction errors scaled by standard deviation of rewards. We show that such scaling may arise if the striatal neurons learn the standard deviation of rewards and modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons. The model is consistent with experimental findings concerning dopamine prediction error scaling relative to reward magnitude, and with many features of striatal plasticity. Our results span across the levels of implementation, algorithm, and computation, and might have important implications for understanding the dopaminergic prediction error signal and its relation to adaptive and effective learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neural networks enable efficient and accurate simulation-based inference of evolutionary parameters from adaptation dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grace Avecilla, Julie N. Chuong, Fangfei Li, Gavin Sherlock, David Gresham, Yoav Ram</p>

The rate of adaptive evolution depends on the rate at which beneficial mutations are introduced into a population and the fitness effects of those mutations. The rate of beneficial mutations and their expected fitness effects is often difficult to empirically quantify. As these 2 parameters determine the pace of evolutionary change in a population, the dynamics of adaptive evolution may enable inference of their values. Copy number variants (CNVs) are a pervasive source of heritable variation that can facilitate rapid adaptive evolution. Previously, we developed a locus-specific fluorescent CNV reporter to quantify CNV dynamics in evolving populations maintained in nutrient-limiting conditions using chemostats. Here, we use CNV adaptation dynamics to estimate the rate at which beneficial CNVs are introduced through de novo mutation and their fitness effects using simulation-based likelihood–free inference approaches. We tested the suitability of 2 evolutionary models: a standard Wright–Fisher model and a chemostat model. We evaluated 2 likelihood-free inference algorithms: the well-established Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) algorithm, and the recently developed Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) algorithm, which applies an artificial neural network to directly estimate the posterior distribution. By systematically evaluating the suitability of different inference methods and models, we show that NPE has several advantages over ABC-SMC and that a Wright–Fisher evolutionary model suffices in most cases. Using our validated inference framework, we estimate the CNV formation rate at the <i>GAP1</i> locus in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> to be 10<sup>−4.7</sup> to 10<sup>−4</sup> CNVs per cell division and a fitness coefficient of 0.04 to 0.1 per generation for <i>GAP1</i> CNVs in glutamine-limited chemostats. We experimentally validated our inference-based estimates using 2 distinct experimental methods—barcode lineage tracking and pairwise fitness assays—which provide independent confirmation of the accuracy of our approach. Our results are consistent with a beneficial CNV supply rate that is 10-fold greater than the estimated rates of beneficial single-nucleotide mutations, explaining the outsized importance of CNVs in rapid adaptive evolution. More generally, our study demonstrates the utility of novel neural network–based likelihood–free inference methods for inferring the rates and effects of evolutionary processes from empirical data with possible applications ranging from tumor to viral evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID – 19 and psychiatry teaching during the outbreak of the pandemic at the  Eduardo Mondlane Medical School [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a considerable impact on the lives of the world's population, which led to the closure of educational institutions including in Mozambique.  In March 2020, the state emergency forced students and professors to change in-person classes to online learning because of the pandemic.   Objectives: To access students’ capacities in terms of technological resources to participate in the 5th-year online classes of the Eduardo Mondlane University Medical School and the difficulties they encountered throughout the year. Additionally, psychological symptoms associated with confinement and how that affected participation in psychiatry and mental health classes were assessed.   Methods: A cross sectional social online questionnaire survey was conducted among 32 students enrolled in the 5th-year psychiatry and mental health classes of the Eduardo Mondlane University Medical School during May and June 2021.   Results: A total of 47 students were invited to participate in this survey, of which 32 students (68%) participated. Of the participants, 16.7% reported the presence of psychological symptoms associated with confinement. All students could participate in online classes using cell phones, computers, and tablets. However, 34.4% did not have a laptop.  In this study, 87.5% of the respondents reported poor internet quality, and 12.5% ​​of students did not have internet and had to join colleagues to participate in classes and to interact with the members of their groups. Most of the students (90.6%) were not prepared or knew how to use google classroom, Skype, and Zoom, before the lockdowns.   Conclusions: The study suggests that the abrupt and radical change from in-person teaching and learning methods to remote online methods showed the weaknesses of students in terms of resources (computers, tablets, internet) and knowledge for the implementation of online classes. Psychological symptoms were present but did not affect student participation in remote psychiatry and mental health classes.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by hippocampal neuronal death in CA1 and hilus. Dentate gyrus granule cells survive but show dispersion of the compact granule cell layer. This is associated with decrease of the glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates neuron migration and dendrite outgrow. Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice show no layering, their granule cells are dispersed throughout the dentate gyrus. We studied granule cell dendritic orientation and distribution of postsynaptic spines in reeler mice and two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy, namely the p35 knockout mice, which show Reelin-independent neuronal migration defects, and mice with unilateral intrahippocampal kainate injection. Granule cells were Golgi-stained and analyzed, using a computerized camera lucida system. Granule cells in naive controls exhibited a vertically oriented dendritic arbor with a small bifurcation angle if positioned proximal to the hilus and a wider dendritic bifurcation angle, if positioned distally. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed a dispersed granule cell layer, granule cells showed basal dendrites with wider bifurcation angles, which lost position-specific differences. Reeler mice lacked dendritic orientation. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed increased dendritic spine density in the granule cell layer. Molecular layer dendrites showed a reduced spine density in kainate-injected mice only, whereas in p35 knockouts no reduced spine density was seen. Reeler mice showed a homogenous high spine density. We hypothesize that granule cells migrate in temporal lobe epilepsy, develop new dendrites which show a spread of the dendritic tree, create new spines in areas proximal to mossy fiber sprouting, which is present in p35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice and loose spines on distal dendrites if mossy cell death is present, as it was in kainate-injected mice only. These results are in accordance with findings in epilepsy patients.</p>

                Background: Rhizocephalan barnacles stand out in the diverse world of metazoan parasites. The body of a rhizocephalan female is modified beyond revealing any recognizable morphological features, consisting of the interna, the system of rootlets, and the externa, a sac-like reproductive body. Moreover, rhizocephalans have an outstanding ability to control their hosts, literally turning them into “zombies”. Despite all these amazing traits, there is no genomic and transcriptomic data about any Rhizocephala. Methods: We collected transcriptomes from four body parts of an adult female rhizocephalan Peltogaster reticulata: externa and main, growing, and thoracic parts of the interna. We used all prepared data for the de novo assembly of the reference transcriptome. Next, a set of encoded proteins was determined, the expression levels of protein-coding genes in different parts of the parasite body were calculated and lists of enriched bioprocesses were identified. We also in silico identified and analyzed sets of potential excretory / secretory proteins. Finally, we applied phylostratigraphy and evolutionary transcriptomics approaches to our data.  Results: The assembled reference transcriptome included transcripts of 12,620 protein-coding genes and was the first for both P. reticulata and Rhizocephala. Based on the results obtained, the spatial heterogeneity of protein-coding genes expression in different regions of P. reticulata adult female body was established. The results of both transcriptomic analysis and histological studies indicated the presence of germ-like cells in the lumen of the interna. The potential molecular basis of the interaction between the nervous system of the host and the parasite's interna was also determined. Given the prolonged expression of development-associated genes, we suggest that rhizocephalans “got stuck in the metamorphosis”, even in their reproductive stage. Conclusions: The results of the first comparative transcriptomic analysis for Rhizocephala not only clarified but also expanded the existing ideas about the biology of this amazing parasites.

                Background: The artistic techniques necessary to fabricate facial prostheses mainly depend on individual skill and are not a resource easily reproduced. Digital technology has contributed to improved outcomes, often combining analog and new digital techniques in the same workflow. Methods: This article aims to present an innovative workflow to produce a final colored 3D printed and facial prosthesis by UV-map color translation into colored resin 3D printing. A modified +ID Methodology was used to obtain 3D models with the calibrated 3D printable patient’s skin color. No hands-on physical molding, manual sculpture, or intrinsic silicone coloration was used. Results: The outcome resulted in acceptable aesthetics, adaptation, and an approximate color match after extrinsic coloration. The patient reported good comfort and acceptance. Conclusions: A direct resin 3D printed prosthesis may be a viable alternative, especially for rapid delivery as an immediate prosthesis or an option when there is no experienced anaplastogist to manufacture a conventional prosthesis.

                <p>Author(s): Pedro A. Soria Ruiz, Falko Ziebert, and Igor M. Kulić</p><p>It has been observed experimentally that some viruses can actively roll on surfaces coated with biomolecules. This article describes a mechanism that relies on the ability of the spike proteins of the virus to bind to the ligands at the surface and then break the bonds, which induces a rolling motion. The authors develop scaling arguments and simulations, and explore the key assumptions to test the feasibility of this mechanism.</p><img src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.054411.png" width="200" height=\"100\"><br/><p>[Phys.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A cyto-, myelo-, and chemoarchitectonic analysis of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin is provided. As certain portions of the pallial telencephalon have been described previously (olfactory pallium, hippocampal formation, and amygdaloid complex), we focus on the claustrum and endopiriform nuclear complex, the white matter and white matter interstitial cells, and the areal organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis indicates that the organization of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin is similar to that observed in many other mammals, and specifically quite similar to the closely related carnivores. The claustrum of the tree pangolin exhibits a combination of insular and laminar architecture, while the endopiriform nuclear complex contains three nuclei, both reminiscent of observations made in other mammals. The population of white matter interstitial cells resembles that observed in other mammals, while a distinct laminated organization of the intracortical white matter was revealed with parvalbumin immunostaining. The cerebral cortex of the tree pangolin presented with indistinct laminar boundaries as well as pyramidalization of the neurons in both layers 2 and 4. All cortical regions typically found in mammals were present, with the cortical areas within these regions often corresponding to what has been reported in carnivores. Given the similarity of the organization of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin to that observed in other mammals, especially carnivores, it would be reasonable to assume that the neural processing afforded the tree pangolin by these structures does not differ dramatically to that of other mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase moonlights as a ribosome binding modulator of Gcn2 activity during oxidative stress</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of translation is a fundamental facet of the cellular response to rapidly changing external conditions. Specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) co-ordinate the translational regulation of distinct mRNA cohorts during stress. To identify RBPs with previously under-appreciated roles in translational control, we used polysome profiling and mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins associated with translating ribosomes in unstressed yeast cells and during oxidative stress and amino acid starvation, which both induce the integrated stress response (ISR). Over 800 proteins were identified across polysome gradient fractions, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors and many others without previously described translation-related roles, including numerous metabolic enzymes. We identified variations in patterns of polysome enrichment in both unstressed and stressed cells and identified proteins enriched in heavy polysomes during stress. Genetic screening of polysome-enriched RBPs identified the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, Aat2, as a ribosome-associated protein whose deletion conferred growth sensitivity to oxidative stress. Loss of Aat2 caused aberrantly high activation of the ISR via enhanced eIF2a phosphorylation and <i>GCN4</i> activation. Importantly, non-catalytic <i>AAT2</i> mutants retained polysome association and did not show heightened stress sensitivity. Aat2 therefore has a separate ribosome-associated translational regulatory or 'moonlighting' function that modulates the ISR independent of its aspartate aminotransferase activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Higher-order olfactory neurons in the lateral horn support odor valence and odor identity coding in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neuronal representations of odor-evoked activities and their progressive transformation from the sensory level to higher brain centers features one of the major aims in olfactory neuroscience. Here, we investigated how odor information is transformed and represented in higher-order neurons of the lateral horn, one of the higher olfactory centers implicated in determining innate behavior, using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We focused on a subset of third-order glutamatergic lateral horn neurons (LHNs) and characterized their odor coding properties in relation to their presynaptic partner neurons, the projection neurons (PNs) by two-photon functional imaging. We show that odors evoke reproducible, stereotypic, and odor-specific response patterns in LHNs. Notably, odor-evoked responses in these neurons are valence-specific in a way that their response amplitude is positively correlated with innate odor preferences. We postulate that this valence-specific activity is the result of integrating inputs from multiple olfactory channels through second-order neurons. GRASP and micro-lesioning experiments provide evidence that glutamatergic LHNs obtain their major excitatory input from uniglomerular PNs, while they receive an odor-specific inhibition through inhibitory multiglomerular PNs. In summary, our study indicates that odor representations in glutamatergic LHNs encode hedonic valence and odor identity and primarily retain the odor coding properties of second-order neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Motor cortex activity across movement speeds is predicted by network-level strategies for generating muscle activity</a></h4>

              
                Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling. Network solutions had a consistent form, which yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we analyzed motor cortex activity recorded during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unique neural coding of crucial versus irrelevant plant odors in a hawkmoth</a></h4>

              
                The sense of smell is pivotal for nocturnal moths to locate feeding and oviposition sites. However, these crucial resources are often rare and their bouquets are intermingled with volatiles emanating from surrounding ‘background’ plants. Here, we asked if the olfactory system of female hawkmoths, <i>Manduca sexta</i>, could differentiate between crucial and background cues. To answer this question, we collected nocturnal headspaces of numerous plants in a natural habitat of <i>M. sexta</i>. We analyzed the chemical composition of these headspaces and used them as stimuli in physiological experiments at the antenna and in the brain. The intense odors of floral nectar sources evoked strong responses in virgin and mated female moths, most likely enabling the localization of profitable flowers at a distance. Bouquets of larval host plants and most background plants, in contrast, were subtle, thus potentially complicating host identification. However, despite being subtle, antennal responses and brain activation patterns evoked by the smell of larval host plants were clearly different from those evoked by other plants. Interestingly, this difference was even more pronounced in the antennal lobe of mated females, revealing a status-dependent tuning of their olfactory system towards oviposition sites. Our study suggests that female moths possess unique neural coding strategies to find not only conspicuous floral cues but also inconspicuous bouquets of larval host plants within a complex olfactory landscape.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Electrocorticography is superior to subthalamic local field potentials for movement decoding in Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Brain signal decoding promises significant advances in the development of clinical brain computer interfaces (BCI). In Parkinson’s disease (PD), first bidirectional BCI implants for adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) are now available. Brain signal decoding can extend the clinical utility of adaptive DBS but the impact of neural source, computational methods and PD pathophysiology on decoding performance are unknown. This represents an unmet need for the development of future neurotechnology. To address this, we developed an invasive brain-signal decoding approach based on intraoperative sensorimotor electrocorticography (ECoG) and subthalamic LFP to predict grip-force, a representative movement decoding application, in 11 PD patients undergoing DBS. We demonstrate that ECoG is superior to subthalamic LFP for accurate grip-force decoding. Gradient boosted decision trees (XGBOOST) outperformed other model architectures. ECoG based decoding performance negatively correlated with motor impairment, which could be attributed to subthalamic beta bursts in the motor preparation and movement period. This highlights the impact of PD pathophysiology on the neural capacity to encode movement vigor. Finally, we developed a connectomic analysis that could predict grip-force decoding performance of individual ECoG channels across patients by using their connectomic fingerprints. Our study provides a neurophysiological and computational framework for invasive brain signal decoding to aid the development of an individualized precision-medicine approach to intelligent adaptive DBS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oct4 differentially regulates chromatin opening and enhancer transcription in pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                The transcription factor Oct4 is essential for the maintenance and induction of stem cell pluripotency, but its functional roles are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the functions of Oct4 by depleting and subsequently recovering it in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and conducting a time-resolved multiomics analysis. Oct4 depletion leads to an immediate loss of its binding to enhancers, accompanied by a decrease in mRNA synthesis from its target genes that are part of the transcriptional network that maintains pluripotency. Gradual decrease of Oct4 binding to enhancers does not immediately change the chromatin accessibility but reduces transcription of enhancers. Conversely, partial recovery of Oct4 expression results in a rapid increase in chromatin accessibility, whereas enhancer transcription does not fully recover. These results indicate different concentration-dependent activities of Oct4. Whereas normal ESC levels of Oct4 are required for transcription of pluripotency enhancers, low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to retain chromatin accessibility, likely together with other factors such as Sox2.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral forebrain organoids derived from individuals with schizophrenia recapitulate perturbed striatal gene expression dynamics of the donor's brains</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a brain disorder originating during neurodevelopment with complex genetic and environmental etiologies. Despite decades of clinical evidence of altered striatal function in affected patients, its cellular and molecular underpinnings remain unclear. Here, to explore neurodevelopmental alterations in the striatum associated with SCZ, we established a method for the differentiation of iPS cells into ventral forebrain organoids. Given substantial genetic heterogeneity among individuals, which can obscure disease-associated phenotypes, we generated organoids from postmortem dural fibroblast-derived iPS cells of 3 patients and 4 healthy control individuals with nonoverlapping polygenic risk score (PRS) for SCZ and whose genotype and postmortem caudate transcriptomic data were profiled in the Brainseq neurogenomics consortium. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of the organoids revealed differences in developmental trajectory between SCZ cases and controls in which inhibitory neurons from patients exhibited accelerated maturation. Furthermore, we found a significant overlap of genes upregulated in the inhibitory neurons in SCZ organoids with upregulated genes in postmortem caudate tissues from patients with SCZ compared with control individuals, including the donors of our iPS cell cohort. Our findings suggest that striatal neurons in the patients with SCZ carry abnormalities that originated during early brain development and a ventral forebrain striatal organoid model can recapitulate those neurodevelopmental phenotypes in a dish.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Basal forebrain cholinergic circuits orchestrate diverse cell types in the adult dentate gyrus to support neural stem cell function and spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Dentate gyrus (DG) is a critical structure involved in spatial memory and adult neurogenesis, two distinct processes dynamically regulated by local circuits comprising diverse populations of DG cells. It remains unknown how these DG cells are orchestrated to regulate these distinct hippocampal functions. Here we report activation of a cholinergic circuit from the Diagonal Band of Broca to DG promotes quiescent radial neural stem cell (rNSC) activation and spatial memory. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing reveals broad transcriptomic changes across DG mature and adult-born cells in response to cholinergic-circuit activation. Notably, neuronal populations exhibit cholinergic-activity-induced molecular changes related to synaptic functions crucial for spatial memory; while rNSCs exhibit changes related to structural remodeling and neurogenic proliferation crucial for hippocampal neurogenesis. Electrophysiology and NicheNet analyses reveal granule cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytes as potential intermediaries for cholinergic regulation of rNSCs. Our findings reveal cell-type-specific signaling mechanisms underlying cholinergic regulation of distinct DG functions.

	<p>This study evaluated the therapeutic effects of surgical treatment of cystic pituitary prolactin-secreting macroadenomas. The clinical data of 42 patients with cystic pituitary prolactin-secreting macroadenomas were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into medication plus surgery and surgery alone groups based on the regularity of bromocriptine treatment before surgery. Both groups underwent extra-pseudocapsular transsphenoidal surgery for tumor resection, and postoperative images and clinical follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. We also evaluated patients who opted for long-term treatment with bromocriptine. In the medication plus surgery group, the long-term surgical cure rate and comprehensive remission rate were 33.3% and 41.7%, while in the surgery alone group they were 69.2% and 80.8%, respectively. No severe or permanent complications occurred, and the surgical complication morbidity rate was 10.5%. The rate of tumor progression during the long-term follow-up was 33.3% and 7.7% in the medication plus surgery and surgery alone groups, respectively. The time required for prolactin levels to return to normal in the surgery alone group was significantly faster and the proportion that returned to normal was significantly higher. Direct surgical treatment after diagnosis combined with postoperative individualized bromocriptine adjuvant therapy had better efficacy in patients with cystic pituitary prolactin-secreting macroadenomas, but its long-term effectiveness requires further follow-up.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate ten exercise interventions (YOGA: yoga training, RT: resistance training, AQU: aquatic training, TAI: Taiji Qigong training, TRD: treadmill training, VR: virtual reality training, DANCE: musical dance training, WKT: walking training, CYC: cycling training, BDJ: Baduanjin Qigong training) on motor function in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients. Design: Through searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were collected to study the effects of the ten exercise interventions on motor function in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. The included studies were evaluated for methodological quality by the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. Results: The RCTs were collected between the earliest available date and April 2022. Sixty RCTs were included and the total sample size used in the study was 2859. The results of the network meta-analysis showed that DANCE can significantly improve patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (SUCRA = 78.4%); DANCE can significantly decline patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale score (UPDRS) (SUCRA = 72.3%) and YOGA can significantly decline patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Timed-Up-and-Go score (TUGT) (SUCRA = 78.0%). Conclusion: Based on the network meta-analysis and SUCRA ranking, we can state that dance, yoga, virtual reality training and resistance training offers better advantages than other exercise interventions for patients&amp;amp;rsquo; motor function.</p>

	<p>Tic disorders are neurological disorders that are prone to fluctuation and recurrence. It is important to study the factors related to disease recurrence and to subsequently provide suggestions for clinical treatment. A retrospective study was conducted to assess patients with recurrent and non-recurring tic disorders diagnosed in the Pediatric Tic Disorder Clinic of the First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China, and to extract various factors&amp;amp;mdash;such as fetal status; medication, allergy, and family history; social and psychological factors; blood lead content; electroencephalogram (EEG); disease duration; type of tics; and disease severity&amp;amp;mdash;and identify factors associated with recurrence. The recurrence rate of tic disorders was approximately 45.10% in this study. The childbirth conditions, surgery/trauma, respiratory tract infection, allergy, stress, consumption of tiapride, and severity of tic disorders were factors related to and affected disease recurrence.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Difficulty hearing in noise is exacerbated in older adults. Older adults are more likely to have audiometric hearing loss, although some individuals with normal pure-tone audiograms also have difficulty perceiving speech in noise. Additional variables also likely account for speech understanding in noise. It has been suggested that one important class of variables is the ability to process auditory information once it has been detected. Here, we tested a set of these &amp;amp;ldquo;suprathreshold&amp;amp;rdquo; auditory processing abilities and related them to performance on a two-part test of speech understanding in competition with and without spatial separation of the target and masking speech. Testing was administered in the Portable Automated Rapid Testing (PART) application developed by our team; PART facilitates psychoacoustic assessments of auditory processing. (2) Methods: Forty-one individuals (average age 51 years), completed assessments of sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS) and spectrotemporal modulation (STM) detection via an iPad running the PART application. Statistical models were used to evaluate the strength of associations between performance on the auditory processing tasks and speech understanding in competition. Age and pure-tone-average (PTA) were also included as potential predictors. (3) Results: The model providing the best fit also included age and a measure of diotic frequency modulation (FM) detection but none of the other potential predictors. However, even the best fitting models accounted for 31% or less of the variance, supporting work suggesting that other variables (e.g., cognitive processing abilities) also contribute significantly to speech understanding in noise. (4) Conclusions: The results of the current study do not provide strong support for previous suggestions that suprathreshold processing abilities alone can be used to explain difficulties in speech understanding in competition among older adults. This discrepancy could be due to the speech tests used, the listeners tested, or the suprathreshold tests chosen. Future work with larger numbers of participants is warranted, including a range of cognitive tests and additional assessments of suprathreshold auditory processing abilities.</p>

	<p>Neurocognitive screening instruments usually require printed sheets and additional accessories, and can be unsuitable for low-threshold use during ward rounds or emergency workup, especially in patients with motor impairments. Here, we test the utility of a newly developed neuropsychology pocketcard set for point-of-care testing. For aphasia and neglect assessment, modified versions of the Language Screening Test and the Bells Test were validated on 63 and 60 acute stroke unit patients, respectively, against expert clinical evaluation and the original pen-and-paper Bells Test. The pocketcard aphasia test achieved an excellent area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88&amp;amp;ndash;1, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Using an optimal cut-off of &amp;amp;ge;2 mistakes, sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 81%. The pocketcard Bells Task, measured against the clinical neglect diagnosis, achieved higher sensitivity (89%) and specificity (88%) than the original paper-based instrument (78% and 75%, respectively). Separately, executive function tests (modified versions of the Trail Making Test [TMT] A and B, custom Stroop color naming task, vigilance &amp;amp;lsquo;A&amp;amp;rsquo; Montreal Cognitive Assessment item) were validated on 44 inpatients with epilepsy against the EpiTrack&amp;amp;reg; test battery. Pocketcard TMT performance was significantly correlated with the original EpiTrack&amp;amp;reg; versions (A: r = 0.64, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; B: r = 0.75, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). AUCs for the custom Stroop task, TMT A and TMT B for discriminating between normal and pathological EpiTrack&amp;amp;reg; scores were acceptable, excellent and outstanding, respectively. Quick point-of-care testing using a pocketcard set is feasible and yields diagnostically valid information.</p>

	<p>Children tend to rely on semantics rather than syntax during sentence comprehension. In transitive sentences, with no reliance on semantics, the syntax-based strategy becomes critical. We aimed to describe developmental changes of brain mechanisms for syntax processing in typically developing (TD) four to six year old&amp;amp;rsquo;s. A specially designed sentence-picture matching task using active (AV) and passive (PV) voice enforced children to use grammar cues for sentence comprehension. Fifty children with above &amp;amp;gt;60% level of accuracy in PV sentences comprehension demonstrated brain sensitivity to voice grammar markers-inflections of the second noun phrase (NP2), which was expressed in a greater event-related potentials (ERP) amplitude to PV vs. AV sentences in four-, five-, and six-year-old children. The biphasic positive-negative component at 200&amp;amp;ndash;400 ms was registered in the frontocentral and bilateral temporoparietal areas. Only in six-year-old children P600 was registered in the right temporoparietal area. LAN-like negativity seems to be a mechanism for distinguishing AV from PV in the early stages of mastering syntax processing of transitive sentences in four to five year old children. Both behavioral and ERP results distinguished six-year-olds from four-year-old&amp;amp;rsquo;s and five-year-old&amp;amp;rsquo;s, reflecting the possible transition to the &amp;amp;ldquo;adult-like&amp;amp;rdquo; syntax-based thematic role assignment.</p>

	<p>Intraoperative hypothermia is very common and leads to memory decline. The hippocampus is responsible for memory formation. As a functional core area, the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus contains abundant blood vessels and is susceptible to ischemia. The aim of the study was to explore vascular function and neuronal state in the CA1 region of rats undergoing intraoperative hypothermia. The neuronal morphological change and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expression were evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunofluorescence respectively. Histology and immunohistochemistry were used to assess vascular function. Results showed that intraoperative hypothermia inhibited the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and caused reactive oxygen species accumulation. Additionally, the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells was transformed from contractile to synthetic, showing a decrease in smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and an increase in osteopontin. Ultimately, vascular dysfunction caused neuronal pyknosis in the CA1 region and reduced memory-related Arc expression. In conclusion, neuronal disorder in the CA1 region was caused by intraoperative hypothermia-related vascular dysfunction. This study could provide a novel understanding of the effect of intraoperative hypothermia in the hippocampus, which might identify a new research target and treatment strategy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients' quality of life and its related factors: A cross-sectional study of the Jordanian population [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death globally, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. It is estimated that 6.5% of Jordanians under 50 and 37.5% of those over 70 years of age are affected. The country's air pollution levels surpass recommended levels, increasing the disease incidence and burden on individuals and the health system. COPD is a long-term, severe, and exhausting condition. In Jordan, patients are highly dependent and frequent users of the healthcare services; therefore, their Quality of Life (QoL) is highly influenced by the health care they receive. The QoL of COPD patients must be studied to devise interventions that can help patients cope with this disease and for healthcare systems to improve their service.  Method: A cross-sectional correlational study of 200 COPD patients. The Arabic WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire Short Form was used to collect data.   Results: The mean COPD patient QoL score was 10.66 (SD=1.58), showing poor QoL perception. The physical domain had the lowest perceived QoL (10.232, SD=1.912), while the environmental domain had the highest (10.948, SD=1.636). Unmarried, non-smokers, and employed had better QoL (M=11.04, M=10.92, M=12.04). Age categories 50-61 exhibited greater mean QoL than age category 61 or higher (M=11.44, M=10.84, M=10.08). Private health services are characterized by short waiting times, availability of different diagnostic and treatment services, and skilled staff was related to better QoL.  Conclusions: QoL for COPD patients seems to be an area requiring urgent attention from Health service providers and planners. Patients should be adequately supported and cared for to have a good QoL. In Jordan, COPD patients' QoL is highly influenced by lack of physical activity, emotional distress, and anxiety. Therefore, better health care services is needed to address all these areas adequately.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A re-analysis of data from Sullins, Rosik, and Santero (2021): are sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) helpful for those who don't change? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background.  Sullins, Rosik, and Santero (2021) evaluated a convenience sample of 125 men who had undergone sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) and they made their data available for independent analysis.     Methods:  Data from Sullins et al. (2021) were reanalyzed in ten new ways.  Several new typologies and variables were created.  Paired sample t-tests, correlations, regression analyses, repeated measures analyses with time x group interactions, and chi-square tests were used to evaluate ten novel hypotheses. Results:  Using parametric statistics, we found similar results to Sullins et al. (2021) where they had used nonparametric statistics.  Regression analyses found that lower initial SSI and higher SSB predicted more change.  Using a new typology for marital status, it was found that those who became engaged/got married during SOCE had the largest gains in OSB compared to other categories of marital status.   Using the typology of change, it was found that some men who became stronger for SSA, SSI, and SSB nevertheless reported high levels of helpfulness for SOCE.  Harms from SOCE seem to be minimal compared to the positives reported for young adults.  SOCE effectiveness did not appear to change with time since therapy, lending less support to a recall bias argument.  Congruence between SSA and SSI, may, in some cases, reduce the apparent effectiveness of SOCE  Conclusion:  While the sample’s results cannot be generalized outside of highly religious men with initially higher levels of SSA and SSB than SSI, these results differ from many contemporary assertions that SOCE cannot ever be effective and is inherently harmful, or that SSA is inherently immutable.  Therefore, calls to ban SOCE legally appear to be founded upon incomplete or inaccurate data and thus premature, while more higher quality research is yet needed regarding SOCE.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Usefulness of vaccine boosters for Covid-19 in Italy and in UK and comparison between in intensive care admissions and deaths of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Surprises and implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is insufficient clarity about the different outcomes between unvaccinated and vaccinated people hospitalized with Covid-19, with reference to the variables “Intensive Care Unit” and “Deaths”. Moreover, it is unclear the real effectiveness of the vaccine boosters on the risks of infection and Covid-19 deaths, beyond the first few months after the booster. To verify the hypotheses that repeated vaccinations might expose to a progressively greater risk of severe Covid-19, and of a growing weakening of the immune response, primarily against infection, as the distance from the booster dose increases. Methods: Through an analysis of the official Italian data we calculated significant differences, percentage variations and trends in the variables “Intensive Care Units” and “Deaths” in hospitalized patients among four groups with different vaccination status, and between the Unvaccinated and Vaccinated groups. Through analyses of the UK Security Agency data in the weekly COVID-19 vaccine surveillance reports we explored the vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and against COVID-19 deaths in relation to the time elapsed from the booster doses. Results: Repeated vaccinations seem to expose the recipients to a growing risk of severe Covid-19, and fewer vaccinations might be enough to protect persons at greater risk. The vaccine effectiveness against infection vanished and reversed in the medium term, and vaccinated persons with three doses become increasingly more infected versus unvaccinated persons. Conclusions: The starting hypotheses have been supported, together with the need to combine carefully rethought vaccination campaigns with the implementation of other strategies, with the achievement of a healthy living and working environment, healthy lifestyles, and effective, safe and sustainable care.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glycine encephalopathy, also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), is an inherited neurometabolic disorder with variable clinical course and severity, ranging from infantile epileptic encephalopathy to psychiatric disorders. A precise phenotypic characterization and an evaluation of predictive approaches are needed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal clinical and biochemical data of 25 individuals with NKH from the patient registry of International Working Group on Neurotransmitter related Disorders were studied with in silico analyses, pathogenicity scores and molecular modeling of <i>GLDC</i> and <i>AMT</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Symptom onset (p&lt;0<sub>·</sub>01) and diagnosis occur earlier in life in severe NKH (p&lt;0<sub>·</sub>01). Presenting symptoms affect the age at diagnosis. Psychiatric problems occur predominantly in attenuated NKH. Onset-age ≥3 months (66% specificity, 100% sensitivity, AUC = 0·87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma glycine ratio ≤0<sub>·</sub>09 (57% specificity, 100% sensitivity, AUC = 0·88) are sensitive indicators for attenuated NKH while CSF glycine concentration ≥116<sub>·</sub>5 μmol/L (100% specificity, 93% sensitivity, AUC = 0·97) and CSF/plasma glycine ratio ≥0<sub>·</sub>15 (100% specificity, 64% sensitivity, AUC = 0·88) are specific for severe forms. A ratio threshold of 0<sub>·</sub>128 discriminates the overlapping range. We present ten new <i>GLDC</i> variants. Two mild variants resulted in attenuated, while two severe variants or one mild and one severe variant lead to severe phenotype. Based on clinical, biochemical and genetic parameter we propose a severity prediction model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study widens the phenotypic spectrum of attenuated NKH and expands the number of pathogenic variants. The multiparametric approach provides a promising tool to predict disease severity, helping to improve clinical management strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) Opportunities in Health Education (HE) in a mandatory social isolation context [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Routine care for prevention and health promotion has reduced significantly due to the Covid-19 pandemic and mandatory social isolation measures. In this context, it is necessary to identify and describe Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide opportunities for health education, promotion, and prevention aimed at the general population. The study is a systematic review of MOOCs on health education, health promotion, and prevention for the general population in a pandemic context. Methods: We developed a search for MOOC courses aimed at the general population on health education, health promotion, and prevention in different available MOOC platforms. We executed a descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs. Terms such as healthy living, physical activity, healthy eating, mental health, and variants aimed at the general population were explored. We did not include advanced or specialized studies aimed only at professionals that required prior knowledge. A descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs was performed. Results: There were 117 MOOCs chosen on health education, promotion, and prevention for the general population. Coursera (40.3%) was the platform that offered the highest quantity of MOOCs; more than half of the MOOCs were in English (52.9%). The median (interquartile range) duration of the selected MOOCs was 11 (6–15) hours. The predominant themes were "Health promotion" (43%) and "Food and nutrition" (31%), and the origin was mainly from Europe (37.8%). Conclusions: Potentially MOOCs could improve access to massive open online public health courses. Adaptation to different languages and topics needed for each context could increase access to important health promotion messages, even outside of "times of pandemic and enforced social isolation".

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Investigating the structural changes due to adenosine methylation of the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus ORF50 transcript</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Konstantin Röder, Amy M. Barker, Adrian Whitehouse, Samuela Pasquali</p>

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is a human oncovirus. KSHV relies on manipulating the host cell N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) RNA modification pathway to enhance virus replication. Methylation within a RNA stem loop of the open reading frame 50 (ORF50) increases transcript stability via the recruitment of the m6A reader, SND1. In this contribution we explore the energy landscapes of the unmethylated and methylated RNA stem loops of ORF50 to investigate the effect of methylation on the structure of the stem loop. We observe a significant shift upon methylation between an open and closed configuration of the top of the stem loop. In the unmethylated stem loop the closed configuration is much lower in energy, and, as a result, exhibits higher occupancy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysing and meta-analysing time-series data of microbial growth and gene expression from plate readers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luis Fernando Montaño-Gutierrez, Nahuel Manzanaro Moreno, Iseabail L. Farquhar, Yu Huo, Lucia Bandiera, Peter S. Swain</p>

Responding to change is a fundamental property of life, making time-series data invaluable in biology. For microbes, plate readers are a popular, convenient means to measure growth and also gene expression using fluorescent reporters. Nevertheless, the difficulties of analysing the resulting data can be a bottleneck, particularly when combining measurements from different wells and plates. Here we present omniplate, a Python module that corrects and normalises plate-reader data, estimates growth rates and fluorescence per cell as functions of time, calculates errors, exports in different formats, and enables meta-analysis of multiple plates. The software corrects for autofluorescence, the optical density’s non-linear dependence on the number of cells, and the effects of the media. We use omniplate to measure the Monod relationship for growth of budding yeast in raffinose, showing that raffinose is a convenient carbon source for controlling growth rates. Using fluorescent tagging, we study yeast’s glucose transport. Our results are consistent with the regulation of the hexose transporter (HXT) genes being approximately bipartite: the medium and high affinity transporters are predominately regulated by both the high affinity glucose sensor Snf3 and the kinase complex SNF1 via the repressors Mth1, Mig1, and Mig2; the low affinity transporters are predominately regulated by the low affinity sensor Rgt2 via the co-repressor Std1. We thus demonstrate that omniplate is a powerful tool for exploiting the advantages offered by time-series data in revealing biological regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sequence dependence of transient Hoogsteen base pairing in DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alberto Pérez de Alba Ortíz, Jocelyne Vreede, Bernd Ensing</p>

Hoogsteen (HG) base pairing is characterized by a 180° rotation of the purine base with respect to the Watson-Crick-Franklin (WCF) motif. Recently, it has been found that both conformations coexist in a dynamical equilibrium and that several biological functions require HG pairs. This relevance has motivated experimental and computational investigations of the base-pairing transition. However, a systematic simulation of sequence variations has remained out of reach. Here, we employ advanced path-based methods to perform unprecedented free-energy calculations. Our methodology enables us to study the different mechanisms of purine rotation, either remaining inside or after flipping outside of the double helix. We study seven different sequences, which are neighbor variations of a well-studied A⋅T pair in A<sub>6</sub>-DNA. We observe the known effect of A⋅T steps favoring HG stability, and find evidence of triple-hydrogen-bonded neighbors hindering the inside transition. More importantly, we identify a dominant factor: the direction of the A rotation, with the 6-ring pointing either towards the longer or shorter segment of the chain, respectively relating to a lower or higher barrier. This highlights the role of DNA’s relative flexibility as a modulator of the WCF/HG dynamic equilibrium. Additionally, we provide a robust methodology for future HG proclivity studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Performance-gated deliberation: A context-adapted strategy in which urgency is opportunity cost</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maximilian Puelma Touzel, Paul Cisek, Guillaume Lajoie</p>

Finding the right amount of deliberation, between insufficient and excessive, is a hard decision making problem that depends on the value we place on our time. Average-reward, putatively encoded by tonic dopamine, serves in existing reinforcement learning theory as the opportunity cost of time, including deliberation time. Importantly, this cost can itself vary with the environmental context and is not trivial to estimate. Here, we propose how the opportunity cost of deliberation can be estimated adaptively on multiple timescales to account for non-stationary contextual factors. We use it in a simple decision-making heuristic based on average-reward reinforcement learning (AR-RL) that we call <i>Performance-Gated Deliberation</i> (PGD). We propose PGD as a strategy used by animals wherein deliberation cost is implemented directly as urgency, a previously characterized neural signal effectively controlling the speed of the decision-making process. We show PGD outperforms AR-RL solutions in explaining behaviour and urgency of non-human primates in a context-varying random walk prediction task and is consistent with relative performance and urgency in a context-varying random dot motion task. We make readily testable predictions for both neural activity and behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Covariations between pupil diameter and supplementary eye field activity suggest a role in cognitive effort implementation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julien Claron, Julie Royo, Fabrice Arcizet, Thomas Deffieux, Mickael Tanter, Pierre Pouget</p>

In both human and nonhuman primates (NHP), the medial prefrontal region, defined as the supplementary eye field (SEF), can indirectly influence behavior selection through modulation of the primary selection process in the oculomotor structures. To perform this oculomotor control, SEF integrates multiple cognitive signals such as attention, memory, reward, and error. As changes in pupil responses can assess these cognitive efforts, a better understanding of the precise dynamics by which pupil diameter and medial prefrontal cortex activity interact requires thorough investigations before, during, and after changes in pupil diameter. We tested whether SEF activity is related to pupil dynamics during a mixed pro/antisaccade oculomotor task in 2 macaque monkeys. We used functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging to examine temporal changes in brain activity at the 0.1-s time scale and 0.1-mm spatial resolution concerning behavioral performance and pupil dynamics. By combining the pupil signals and real-time imaging of NHP during cognitive tasks, we were able to infer localized cerebral blood volume (CBV) responses within a restricted part of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, referred to as the SEF, an area in which antisaccade preparation activity is also recorded. Inversely, SEF neurovascular activity measured by fUS imaging was found to be a robust predictor of specific variations in pupil diameter over short and long-time scales. Furthermore, we directly manipulated pupil diameter and CBV in the SEF using reward modulations. These results bring a novel understanding of the physiological links between pupil and SEF, but it also raises questions about the role of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as CBV variations in the ACC seems to be negligible compared to CBV variations in the SEF.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A microfluidic system that replicates pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles in vitro improves prediction of in vivo efficacy in preclinical models</a></h4>

Test compounds used on in vitro model systems are conventionally delivered to cell culture wells as fixed concentration bolus doses; however, this poorly replicates the pharmacokinetic (PK) concentration changes seen in vivo and reduces the predictive value of the data. Herein, proof-of-concept experiments were performed using a novel microfluidic device, the Microformulator, which allows in vivo like PK profiles to be applied to cells cultured in microtiter plates and facilitates the investigation of the impact of PK on biological responses. We demonstrate the utility of the device in its ability to reproduce in vivo PK profiles of different oncology compounds over multiweek experiments, both as monotherapy and drug combinations, comparing the effects on tumour cell efficacy in vitro with efficacy seen in in vivo xenograft models. In the first example, an ERK1/2 inhibitor was tested using fixed bolus dosing and Microformulator-replicated PK profiles, in 2 cell lines with different in vivo sensitivities. The Microformulator-replicated PK profiles were able to discriminate between cell line sensitivities, unlike the conventional fixed bolus dosing. In a second study, murine in vivo PK profiles of multiple Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1/2 (PARP) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor combinations were replicated in a FaDu cell line resulting in a reduction in cell growth in vitro with similar rank ordering to the in vivo xenograft model. Additional PK/efficacy insight into theoretical changes to drug exposure profiles was gained by using the Microformulator to expose FaDu cells to the DNA-PK inhibitor for different target coverage levels and periods of time. We demonstrate that the Microformulator enables incorporating PK exposures into cellular assays to improve in vitro–in vivo translation understanding for early therapeutic insight.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Automated assessment reveals that the extinction risk of reptiles is widely underestimated across space and phylogeny</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriel Henrique de Oliveira Caetano, David G. Chapple, Richard Grenyer, Tal Raz, Jonathan Rosenblatt, Reid Tingley, Monika Böhm, Shai Meiri, Uri Roll</p>

The Red List of Threatened Species, published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is a crucial tool for conservation decision-making. However, despite substantial effort, numerous species remain unassessed or have insufficient data available to be assigned a Red List extinction risk category. Moreover, the Red Listing process is subject to various sources of uncertainty and bias. The development of robust automated assessment methods could serve as an efficient and highly useful tool to accelerate the assessment process and offer provisional assessments. Here, we aimed to (1) present a machine learning–based automated extinction risk assessment method that can be used on less known species; (2) offer provisional assessments for all reptiles—the only major tetrapod group without a comprehensive Red List assessment; and (3) evaluate potential effects of human decision biases on the outcome of assessments. We use the method presented here to assess 4,369 reptile species that are currently unassessed or classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN. The models used in our predictions were 90% accurate in classifying species as threatened/nonthreatened, and 84% accurate in predicting specific extinction risk categories. Unassessed and Data Deficient reptiles were considerably more likely to be threatened than assessed species, adding to mounting evidence that these species warrant more conservation attention. The overall proportion of threatened species greatly increased when we included our provisional assessments. Assessor identities strongly affected prediction outcomes, suggesting that assessor effects need to be carefully considered in extinction risk assessments. Regions and taxa we identified as likely to be more threatened should be given increased attention in new assessments and conservation planning. Lastly, the method we present here can be easily implemented to help bridge the assessment gap for other less known taxa.

                Background: Cannabis safety testing requires adequate detection of a broad class of bacteria known as Enterobacteria, from the family of Enterobacteriaceae. These organisms are responsible for many food-borne illnesses including gastroenteritis, and are common targets in the food testing industry. While all these organisms contain 16S DNA, not all of them grow on commercial culture-based platforms at a single culture temperature. Methods: We assessed four Enterobacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Pantoea agglomerans, Yersinia enterocolitica, Rahnella aquatilis) that vary in their preferred culture temperature, human pathogenicity and prevalence in cannabis. We cultured them on two different plating media and compared these results to two different qPCR assays. Results: All four bacteria grew on one plating medium at 30°C. 75% of them failed to grow at 36°C. Using a different plating medium, 75% grew at 30°C and zero grew at 36°C. Two different commercialy available quantitative PCR assays detected 100% of the organisms. Conclusions: Several Enterobacteria are highly medium- and temperature-sensitive, and can easily evade culture-based detection. Some of these bacteria are known to infect cannabis and may pose a clinical risk to cannabis trimmers or consumers. Quantitative PCR detected all of these species. Quantitative PCR is often criticized for failing to discern live versus dead DNA, but the definition of “live” is dependent on the culture medium and temperature used.

                Background: This observational study aims to establish a discrepancy in the radiation dose distributed for head & neck and pelvis localization in Computed Tomography (CT) imaging in radiation therapy. The objective and need of the current study are to establish Diagnostic Reference Level (DRL) for head & neck and pelvic CT protocols in Radiation Therapy planning and compare them with other regional, national and international DRL. The established DRL will be used to find further optimized DRL for Radiation Therapy Computed Tomography (RTCT). Methods: A total of 120 patients with Head & Neck cancers and 90 patients with pelvic cancers to be treated with radiotherapy prescribed for the RTCT with ages above 18 years old and above were included in the current study. The advanced Philips 16 slice big bore CT acquired all the CT simulation images. Results: Third quartile standards of Dose Length Product and effective dose for Head & Neck, and pelvis were 790.65mGy.cm, 2.45179 mSv, and 999.7 mGy.cm, 15.48mSv respectively. The third quartile CTDIvol value for the same order of procedure is 17.6 mGy. Tube voltage of 120kVp and 300mAs and used for radiotherapy planning. Conclusion: The first regional Radiation therapy Computed tomography simulation Diagnostic reference levels have been projected and deliver a platform for dose evaluation and optimization due to the limited number of papers on radiation therapy, computed tomography, and diagnostic reference levels. Comparison with previously available RT CT diagnostic reference levels indicated some radiation dose variation, so exposure parameters should be revised and improved.

The myocardia and microvessels of the left atrium are the most affected by inflammation storm. These results could provide guidance in improvement of clinical treatments for cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19.

                Becerra-Artiles et al. study two partially overlapping CD4 T cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are highly conserved across human and animal coronaviruses and are recognized by cross-reactive T cells present in most individuals. The molecular basis for the observed T cell cross-reactivity is discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-sensitive aggregation triggers NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is an autoinflammatory syndrome caused by mutations of NLRP3 gene encoding cryopyrin. Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), the mildest form of CAPS, is characterized by cold-induced inflammation induced by the overproduction of IL-1β. However, the molecular mechanism of how mutated NLRP3 causes inflammasome activation in CAPS remains unclear. Here, we found that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregates that function as a scaffold for inflammasome activation. Cold exposure promoted inflammasome assembly and subsequent IL-1β release triggered by mutated NLRP3. While K<sup>+</sup> efflux was dispensable, Ca<sup>2+</sup> was necessary for mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Notably, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was induced during mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Furthermore, caspase-1 inhibition prevented Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and inflammasome assembly induced by the mutated NLRP3, suggesting a feed-forward Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx loop triggered by mutated NLRP3. Thus, the mutated NLRP3 forms cryo-sensitive aggregates to promote inflammasome assembly distinct from canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Toward the cellular-scale simulation of motor-driven cytoskeletal assemblies</a></h4>

              
                The cytoskeleton – a collection of polymeric filaments, molecular motors, and crosslinkers – is a foundational example of active matter, and in the cell assembles into organelles that guide basic biological functions. Simulation of cytoskeletal assemblies is an important tool for modeling cellular processes and understanding their surprising material properties. Here, we present <i>aLENS</i> (a Living Ensemble Simulator), a novel computational framework designed to surmount the limits of conventional simulation methods. We model molecular motors with crosslinking kinetics that adhere to a thermodynamic energy landscape, and integrate the system dynamics while efficiently and stably enforcing hard-body repulsion between filaments. Molecular potentials are entirely avoided in imposing steric constraints. Utilizing parallel computing, we simulate tens to hundreds of thousands of cytoskeletal filaments and crosslinking motors, recapitulating emergent phenomena such as bundle formation and buckling. This simulation framework can help elucidate how motor type, thermal fluctuations, internal stresses, and confinement determine the evolution of cytoskeletal active matter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural differences in adolescent brains can predict alcohol misuse</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol misuse during adolescence (AAM) has been associated with disruptive development of adolescent brains. In this longitudinal machine learning (ML) study, we could predict AAM significantly from brain structure (T1-weighted imaging and DTI) with accuracies of 73 - 78% in the IMAGEN dataset (n ~1182). Our results not only show that structural differences in brain can predict AAM, but also suggests that such differences might precede AAM behavior in the data. We predicted ten phenotypes of AAM at age 22 using brain MRI features at ages 14, 19, and 22. Binge drinking was found to be the most predictable phenotype. The most informative brain features were located in the ventricular CSF, and in white matter tracts of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and brain stem. In the cortex, they were spread across the occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes and in the cingulate cortex. We also experimented with four different ML models and several confound control techniques. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with rbf kernel and Gradient Boosting consistently performed better than the linear models, linear SVM and Logistic Regression. Our study also demonstrates how the choice of the predicted phenotype, ML model, and confound correction technique are all crucial decisions in an explorative ML study analyzing psychiatric disorders with small effect sizes such as AAM.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Partial response electromyography as a marker of action stopping</a></h4>

              
                Response inhibition is among the core constructs of cognitive control. It is notoriously difficult to quantify from overt behavior, since the outcome of successful inhibition is the lack of a behavioral response. Currently, the most common measure of action stopping, and by proxy response inhibition, is the model-based stop signal reaction time (SSRT) derived from the stop signal task. Recently, partial response electromyography (prEMG) has been introduced as a complementary physiological measure to capture individual stopping latencies. PrEMG refers to muscle activity initiated by the go signal that plummets after the stop signal before its accumulation to a full response. Whereas neither the SSRT nor the prEMG is an unambiguous marker for neural processes underlying response inhibition, our analysis indicates that the prEMG peak latency is better suited to investigate brain mechanisms of action stopping. This study is a methodological resource with a comprehensive overview of the psychometric properties of the prEMG in a stop signal task, and further provides practical tips for data collection and analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nanchangmycin regulates FYN, PTK2, and MAPK1/3 to control the fibrotic activity of human hepatic stellate cells</a></h4>

              
                Chronic liver injury causes fibrosis, characterized by the formation of scar tissue resulting from excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) myofibroblasts are the primary cell type responsible for liver fibrosis, yet there are currently no therapies directed at inhibiting the activity of HSC myofibroblasts. To search for potential anti-fibrotic compounds, we performed a high-throughput compound screen in primary human HSC myofibroblasts and identified 19 small molecules that induce HSC inactivation, including the polyether ionophore nanchangmycin (NCMC). NCMC induces lipid re-accumulation while reducing collagen expression, deposition of collagen in the extracellular matrix, cell proliferation, and migration. We find that NCMC increases cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reduces the phosphorylated protein levels of FYN, PTK2 (FAK), MAPK1/3 (ERK2/1), HSPB1 (HSP27), and STAT5B. Further, depletion of each of these kinases suppress <i>COL1A1</i> expression. These studies reveal a signaling network triggered by NCMC to inactivate HSC myofibroblasts and reduce expression of proteins that compose the fibrotic scar. Identification of the antifibrotic effects of NCMC and the elucidation of pathways by which NCMC inhibits fibrosis provide new tools and therapeutic targets that could potentially be utilized to combat the development and progression of liver fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perception of a conserved family of plant signalling peptides by the receptor kinase HSL3</a></h4>

              
                Plant genomes encode hundreds of secreted peptides; however, relatively few have been characterised. We report here an uncharacterised, stress-induced family of plant signalling peptides, which we call CTNIPs. Based on the role of the common co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1) in CTNIP-induced responses, we identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> the orphan receptor kinase HAESA-LIKE 3 (HSL3) as the CTNIP receptor via a proteomics approach. CTNIP binding, ligand-triggered complex formation with BAK1, and induced downstream responses all involve HSL3. Notably, the HSL3-CTNIP signalling module is evolutionarily conserved amongst most extant angiosperms. The identification of this novel signalling module will further shed light on the diverse functions played by plant signalling peptides and will provide insights into receptor-ligand co-evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deciphering a hexameric protein complex with Angstrom optical resolution</a></h4>

              
                Cryogenic optical localization in three dimensions (COLD) was recently shown to resolve up to four binding sites on a single protein. However, because COLD relies on intensity fluctuations that result from the blinking behavior of fluorophores, it is limited to cases where individual emitters show different brightness. This significantly lowers the measurement yield. To extend the number of resolved sites as well as the measurement yield, we employ partial labeling and combine it with polarization encoding in order to identify single fluorophores during their stochastic blinking. We then use a particle classification scheme to identify and resolve heterogenous subsets and combine them to reconstruct the three-dimensional arrangement of large molecular complexes. We showcase this method (polarCOLD) by resolving the trimer arrangement of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and six different sites of the hexamer protein Caseinolytic Peptidase B (ClpB) of <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> in its quaternary structure, both with Angstrom resolution. The combination of polarCOLD and single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) promises to provide crucial insight into intrinsic heterogeneities of biomolecular structures. Furthermore, our approach is fully compatible with fluorescent protein labeling and can, thus, be used in a wide range of studies in cell and membrane biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conditional and unconditional components of aversively motivated freezing, flight and darting in mice</a></h4>

              
                Fear conditioning is one of the most frequently used laboratory procedures for modeling learning and memory generally, and anxiety disorders in particular. The conditional response (CR) used in the majority of fear conditioning studies in rodents is freezing. Recently, it has been reported that under certain conditions, running, jumping or darting replaces freezing as the dominant CR. These findings raise both a critical methodological problem and an important theoretical issue. If only freezing is measured but rodents express their learning with a different response, then significant instances of learning, memory, or fear may be missed. In terms of theory, whatever conditions lead to these different behaviors may be a key to how animals transition between different defensive responses and different emotional states. In mice, we replicated these past results but along with several novel control conditions. Contrary to the prior conclusions, running and darting were primarily a result of nonassociative processes and were actually suppressed by associative learning. Darting and flight were taken to be analogous to nonassociative startle or alpha responses that are potentiated by fear. Additionally, associative processes had some impact on the topography of flight behavior. On the other hand, freezing was the purest reflection of associative learning. We also uncovered a rule that describes when these movements replace freezing: When afraid, freeze until there is a sudden novel change in stimulation, then burst into vigorous flight attempts. This rule may also govern the change from fear to panic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The LOTUS initiative for open knowledge management in natural products research</a></h4>

              
                Contemporary bioinformatic and chemoinformatic capabilities hold promise to reshape knowledge management, analysis and interpretation of data in natural products research. Currently, reliance on a disparate set of non-standardized, insular, and specialized databases presents a series of challenges for data access, both within the discipline and for integration and interoperability between related fields. The fundamental elements of exchange are referenced structure-organism pairs that establish relationships between distinct molecular structures and the living organisms from which they were identified. Consolidating and sharing such information via an open platform has strong transformative potential for natural products research and beyond. This is the ultimate goal of the newly established LOTUS initiative, which has now completed the first steps toward the harmonization, curation, validation and open dissemination of 750,000+ referenced structure-organism pairs. LOTUS data is hosted on Wikidata and regularly mirrored on <a href="https://lotus.naturalproducts.net">https://lotus.naturalproducts.net</a>. Data sharing within the Wikidata framework broadens data access and interoperability, opening new possibilities for community curation and evolving publication models. Furthermore, embedding LOTUS data into the vast Wikidata knowledge graph will facilitate new biological and chemical insights. The LOTUS initiative represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a comprehensive and collaborative natural products knowledge base.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical adaptation to sound reverberation</a></h4>

              
                In almost every natural environment, sounds are reflected by nearby objects, producing many delayed and distorted copies of the original sound, known as reverberation. Our brains usually cope well with reverberation, allowing us to recognize sound sources regardless of their environments. In contrast, reverberation can cause severe difficulties for speech recognition algorithms and hearing-impaired people. The present study examines how the auditory system copes with reverberation. We trained a linear model to recover a rich set of natural, anechoic sounds from their simulated reverberant counterparts. The model neurons achieved this by extending the inhibitory component of their receptive filters for more reverberant spaces, and did so in a frequency-dependent manner. These predicted effects were observed in the responses of auditory cortical neurons of ferrets in the same simulated reverberant environments. Together, these results suggest that auditory cortical neurons adapt to reverberation by adjusting their filtering properties in a manner consistent with dereverberation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Binary outcomes of enhancer activity underlie stable random monoallelic expression</a></h4>

              
                Mitotically stable random monoallelic gene expression (RME) is documented for a small percentage of autosomal genes. We developed an in vivo genetic model to study the role of enhancers in RME using high-resolution single-cell analysis of natural killer (NK) cell receptor gene expression and enhancer deletions in the mouse germline. Enhancers of the RME NK receptor genes were accessible and enriched in H3K27ac on silent and active alleles alike in cells sorted according to allelic expression status, suggesting enhancer activation and gene expression status can be decoupled. In genes with multiple enhancers, enhancer deletion reduced gene expression frequency, in one instance converting the universally expressed gene encoding NKG2D into an RME gene, recapitulating all aspects of natural RME including mitotic stability of both the active and silent states. The results support the binary model of enhancer action, and suggest that RME is a consequence of general properties of gene regulation by enhancers rather than an RME-specific epigenetic program. Therefore, many and perhaps all genes may be subject to some degree of RME. Surprisingly, this was borne out by analysis of several genes that define different major hematopoietic lineages, that were previously thought to be universally expressed within those lineages: the genes encoding NKG2D, CD45, CD8α, and Thy-1. We propose that intrinsically probabilistic gene allele regulation is a general property of enhancer-controlled gene expression, with previously documented RME representing an extreme on a broad continuum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of HIV-reservoir cells with reduced susceptibility to antibody-dependent immune response</a></h4>

              
                HIV establishes a persistent infection in heterogeneous cell reservoirs, which can be maintained by different mechanisms including cellular proliferation, and represent the main obstacle to curing the infection. The expression of the Fcγ receptor CD32 has been identified as a marker of the active cell reservoirs in people on antiretroviral therapy, but if its expression has any role in conferring advantage for viral persistence is unknown. Here, we report that HIV-infected cells expressing CD32 have reduced susceptibility to natural killer (NK) antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) by a mechanism compatible with the suboptimal binding of HIV-specific antibodies. Infected CD32 cells have increased proliferative capacity in the presence of immune complexes, and are more resistant to strategies directed to potentiate NK function. Remarkably, reactivation of the latent reservoir from antiretroviral-treated people living with HIV increases the pool of infected CD32 cells, which are largely resistant to the ADCC immune mechanism. Thus, we report the existence of reservoir cells that evade part of the NK immune response through the expression of CD32.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial transcriptomics reveals metabolic changes underly age-dependent declines in digit regeneration</a></h4>

              
                De novo limb regeneration after amputation is restricted in mammals to the distal digit tip. Central to this regenerative process is the blastema, a heterogeneous population of lineage-restricted, dedifferentiated cells that ultimately orchestrates regeneration of the amputated bone and surrounding soft tissue. To investigate skeletal regeneration, we made use of spatial transcriptomics to characterize the transcriptional profile specifically within the blastema. Using this technique, we generated a gene signature with high specificity for the blastema in both our spatial data, as well as other previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing transcriptomic studies. To elucidate potential mechanisms distinguishing regenerative from non-regenerative healing, we applied spatial transcriptomics to an aging model. Consistent with other forms of repair, our digit amputation mouse model showed a significant impairment in regeneration in aged mice. Contrasting young and aged mice, spatial analysis revealed a metabolic shift in aged blastema associated with an increased bioenergetic requirement. This enhanced metabolic turnover was associated with increased hypoxia and angiogenic signaling, leading to excessive vascularization and altered regenerated bone architecture in aged mice. Administration of the metabolite oxaloacetate decreased the oxygen consumption rate of the aged blastema and increased WNT signaling, leading to enhanced in vivo bone regeneration. Thus, targeting cell metabolism may be a promising strategy to mitigate aging-induced declines in tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hybridization alters the shape of the genotypic fitness landscape, increasing access to novel fitness peaks during adaptive radiation</a></h4>

              
                Estimating the complex relationship between fitness and genotype or phenotype (i.e. the adaptive landscape) is one of the central goals of evolutionary biology. However, adaptive walks connecting genotypes to organismal fitness, speciation, and novel ecological niches are still poorly understood and processes for surmounting fitness valleys remain controversial. One outstanding system for addressing these connections is a recent adaptive radiation of ecologically and morphologically novel pupfishes (a generalist, molluscivore, and scale-eater) endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We leveraged whole-genome sequencing of 139 hybrids from two independent field fitness experiments to identify the genomic basis of fitness, estimate genotypic fitness networks, and measure the accessibility of adaptive walks on the fitness landscape. We identified 132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with fitness in field enclosures. Six out of the 13 regions most strongly associated with fitness contained differentially expressed genes and fixed SNPs between trophic specialists; one gene (<i>mettl21e</i>) was also misexpressed in lab-reared hybrids, suggesting a potential intrinsic genetic incompatibility. We then constructed genotypic fitness networks from adaptive alleles and show that scale-eating specialists are the most isolated of the three species on these networks. Intriguingly, introgressed and de novo variants reduced fitness landscape ruggedness as compared to standing variation, increasing the accessibility of genotypic fitness paths from generalist to specialists. Our results suggest that adaptive introgression and de novo mutations alter the shape of the fitness landscape, providing key connections in adaptive walks circumventing fitness valleys and triggering the evolution of novelty during adaptive radiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spontaneous neuronal oscillations in the human insula are hierarchically organized traveling waves</a></h4>

              
                The insula plays a fundamental role in a wide range of adaptive human behaviors, but its electrophysiological dynamics are poorly understood. Here we used human intracranial electroencephalographic recordings to investigate the electrophysiological properties and hierarchical organization of spontaneous neuronal oscillations within the insula. We analyzed the neuronal oscillations of the insula directly and found that rhythms in the theta and beta frequency oscillations are widespread and spontaneously present. These oscillations are largely organized along the anterior–posterior axis of the insula. Both the left and right insula showed anterior-­to-posterior decreasing gradients for the power of oscillations in the beta frequency band. The left insula also showed a posterior-to-anterior decreasing frequency gradient and an anterior-to-posterior decreasing power gradient in the theta frequency band. In addition to measuring the power of these oscillations, we also examined the phase of these signals across simultaneous recording channels and found that the insula oscillations in the theta and beta bands are traveling waves. The strength of the traveling waves in each frequency was positively correlated with the amplitude of each oscillation. However, the theta and beta traveling waves were uncoupled to each other in terms of phase and amplitude, which suggested that insular traveling waves in the theta and beta bands operate independently. Our findings provide new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics and hierarchical organization of neuronal oscillations within the insula, which, given its rich connectivity with widespread cortical regions, indicates that oscillations and traveling waves have an important role in intra- and inter-insular communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The locus coeruleus directs sensory-motor reflex amplitude across environmental contexts</a></h4>

              
                Animals possess a remarkable ability to quickly and accurately respond to challenges to their balance and posture. Postural corrections are the implementation of a motor act by the nervous system that counteracts a perturbation and returns the body to a stable state. These corrections must respect both the current position of the limbs and trunk, as well as the external environment. However, how motor circuits integrate multiple streams of information regarding both these internal and external factors, and adjust motor actions accordingly, are poorly understood. Here we show that the lateral vestibular nucleus in the brainstem generates motor corrections following perturbation, and that this reflex can be altered by manipulating the surrounding environment. The strength of the motor correction is influenced by noradrenergic signalling from the locus coeruleus, suggesting a potential link between forebrain structures which convey sensory information about the environment, and brainstem circuits that generate motor corrections.
