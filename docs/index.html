              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00269">Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate: feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3% reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve 16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.

                arXiv:2507.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a streamlined image analysis framework for correlating behavioral measures to anatomical measures on the cortex and detecting the regions of abnormal brain-behavior correlates. We correlated a facial emotion discrimination task score and its response time to cortical thickness measurements in a group of high functioning autistic subjects. Many previous correlation studies in brain imaging neglect to account for unwanted age effect and other variables and the subsequent statistical parametric maps may report spurious results. We demonstrate that the partial correlation mapping strategy proposed here can remove the effect of age and global cortical area difference effectively while localizing the regions of high correlation difference. The advantage of the proposed correlation mapping strategy over the general linear model framework is that we can directly visualize more intuitive correlation measures across the cortex in each group.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00265">Examining Reject Relations in Stimulus Equivalence Simulations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE), yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS) simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series, one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational models of equivalence.

                arXiv:2507.00305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the completely locked-in state (CLIS) can lose all reliable motor control and are left without any means of communication. It remains unknown whether non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can support volitional communication in CLIS. Here, we show that a CLIS patient was able to operate an EEG-based BCI across multiple online sessions to respond to both general knowledge and personally relevant assistive questions. The patient delivered "Yes"/"No" responses by volitionally modulating alpha and beta band power at different channels, guided by real-time auditory feedback from the BCI. The patient communicated assistive needs above chance in all sessions, achieving a perfect score in the final session. Performance on general knowledge questions varied across sessions, with two sessions showing accurate and above-chance responses, while the first and last sessions remained at chance level. The patient also showed consistent modulation patterns over time. These findings suggest that non-invasive BCIs may offer a potential pathway for restoring basic communication in CLIS.

                arXiv:2507.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances. Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17485">Storing overlapping associative memories on latent manifolds in low-rank spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Associative memory architectures such as the Hopfield network have long been important conceptual and theoretical models for neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, translating these abstract models into spiking neural networks has been surprisingly difficult. Indeed, much previous work has been restricted to storing a small number of primarily non-overlapping memories in large networks, thereby limiting their scalability. Here, we revisit the associative memory problem in light of recent advances in understanding spike-based computation. Using a recently-established geometric framework, we show that the spiking activity for a large class of all-inhibitory networks is situated on a low-dimensional, convex, and piecewise-linear manifold, with dynamics that move along the manifold. We then map the associative memory problem onto these dynamics, and demonstrate how the vertices of a hypercubic manifold can be used to store stable, overlapping activity patterns with a direct correspondence to the original Hopfield model. We propose several learning rules, and demonstrate a linear scaling of the storage capacity with the number of neurons, as well as robust pattern completion abilities. Overall, this work serves as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a geometrical perspective to design dynamics on neural manifolds, with implications for neuroscience and machine learning.

Abstract: Zeroing neural networks (ZNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance on time-varying optimization and control problems. Nonetheless, few studies are committed to illustrating the relationship among different ZNNs and the derivation of them. Therefore, reviewing the advances for a systematical understanding of this field is desirable. This paper provides a survey of ZNNs' progress regarding implementing methods, analysis theory, and practical applications.

Abstract: This research paper introduces two novel complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CvHNNs) that incorporate phase and magnitude quantization. The first CvHNN employs a ceiling-type activation function that operates on the rectangular coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The second CvHNN similarly incorporates phase and magnitude quantization but utilizes a ceiling-type activation function based on the polar coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The proposed CvHNNs, with their phase and magnitude quantization, significantly increase the number of states compared to existing models in the literature, thereby expanding the range of potential applications for CvHNNs.

                arXiv:2507.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously. The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over task-relevant manifolds.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00022">GLU Attention Improve Transformer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.00022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLU) have shown great potential in enhancing neural network performance. In this paper, I introduce a novel attention mechanism called GLU Attention, which introduces nonlinearity into the values of Attention. My experiments demonstrate that GLU Attention improves both model performance and convergence speed across text and vision modalities with zero additional parameters and negligible computational costs. GLU Attention is lightweight and can seamlessly integrate with other technologies, such as Flash Attention, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), and various Multi-Head Attention (MHA) variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). This project is open-sourced at github.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00032">Ken Utilization Layer: Hebbian Replay Within a Student's Ken for Adaptive Knowledge Tracing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training. Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured (tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for personalized learning at scale.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00263">Room Scene Discovery and Grouping in Unstructured Vacation Rental Image Collections</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.00263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization. This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem, as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally, the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with pretrained embeddings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07438">Hardest Monotone Functions for Evolutionary Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2311.07438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the question how hard it can be for the $(1+1)$ Evolutionary Algorithm to optimize monotone pseudo-Boolean functions. By introducing a more pessimistic stochastic process, the partially-ordered evolutionary algorithm (PO-EA) model, Jansen first proved a runtime bound of $O(n^{3/2})$. More recently, Lengler, Martinsson and Steger improved this upper bound to $O(n \log^2 n)$ by an entropy compression argument. In this work, we analyze monotone functions that may adversarially vary at each step of the optimization, so-called dynamic monotone functions. We introduce the function Switching Dynamic BinVal (SDBV) and prove, using a combinatorial argument, that for the $(1+1)$-EA with any mutation rate $p \in [0,1]$, SDBV is drift minimizing within the class of dynamic monotone functions. We further show that the $(1+1)$-EA optimizes SDBV in $\Theta(n^{3/2})$ generations. Therefore, our construction provides the first explicit example which realizes the pessimism of the \poea model. Our simulations demonstrate matching runtimes for both the static and the self-adjusting $(1,\lambda)$-EA and $(1+\lambda)$-EA. Moreover, devising an example for fixed dimension, we illustrate that drift minimization does not equal maximal runtime beyond asymptotic analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05576">STONet: A neural operator for modeling solute transport in micro-cracked reservoirs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.05576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel neural operator, the Solute Transport Operator Network (STONet), to efficiently model contaminant transport in micro-cracked porous media. STONet's model architecture is specifically designed for this problem and uniquely integrates an enriched DeepONet structure with a transformer-based multi-head attention mechanism, enhancing performance without incurring additional computational overhead compared to existing neural operators. The model combines different networks to encode heterogeneous properties effectively and predict the rate of change of the concentration field to accurately model the transport process. The training data is obtained using finite element (FEM) simulations by random sampling of micro-fracture distributions and applied pressure boundary conditions, which capture diverse scenarios of fracture densities, orientations, apertures, lengths, and balance of pressure-driven to density-driven flow. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that, once trained, STONet achieves accurate predictions, with relative errors typically below 1% compared with FEM simulations while reducing runtime by approximately two orders of magnitude. This type of computational efficiency facilitates building digital twins for rapid assessment of subsurface contamination risks and optimization of environmental remediation strategies. The data and code for the paper will be published at https://github.com/ehsanhaghighat/STONet.

                <p>Virtual reality (VR) has gained popularity in recent years, integrating with conventional music stimulation (MS), action observation (AO), and motor imagination (MI). It offers promising opportunities for developing innovative rehabilitation treatments, though the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. This study aims to compare brain activation and network mechanisms following the fusion of MS, AO, and MI with VR. Fifty healthy participants were recruited and underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy synchronization with three VR tasks: MS (VRMS), AO (VRAO), and MI (VRMI). The results indicate that VRMS significantly enhances functional connectivity of the bilateral primary sensory cortex (S1), premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area (PM&amp;SMA) compared with VRAO and VRMI. Furthermore, the interaction among the bilateral PM&amp;SMA, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right primary motor cortex (M1) regions is notably stronger with VRMS than with the other VR tasks. These findings elucidate the brain activation and network characteristics of the three VR tasks, highlighting VRMS's potential in boosting the functional interaction among brain regions. Future research should explore additional brain regions, broader diseased brain samples, and alternative brain-stimulation effects of VRMS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-639/v1?src=rss">Assessing Knowledge and Awareness of Occupational Hazards and Preventive Measures among Dentists and Final-year Students in Two Dentistry Hospitals, Kabul, Afghanistan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and awareness of occupational hazards and preventive measures among dentists and final-year students in two dentistry hospitals in Kabul, Afghanistan. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used in this research, which was distributed to 198 dental professionals, with Part A dealing with sociodemographic data, Part B focusing on awareness of occupational hazards, and Part C on preventive measures. Responses were analyzed to assess the level of awareness using a five-point scale. The data were also compared using Mann-Whitney U tests to examine the differences between male and female respondents and between final-year dental students and practicing dentists. Results The overall mean proportion of correct answers was 0.71 (71%), indicating moderately high awareness. Part B had a mean of 0.73 (high), and Part C had a mean of 0.69 (medium). High awareness was found in areas such as radiation safety (93.4%), infection control (97.5%) and ergonomics (85.9%). However, gaps were identified in knowledge of lead protective gowns (15.2%) and the inverse square law (8.1%). In Part C, high awareness was noted regarding safety guidelines for electrical devices (85.9%) and protective eyewear (93.4%), but low awareness was found regarding safety boxes for sharp instruments (19.7%) and the scoop technique (31.8%). Mann-Whitney U tests revealed significant differences between male and female respondents (p < 0.001), with females showing higher awareness, although the effect size was small (r = -0.247). No significant difference was observed between the final-year students and practicing dentists (p = 0.575). Conclusions Although dental professionals exhibit a relatively high level of awareness regarding occupational hazards and preventive measures, specific knowledge gaps persist. Addressing these deficiencies through structured educational interventions and continuous professional training is essential to enhance the occupational safety and improve the overall well-being of dental practitioners.

                <p>by Héctor D. García-Verdugo, Cristian Román-Palacios</p>

Effective collaboration, essential for success in academic environments, often requires efficient team communication and access to a team-oriented digital infrastructure. Despite the significance of efficient and effective collaboration within the academy, a standardized and structured suite for collaboration remains relatively overlooked. In the context of research labs, where multiple levels of collaboration often coexist, the ability to communicate and share resources in a timely and secure manner is critical. Modern research teams and institutions have historically attempted to solve these needs through proprietary, largely restrictive, and inflexible tools. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has facilitated the development of our modern computer-focused world by virtue of its legal, customizable, and accessible nature. However, FOSS remains weakly used for supporting communication, collaborative writing, storage, and other tasks within research labs. This paper discusses the implementation of a FOSS computational workflow for active collaboration within academic environments. We focus on identifying available tools that can support collaborative writing, instant messaging, data storage, among other tasks. The Lab Operations (LabOps) workflow presented in this paper—which can be self-hosted, adapted, and adopted at different levels—offers an alternative approach to off-the-shelf proprietary solutions for both within- and cross-lab communication. We discuss the benefits, flexibility, limitations, and potential approaches to adoption of the workflow.

                <p>by D. Walker Gauthier, Noelle James, Benjamin D. Auerbach</p>

Atypical sensory processing, particularly in the auditory domain, is one of the most common and quality-of-life affecting symptoms seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of ASD and a majority of FXS individuals present with auditory processing alterations. While auditory hypersensitivity is a common phenotype observed in FXS and <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) rodent models, it is important to consider other auditory coding impairments that could contribute to sound processing difficulties and disrupted language comprehension in FXS. We have shown previously that a <i>Fmr1</i> KO rat model of FXS exhibits heightened sound sensitivity that coincided with abnormal perceptual integration of stimulus bandwidth, indicative of altered spectral processing. Frequency discrimination is a fundamental aspect of sound encoding that is important for a range of auditory processes, such as source segregation and speech comprehension, and disrupted frequency coding could thus contribute to a range of auditory issues in FXS and ASD. Here we explicitly characterized spectral processing deficits in male <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats using an operant conditioning tone discrimination assay and in vivo electrophysiology recordings from the auditory cortex and inferior colliculus. We found that <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats exhibited poorer frequency resolution, which corresponded with neuronal hyperactivity and broader frequency tuning in auditory cortical but not collicular neurons. Using an experimentally informed population model, we show that these cortical physiological differences can recapitulate the observed behavior discrimination deficits, with decoder performance being tightly linked to differences in cortical tuning width and signal-to-noise ratios. Together, these findings indicate that cortical hyperexcitability in <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats may act to preserve signal-to-noise ratios and signal detection threshold at the expense of sound sensitivity and fine feature discrimination, highlighting a potential mechanistic locus for a range of auditory behavioral phenotypes in FXS.

Effortful learning and practice are integral to academic attainment in areas like reading, language, and mathematics, shaping future career prospects, socioeconomic status, and health outcomes. However, academic learning outcomes often exhibit disparities, with initial cognitive advantages leading to further advantages (the Matthew effect). One of the areas in which learners frequently exhibit difficulties is mathematical learning. Neurobiological research has underscored the involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and the hippocampus in mathematical learning. However, their causal contributions remain unclear. Moreover, recent findings have highlighted the potential role of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in neuroplasticity and learning. To deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving mathematical learning, we employed a novel approach integrating double-blind excitatory neurostimulation—high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS)—and examined its effect at the behavioral, functional, and neurochemical levels. During a 5-day mathematical learning paradigm (<i>n</i> = 72) active tRNS was applied over the dlPFC or the PPC, and we compared the effects versus sham tRNS. Individuals exhibiting stronger positive baseline frontoparietal connectivity demonstrated greater improvement in calculation learning. Subsequently, utilizing tRNS to modulate frontoparietal connectivity, we found that participants with weaker positive baseline frontoparietal connectivity, typically associated with poorer learning performance, experienced enhanced learning outcomes following dlPFC-tRNS only. Further analyses revealed that dlPFC-tRNS improved learning outcomes for participants who showed reductions in dlPFC GABA when it was accompanied by a reduced positive frontoparietal connectivity, but this effect was reversed for participants who showed increased positive frontoparietal connectivity. Our multimodal approach elucidates the causal role of the dlPFC and frontoparietal network in a critical academic learning skill, shedding light on the interplay between functional connectivity and GABAergic modulation in the efficacy of brain-based interventions to augment learning outcomes, particularly benefiting individuals who would learn less optimally based on their neurobiological profile.

Adhesive interactions, mediated by specific molecular and structural mechanisms, are fundamental to host–pathogen and predator–prey relationships, driving evolutionary dynamics and ecological interactions. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular basis of adhesion between the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and its natural predator the nematode-trapping fungus <i>Arthrobotrys oligospora</i>, which employs specialized adhesive nets to capture its prey. Using forward genetic screens, we identified <i>C. elegans</i> mutants that escape fungal traps and revealed the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-66 as a key regulator of fungal-nematode adhesion. Loss-of-function mutations in <i>nhr-66</i> conferred resistance to fungal trapping through the downregulation of a large subset of cuticular collagen genes. Restoring collagen gene expression in <i>nhr-66</i> mutants abolished the escape phenotype, highlighting the essential role of these structural proteins in fungal-nematode adhesion. Furthermore, sequence analysis of natural <i>C. elegans</i> populations revealed no obvious loss-of-function variants in <i>nhr-66</i>, suggesting selective pressures exist that balance adhesion-mediated predation risk with physiological robustness. We observed that loss of <i>nhr-66</i> function resulted in a trade-off of increased hypersensitivity to hypoosmotic stress and cuticular fragility. These findings underscore the pivotal role of structural proteins in shaping ecological interactions and the evolutionary arms race between predator and prey.

<p>High-frequency oscillations (HFO) generated by the microscale overexcitation circuits are promising biomarker of the epileptogenesis and epilepsy development.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The mechanism of epilepsy is still unclear. We aim to explore the relationship between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) dynamics and epilepsy, with a focus on deciphering underlying mechanisms at the single-neuron level. Using a rat model of chronic focal cortical epilepsy induced by cobalt-wire implantation, we monitored the seizures and HFO dynamics, as well as the cross-frequency coupling trends between HFOs and theta activities. Additionally, excitatory and inhibitory neurons' discharges were recorded by 16-channel tetrode electrode, with comparisons made between the discharge rates and changes from baselines during different bands of HFOs (ripple:80-200 Hz; fast ripple, FRs:200-500 Hz). All rats (8/8) with cobalt-wire implantation developed spontaneous seizures within 4 to 8 days post-surgery, in contrast to the control group (3/3) with steel-wire insertion remaining seizure-free. HFOs exhibited a progressive increase over time post-surgery in the epilepsy model, while minimal HFOs was observed in the control group. HFOs recorded during the peak-seizure periods showed a propensity to synchronize with the trough of theta activity, coinciding with heightened seizure frequency. A substantial augmentation showed in the discharge rates of both putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons during HFO occurrences. The change ratios between putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons during ripples were smaller than those during FRs. In conclusion, we found that HFO dynamics reflect epileptogenic network formation, with implications for early seizure prediction and therapeutic interventions. Our data provide novel insights at cellular and cross-frequency level into the mechanistic underpinnings of HFO emergence and network reorganization offering potential strategies for targeting pathological network activity in epilepsy.</p>

                Sialoglycans on T cells are emerging as important immunotherapeutic targets but remain incompletely characterized in both mice and humans. Here, Izzati and Choksi et al. curate an atlas of functionally important glycans across murine and human T cell repertoires and discover species-specific differences driven by divergent biosynthesis.

                Isogawa et al. show that antibody durability after booster vaccination is predicted by pre-existing memory T cells that produce IL-2 upon antigen stimulation. These memory T cells, termed memory Th0 cells, uniquely express BACH2, distinguishing them from conventional helper T cells.

Additionally, they extend molecular evidence to data from field studies that have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in wild-caught bats lack an intact furin cleavage site.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89929">A neuromorphic model of active vision shows how spatiotemporal encoding in lobula neurons can aid pattern recognition in bees</a></h4>

              
                Bees’ remarkable visual learning abilities make them ideal for studying active information acquisition and representation. Here, we develop a biologically inspired model to examine how flight behaviours during visual scanning shape neural representation in the insect brain, exploring the interplay between scanning behaviour, neural connectivity, and visual encoding efficiency. Incorporating non-associative learning—adaptive changes without reinforcement—and exposing the model to sequential natural images during scanning, we obtain results that closely match neurobiological observations. Active scanning and non-associative learning dynamically shape neural activity, optimising information flow and representation. Lobula neurons, crucial for visual integration, self-organise into orientation-selective cells with sparse, decorrelated responses to orthogonal bar movements. They encode a range of orientations, biased by input speed and contrast, suggesting co-evolution with scanning behaviour to enhance visual representation and support efficient coding. To assess the significance of this spatiotemporal coding, we extend the model with circuitry analogous to the mushroom body, a region linked to associative learning. The model demonstrates robust performance in pattern recognition, implying a similar encoding mechanism in insects. Integrating behavioural, neurobiological, and computational insights, this study highlights how spatiotemporal coding in the lobula efficiently compresses visual features, offering broader insights into active vision strategies and bio-inspired automation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102305">Cardiac fibroblasts regulate myocardium and coronary vasculature development in the murine heart via the collagen signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                The fibroblast (FB), cardiomyocyte (CM), and vascular endothelial cell (Vas_EC) are the three major cell types in the heart, yet their relationships during development are largely unexplored. To address this gap, we employed RNA staining of the FB marker gene <i>Col1a1</i> together with the CM marker gene <i>Actn2</i> and the Vas_EC marker gene <i>Cdh5</i> at various stages of mouse heart development. This approach enabled us to discern the anatomical pattern of cardiac FBs and identify approximately one EC and four CMs directly interacting with each FB. Molecularly, through the analysis of single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we unveiled collagen as the top signaling molecule derived from FBs influencing CM and Vas_EC development. Subsequently, we used a <i>Pdgfra-CreER</i> controlled diphtheria toxin A (DTA) system to ablate the FBs at different stages. We found that the ablation of FBs disrupted myocardium and vasculature development and led to embryonic heart defects. Using scRNA-seq, we further profiled the ablated hearts and identified molecular defects in their ventricular CMs and Vas_ECs compared to control hearts. Moreover, we identified a reduction of collagen in the ablated hearts and predicted collagen as the major signaling pathway regulating the differentially expressed genes in the ablated ventricular CMs. Finally, we performed both short-term and long-term FB ablation at the neonatal stage. We found that short-term ablation caused a reduction in collagen and Vas_EC density, while long-term ablation may induce compensatory collagen expression without causing heart function reduction. In summary, our study has identified the function of FBs in regulating myocardium and vasculature development in the mouse heart and implicated an important role for the collagen pathway in this process.

                Traditionally, insects have been thought to be entirely dependent on their innate immune system, which has little capacity for the acquisition of experience from previous infections. However, much experimental evidence has challenged this view, showing that insects can develop long-term, pathogen-specific immune memory, which in some cases can be transmitted to offspring. Although significant progress has been made in this area, the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood, and a number of fundamental questions remain unanswered. In this review, we present an overview of documented cases of insect immune memory and summarize the experimental evidence in support of the prevailing hypotheses on the mechanism of antiviral and antibacterial immune memory in insects. We also highlight key questions that remain unanswered and discuss <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a powerful model organism for investigating the mechanisms of innate immune memory formation. Finally, we evaluate the significance of this research and explore the potential for insect vaccination.

">Neural adolescent pragmatic development mirrors pragmatic differences in adulthood: an fMRI-study</a></h4>

              
                Pragmatic development is still ongoing during adolescence. However, the developmental trajectory during the adolescent years is understudied and the underlying neural correlates of pragmatic development are unknown. In this study, we used an established fMRI paradigm contrasting indirect and direct speech act processing in a newly acquired adolescent sample (n = 51) and a previously collected adult sample (n = 57). The adolescent sample was split into two groups: Young (ages 13-15) and Mid (ages 16-18); and the adult sample (Old, ages 18-36) into two groups based on pragmatic skill level, established in separate behavioral tests. We observed increased activity with age in the posterior medial prefrontal cortex, and a combination of age-related differences and individual differences in adults in the left posterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the posterior cingulate cortex. These clusters were all located outside of the classical perisylvian language areas ("the language network"). The posterior cingulate cortex cluster overlapped with core nodes of the DMN network. We interpret the IPS finding in terms of its overlap with two relevant networks (one of them is the "multiple demand" network related to cognitive control). The results indicate that young adolescents and adults with low pragmatic skill may be over-interpreting direct speech acts as potentially indirect. The similarity between these two groups across results in turn indicate that a delayed adolescent development may lead to persistent difficulties in adulthood. We have shown that aspects of pragmatic development depend on cognitive abilities other than language and Theory of Mind. By studying adolescence, a presumably uniquely human extended developmental period, we provide a rare empirical angle on the question of which aspects of brain and cultural evolution contributed to the human communicative faculty.

">Influenza A Virus infection is associated with TDP-43 pathology and neuronal damage in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Viral pandemics such as COVID-19 have demonstrated long-term neurological consequences, including memory impairment and depression, emphasizing the importance of understanding virus-brain interactions [1]. Similar concerns have been raised for Influenza A virus (IAV), which has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders [2, 3]. In this study, we investigated the neuropathological effects of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and H5N8 strains in a mouse model. Although viral RNA was detected in the brain post-infection, no viral proteins were found, suggesting limited or transient brain replication. Despite this, infected brains showed significant neuronal damage, including axonal loss and nuclear condensation, as evidenced by immunofluorescence and Nissl staining. We also observed pathological changes in TDP-43, including conformational alterations and increased phosphorylation, which required antigen retrieval for detection, features reminiscent of those found in frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [4, 5]. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed strain-specific host responses, including activation of interferon-related genes and downregulation of microtubule-associated pathways. These findings suggest that IAV infection can trigger hallmarks of neurodegeneration in the absence of persistent viral protein expression, possibly through host-driven mechanisms. Our results underscore the need for further investigation into virus-induced molecular pathways contributing to neurodegenerative disease.

                Background People with dementia have a yearly risk of falling of 60 to 80 percent. Therefore, a walker is often recommended. However, the use of a walker in people with dementia is associated with a threefold increased odds of falls compared to their healthy peers who walk with a walker. Assessing walking skills with a walker can improve the quality of advice on its use. Therefore, a tool to assess functional walking skills with a walker is needed. The SUMAC was developed to fill this gap. So far, there is no Dutch instrument available that can assess functional walking skills with a walker in people with dementia. Methods Reliability was evaluated by scoring videos of people with dementia (n = 9) using a walker performing the SUMAC-NL. ICC was used to assess inter-rater and test-retest reliability. An expert panel (n = 8) evaluated the content validity using the content validity index (CVI) and the content validity ratio (CVR). Results Inter-rater reliability of the SUMAC-NL was statistically significant for the physical function (PF) domain (ICC = 0.94, 95%CI (0.84, 0.98, p < 0.001) and for the interaction with equipment (EQ) domain (ICC = 0.79, 95%CI (0.49 – 0.95), p < 0.001). Test-retest reliability was statistically significant for both the PF domain (ICC = 0.95, 95%CI (0.89, 0.99), p < 0.001) and EQ domain (ICC = 0.92, 95%CI (0.82, 0.98), p < 0.001). The SUMAC-NL shows content validity with a CVI >0.79 for both domains and a CVR of 0.53 on the PF domain and 0.78 on the EQ domain. Conclusions The SUMAC-NL shows good to excellent reliability and content validity for both the PF and the EQ domain. The SUMAC-NL seems to be a promising tool to assess walking with a walker in people with dementia in the Netherlands.

                Abstract Introduction Cultural capital, conceptualized by Bourdieu, is a form of individual capital facilitating social mobility. Although local culture has been recognized as important in global health interventions, epidemiology, which is a key discipline evaluating such interventions, lacks conceptual frameworks and tools to measure cultural capital. This paper aims to identify challenges in adapting Bourdieu’s theory of cultural capital to public health and epidemiology, and to provide proposals to address them. Methods A theory adaptation approach, drawing on insights from public health, epidemiology, cultural anthropology, and related fields. Results and Discussion We identify five key challenges: 1. the epistemological divergence between Bourdieu’s focus on power structures and public health’s focus on health promotion; 2. the need to consider intervention-oriented cultural capital concept; 3. the need to assess cultural capital at the collective level; 4. the need for cultural capital concept that encompasses human nature beyond the social space; and 5. the unclear and inconsistent definitions of culture across research fields. For each challenge, we propose corresponding conceptual frameworks to facilitate the integration of cultural capital into public health and epidemiological research. Finally, we discuss the collective and existential properties of cultural and other forms of capital, arguing the liberating and constraining effects of capital (e.g., the risks of stereotyping specific subpopulations). Conclusion This study represents an initial step toward establishing cultural epidemiology as a field that quantitatively assesses the role of culture in shaping health and well-being. Future empirical research is needed to operationalize and apply these frameworks.

                <p>by Scott Rich, Taufik A. Valiante, Jérémie Lefebvre</p>

Channelopathies affecting the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN or h-) channel and the Kv7 voltage gated m-type potassium (m-) channel present a paradox in epilepsy research: despite experimental evidence that both over- and underexpression of these channels can be epileptogenic, channel overexpression does not appear to increase the excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance as caused by channel underexpression. We here derive a viable mechanism for ictogenesis driven by h- and m-channel overexpression from analysis of an <i>in silico</i> spiking neuronal microcircuit exhibiting spontaneous seizure-like events (SLEs). Such SLEs are dependent upon sufficiently strong gain in two adaptation terms phenomenologically modeling these channels’ effects: voltage homeostasis (h-current) and spike-frequency adaptation (m-current). Excessive gain of these adaptation terms translates high levels of input correlation into population-level deviations from baseline activity, promoting a sequence of network-level events that collectively provoke an SLE. Importantly, these changes do not cause increased excitability in isolated neurons, nor does this cascade require a change in the amplitude of external input to the circuit, suggesting an ictogenic pathway independent of classical changes to the E-I balance. The viability of this mechanism for SLE onset is strengthened by the host of experimentally-characterized features of seizure produced in this model reliant upon the presence of these adaptation terms, including the irregular initiation and termination of SLEs and time-varying peak frequency of oscillations during such events (i.e., chirps). Moreover, the cell-type dependent effects of changes in these adaptation terms, as delineated in our analyses, represent experimentally-testable predictions for future study of h- and m-channelopathies. These computational results provide vital new insights into the epileptogenic nature of h- and m-channel overexpression currently absent in the experimental literature.

                <p>by Ian Syndergaard, Daniel B. Free, Dario Farina, Steven K. Charles</p>

Both closed-loop models and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) models of the neuromusculoskeletal system of the upper limb are important for simulating and understanding motor control. Yet no large-scale linear neuromusculoskeletal models of the upper limb that are both closed-loop and MIMO have been developed. The primary difficulty in creating such models is choosing appropriate feedback parameters (such as feedback gains and delays), as such a collection of parameters is not available in the literature. The purpose of this work is to 1) present a method for developing MIMO models of short-loop afferent feedback and 2) offer estimates of average feedback parameter values and ranges based on the currently available literature. To this end, we combined measurements of feedback-related parameters available in 26 prior studies with known properties of system stability and behavior. As a result, we present estimated feedback gains and delays for a linear model of the upper limb with inputs into the 13 major superficial muscles and outputs to the 7 main joint degrees of freedom from the shoulder to the wrist. This model includes homonymous feedback mediated by Golgi tendon organs and both homonymous and heteronymous feedback mediated by muscle spindles. As a partial validation of muscle-spindle feedback gains, we compared the sign of the estimated gains to known differences in excess central delay between excitatory and inhibitory connections. The comparison proved correct in all 39 muscle pairs for which we had both estimated a feedback gain and found a measured excess central delay value in the literature. Furthermore, as a partial validation of delay times, we compared estimated delay times to measured innervation lengths. We found a strong fit for efferent delays (R = 0.88) and a moderate fit for afferent delays (R = 0.65). In addition, we demonstrate the effect of feedback on model behavior and present brief comparisons between this behavior and experimentally observed behaviors of the human upper limb with and without feedback.

                <p>by Zichao Liu, Yinyun Li</p>

Electrodiffusion plays a crucial role in modulating ion channel conductivity and neural firing dynamics within the nervous system. However, the relationship among ion electrodiffusion, concentration changes, as well as channel conductivity and neuronal discharge behaviors is not quite clear. In this work, we introduce a novel Gauss-Nernst-Planck (GNP) approach to investigate how electrodiffusive dynamics influence ion channel rectification and neural activity. We have analytically demonstrated how the membrane conductance changes along with voltage and ion concentrations due to the electrodiffusive dynamics, bridging the gap between the permeability-based Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) model and conductance-based models. We characterize the rectification properties of GABAA, AMPA and leaky channels by estimating their single-channel permeabilities and conductance. By integrating these rectifying channels into neurodynamic models, our GNP neurodynamic model reveals how electrodiffusive dynamics fundamentally shape neural firing by modulating membrane conductance and the interplay between passive and active ion transport-mechanisms, which exhibits difference from conventional conductance-based neurodynamic models especially when ion concentration accumulates to high levels. Furthermore, we have explored how the electrodiffusive dynamics influence the pathological neural events by modulating the stability of neurodynamic system. This study provides a fundamental mechanistic understanding of electrodiffusion regulation in neural activity and establishes a robust framework for future research in neurophysiology.

β-Amyloid (Aβ) is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase, where BACE1 acting as the rate-limiting enzyme. Elevated BACE1 levels in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients implicate that dysregulated BACE1 expression is crucial to AD pathogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified that the G protein subunit β5 gene (<i>Gnb5</i>), a component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, is significantly downregulated in both human AD patients and AD mouse models. Conditional knockout of <i>Gnb5</i> in excitatory neurons resulted in cognitive impairments, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Gnb5 in the hippocampus ameliorated cognitive deficits and reduced Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Gnb5 interacts with BACE1, modulating its expression and potentially influencing Aβ generation. We further identify the first tryptophan–aspartate domain (WD domain) of Gnb5 and the Ser81 residue as crucial for this regulation. Expression of this WD domain alone is sufficient to reduce Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice, whereas a point mutation at Ser81 (S81L) abolishes this effect. Overall, our findings establish Gnb5 as a negative regulator of the BACE1-APP processing axis and unveil mechanistic insights into its role in Aβ-mediated AD pathogenesis.

                <p>by Julia M. Kreiner, Jacob S. Montgomery, Marco Todesco, Natalia Bercovich, Yunchen Gong, Cassandra Elphinstone, Patrick J. Tranel, Loren H. Rieseberg, Stephen I. Wright</p>

The evolution of separate sexes is hypothesized to occur through distinct pathways involving few large-effect or many small-effect alleles. However, we lack empirical evidence for how these different genetic architectures shape the transition from quantitative variation in sex expression to distinct male and female phenotypes. To explore these processes, we leveraged the recent transition of <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i> to dioecy within a predominantly monoecious genus, along with a sex-phenotyped population genomic dataset, and six newly generated chromosome-level haplotype phased assemblies. We identify a ~3 Mb region strongly associated with sex through complementary SNP genotype and sequence-depth-based analyses. Comparative genomics of these proto-sex chromosomes within the species and across the Amaranthus genus demonstrates remarkable variability in their structure and genic content, including numerous polymorphic inversions. No such inversion underlies the extended linkage we observe associated with sex determination. Instead, we identify a complex presence/absence polymorphism reflecting substantial Y-haplotype variation—structured by ancestry, geography, and habitat—but only partially explaining phenotyped sex. Just over 10% of sexed individuals show phenotype-genotype mismatch in the sex-linked region, and along with observation of leakiness in the phenotypic expression of sex, suggest additional modifiers of sex and dynamic gene content within and between the proto-X and Y. Together, this work reveals a complex genetic architecture of sex determination in <i>A. tuberculatus</i> characterized by the maintenance of substantial haplotype diversity, and variation in the expression of sex.

<p>The past decade has witnessed groundbreaking clinical implementation of neuroprosthetic limbs driven by signals from peripheral targets (eg, nerves and muscle) and the brain to restore limb function for individuals with limb loss or impairment. In this review, we highlight recent key clinical trials in peripheral neuroprosthetic interfaces directly with nerve, residual muscle, and reinnervated muscle. We then highlight the key advances in brain interfaces, including clinical trials using electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and intracortical electrodes to control neuroprosthetics. Finally, we explore the future of neuroprosthetic control where both peripheral and brain interfaces can be combined to improve neuroprosthetic performance. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

In this review, Meriau et al. discuss the mechanisms underlying SGCs’ modulation of neuronal functions in health and disease and their potential to shape peripheral input to the brain.

                Chipman and colleagues identify Sema3a-PlexinA4-ITGB1 as a unifying, trans-synaptic signaling mechanism for presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) at both the cholinergic mouse NMJ and glutamatergic synapses in the adult mouse hippocampus. Hippocampal signaling is necessary for cross-modal inhibitory plasticity and links PHP to a functional and ultrastructural re-organization of synaptic vesicle pools.

                Morabito et al. observed that different neocortical interneuron (IN) populations display distinct dendritic properties by varying synaptic receptor composition and input location. These IN-specific dendritic properties enhance synaptic efficiency but are tailored to different temporal processing modes. In the visual cortex, this mechanism supports the distinct dynamics of PV- and SST-INs.

DCA promotes CaOx crystal deposition via HSP90α-mediated ferroptosis and crystal adhesion, revealing bile acid signaling as a potential therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103796">Evolution of lateralized gustation in nematodes</a></h4>

              
                Animals with small nervous systems have a limited number of sensory neurons that must encode information from a changing environment. This problem is particularly exacerbated in nematodes that populate a wide variety of distinct ecological niches but only have a few sensory neurons available to encode multiple modalities. How does sensory diversity prevail within this constraint in neuron number? To identify the genetic basis for patterning different nervous systems, we demonstrate that sensory neurons in <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i> respond to various salt sensory cues in a manner that is partially distinct from that of the distantly related nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Previously we showed that <i>P. pacificus</i> likely lacked bilateral asymmetry (Hong et al., 2019). Here, we show that by visualizing neuronal activity patterns, contrary to previous expectations based on its genome sequence, the salt responses of <i>P. pacificus</i> are encoded in a left/right asymmetric manner in the bilateral ASE neuron pair. Our study illustrates patterns of evolutionary stability and change in the gustatory system of nematodes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89425">Sex chromosome gene expression associated with vocal learning following hormonal manipulation in female zebra finches</a></h4>

              
                Zebra finches are sexually dimorphic vocal learners. Males learn to sing by imitating mature conspecifics, but females do not. Absence of song in females is associated with partial atrophy and apparent repression of several vocal learning brain regions during development. However, atrophy can be prevented, and vocal learning retained in females when given early pharmacological estrogen treatment. To screen for candidate drivers of this sexual dimorphism, we performed an unbiased transcriptomic analysis of song learning nuclei specializations relative to the surrounding regions from either sex, treated with vehicle or estrogen until 30 days of age when divergence between the sexes becomes anatomically apparent. Analyses of transcriptomes by RNA sequencing identified song nuclei-specialized gene expressed modules associated with sex and estrogen manipulation. Female HVC and Area X gene modules were specialized by estrogen supplementation, exhibiting a subset of the transcriptomic specializations observed in males. Female robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) specialized modules were less dependent on estrogen. The estrogen-induced gene modules in females were enriched for anatomical development functions and strongly correlated to the expression of several Z sex chromosome genes. We present a hypothesis where reduced dosage and expression of these Z chromosome genes suppress the full development of the song system and thus song learning behavior, which is partially rescued by estrogen treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100448">Passive shaping of intra- and intercellular m6A dynamics via mRNA metabolism</a></h4>

              
                m6A is the most widespread mRNA modification and is primarily implicated in controlling mRNA stability. Fundamental questions pertaining to m6A are the extent to which it is dynamically modulated within cells and across stimuli, and the forces underlying such modulation. Prior work has focused on investigating active mechanisms governing m6A levels, such as recruitment of m6A writers or erasers leading to either ‘global’ or ‘site-specific’ modulation. Here, we propose that changes in m6A levels across subcellular compartments and biological trajectories may result from passive changes in gene-level mRNA metabolism. To predict the intricate interdependencies between m6A levels, mRNA localization, and mRNA decay, we establish a differential model ‘m6ADyn’ encompassing mRNA transcription, methylation, export, and m6A-dependent and -independent degradation. We validate the predictions of m6ADyn in the context of intracellular m6A dynamics, where m6ADyn predicts associations between relative mRNA localization and m6A levels, which we experimentally confirm. We further explore m6ADyn predictions pertaining to changes in m6A levels upon controlled perturbations of mRNA metabolism, which we also experimentally confirm. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of m6ADyn in the context of cellular heat stress response, where genes subjected to altered mRNA product and export also display predictable changes in m6A levels, consistent with m6ADyn predictions. Our findings establish a framework for dissecting m6A dynamics and suggest the role of passive dynamics in shaping m6A levels in mammalian systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91979">Expansion-assisted selective plane illumination microscopy for nanoscale imaging of centimeter-scale tissues</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in tissue processing, labeling, and fluorescence microscopy are providing unprecedented views of the structure of cells and tissues at sub-diffraction resolutions and near single molecule sensitivity, driving discoveries in diverse fields of biology, including neuroscience. Biological tissue is organized over scales of nanometers to centimeters. Harnessing molecular imaging across intact, three-dimensional samples on this scale requires new types of microscopes with larger fields of view and working distance, as well as higher throughput. We present a new expansion-assisted selective plane illumination microscope (ExA-SPIM) with aberration-free 1.5 µm×1.5 µm×3 µm optical resolution over a large field of view (10.6×8.0 mm<sup>2</sup>) and working distance (35 mm) at speeds up to 946 megavoxels/s. Combined with new tissue clearing and expansion methods, the microscope allows imaging centimeter-scale samples with 375 nm lateral and 750 nm axial resolution (4× expansion), including entire mouse brains, with high contrast and without sectioning. We illustrate ExA-SPIM by reconstructing individual neurons across the mouse brain, imaging cortico-spinal neurons in the macaque motor cortex, and visualizing axons in human white matter.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103797">Expanding automated multiconformer ligand modeling to macrocycles and fragments</a></h4>

              
                Small molecule ligands exhibit a diverse range of conformations in solution. Upon binding to a target protein, this conformational diversity is reduced. However, ligands can retain some degree of conformational flexibility even when bound to a receptor. In the Protein Data Bank, a small number of ligands have been modeled with distinct alternative conformations that are supported by macromolecular X-ray crystallography density maps. However, the vast majority of structural models are fit to a single-ligand conformation, potentially ignoring the underlying conformational heterogeneity present in the sample. We previously developed qFit-ligand to sample diverse ligand conformations and to select a parsimonious ensemble consistent with the density. While this approach indicated that many ligands populate alternative conformations, limitations in our sampling procedures often resulted in non-physical conformations and could not model complex ligands like macrocycles. Here, we introduce several improvements to qFit-ligand, including integrating RDKit for stochastic conformational sampling. This new sampling method greatly enriches low-energy conformations of small molecules and macrocycles. We further extended qFit-ligand to identify alternative conformations in PanDDA-modified density maps from high-throughput X-ray fragment screening experiments, as well as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy density maps. The new version of qFit-ligand improves fit to electron density and reduces torsional strain relative to deposited single-conformer models and our prior version of qFit-ligand. These advances enhance the analysis of residual conformational heterogeneity present in ligand-bound structures, which can provide important insights for the rational design of therapeutic agents.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98009">Dual-specific autophosphorylation of kinase IKK2 enables phosphorylation of substrate IκBα through a phosphoenzyme intermediate</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and high-fidelity phosphorylation of serine residues at positions 32 and 36 of IκBα by IKK2/β, a highly conserved prototypical Ser/Thr kinase in vertebrates, is critical for canonical NF-κB activation. Here, we report that human IKK2 not only phosphorylates substrate serine residues and autophosphorylates its own activation loop, but also autophosphorylates at a tyrosine residue proximal to the active site and is, therefore, a dual-specificity kinase. We observed that mutation of Y169, an autophosphorylatable tyrosine located at the DFG +1 (DLG in IKK1/α and 2) position, to phenylalanine renders IKK2 incapable of catalyzing phosphorylation at S32 within its IκBα substrate. We also observed that mutation of the phylogenetically conserved ATP-contacting residue K44 in IKK2 to methionine converts IKK2 to an enzyme that no longer catalyzes specific phosphorylation of IκBα at S32 or S36, but rather directs phosphorylation of IκBα at other residues. Lastly, we report evidence of a phospho-relay from autophosphorylated IKK2 to IκBα in the presence of ADP. These observations suggest an unusual evolution of IKK2, in which autophosphorylation of tyrosine(s) in the activation loop and the conserved ATP-contacting K44 residue provide its signal-responsive substrate specificity and ensure fidelity during NF-κB activation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101157">Effects of experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic on optimistically biased belief updating</a></h4>

              
                Optimistically biased belief updating is essential for mental health and resilience in adversity. Here, we asked how experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic affected optimism biases in updating beliefs about the future. One hundred and twenty-three participants estimated the risk of experiencing adverse future life events in the face of belief-disconfirming evidence either outside the pandemic (n=58) or during the pandemic (n=65). While belief updating was optimistically biased and Reinforcement-learning-like outside the pandemic, the bias faded, and belief updating became more rational Bayesian-like during the pandemic. This malleability of anticipating the future during the COVID-19 pandemic was further underpinned by a lower integration of positive belief-disconfirming information, fewer but stronger negative estimations, and more confidence in base rates. The findings offer a window into the putative cognitive mechanisms of belief updating during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven more by quantifying the uncertainty of the future than by the motivational salience of optimistic outlooks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104461">Tissue-specific responses to TFAM and mtDNA copy number manipulation in prematurely ageing mice</a></h4>

              
                Somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are implicated as important drivers of ageing and age-related diseases. Their pathological effect can be counteracted by increasing the absolute amount of wild-type mtDNA via moderately upregulating TFAM, a protein important for mtDNA packaging and expression. However, strong TFAM overexpression can also have detrimental effects as it results in mtDNA hypercompaction and subsequent impairment of mtDNA gene expression. Here, we have experimentally addressed the propensity of moderate TFAM modulation to improve the premature ageing phenotypes of mtDNA mutator mice, carrying random mtDNA mutations. Surprisingly, we detect tissue-specific endogenous compensatory mechanisms acting in mtDNA mutator mice, which largely affect the outcome of TFAM modulation. Accordingly, moderate overexpression of TFAM can have negative and beneficial effects in different tissues of mtDNA mutator mice. We see a similar behavior for TFAM reduction, which improves brown adipocyte tissue homeostasis, while other tissues are unaffected. Our findings highlight that the regulation of mtDNA copy number and gene expression is complex and causes tissue-specific effects that should be considered when modulating TFAM levels. Additionally, we suggest that TFAM is not the sole determinant of mtDNA copy number in situations where oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is compromised, but other important players must be involved.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, with approximately 30% experiencing drug-resistant forms that may require surgical intervention. Accurate localisation of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is crucial for effective treatment, but how best to use intracranial EEG data to delineate the EZ remains unclear. Previous studies have used the directionality of neural activities across the brain to investigate seizure dynamics and localise the EZ. However, the different connectivity measures used across studies have often provided inconsistent insights about the direction and the localisation power of signal flow as a biomarker for EZ localisation. In a data-driven approach, this study employs a large set of 13 distinct directed connectivity measures to evaluate neural activity flow in and out the seizure onset zone (SOZ) during interictal and ictal periods. These measures test the hypotheses of “sink SOZ” (SOZ dominantly receiving neural activities during interictal periods) and “source SOZ” (SOZ dominantly transmitting activities during ictal periods). While the results were different across connectivity measures, several measures consistently supported higher connectivity directed towards the SOZ in interictal periods and higher connectivity directed away during ictal periods. Comparing six distinct metrics of node behaviour in the network, we found that SOZ separates itself from the rest of the network, allowing for the metric of “<span style="font-style:italic;">eccentricity</span>” to localise the SOZ more accurately than any other metrics including “<span style="font-style:italic;">in strength</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic;">out strength</span>.” This introduced a novel biomarker for localising the SOZ, leveraging the discriminative power of directed connectivity measures in an explainable machine learning pipeline. By using a comprehensive, objective, and data-driven approach, this study addresses previously unresolved questions on the direction of neural activities in seizure organisation and sheds light on dynamics of interictal and ictal activity in focal epilepsy.</span>

">Power Pixels: a turnkey pipeline for processing of Neuropixel recordings</a></h4>

              
                There are many open-source tools available for the processing of neuronal data acquired using Neuropixels probes. Each of these tools, focuses on a part of the process from raw data to single neuron activity. For example, SpikeInterface is an incredibly useful Python module for pre-processing and spike sorting of individual recordings. However, there are more steps in between raw data and spikes, such as synchronization of spike times between probes and histological reconstruction of probe insertions. Therefore, we developed Power Pixels, combining the functionality of several packages into one integrated pipeline, which may be run in any lab workflow. It includes pre-processing, spike sorting, neuron-level quality control metrics, synchronization between multiple probes, compression of raw data, and ephys-to-histology alignment. Integrating all these steps into one pipeline greatly simplifies Neuropixels data processing, especially for novel users who might struggle to find their way around all the available code and tools.

">Longitudinal Imaging of Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage Pathology with Iodine-enhanced Micro-CT</a></h4>

              
                Background Iodine-enhanced micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) enables high-resolution three-dimensional imaging of brain architecture. This study aimed to characterize both acute and chronic pathological changes following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) using iodine-enhanced micro-CT. Method Experimental ICH was induced in 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice (n = 76) via stereotaxic injection of either 0.075 U collagenase IV or 30 l autologous blood. Iodine-enhanced micro-CT imaging was performed at 4 hours, 1, 3, and 7 days after intracerebral hemorrhage post-ICH to evaluate hematoma formation and erythrolysis. Chronic alterations, including ventriculomegaly and ipsilateral lesion, were assessed at 28 days post-ICH. In parallel, MRI was conducted at 1, 7, and 28 days following autologous blood injection, followed by micro-CT, to facilitate cross-modality quantitative analysis. Lesion volumes were compared between imaging modalities over time. Results Micro-CT enabled quantification of hematoma volume and erythrolysis in ICH models. Hematomas extended along perivascular pathways toward the cerebral surface in both collagenase- and autologous blood- induced ICH models. At 28 days post-ICH, micro-CT detected ventriculomegaly and hypodense lesions without concurrent expansion of the choroid plexus. Lesion volume measurements derived from micro-CT correlated with those from MRI, enabling quantitatively assessment of iron deposition and hematoma size alterations after ICH. Conclusion Iodine-enhanced micro-CT provides a robust and high-resolution imaging platform for evaluating hematoma evolution, hemolysis, ventricular enlargement, and chronic brain lesions in experimental ICH. When integrated with MRI, these multimodal imaging approaches enhance the characterization of both hematoma volume and iron deposition following ICH.

">Luminal Vascular Dysfunction Drives Rapid Blood Brain Barrier Injury in Hyperglycemic Stroke: Key Roles for Luminal Glycocalyx and Complement</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute hyperglycemia affects approximately 40% of stroke patients and is associated with worse outcomes. The underlying mechanisms linking this metabolic stress to stroke-induced brain injury remains unclear, and effective therapies are lacking. Methods: In a mouse model of acute hyperglycemic stroke, luminal disruption, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, neurological deficit, motor function, and mortality were evaluated. Vascular luminal glycocalyx and complement activation were assessed by immunostaining, with glycocalyx loss confirmed by electron microscopy. Complement C3's causal role was tested using C3 knockout mice and site-targeted inhibition with CR2-Crry. To enhance translational relevance, post-mortem human stroke and control brains were immunostained to assess the association between endothelial glycocalyx loss and vascular complement activation. In a separate stroke patient cohort, soluble complement activation products were measured in pre-thrombectomy plasma, and their predictive value for modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes evaluated using elastic net regression. Results: Hyperglycemic stroke mice exhibited accelerated and more severe BBB breakdown, greater functional deficits, and higher mortality than normoglycemic controls, mirroring clinical observations. Acute hyperglycemia triggered rapid vascular luminal injury characterized by loss of endothelial luminal glycocalyx, luminal IgM/IgG deposition, and vascular complement C3 activation, leading to BBB disruption. This vascular luminal injury was corroborated in human stroke brain tissue. These luminal changes persisted despite glucose normalization and were exacerbated by reperfusion, driving injury into the brain parenchyma. Genetic and pharmacological approaches confirmed vascular complement activation as a causal driver of severe BBB disruption and poor outcomes. Importantly, site-targeted pharmacological inhibition of complement after reperfusion preserved BBB integrity and improved outcomes, defining a time-specific, luminal-directed strategy as a promising adjunct to thrombectomy. Notably, soluble complement activation markers in pre-thrombectomy stroke plasma predicted clinical outcomes, highlighting their potential as pre-intervention markers for patient stratification and tailored therapy. Conclusion: This study reframes acute hyperglycemic stroke as a vascular luminal disorder, establishing a novel Metabolic-Complement-Vascular (MCV) axis linking metabolic stress to endothelial luminal glycocalyx loss, vascular complement activation, and BBB breakdown in both mice and humans. This new mechanistic understanding transforms the therapeutic landscape of hyperglycemic stroke, offering a potential time-defined, luminal-focused adjunct therapy alongside thrombectomy.

">Sephin1 alleviates white matter injury by protecting oligodendrocyte after intracerebral hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                Background: White matter injury (WMI) caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a major neuropathological feature closely associated with neurological impairments such as motor and sensory dysfunction. Oligodendrocytes (OLs), which are responsible for repairing WMI, also suffer severe death resulting from the compression of hematoma and secondary neuroinflammation after ICH. Sephin1, a selective inhibitor of PPP1R15A, has been shown to reduce general protein synthesis and protect OLs by prolonging the integrated stress response (ISR). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Sephin1 in protecting OLs in experimental ICH mice and primary OLs and microglia co-cultures. Methods: We first determined the performance of ICH mice treated with Sephin1 or vehicle in multiple behavioral tests. To investigate dynamic changes in the number of OLs surrounding the hematoma after ICH, we labeled and tracked apoptotic, proliferating, and mature OLs using immunofluorescence staining. Results: Sephin1 treatment improved long-term neurological function after ICH, which was accompanied by a significant alleviation of WMI in the perihematomal region. Our data indicated that Sephin1 dramatically increased the population of OLs in the perihematomal region after ICH by inhibiting OL apoptosis and promoting OL proliferation. Moreover, Sephin1 treatment attenuated neuroinflammation after ICH by inhibiting microglial polarization to the M1 phenotype. In vitro, a co-culture model of primary OLs and microglia demonstrated that Sephin1 preserved the viability of OLs under pro-inflammatory conditions. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that Sephin1 is a promising therapeutic drug to preserve the OLs and alleviate WMI around the hematoma in ICH, highlighting its translational potential to improve long-term neurological recovery in hemorrhagic stroke.

">Switches in Orientation Coding by Mouse Primary Visual Cortex Neurons Depend on Stimulus Predictability.</a></h4>

              
                How the brain processes a stimulus depends on contextual factors, such as whether it is predictable or surprising. While this process has been partially characterized using EEG and fMRI, and invasive cellular approaches, the microcircuit mechanisms responsible for comparing sensory input and expectations remain poorly understood. Here, we combined layer-resolved recordings of single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFP) in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) with a visual oddball paradigm using oriented gratings. Both event-related potentials and firing rates exhibited distinct temporal components across cortical layers and trial types. We identified robust stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), mismatch negativity (MMN), and deviant detection (DD) contrast at both early and late epochs. Surprisingly, a substantial subset of excitatory neurons exhibited complete reversals of orientation preference ("preference switches") between standard and deviant trials, rather than only changes in selectivity. These preference-switching cells were primarily observed in layers 2/3 and 5/6 and contributed as much information to stimulus decoding as stably tuned neurons. Our findings demonstrate that context-dependent flexibility in feature preference is an integral part of predictive coding in V1 and challenge the notion of fixed stimulus representations at the single-neuron level.

">Intrinsic mechanisms contributing to the biophysical signature of mouse gamma motoneurons</a></h4>

              
                Precise motor control relies on continuous sensory feedback from muscles, a process in which gamma motoneurons play a key role. These specialized spinal neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibres, modulating their sensitivity to stretch and maintaining proprioceptive signalling during movement. Gamma motoneurons are characterized by a distinct biophysical profile, including low recruitment thresholds and high firing rates that enable rapid activation of intrafusal fibres at contraction onset. Despite their importance, the intrinsic mechanisms that underlie these properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we analysed published and unpublished data to identify a population of low-threshold, high-gain motoneurons with features consistent with gamma motoneurons, emerging during the third postnatal week in mice. Their low recruitment threshold was linked to lower membrane capacitance, higher input resistance, a more hyperpolarized activation of persistent inward currents (PICs), and a narrower axon initial segment. In contrast, higher firing rates were associated not with PIC amplitude but with shorter action potential durations and smaller medium afterhyperpolarizations. Notably, 92% of putative gamma motoneurons exhibited a sodium pump-mediated ultra-slow afterhyperpolarization (usAHP), which was absent in slow alpha motoneurons. This difference could not be attributed to h-current activity or expression of the alpha 3 subunit of the sodium-potassium ATPase. These findings reveal key intrinsic properties that support the unique excitability of gamma motoneurons, offering new insight into their contribution to motor control. This work provides a foundation for future studies into their development, regulation, and involvement in neuromuscular disorders.

">Spatial Reorganization of Object Representations in High-Level Visual Cortex Distinguishes Working Memory from Perception</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system balances veridical object visual perception with flexible object visual working memory (VWM), both relying on high-level visual regions. However, how these competing demands shape spatial representations remains unclear. Here, we ask whether VWM inherits the spatial constraints observed in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) during perception, or instead reorganizes these representations to meet mnemonic demands. Using matched bilateral presentation paradigms and fMRI-based decoding, we systematically compared spatial representations during perception and VWM. This approach revealed a striking dissociation: during perception, object information is largely confined to the contralateral LOC, whereas during VWM, robust ipsilateral representations emerge--even when both hemifields must be remembered. Vertex-ablation analyses revealed that VWM engages 70-90% of ipsilateral LOC territories, far exceeding those recruited during unilateral perception. Neither increased attentional span nor top-down feedback from association areas fully explained this expansion; rather, ipsilateral LOC patterns closely mirrored contralateral sensory representations, implicating interhemispheric coordination in VWM. Together, these findings demonstrate that object VWM flexibly recruits distributed high-level visual cortex, with spatial reorganization distinguishing mnemonic flexibility from perceptual fidelity.

">IP3-mediated Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria stimulates ATP synthesis in primary hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                During electrical activity, Ca2+ enhances mitochondrial ATP production, helping to replenish the energy consumed during this process. Most Ca2+ enters the cell via ligand- or voltage-gated channels on the neuronal membrane, where it stimulates the release of additional Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although the influence of cytosolic Ca2+ on neuronal metabolism has been widely investigated, relatively few studies have explored the contribution of ER Ca2+ release in this context. Therefore, we investigated how activity-driven Ca2+ crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria influences the regulation of mitochondrial ATP production. We show that in primary hippocampal neurons derived from rat pups of either sex, depletion of ER Ca2+ led to a reduction in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels during both resting and stimulated states, while exerting only a minimal impact on cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Additionally, impaired ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer led to a reduction in mitochondrial ATP production. Similar effects were observed when inositol-3-phosphate receptors (IP3Rs), but not ryanodine receptors (RyRs), were pharmacologically inhibited. Together, our findings show that, in hippocampal neurons, Ca2+ is transferred from the ER to mitochondria through IP3 receptors, and this Ca2+ crosstalk in turn enhances mitochondrial ATP production in response to neuronal activity.

">Early postnatal CA3 hyperexcitability drives hippocampal development and epileptogenesis in SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies caused by pathogenic variants in SCN2A (SCN2A-DEE), encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, present with early-life seizures, developmental delay, and increased mortality. Using a novel Scn2a p.A263V gain-of-function (GOF) mouse model, we demonstrate gene-dose and background-dependent phenotypes ranging from self-limited neonatal seizures to chronic epilepsy with high mortality. In vivo electrophysiology revealed hippocampal seizures as early as postnatal day 2.5, with CA3-driven gamma oscillations preceding seizure onset. CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibited transient hyperexcitability during early postnatal development, resolving by P24-30. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered gene dose-dependent accelerated maturation of hippocampal networks, peaking at P7, alongside widespread transcriptional changes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In adulthood, persistent hippocampal network alterations emerged, marked by reduced mid-gamma oscillations and theta-gamma coupling. Our findings establish hippocampal CA3 hyperexcitability as an early driver of epileptogenesis in SCN2A-DEE and highlight it as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate disease progression.

">Interleaved Replay of Novel and Familiar Memory Traces During Slow-Wave Sleep Prevents Catastrophic Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals can learn continuously, acquiring new knowledge and integrating it into a pool of lifelong memories. Memory replay during sleep has been proposed as a powerful mechanism contributing to interference-free new learning. In contrast, artificial neural networks suffer from a problem called catastrophic forgetting, where new training damages existing memories. This issue can be mitigated by interleaving training on new tasks with past data; however, whether the brain employs this strategy remains unknown. In this work, we show that slow-wave sleep (SWS) employs an interleaved replay of familiar cortical and novel hippocampal memory traces within individual Up states of the slow oscillation (SO), allowing new memories to be embedded into the existing pool of cortical memories without interference. Using a combination of biophysical modeling and analyses of single-unit activity from the mouse retrosplenial cortex - for a mouse trained first in a highly familiar environment and then in a novel one - we found that hippocampal ripples arriving near the Down-to-Up or Up-to-Down transitions of the sleep SO can entrain novel memory replay, while the middle phase of the Up state tends to replay familiar cortical memories. This strategy ensures the consolidation of novel cortical memory traces into long-term storage while minimizing damage to familiar ones. This study presents a novel framework for how replay of familiar and novel memory traces is organized during SWS to enable continual learning.

">Altered Brain Energy Metabolism in the APPPS1 Alzheimer's Model during anesthesia: Integration of Experimental Data and In Silico Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Background: Synaptic transmission and network activity rely on high ATP turnover. Impairments in cerebral energy metabolism are increasingly recognized as central in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Elderly patients and patients with AD are also at elevated risk for perioperative neurological complications, including post-operative delirium and further cognitive deterioration. However, the interaction between metabolic vulnerability and anesthetic exposure remains incompletely understood. Methods: We investigated cortical metabolic responses and potassium homeostasis in acute brain slices from wild-type (WT) and AD-like APPPS1 transgenic mice, which were either exposed to isoflurane or left untreated. Glia cells were assessed by staining microglia and astrocytes. Measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), extracellular potassium dynamics, and proteomic profiling were integrated with computational modeling to assess oxidative metabolism and anesthetic effects under different conditions. Results: APPPS1 mice exhibited reduced CMRO2 and attenuated neuronal activity compared to age-matched WT controls, showing sex-specific differences. Proteomic analysis revealed the downregulation of key mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes, indicating an impaired ATP-generating capacity. Exposure to isoflurane further suppressed CMRO2, with a more pronounced effect in the APPPS1 brain tissue, while glia cells exhibited no acute changes. Additionally, isoflurane exacerbated deficits in extracellular potassium ([K]) clearance, highlighting impaired ion homeostasis under anesthetic challenge. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that AD-like pathology in APPPS1 mice is associated with a significant decline in oxidative metabolism and ATP availability. These deficits are exacerbated by anesthetic exposure, contributing to impaired potassium regulation. This suggests that diminished metabolic flexibility may underlie increased anesthetic vulnerability and postoperative complications in AD.

">Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics Modulate TRPV1 Channel Activation via Tissue Entropy Production</a></h4>

              
                Inflammatory processes involve complex interactions between molecular signaling and biophysical mechanisms, yet the thermodynamic consequences of such processes remain underexplored. Here, we present a theoretical multiscale model that demonstrates how elevated entropy production in inflamed tissue environments modulates the activation threshold of TRPV1 thermosensitive ion channels. Our framework integrates axonal electrophysiology based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, thermodynamic heat transfer with explicit entropy generation, and a dynamic model of TRPV1 channel gating. Simulations reveal that increased entropy production leads to a downward shift in the activation temperature of TRPV1 channels, driven by cumulative non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects. This result provides a mechanistic explanation for the enhanced excitability of sensory axons in inflamed tissue and highlights entropy production as a fundamental physical variable influencing ion channel behavior. The study contributes a novel perspective on the coupling between thermodynamics and sensory transduction at the cellular level.

">Forgetting in Drosophila consists of an increase in uncertainty rather than a stochastic loss of memory</a></h4>

              
                While forgetting has been studied extensively in various organisms, its precise nature has often been unclear. Here, we used behavioral experiments in Drosophila to determine that a significant aspect of forgetting consists of a decrease in the ability of a memory to induce an appropriate behavior. We tested flies for memory retention at various times after training and then separately retested both flies that chose correctly and those that chose incorrectly. Although the ability to choose correctly decreased over time, we could not measure any differences in memory between flies that initially chose correctly and those that chose incorrectly upon retest. This suggests that forgetting is unlikely to consist of a spontaneous loss of a memory but instead consists of a decrease in the probability of flies that remember choosing the correct behavioral response. Thus, although flies maintain memory over time, there is an increase in uncertainty associated with this memory. We find that forgetting of long-term memories and accelerated forgetting in old flies occur in a similar manner.

">TRPML3 regulates neuronal gene expression in an in vitro model of autophagy and may act as a genetic marker of familial neurodegenerative disorders</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a conserved pro-survival pathway for delivering misfolded proteins and damaged organelles to lysosomes for degradation and protein homeostasis. Anomaly in autophagy leads to aberrant protein aggregation in neuronal cells, which is a common etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Endo-lysosomal cation channel TRPML3 (Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin-3) has been shown to induce autophagy in cell line models. However, the mechanism of TRPML3 mediated autophagy induction and the underlying gene expression changes are not clearly understood. Here, by using Ca2+- and electrical-current measurements, RNA sequencing and RT PCR studies, we explored the cellular function of TRPML3 and the global transcriptomic profile in a cell-based serum starvation model of autophagy. We report that serum starvation leads to downregulation of neuronal developmental genes during autophagy induction. TRPML3 overexpression further amplifies the effect of starvation in downregulating neuronal gene expression. But, when nutrition is not a limiting condition, TRPML3 overexpression upregulated neuronal genes including those responsible for axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and dendritic arborization. TRPML3 mediated neuronal gene expression changes were, presumably, due to transcription factors (TF) TFEB, FOXO1 and neuron-specific TFs such as SOX2, and ETV5. To further validate the role of TRPML3 in neuronal gene regulation, we performed meta-analysis of publicly available RNAseq datasets on neurodegenerative disorders which provided insight into the heterogeneity in the molecular mechanisms of autophagy and corroborated the TFEB-mediated autophagy induction and neuronal gene expression in TRPML3 overexpression condition. Based on our results, we propose that TRPML3 may act as a potential genetic marker for familial neurodegenerative disorders.

">The Vomeronasal System of Talpa occidentalis: A Combined Histological, Immunohistochemical, and Lectin-Binding Approach</a></h4>

              
                The vomeronasal system (VNS) is critical for detecting pheromonal cues that modulate sociosexual behaviors. Despite its central role in chemical communication, our understanding of its anatomical and functional variability across mammals remains incomplete. This study provides the first detailed characterization of the VNS in the Iberian mole (Talpa occidentalis), a fossorial species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We performed a morphofunctional and neurochemical analysis of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) using histology, immunohistochemistry, and lectin histochemistry. The VNO in T. occidentalis exhibited an unusual circular lumen lined by a uniform sensory epithelium, lacking the dual epithelial organization seen in most species. The vomeronasal cartilage was limited in extent and did not form the typical J-shaped structure. Importantly, no evidence of a vomeronasal pump was found, suggesting alternative mechanisms for semiochemical entry, likely facilitated by the anatomical position of the organ and continuous receptor distribution. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong expression of Gai2 and Gg8 in sensory neurons, with weaker Ga0 expression, suggesting predominance of V1R-type signal transduction. The AOB, though small, exhibited clear lamination and specific marker localization (Gai2, OMP, CR, MAP2), indicating robust functional organization. Lectin binding revealed specific glycosylation patterns in the glomerular layer, with STL and LEA marking synaptic regions. These findings uncover unprecedented anatomical and molecular features in the VNS of T. occidentalis, positioning this species as a valuable model for studying vomeronasal diversity and evolution among Laurasiatherian mammals.

">Identification of Small Molecule Dimethyoxyphenyl Piperazine Inhibitors of Alpha-Synuclein Fibril Growth</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (asyn) fibril accumulation is the defining feature of Parkinson disease and is a target for disease-modifying treatments. One therapeutic strategy to reduce fibril accumulation is inhibition of asyn fibril growth. We developed a sensitive fluorescence-based fibril growth assay to screen for small molecule inhibitors. After validating the inhibition assay using a previously identified inhibitor, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, we identified compound 1 as a lead for inhibition of fibril growth. We analysed structure-activity relationships with analogs of 1 to optimize inhibition potency. Our results identified two dimethoxyphenyl piperazine analogs with more potent inhibition of in-vitro assembled fibrils. These analogs also inhibited the growth of asyn fibrils amplified from Lewy Body Disease brain tissue, further validating the inhibitor screening assay. Molecular docking studies indicate that these compounds can bind to the fibril ends, suggesting a potential capping mechanism through which these compounds inhibit the sequential association of monomeric asyn required for fibril growth.

">Identifying out-of-voxel echoes in edited MRS with phase cycle inversion</a></h4>

              
                Purpose To identify the origin of out-of-voxel (OOV) signals based on the coherence transfer pathway (CTP) formalism using signal phase conferred by the acquisition phase cycling scheme. Knowing the CTP driving OOV artifacts enables optimization of crusher gradients to improve their suppression without additional data acquisition. Theory and Methods A phase cycle systematically changes the phase of RF pulses across the transients of an experiment, encoding phase shifts into the data that can be used to suppress unwanted CTPs. We present a new approach, phase cycle inversion (PCI), which removes the receiver phase originally applied to the stored transients, replacing it with new receiver phases, matching the phase evolutions associated with each unwanted CTP, to identify the OOV signals. We demonstrated the efficacy of PCI using the MEGA-edited PRESS sequence in simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. Based on these findings, the crusher gradient scheme was optimized. Results The simulation results demonstrated that PCI can fully separate signals originating from different CTPs using a complete phase cycling scheme. PCI effectively identified the CTP responsible for OOV signals in phantom experiments and in vivo, though with reduced specificity in vivo due to phase instabilities. Re-optimization of the gradient scheme based on the identified OOV-associated CTP to suppress these signals, resulted in cleaner spectra in six volunteers. Conclusion PCI can be broadly applied across pulse sequences and voxel locations, making it a flexible and generalizable approach for diagnosing the CTP origin of OOV signals.

">Stretching of the insect mechanoreceptor evokes mechano-electrical transduction in auditory chordotonal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Insect proprioception, vibration and sound detection rely on the scolopidium--a mechanosensory unit enclosing the sensory cilium of chordotonal organ neurons. The cilium contains mechanosensitive ion channels, and is enclosed by a scolopale cell with its tip embedded in a cap. Despite knowledge of the scolopidium's structure in multiple insects, the mechanism by which mechanical force elicits the transduction current remains speculative. We examined scolopidia in the auditory Muller's organ of the desert locust and present a comprehensive three-dimensional ultrastructure of a scolopidium using Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM). Next, we characterised sound-evoked motions of Muller's organ and the scolopidium using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and high-speed light microscopy. We further measured transduction currents via patch clamp electrophysiology during mechanical stimulation of individual scolopidia. By combining ultrastructure, sound-evoked motions, and transduction current recordings, our finding suggests that the scolopidium is activated best by stretch along the ciliary axis.

">Triceps Surae Muscle Ia Proprioceptive Weighting During Quiet Stance with Vision Occlusion</a></h4>

              
                Visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and cutaneous sensory information is important for posture control during quiet stance. When the reliability of one source of sensory information used to detect self-motion for posture control is reduced, there may be a reweighting of inputs within and/or across the remaining sensory systems determining self-motion for postural control. Muscle vibration, which creates an illusion of muscle stretch and a compensatory movement to shorten the vibrated muscle, may be used to determine the weighting of muscle spindle Ia proprioception for posture control. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vision occlusion on triceps surae muscle Ia proprioceptive weighting for postural control during quiet stance, utilizing 80 Hz muscle vibration and a quantitative measure of the bodys anterior to posterior ground center of pressure response to triceps surae muscle vibration in freely standing subjects. Subjects (N = 41; mean(standard deviation), 19.6(2.0) years) were examined as they stood with eyes open or eyes closed. Ground center of pressure was measured during quiet standing with, and without, bilateral vibration of the triceps surae muscles. The mean backward center of pressure shift induced by triceps surae vibration was significantly greater during the eyes closed condition compared to eyes open (eyes closed: -4.93(1.62) centimeters; eyes open: -3.21(1.33) centimeters; p = 6.85E-10; Cohens d = 1.29). Thirty-seven subjects increased, and two subjects decreased, their vibration induced center of pressure backward shift in the eyes closed condition compared to eyes open, although the magnitude of the change varied. Results support the idea that for most subjects, during an eyes closed stance there is an increased triceps surae muscle Ia proprioceptive weighting for postural control, due to the need for posture control to depend more on non-visual feedback.

">Prior knowledge influences the neural mechanisms supporting memory-based inference</a></h4>

              
                Memory-based inference allows individuals to integrate information acquired across separate episodes to support novel decisions and reasoning. Although prior knowledge, such as schemas, is known to influence learning and memory, its impact on the neural mechanisms underlying inference remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how schema congruency affects the encoding and retrieval of overlapping events and how these processes contribute to memory-based inference. Thirty-nine participants encoded AB associations, consisting of picture-word pairs presented on either schema-congruent or schema-incongruent backgrounds. These were followed by BC associations involving the same word paired with a new picture on a neutral background. At test, participants were asked to infer the indirect AC association. While overall inference accuracy did not differ as a function of schema congruency, behavioral and neural data revealed distinct mechanisms. Inference for schema-incongruent events depended on accurate retrieval of both AB and BC associations, whereas schema-congruent inferences did not. To investigate the neural processes involved, we trained hierarchical multivariate pattern classifiers on EEG data to detect schema and context reinstatement during task performance. For schema-congruent events, successful inference was predicted by schema reinstatement during BC encoding, consistent with integrating overlapping information into a unified memory trace. In contrast, successful inference for schema-incongruent events was predicted by context reinstatement during AC retrieval, reflecting a reliance on flexible recombination of separate memory representations. These findings demonstrate that schema congruency modulates the neural basis of memory-based inference. Congruent events are integrated during encoding, whereas incongruent events rely on retrieval-based inference. Keywords: memory integration, schema, congruency, context, MVPA, EEG

">Heterogeneity and variability in short term synaptic plasticity and implications for signal transformation</a></h4>

              
                There are many sources of heterogeneity in the CA1 network, including plasticity, connectivity and cell properties, yet the extent and functional consequences of this diversity remains poorly understood. We used patterned optogenetic stimulation of CA3 pyramidal neurons and whole-cell patch clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, to characterize the contributions of different forms of heterogeneity to information flow. We found pronounced heterogeneity in synaptic responses and short-term plasticity (STP), influenced by the neurotransmitter identity, input pattern, and size of the activated presynaptic ensemble. Inhibitory synapses exhibited greater diversity in both response variability and depression profiles than excitatory synapses. We incorporated these readings in a molecule-to-network multiscale model of the CA3->CA1 circuit. The reference model shows strong decorrelation of autocorrelated input, but removal of STP makes the decorrelation frequency dependent. Removal of stochasticity and heterogeneity in connections makes the output periodic. Thus heterogeneity, short-term plasticity, and stochasticity each have distinct effects on cellular information transmission.

">Inhibition of nonsense-mediated decay in TDP-43 deficient neurons reveals novel cryptic exons</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is an essential splicing repressor whose loss of function underlies the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD). Nuclear clearance of TDP-43 disrupts its function and leads to the inclusion of aberrant cryptic exons. These cryptic exons frequently introduce premature termination codons resulting in the degradation of affected transcripts through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Conventional RNA sequencing approaches thus may fail to detect cryptic exons that are efficiently degraded by NMD, precluding identification of potential therapeutic targets. We generated a comprehensive set of neuronal targets of TDP-43 in human iPSC-derived i3Neurons (i3N) by combining TDP-43 knockdown with inhibition of multiple factors essential for NMD, revealing novel cryptic targets. We then restored expression of selected NMD targets in TDP-43 deficient i3Ns and determined which genes improved neuronal viability. Our findings highlight the role of NMD in masking cryptic splicing events and identify novel potential therapeutic targets for TDP-43-related neurodegenerative disorders.

">SORLA upregulation suppresses global pathological effects in aged tauopathy mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                A role for the trafficking receptor SORLA in reducing A{beta} levels has been well-established, however, relatively little is known with respect to whether and how SORLA can potentially affect tau pathology in vivo. Here, we show that transgenic SORLA upregulation (SORLA TG) can reverse pathological effects in aged PS19 (P301S tau) mouse brain, including tau phosphorylation and seeding, ventricle dilation, synapse loss, LTP impairment and glial hyperactivation. Proteomic analysis indicates reversion of PS19 profiles in PS19/SORLA TG hippocampus, including pathological changes in synapse-related proteins as well as key drivers of synaptic dysfunction such as Apoe and C1q. snRNA-seq analysis reveals suppression of PS19- signatures with SORLA upregulation, including proinflammatory induction of Plxnb1/Plxnb2 in glia. Tau seeding and aggregation, neuroinflammation, as well as PlxnB1/B2 induction are exacerbated in PS19 hippocampus with SORLA deletion. These results implicate a global role for SORLA in neuroprotection from tau toxicity in PS19 mouse brain.

">A systematic protocol to identify 'clinical controls' for pediatric neuroimaging research from clinically acquired brain MRIs</a></h4>

              
                Progress at the intersection of artificial intelligence and pediatric neuroimaging necessitates large, heterogeneous datasets to generate robust and generalizable models. Retrospective analysis of clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans offers a promising avenue to augment prospective research datasets, leveraging the extensive repositories of scans routinely acquired by hospital systems in the course of clinical care. Here, we present a systematic protocol for identifying scans with limited imaging pathology through machine-assisted manual review of radiology reports. The protocol employs a standardized grading scheme developed with expert neuroradiologists and implemented by non-clinician graders. Categorizing scans based on the presence or absence of significant pathology and image quality concerns, facilitates the repurposing of clinical brain MRI data for brain research. Such an approach has the potential to harness vast clinical imaging archives exemplified by over 250,000 brain MRIs at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia to address demographic biases in research participation, to increase sample size, and to improve replicability in neurodevelopmental imaging research. Ultimately, this protocol aims to enable scalable, reliable identification of clinical control brain MRIs, supporting large-scale, generalizable neuroimaging studies of typical brain development and neurogenetic conditions.

">Dietary restriction promotes neuronal resilience via ADIOL</a></h4>

              
                The steroid hormone 5-androstene-3{beta},17{beta}-diol (ADIOL) was discovered in humans nearly a century ago, yet its physiological roles remain poorly defined. Here, we show that fasting and caloric restriction, two forms of dietary restriction, induce transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and 17{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family enzymes, promoting ADIOL biosynthesis. ADIOL, in turn, acts on the nervous system to reduce levels of kynurenic acid, a neuroactive metabolite linked to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This effect requires NHR-91, the C. elegans homolog of estrogen receptor {beta}, specifically in the RIM neuron, a key site of kynurenic acid production. Consistent with the known benefits of fasting and caloric restriction on healthspan, enhancing ADIOL signaling improves multiple healthspan indicators during aging. Conversely, animals deficient in ADIOL signaling exhibit reduced healthspan under normal conditions and in genetic models of caloric restriction, underscoring the functional significance of this pathway. Furthermore, ADIOL suppresses cellular stresses induced by the Alzheimer's-associated APOE4 variant, highlighting its potential as a neuroprotective agent. Notably, ADIOL does not significantly impact lifespan, indicating that its healthspan benefits are not simply a byproduct of lifespan extension. Together, these findings establish a physiological role for ADIOL in mediating the neuroprotective and pro-healthspan effects of fasting and caloric restriction and suggest that boosting ADIOL signaling may help narrow the gap between lifespan and healthspan. This positions ADIOL as a promising mimetic of dietary restriction effects on healthspan that could be used as a therapeutic strategy for age-related neurodegenerative conditions.

">The effects of gait speed on the responses to immediate and prolonged exposure to mediolateral optic flow perturbation in healthy young adults</a></h4>

              
                Background: Optic flow is vital for locomotor control and is often perturbed to study the impact of optic flow on balance control. However, it remains unclear whether gait speed influences responses to such perturbations. This study aims to examine the effects of gait speed on gait parameters following immediate and prolonged exposure to mediolateral optic flow perturbations. Methods: Twenty-one young adults (23.43 +/- 4.19 years) walked on an instrumented treadmill, including 3 phases: baseline (3 min), perturbation with mediolateral optic flow (8 min), and post-perturbation (3 min). Trials were conducted at 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 m/s. Ground reaction forces and 3D motion data were collected to calculate mediolateral margin of stability (MoS), mean step length (SL), step width (SW) and their variabilities. Three repeated-measures ANOVAs (Speed by Phase) were used to compare: baseline vs. early perturbation, early vs. late perturbation, and baseline vs. post-perturbation. Results: The responses to immediate and prolonged exposure to optic flow perturbation were speed dependent. Walking at slow speeds induced greater immediate responses in mediolateral gait parameters (SW and mediolateral MoS, both p < 0.001) compared to walking at faster speeds. During the perturbation phase, the adaptations were larger at faster vs. slower speeds for gait parameters in the direction of movement (SL, p = 0.007). Conclusion: Immediate responses and adaptations to mediolateral optic flow perturbations are speed-dependent and larger at slower gait speeds. The responses to prolonged perturbation are interpreted as step-to-step adaptations that may inform future interventions and studies on gait speed selection.

">Cortical dissociation of spatial reference frames during place navigation</a></h4>

              
                Animals rely on both sensory perception and memory when navigating relative to learned allocentric locations. Incoming sensory stimuli, which arrive from an egocentric perspective, must be integrated into an allocentric reference frame to allow neural computations that direct an animal toward a learned goal. This egocentric-allocentric spatial transformation has been proposed to involve projections from the rodent postrhinal cortex (POR), which receives strong visual input, to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which contains allocentric spatial cell types such as grid and border cells. A major step toward understanding this transformation is to identify how POR and MEC spatial representations differ during place navigation, which is currently unknown. To answer this question, we recorded single neurons from POR and MEC as rats engaged in a navigation task that required them to repeatedly visit a learned uncued allocentric location in an open field arena to receive a randomly scattered food reward. While neurons in both regions displayed strong tuning to the spatial structure of the environment, neither showed bias toward the goal location despite strongly biased behavior. Critically, when local visual landmarks were manipulated to place the visual scene in conflict with the learned location, POR neurons adjusted their tuning preferences to follow the visual landmarks, while MEC neurons remained in register with the true global reference frame. These findings reveal a strong dissociation between POR and MEC spatial reference frames during place navigation and raise questions regarding the mechanisms underlying integration of POR egocentric signals into the MEC allocentric spatial map.

">Motor Learning Outside the Body: Broad Skill Generalisation with an Extra Robotic Limb</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to transfer motor skills across tools and contexts is what makes modern technology usable. The success of motor augmentation devices, such as supernumerary robotic limbs, hinges on users' capacity for generalised motor performance. We trained participants over seven days to use an extra robotic thumb (Third Thumb, Dani Clode Design), worn on the right hand and controlled via the toes. We tested whether motor learning was confined to the specific tasks and body parts involved in controlling and interacting with the Third Thumb, or whether it could generalise beyond them. Participants showed broad skill generalisation across tasks, body postures, and even when either the Third Thumb or the controller was reassigned to a different body part, suggesting the development of abstract, body-independent motor representations. Training also reduced cognitive demands and increased the sense of agency over the device. However, participants still preferred using their biological hand over the Third Thumb when given the option, suggesting that factors beyond motor skill generalisation, cognitive effort, and embodiment must be addressed to support the real-world adoption of such technologies.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Previous studies have shown that lanthionine ketimine ethyl ester (LKE), a semi-synthetic derivative of the endogenous amino acid lanthionine, can induce proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in vivo. In the current study, we examined the effects of LKE on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in primary mouse OPCs, as intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can regulate those processes. Treatment with LKE stimulated proliferation of OPCs and increased the number of Olig2+, CC1+, and PLP+ cells. LKE also reduced cell death (caspase-3 expressing cells). Measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux showed that LKE increased basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following stimulation with glutamate or ATP, and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux because of depolarization with KCl. Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were also observed following treatment with a peptide that disrupts interactions of collapsin response mediated protein 2 (CRMP2), a primary target of LKE. These findings demonstrate regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in OPCs by LKE and suggest that these actions may be mediated, in part, by CRMP2. LKE or related analogs could therefore be of benefit for the treatment of multiple sclerosis as well as other demyelinating conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-634/v1?src=rss">Prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practice among young people in Ethiopia: systematic review and Meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Young people in developing nations are particularly affected by HIV infection, which primarily spreads through sexual contact, including anal, oral, and vaginal sex. Heterosexual couples engage in female anal sex, a receptive sexual behavior in which the penis is placed in the female partner’s anus. Anal intercourse has a higher risk of HIV transmission than vaginal intercourse, especially when there is appropriately low condom use, and the majority of couples are unaware of the risk of HIV transmission during anal intercourse. PROSPERO Registration number CRD42024629445 Objectives of the review To determine the pooled prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practices among young Ethiopian people. Methods This systematic review of peer reviews published in English up to January 31, 2025, measures heterosexual anal and oral sex practices and contributing factors among young people in Ethiopia. STATA version 17 software was used to analyze the pooled prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practices among young people in Ethiopia. Result Female young people were 2.45 times more likely to engage in heterosexual anal sex practice 95%CI, OR 4.05[1.57-3.33]. Young people who were living alone were 2.50 more likely involved in heterosexual anal sex practice with 95% CI, OR 2.50[1.60-3.40]).Those young people who live alone were 1.91 more likely engaged in heterosexual oral sex practice with 95% CI, OR 1.91[1.7-2.12]. Young people whose intimate partners engaged in heterosexual oral sex practice were 5.13 times more likely to engage in heterosexual oral sex practice in Ethiopia. Conclusions The pooled prevalence of heterosexual oral and anal sex practices in Ethiopia is high. Living alone and female sex were associated with heterosexual anal sex practices, while intimate partner engagement in oral heterosexual sex practice was associated with heterosexual oral sex practice among young people in Ethiopia.

                Background Precision medicine is an emerging approach that tailors treatments based on an individual’s genetic profile. The UAE has made significant strides in this field through initiatives like the National Genomics Strategy and the Emirati Genome Program. However, public awareness and engagement remain key challenges. Purpose This study assesses awareness, acceptance, and utilization of precision medicine among UAE residents. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a snowball sampling method, The survey collected demographic data, health status, knowledge, and experiences with precision medicine. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to analyze associations. Results Most participants (94.3%) were under 50 years old, 62.5% were female, and 60.0% held a bachelor’s degree. Awareness of precision medicine was moderate (55.3%), with higher familiarity among females and students. While 40% believed its main benefit was optimizing drug effectiveness, 38.5% viewed it as crucial for preventing adverse drug reactions. Family and friends (29.5%) were the primary sources of information, yet 25.5% had never heard of precision medicine. Awareness of insurance coverage was low, with 59.0% uncertain about their policy. Genetic testing participation was associated with education level (p < 0.05). Acceptance of precision medicine was higher among individuals with chronic illnesses (p = 0.004). Familiarity scores varied significantly by occupation (p < 0.001) and income (p = 0.004), with higher-income individuals showing greater awareness. Males had a broader range of practice scores (p = 0.003), and individuals with chronic conditions were more aware of precision medicine (p = 0.023). Conclusion Despite advancements, public engagement with precision medicine remains limited. Targeted educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and increased awareness of insurance coverage may enhance adoption and utilization.

                <p>by Yuxi Long, Bruce R. Donald</p>

Accurate binding affinity prediction (BAP) is crucial to structure-based drug design. We present PATH+, a novel, generalizable machine learning algorithm for BAP that exploits recent advances in computational topology. Compared to current binding affinity prediction algorithms, PATH+ shows similar or better accuracy and is more generalizable across orthogonal datasets. PATH+ is not only one of the most accurate algorithms for BAP, it is also the first algorithm that is inherently interpretable. Interpretability is a key factor of trust for an algorithm and alongside generalizability, allows PATH+ to be trusted in critical applications, such as inhibitor design. We visualized the features captured by PATH+ for two clinically relevant protein-ligand complexes and find that PATH+ captures binding-relevant structural mutations that are corroborated by biochemical data. Our work also sheds light on the features captured by current computational topology BAP algorithms that contributed to their high performance, which have been poorly understood. PATH+ also offers an improvement of 𝒪(m+n)3 in computational complexity and is empirically over 10 times faster than the dominant (uninterpretable) computational topology algorithm for BAP. Based on insights from PATH+, we built PATH−, a scoring function for differentiating between binders and non-binders that has outstanding accuracy against 11 current algorithms for BAP. In summary, we report progress in a novel combination of interpretability, speed, and accuracy that should further empower topological screening of large virtual inhibitor libraries to protein targets, and allow binding affinity predictions to be understood and trusted. The source code for PATH+ and PATH− are released open-source as part of the osprey protein design software package.

                <p>by Xixuan Feng, Shuqin Zhang, Limin Li</p>

Cell-cell communication (CCC) is a fundamental biological process essential for maintaining the functionality of multicellular organisms. It allows cells to coordinate their activities, sustain tissue homeostasis, and adapt to environmental changes. However, understanding the mechanisms underlying intercellular communication remains challenging. The rapid advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have enabled the analysis of CCC within its spatial context. Despite the development of several computational methods for inferring CCCs from ST data, most rely on literature-curated gene or protein interaction lists, which are often inadequate due to the restricted gene coverage. In this work, we propose OrgaCCC, an orthogonal graph autoencoders approach for cell-cell communication inference based on deep generative models. OrgaCCC leverages the information of gene expression profiles, spatial locations and ligand-receptor relationships. It captures both cell/spot and gene features using two orthogonally coupled variational graph autoencoders across cell/spot and gene dimensions and combines them by maximizing the similarity between their reconstructed cell/spot features. Numerical experiments on five ST datasets demonstrate the superiority of OrgaCCC compared with state-of-the-art methods in CCC inference at the cell-type level, cell/spot level, and ligand-receptor level, in terms of inference accuracy and reliability.

                <p>by Samuel Eriksson Lidbrink, Rebecca J. Howard, Nandan Haloi, Erik Lindahl</p>

The function of a protein is enabled by its conformational landscape. For non-rigid proteins, a complete characterization of this landscape requires understanding the protein’s structure in all functional states, the stability of these states under target conditions, and the transition pathways between them. Several strategies have recently been developed to drive the machine learning algorithm AlphaFold2 (AF) to sample multiple conformations, but it is more challenging to a priori predict what states are stabilized in particular conditions and how the transition occurs. Here, we combine AF sampling with small-angle scattering curves to obtain a weighted conformational ensemble of functional states under target environmental conditions. We apply this to the pentameric ion channel GLIC using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) curves, and identify apparent closed and open states. By comparing experimental SANS data under resting and activating conditions, we can quantify the subpopulation of closed channels that open upon activation, matching both experiments and extensive simulation sampling using Markov state models. The predicted closed and open states closely resemble crystal structures determined under resting and activating conditions respectively, and project to predicted basins in free energy landscapes calculated from the Markov state models. Further, without using any structural information, the AF sampling also correctly captures intermediate conformations and projects onto the transition pathway resolved in the extensive sampling. This combination of machine learning algorithms and low-dimensional experimental data appears to provide an efficient way to predict not only stable conformations but also accurately sample the transition pathways several orders of magnitude faster than simulation-based sampling.

                <p>by Qile Yang, Ksenia R. Safina, Kieu Diem Quynh Nguyen, Zewen Kelvin Tuong, Nicholas Borcherding</p>

Single-cell adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (scAIRR-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide a transformative approach to profiling immune responses at unprecedented resolution across diverse pathophysiologic contexts. This work presents scRepertoire 2, a substantial update to our R package for analyzing and visualizing single-cell immune receptor data. This new version introduces an array of features designed to enhance both the depth and breadth of immune receptor analysis, including improved workflows for clonotype tracking, repertoire diversity metrics, and novel visualization modules that facilitate longitudinal and comparative studies. Additionally, scRepertoire 2 offers seamless integration with contemporary single-cell analysis frameworks like Seurat and SingleCellExperiment, allowing users to conduct end-to-end single-cell immune profiling with transcriptomic data. Performance optimizations in scRepertoire 2 resulted in a 85.1% increase in speed and a 91.9% reduction in memory usage from the first version over the range repertoire size tested in benchmarking, addressing the demands of the ever-increasing size and scale of single-cell studies. This release marks an advancement in single cell immunogenomics, equipping researchers with a robust toolset to uncover immune dynamics in health and disease.

                <p>by Isabel Raposo, Ian C. Fiebelkorn, Jack J. Lin, Josef Parvizi, Sabine Kastner, Robert T. Knight, Assaf Breska, Randolph F. Helfrich</p>

Attention samples visual space sequentially to enhance behaviorally relevant sensory representations. While traditionally conceptualized as a static continuous spotlight, contemporary models of attention highlight its discrete nature. But which neural mechanisms govern the temporally precise allocation of attention? Periodic brain activity as exemplified by neuronal oscillations as well as aperiodic temporal structure in the form of intrinsic neural timescales have been proposed to orchestrate the attentional sampling process in space and time. However, both mechanisms have been largely studied in isolation. To date, it remains unclear whether periodic and aperiodic temporal structure reflect distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we combined computational simulations with a multimodal approach encompassing five experiments, and three different variants of classic spatial attention paradigms, to differentiate aperiodic from oscillatory-based sampling. Converging evidence across behavior as well as scalp and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that periodic and aperiodic temporal regularities can theoretically and experimentally be distinguished. Our results extend the rhythmic sampling framework of attention by demonstrating that aperiodic neural timescales predict behavior in a spatially-, context-, and demand-dependent manner. Aperiodic timescales increased from sensory to association cortex, decreased during sensory processing or action execution, and were prolonged with increasing behavioral demands. These results reveal that multiple, concurrent temporal regularities govern attentional sampling.

                Introduction and Importance Gastrointestinal duplications are rare congenital anomalies, occurring in about 1 in 25,000 births, with duodenal duplications making up 2% to 7% of cases. Typically diagnosed in childhood, they pose diagnostic challenges in adults. Case Presentation We present a case of a 14-year-old boy with mild epigastric pain, whose imaging revealed a large inter-duodeno-pancreatic cystic mass displacing nearby structures. Surgical exploration identified a cystic formation in the second part of the duodenum with a small communication to the duodenal lumen. A subtotal resection and cysto-duodenostomy were performed, leading to an uneventful postoperative recovery. Clinical Discussion Duplication cysts, or alimentary tract duplications, are rare congenital lesions, typically found in the distal ileum but infrequently in the duodenum. Diagnosed mainly in early childhood, they may occasionally present in adulthood, manifesting as abdominal mass, obstruction, or discomfort; in some cases, they mimic choledochal cysts, complicating diagnosis. Surgical removal is the standard treatment, focusing on ensuring proper drainage while preserving biliary and pancreatic ducts. Conclusion Duodenal duplication is a rare, challenging diagnosis in adolescents; this case offers guidance for timely identification and treatment. It aims to support healthcare providers in achieving timely diagnosis and effective management in similar cases.

                Abstract Liver diseases cause nearly 2 million deaths worldwide each year, with approximately 1 million deaths from cirrhosis complications and another 1 million from viral hepatitis and liver cancer, according to WHO estimates. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the primary curative option, boasting success rates of 85% in the first year and 75% at five years post-transplant. Despite high costs, LT is considered cost-effective, especially for younger patients with active work years remaining. However, post-transplant complications, particularly intrahepatic cholestasis, present notable challenges. This complication arises from factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, infections, immunological rejection, and surgical complications, all contributing to impaired bile flow and liver damage. Current medical therapies for post-LT cholestasis are limited, with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) frequently used, despite questionable efficacy. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist approved by the FDA for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has shown potential benefits in reducing elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Given its significant effects on liver health, OCA may offer therapeutic value in managing post-transplant cholestasis and improving graft survival. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate OCA’s efficacy compared to UDCA in reducing cholestatic injury and enhancing graft function post-LT. The primary outcomes will focus on a 15% reduction in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline one month. Secondary outcomes include molecular markers, biliary complications, graft rejection, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Results are anticipated to demonstrate that OCA could improve graft survival, reduce complications, and enhance quality of life, potentially setting a new standard in post-LT care if found beneficial.

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an emerging risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate CHIP's association with cerebrovascular or glymphatic changes in a community-based population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study examined Chinese community cohort participants. CHIP mutations were identified through whole-exome sequencing. Intracranial arterial stenosis, silent brain infarcts, cerebral small vessel disease markers, and diffusion along the perivascular space index were identified by magnetic resonance imaging. The correlation between CHIP and neuroimaging outcomes was investigated through univariate and multivariate logistic/linear regression. The multivariate regression model was adjusted for cerebrovascular disease risk factors, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 18.2% (224 out of 1,229) participants were identified as carriers of CHIP mutations. The prevalence of CHIP generally increases with age (<i>p</i> = 0.009). After adjusting for vascular risk factors using multivariate regression, CHIP mutations were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of large magnetic resonance imaging-defined infarcts (&gt;15 mm; OR 3.20; 95% CI 1.18 to 8.43; <i>p</i> = 0.018), inversely associated with diffusion along the perivascular space (<i>β</i> = −0.02; 95% CI −0.04 to 0; <i>p</i> = 0.034), and showed a borderline association with intracranial arterial stenosis (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.30; <i>p</i> = 0.053). Notably, no statistically significant correlations were observed between CHIP and cerebral small vessel disease markers or brain atrophy measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CHIP was significantly associated with glymphatic dysfunction and large infarcts, and marginally associated with intracranial arterial stenosis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology linking CHIP to cerebral covert changes. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
