The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula.

Abstract
<p>Several influential theories of consciousness attempt to explain how, when and where conscious perception arises in the brain. The extent of conscious perception of a stimulus is often probed by asking subjects to provide confidence estimations in their choices in challenging perceptual decision-making tasks. Here, we aimed to dissociate neural patterns of "cognitive" and "sensory" information maintenance by linking category selective visual processes to decision confidence using multivariate decoding techniques on human EEG data. Participants discriminated at-threshold masked face versus house stimuli and reported confidence in their discrimination performance. Three distinct types of category-selective neural activity patterns were observed, dissociable by their timing, scalp topography, relationship with decision confidence, and generalization profile. An early (~150–200 ms) decoding profile was unrelated to confidence and quickly followed by two distinct decodable patterns of late neural activity (350–500 ms). One pattern was on<i>-</i>diagonal, global and highly related to decision confidence, likely indicating cognitive maintenance of consciously reportable stimulus representations. The other pattern however was off-diagonal, restricted to posterior electrode sites (local), and independent of decision confidence, and therefore may reflect sensory maintenance of category-specific information, possibly operating via recurrent processes within visual cortices. These results highlight that two functionally independent neural processes are operating in parallel, only one of which is related to decision confidence and conscious access.</p>

Abstract
<p>The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a significant modulator of both analgesic and fear behaviors in both humans and rodents, but the underlying circuitry responsible for these two phenotypes is incompletely understood. Importantly, it is not known if there is a way to produce analgesia without anxiety by targeting the PAG, as modulation of glutamate or GABA neurons in this area initiates both antinociceptive and anxiogenic behavior. While dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG)/dorsal raphe display a supraspinal antinociceptive effect, their influence on anxiety and fear are unknown. Using DAT-cre and Vglut2-cre male mice, we introduced designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) to DA and glutamate neurons within the vlPAG using viral-mediated delivery and found that levels of analgesia were significant and quantitatively similar when DA and glutamate neurons were selectively stimulated. Activation of glutamatergic neurons, however, reliably produced higher indices of anxiety, with increased freezing time and more time spent in the safety of a dark enclosure. In contrast, animals in which PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons were stimulated failed to show fear behaviors. DA-mediated antinociception was inhibitable by haloperidol and was sufficient to prevent persistent inflammatory pain induced by carrageenan. In summary, only activation of DA neurons in the PAG/dorsal raphe produced profound analgesia without signs of anxiety, indicating that PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons are an important target involved in analgesia that may lead to new treatments for pain.</p>

<p>Inspired by the adaptation phenomenon of biological neuronal firing rate, we
propose regularity normalization: a reparametrization of the activation in the
neural network that take into account the statistical regularity in the
implicit space. The implicit space is constrained by the normalizing factor,
the minimum description length of the optimal universal code. We introduce an
incremental version of computing this universal code as normalized maximum
likelihood and demonstrated its flexibility to include data prior such as
top-down attention and other oracle information and its comptatibility to be
incorporated into batch normalization and layer normalization. The preliminary
empirical results are inconclusive regarding its advantages in tackling the
limited and imbalanced data from a non-stationary distribution benchmarked on
computer vision task. This biologically plausible normalization, however, has
the potential to deal with other complicated real-world scenarios - further
research are proposed to discover these scenarios and explore the behaviors
among different variants.

<p>Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) is the predominant method for inferring
effective connectivity from neuroimaging data. In the 15 years since its
introduction, the neural models and statistical routines in DCM have developed
in parallel, driven by the needs of researchers in cognitive and clinical
neuroscience. In this tutorial, we step through an exemplar fMRI analysis in
detail, reviewing the current implementation of DCM and demonstrating recent
developments in group-level connectivity analysis. In the first part of the
tutorial (current paper), we focus on issues specific to DCM for fMRI,
unpacking the relevant theory and highlighting practical considerations. In
particular, we clarify the assumptions (i.e., priors) used in DCM for fMRI and
how to interpret the model parameters. This tutorial is accompanied by all the
necessary data and instructions to reproduce the analyses using the SPM
software. In the second part (in a companion paper), we move from subject-level
to group-level modelling using the Parametric Empirical Bayes framework, and
illustrate how to test for commonalities and differences in effective
connectivity across subjects, based on imaging data from any modality.

<p>Avalanches whose sizes and durations are distributed as power laws appear in
many contexts. Here, we show that there is a hidden peril in thresholding
continuous times series --either from empirical or synthetic data-- for the
detection of avalanches. In particular, we consider two possible alternative
definitions of avalanche size used e.g. in the empirical determination of
avalanche exponents in the analysis of neural-activity data. By performing
analytical and computational studies of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (taken as
a guiding example) we show that if (i) relatively large threshold values are
employed to determine the beginning and ending of avalanches and if (ii) --as
sometimes done in the literature-- avalanche sizes are defined as the total
area (above zero) of the avalanche, then true asymptotic scaling behavior is
not seen, instead the observations are dominated by transient effects. These
can induce misinterpretations of the resulting scaling regimes as well as to a
wrong assignation of universality classes.

<p>Maintaining upright posture is a complex task governed by the integration of
afferent sensorimotor and visual information with compensatory neuromuscular
reactions. The objective of this work was to characterize the visual dependency
and functional dynamics of cortical activation during postural control.
Proprioceptic vibratory stimulation of calf muscles at 85 Hz was performed to
evoke postural perturbation in open-eye (OE) and closed-eye (CE) experimental
trials, with pseudorandom binary stimulation phases divided into four segments
of 16 stimuli. 64-channel EEG was recorded; with perturbation epochs defined
using bipolar electrodes placed proximal to each vibrator. Finally, functional
connectivity assessment was explored via network segregation and integration
analyses. Spectra variation showed waveform and vision-dependent activation
within cortical regions specific to both postural adaptation and habituation.
Generalized spectral variation yielded significant shifts from low to high
frequencies in CE adaptation trials, with overall activity suppressed in
habituation; OE trials showed the opposite phenomenon, with both adaptation and
habituation yielding increases in spectral power. Finally, our analysis of
functional dynamics reveals novel cortical networks implicated in postural
control using EEG source-space brain networks. In particular, our reported
significant increase in local theta connectivity may signify the planning of
corrective steps and/or the analysis of falling consequences, while alpha band
network integration results reflect an inhibition of error detection within the
cingulate cortex, likely due to habituation. Our findings suggest that specific
cortical waveforms are dependent upon the availability of visual feedback, and
we present the first evidence that local and global brain networks undergo
characteristic modification during postural control.

<p>Echolocating bats locate the targets by echolocation. Many theoretical
frameworks have been suggested the abilities of bats are related to the shapes
of bats ears, but few artificial bat-like ears have been made to mimic the
abilities, the difficulty of which lies in the determination of the elevation
angle of the target. In this study, we present a device with artificial bat
pinnae modeling by the ears of brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) which
can accurately estimate the elevation angle of the aerial target by virtue of
active sonar. An artificial neural-network with the labeled data obtained from
echoes as the trained and tested data is used and optimized by a tenfold
cross-validation technique. A decision method we named sliding window averaging
algorithm is designed for getting the estimation results of elevation. At last,
a right-angle pinnae construction is designed for determining direction of the
target. The results show a higher accuracy for the direction determination of
the single target. The results also demonstrate that for the Plecotus auritus
bat, not only the binaural shapes, but the binaural relative orientations also
play important roles in the target localization.

<p>Robust motifs are graphs associated to threshold-linear networks (TLNs) for
which the structure of fixed points is independent of the choice of
connectivity matrix $W$. In this work we describe infinite families of robust
motifs, and use them to completely characterize all robust motifs for networks
of size $n \leq 5$. These graph structures tightly constrain the dynamics of
the associated TLNs, making them ideal candidates for constructing network
architectures whose dynamics are robust despite allowing great flexibility in
the choice of $W$.

<p>Movement experience and the coordination of perception and action are the
basis of developing body awareness, emotion, motivation and cognition and the
sense of self. The four limbs play a key role in the developing sense of body
ownership, agency and peripersonal space. Neonatal limb movements were
investigated respective processes of self-organization and developing body
awareness. Application of symbolic dynamics to kinematic data of radial
distance trajectories of the hands and feet determined 16 coordination patterns
according to the distance of the effectors to the body center. From time series
analysis of occurrence and recurrence of these configurations of 25 movement
episodes of 14 infants both characteristics of self-organization as well as
features assumed to provide neonates with experiences involved in the
development of body awareness were found. With increasing age a shift from
configurations with proximal to distal positions suggests a role of the
proximal-distal dimension in movement development. We conclude that
self-organization in spontaneous movements provides neonates with perceptual
body- and self-specifying stimuli involved in developing body awareness and
postulate the involvement of emotional and cognitive processes.

Munc13-1 plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release. We recently proposed that the C-terminal region encompassing the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1 (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) bridges the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes through interactions involving the C<sub>2</sub>C domain and the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region. However, the physiological relevance of this model has not been demonstrated. Here we show that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bridges membranes through opposite ends of its elongated structure. Mutations in putative membrane-binding sites of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain disrupt the ability of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C to bridge liposomes and to mediate liposome fusion in vitro. These mutations lead to corresponding disruptive effects on synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release in mouse neurons. Remarkably, these effects include an almost complete abrogation of release by a single residue substitution in this 200 kDa protein. These results show that bridging the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes is a central function of Munc13-1.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41535">Coding of whisker motion across the mouse face</a></h4>

Haptic perception synthesizes touch with proprioception, the sense of body position. Humans and mice alike experience rich active touch of the face. Because most facial muscles lack proprioceptor endings, the sensory basis of facial proprioception remains unsolved. Facial proprioception may instead rely on mechanoreceptors that encode both touch and self-motion. In rodents, whisker mechanoreceptors provide a signal that informs the brain about whisker position. Whisking involves coordinated orofacial movements, so mechanoreceptors innervating facial regions other than whiskers could also provide information about whisking. To define all sources of sensory information about whisking available to the brain, we recorded spikes from mechanoreceptors innervating diverse parts of the face. Whisker motion was encoded best by whisker mechanoreceptors, but also by those innervating whisker pad hairy skin and supraorbital vibrissae. Redundant self-motion responses may provide the brain with a stable proprioceptive signal despite mechanical perturbations during active touch.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39404">Control of entropy in neural models of environmental state</a></h4>

Humans and animals construct internal models of their environment in order to select appropriate courses of action. The representation of uncertainty about the current state of the environment is a key feature of these models that controls the rate of learning as well as directly affecting choice behaviour. To maintain flexibility, given that uncertainty naturally decreases over time, most theoretical inference models include a dedicated mechanism to drive up model uncertainty. Here we probe the long-standing hypothesis that noradrenaline is involved in determining the uncertainty, or entropy, and thus flexibility, of neural models. Pupil diameter, which indexes neuromodulatory state including noradrenaline release, predicted increases (but not decreases) in entropy in a neural state model encoded in human medial orbitofrontal cortex, as measured using multivariate functional MRI. Activity in anterior cingulate cortex predicted pupil diameter. These results provide evidence for top-down, neuromodulatory control of entropy in neural state models.

VanRyzin et al. demonstrate that microglia in the developing amygdala engulf and kill otherwise viable newborn astrocytes, establishing sex differences in social circuits. This process, which depends on gonadal hormones and endocannabinoid signaling, promotes juvenile play by males.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/_eq63JrmzU4/article">Script of scripts: A pragmatic workflow system for daily computational research</a></h4>

<p>by Gao Wang, Bo Peng</p>

Computationally intensive disciplines such as computational biology often require use of a variety of tools implemented in different scripting languages and analysis of large data sets using high-performance computing systems. Although scientific workflow systems can powerfully organize and execute large-scale data-analysis processes, creating and maintaining such workflows usually comes with nontrivial learning curves and engineering overhead, making them cumbersome to use for everyday data exploration and prototyping. To bridge the gap between interactive analysis and workflow systems, we developed Script of Scripts (SoS), an interactive data-analysis platform and workflow system with a strong emphasis on readability, practicality, and reproducibility in daily computational research. For exploratory analysis, SoS has a multilanguage scripting format that centralizes otherwise-scattered scripts and creates dynamic reports for publication and sharing. As a workflow engine, SoS provides an intuitive syntax for creating workflows in process-oriented, outcome-oriented, and mixed styles, as well as a unified interface for executing and managing tasks on a variety of computing platforms with automatic synchronization of files among isolated file systems. As illustrated herein by real-world examples, SoS is both an interactive analysis tool and pipeline platform suitable for different stages of method development and data-analysis projects. In particular, SoS can be easily adopted in existing data analysis routines to substantially improve organization, readability, and cross-platform computation management of research projects.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_eq63JrmzU4" width="1" />

<p>by Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz, Roberto Mulet</p>

Continuous cultures of mammalian cells are complex systems displaying hallmark phenomena of nonlinear dynamics, such as multi-stability, hysteresis, as well as sharp transitions between different metabolic states. In this context mathematical models may suggest control strategies to steer the system towards desired states. Although even clonal populations are known to exhibit cell-to-cell variability, most of the currently studied models assume that the population is homogeneous. To overcome this limitation, we use the maximum entropy principle to model the phenotypic distribution of cells in a chemostat as a function of the dilution rate. We consider the coupling between cell metabolism and extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor and take into account the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation on cell viability. We present a formal solution for the stationary state of the chemostat and show how to apply it in two examples. First, a simplified model of cell metabolism where the exact solution is tractable, and then a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. Along the way we discuss several consequences of heterogeneity, such as: qualitative changes in the dynamical landscape of the system, increasing concentrations of byproducts that vanish in the homogeneous case, and larger population sizes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YXzLvBRqBKs" width="1" />

<p>by Sarah C. Kramer, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Accurate forecasts of influenza incidence can be used to inform medical and public health decision-making and response efforts. However, forecasting systems are uncommon in most countries, with a few notable exceptions. Here we use publicly available data from the World Health Organization to generate retrospective forecasts of influenza peak timing and peak intensity for 64 countries, including 18 tropical and subtropical countries. We find that accurate and well-calibrated forecasts can be generated for countries in temperate regions, with peak timing and intensity accuracy exceeding 50% at four and two weeks prior to the predicted epidemic peak, respectively. Forecasts are significantly less accurate in the tropics and subtropics for both peak timing and intensity. This work indicates that, in temperate regions around the world, forecasts can be generated with sufficient lead time to prepare for upcoming outbreak peak incidence.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fgxSpBSZBYY" width="1" />

<p>by Marzieh Ayati, Danica Wiredja, Daniela Schlatzer, Sean Maxwell, Ming Li, Mehmet Koyutürk, Mark R. Chance</p>

We present CoPhosK to predict kinase-substrate associations for phosphopeptide substrates detected by mass spectrometry (MS). The tool utilizes a Naïve Bayes framework with priors of known kinase-substrate associations (KSAs) to generate its predictions. Through the mining of MS data for the collective dynamic signatures of the kinases’ substrates revealed by correlation analysis of phosphopeptide intensity data, the tool infers KSAs in the data for the considerable body of substrates lacking such annotations. We benchmarked the tool against existing approaches for predicting KSAs that rely on static information (e.g. sequences, structures and interactions) using publically available MS data, including breast, colon, and ovarian cancer models. The benchmarking reveals that co-phosphorylation analysis can significantly improve prediction performance when static information is available (about 35% of sites) while providing reliable predictions for the remainder, thus tripling the KSAs available from the experimental MS data providing to a comprehensive and reliable characterization of the landscape of kinase-substrate interactions well beyond current limitations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P238-LP1vMA" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Mutations in the <i>KCNV2</i> gene, which encodes the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel protein Kv8.2, cause a distinctive form of cone dystrophy with a supernormal rod response (CDSRR). Kv8.2 channel subunits only form functional channels when combined in a heterotetramer with Kv2.1 subunits encoded by the <i>KCNB1</i> gene. The CDSRR disease phenotype indicates that photoreceptor adaptation is disrupted. The electroretinogram (ERG) response of affected individuals shows depressed rod and cone activity, but what distinguishes this disease is the supernormal rod response to a bright flash of light. Here, we have utilized knock-out mutations of both genes in the mouse to study the pathophysiology of CDSRR. The Kv8.2 knock-out (KO) mice show many similarities to the human disorder, including a depressed a-wave and an elevated b-wave response with bright light stimulation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and immunohistochemistry indicate that the changes in six-month-old Kv8.2 KO retinae are largely limited to the outer nuclear layer (ONL), while outer segments appear intact. In addition, there is a significant increase in TUNEL<b>-</b>positive cells throughout the retina. The Kv2.1 KO and double KO mice also show a severely depressed a-wave, but the elevated b-wave response is absent. Interestingly, in all three KO genotypes, the c-wave is totally absent. The differential response shown here of these KO lines, that either possess homomeric channels or lack channels completely, has provided further insights into the role of K<sup>+</sup> channels in the generation of the a-, b-, and c-wave components of the ERG.</p>

<p>Stroke robustly stimulates adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. It is currently unknown whether this process induces beneficial or maladaptive effects, but morphological and behavioral studies have reported aberrant neurogenesis and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory following stroke. However, the intrinsic function and network incorporation of adult-born granule cells (ABGCs) after ischemia is unclear. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we evaluated doublecortin-positive (DCX<sup>+</sup>) ABGCs as well as DCX<sup>–</sup> dentate gyrus granule cells 2 weeks after a stroke or sham operation in DCX<i>/</i>DsRed transgenic mice of either sex. The developmental status, intrinsic excitability, and synaptic excitability of ABGCs were accelerated following stroke, while dendritic morphology was not aberrant. Regression analysis revealed uncoupled development of intrinsic and network excitability, resulting in young, intrinsically hyperexcitable ABGCs receiving disproportionately large glutamatergic inputs. This aberrant functional maturation in the subgroup of ABGCs in the hippocampus may contribute to defective hippocampal function and increased seizure susceptibility following stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stroke increases hippocampal neurogenesis but the functional consequences of the postlesional response is mostly unclear. Our findings provide novel evidence of aberrant functional maturation of newly generated neurons following stroke. We demonstrate that stroke not only causes an accelerated maturation of the intrinsic and synaptic parameters of doublecortin-positive, new granule cells in the hippocampus, but that this accelerated development does not follow physiological dynamics due to uncoupled intrinsic and synaptic maturation. Hyperexcitable immature neurons may contribute to disrupted network integration following stroke.</p>

<p>The acquisition of drug, including alcohol, use is associated with activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, over the course of drug exposure the control over drug seeking progressively devolves to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms. The causal importance of this functional recruitment of aDLS in the switch from controlled to compulsive drug use in vulnerable individuals remains to be established. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the susceptibility to aDLS dopamine-dependent control over alcohol seeking predicts and underlies the development of compulsive alcohol seeking. Male alcohol-preferring rats, the alcohol-preferring phenotype of which was confirmed in an intermittent two-bottle choice procedure, were implanted bilaterally with cannulae above the aDLS and trained instrumentally on a seeking–taking chained schedule of alcohol reinforcement until some individuals developed compulsive seeking behavior. The susceptibility to aDLS dopamine control over behavior was investigated before and after the development of compulsivity by measuring the extent to which bilateral aDLS infusions of the dopamine receptor antagonist α-flupenthixol (0, 5, 10, and 15 μg/side) decreased alcohol seeking at different stages of training, as follows: (1) after acquisition of instrumental taking responses for alcohol; (2) after alcohol-seeking behavior was well established; and (3) after the development of punishment-resistant alcohol seeking. Only alcohol-seeking, not alcohol-taking, responses became dependent on aDLS dopamine. Further, marked individual differences in the susceptibility of alcohol seeking to aDLS dopamine receptor blockade actually predicted the vulnerability to develop compulsive alcohol seeking, but only in subjects dependent on aDLS dopamine-dependent control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over the course of addictive drug exposure, there is a transition in the control over drug seeking from ventral to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms, but it is unclear whether this is causally involved in the development of compulsive drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the reliance of alcohol seeking on aDLS dopamine predicts and underlies the emergence of compulsive alcohol seeking. We identified individual differences in the reliance of well established alcohol seeking, but not taking behavior, on aDLS mechanisms and also showed that this predicted the subsequent development of compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior. Thus, those individuals in whom alcohol seeking depended on aDLS mechanisms were vulnerable subsequently to display compulsivity.</p>

<p>Many important situations require human observers to simultaneously search for more than one object. Despite a long history of research into visual search, the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with multiple-target search are poorly understood. Here we test the novel theory that the efficiency of looking for multiple targets critically depends on the mode of cognitive control the environment affords to the observer. We used an innovative combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking while participants searched for two targets, within two different contexts: either both targets were present in the search display and observers were free to prioritize either one of them, thus enabling proactive control over selection; or only one of the two targets would be present in each search display, which requires reactive control to reconfigure selection when the wrong target has been prioritized. During proactive control, both univariate and multivariate signals of beta-band (15–35 Hz) power suppression before display onset predicted switches between target selections. This signal originated over midfrontal and sensorimotor regions and has previously been associated with endogenous state changes. In contrast, imposed target selections requiring reactive control elicited prefrontal power enhancements in the delta/theta band (2–8 Hz), but only after display onset. This signal predicted individual differences in associated oculomotor switch costs, reflecting reactive reconfiguration of target selection. The results provide compelling evidence that multiple target representations are differentially prioritized during visual search, and for the first time reveal distinct neural mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control over multiple-target search.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Searching for more than one object in complex visual scenes can be detrimental for search performance. Although perhaps annoying in daily life, this can have severe consequences in professional settings such as medical and security screening. Previous research has not yet resolved whether multiple-target search involves changing priorities in what people attend to, and how such changes are controlled. We approached these questions by concurrently measuring cortical activity and eye movements using EEG and eye tracking while observers searched for multiple possible targets. Our findings provide the first unequivocal support for the existence of two modes of control during multiple-target search, which are expressed in qualitatively distinct time-frequency signatures of the EEG both before and after visual selection.</p>

<p>Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the inability to acquire typical reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral cortex alterations; however, recent evidence also points toward sensory thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is highly correlated with reading proficiency. Here, we tested two hypotheses that were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left MGB and the auditory-motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT). Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT–MGB connectivity correlates with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging-based probabilistic tracking, we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT–MGB connectivity was not associated with faster RANln scores in dyslexics, but was in neurotypical readers. Our findings provide the first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia and it may also affect reading-related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developmental dyslexia is one of the most widespread learning disabilities. Although previous neuroimaging research mainly focused on pathomechanisms of dyslexia at the cerebral cortex level, several lines of evidence suggest an atypical functioning of subcortical sensory structures. By means of diffusion tensor imaging, we here show that dyslexic male adults have reduced white matter connectivity in a cortico-thalamic auditory pathway between the left auditory motion-sensitive planum temporale and the left medial geniculate body. Connectivity strength of this pathway was associated with measures of reading fluency in neurotypical readers. This is novel evidence on the neurocognitive correlates of reading proficiency, highlighting the importance of cortico-subcortical interactions between regions involved in the processing of spectrotemporally complex sound.</p>

<p>The basal ganglia, especially the circuits originating from the putamen, are essential for controlling normal body movements. Notably, the putamen receives inputs not only from motor cortical areas but also from multiple sensory cortices. However, how these sensory signals are processed in the putamen remains unclear. We recorded the activity of tentative medium spiny neurons in the caudal part of the putamen when the monkey viewed many fractal objects. We found many neurons that responded to these objects, mostly in the ventral region. We called this region "putamen tail" (PUTt), as it is dorsally adjacent to "caudate tail" (CDt). Although PUTt and CDt are mostly separated by a thin layer of white matter, their neurons shared several features. Almost all of them had receptive fields in the contralateral hemifield. Moreover, their responses were object selective (i.e., variable across objects). The object selectivity was higher in the ventral region (i.e., CDt &gt; PUTt). Some neurons above PUTt, which we called the caudal–dorsal putamen (cdPUT), also responded to objects, but less selectively than PUTt. Next, we examined whether these visual neurons changed their responses based on the reward outcome. We found that many neurons encoded the values of many objects based on long-term memory, but not based on short-term memory. Such stable value responses were stronger in PUTt and CDt than in cdPUT. These results suggest that PUTt, together with CDt, controls saccade/attention among objects with different historical values, and may control other motor actions as well.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although the putamen receives inputs not only from motor cortical areas but also from sensory cortical areas, how these sensory signals are processed remains unclear. Here we found that neurons in the caudal–ventral part of the putamen (putamen tail) process visual information including spatial and object features. These neurons discriminate many objects, first by their visual features and later by their reward values as well. Importantly, the value discrimination was based on long-term memory, but not on short-term memory. These results suggest that the putamen tail controls saccade/attention among objects with different historical values and might control other motor actions as well.</p>

<p>Figure-ground segregation is fundamental to listening in complex acoustic environments. An ongoing debate pertains to whether segregation requires attention or is "automatic" and preattentive. In this magnetoencephalography study, we tested a prediction derived from load theory of attention (e.g., Lavie, 1995) that segregation requires attention but can benefit from the automatic allocation of any "leftover" capacity under low load. Complex auditory scenes were modeled with stochastic figure-ground stimuli (Teki et al., 2013), which occasionally contained repeated frequency component "figures." Naive human participants (both sexes) passively listened to these signals while performing a visual attention task of either low or high load. While clear figure-related neural responses were observed under conditions of low load, high visual load substantially reduced the neural response to the figure in auditory cortex (planum temporale, Heschl's gyrus). We conclude that fundamental figure-ground segregation in hearing is not automatic but draws on resources that are shared across vision and audition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work resolves a long-standing question of whether figure-ground segregation, a fundamental process of auditory scene analysis, requires attention or is underpinned by automatic, encapsulated computations. Task-irrelevant sounds were presented during performance of a visual search task. We revealed a clear magnetoencephalography neural signature of figure-ground segregation in conditions of low visual load, which was substantially reduced in conditions of high visual load. This demonstrates that, although attention does not need to be actively allocated to sound for auditory segregation to occur, segregation depends on shared computational resources across vision and hearing. The findings further highlight that visual load can impair the computational capacity of the auditory system, even when it does not simply dampen auditory responses as a whole.</p>

<p>Environmental change can lead decision makers to shift rapidly among different behavioral regimes. These behavioral shifts can be accompanied by rapid changes in the firing pattern of neural networks. However, it is unknown what the populations of neurons that participate in such "network reset" phenomena are representing. Here, we investigated the following: (1) whether and where rapid changes in multivariate activity patterns are observable with fMRI during periods of rapid behavioral change and (2) what types of representations give rise to these phenomena. We did so by examining fluctuations in multivoxel patterns of BOLD activity from male and female human subjects making sequential inferences about the state of a partially observable and discontinuously changing variable. We found that, within the context of this sequential inference task, the multivariate patterns of activity in a number of cortical regions contain representations that change more rapidly during periods of uncertainty following a change in behavioral context. In motor cortex, this phenomenon was indicative of discontinuous change in behavioral outputs, whereas in visual regions, the same basic phenomenon was evoked by tracking of salient environmental changes. In most other cortical regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, the phenomenon was most consistent with directly encoding the degree of uncertainty. However, in a few other regions, including orbitofrontal cortex, the phenomenon was best explained by representations of a shifting context that evolve more rapidly during periods of rapid learning. These representations may provide a dynamic substrate for learning that facilitates rapid disengagement from learned responses during periods of change.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain activity patterns tend to change more rapidly during periods of uncertainty and behavioral adjustment, yet the computational role of such rapid transitions is poorly understood. Here, we identify brain regions with fMRI BOLD activity patterns that change more rapidly during periods of behavioral adjustment and use computational modeling to attribute the phenomenon to specific causes. We demonstrate that the phenomenon emerges in different brain regions for different computational reasons, the most common being the representation of uncertainty itself, but that, in a selective subset of regions including orbitofrontal cortex, the phenomenon was best explained as a shifting latent state signal that may serve to control the degree to which recent temporal context affects ongoing expectations.</p>

<p>Neurons in primary visual cortex are strongly modulated both by stimulus contrast and by fluctuations of internal inputs. An important question is whether the population code is preserved under these conditions. Changes in stimulus contrast are thought to leave the population code invariant, whereas the effect of internal gain modulations remains unknown. To address these questions we studied how the direction-of-motion of oriented gratings is encoded in layer 2/3 primary visual cortex of mouse (with C57BL/6 background, of either sex). We found that, because contrast gain responses across cells are heterogeneous, a change in contrast alters the information distribution profile across cells leading to a violation of contrast invariance. Remarkably, internal input fluctuations that cause commensurate firing rate modulations at the single-cell level result in more homogeneous gain responses, respecting population code invariance. These observations argue that the brain strives to maintain the stability of the neural code in the face of fluctuating internal inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal responses are modulated both by stimulus contrast and by the spontaneous fluctuation of internal inputs. It is not well understood how these different types of input impact the population code. Specifically, it is important to understand whether the neural code stays invariant in the face of significant internal input modulations. Here, we show that changes in stimulus contrast lead to different optimal population codes, whereas spontaneous internal input fluctuations leave the population code invariant. This is because spontaneous internal input fluctuations modulate the gain of neuronal responses more homogeneously across cells compared to changes in stimulus contrast.</p>

<p>In rodents, the progression of extrastriate areas located laterally to primary visual cortex (V1) has been assigned to a putative object-processing pathway (homologous to the primate ventral stream), based on anatomical considerations. Recently, we found functional support for such attribution (Tafazoli et al., 2017), by showing that this cortical progression is specialized for coding object identity despite view changes, the hallmark property of a ventral-like pathway. Here, we sought to clarify what computations are at the base of such specialization. To this aim, we performed multielectrode recordings from V1 and laterolateral area LL (at the apex of the putative ventral-like hierarchy) of male adult rats, during the presentation of drifting gratings and noise movies. We found that the extent to which neuronal responses were entrained to the phase of the gratings sharply dropped from V1 to LL, along with the quality of the receptive fields inferred through reverse correlation. Concomitantly, the tendency of neurons to respond to different oriented gratings increased, whereas the sharpness of orientation tuning declined. Critically, these trends are consistent with the nonlinear summation of visual inputs that is expected to take place along the ventral stream, according to the predictions of hierarchical models of ventral computations and a meta-analysis of the monkey literature. This suggests an intriguing homology between the mechanisms responsible for building up shape selectivity and transformation tolerance in the visual cortex of primates and rodents, reasserting the potential of the latter as models to investigate ventral stream functions at the circuitry level.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the growing popularity of rodents as models of visual functions, it remains unclear whether their visual cortex contains specialized modules for processing shape information. To addresses this question, we compared how neuronal tuning evolves from rat primary visual cortex (V1) to a downstream visual cortical region (area LL) that previous work has implicated in shape processing. In our experiments, LL neurons displayed a stronger tendency to respond to drifting gratings with different orientations while maintaining a sustained response across the whole duration of the drift cycle. These trends match the increased complexity of pattern selectivity and the augmented tolerance to stimulus translation found in monkey visual temporal cortex, thus revealing a homology between shape processing in rodents and primates.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1631?rss=1">Mouse Parabrachial Neurons Signal a Relationship between Bitter Taste and Nociceptive Stimuli</a></h4>

<p>Taste and somatosensation both mediate protective behaviors. Bitter taste guides avoidance of ingestion of toxins while pain sensations, such as noxious heat, signal adverse conditions to ward off harm. Although brain pathways for taste and somatosensation are typically studied independently, prior data suggest that they intersect, potentially reflecting their common protective role. To investigate this, we applied electrophysiologic and optogenetic techniques in anesthetized mice of both sexes to evaluate relationships between oral somatosensory and taste activity in the parabrachial nucleus (PbN), implicated for roles in gustation and pain. Spikes were recorded from taste-active PbN neurons tested with oral delivery of thermal and chemesthetic stimuli, including agonists of nocisensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels on somatosensory fibers. Gustatory neurons were also tested to follow electrical pulse stimulation of an oral somatosensory region of the spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), which projects to the PbN. Neurons composed classic taste groups, including sodium, electrolyte, appetitive, or bitter cells. Across groups, most neurons spiked to Vc pulse stimulation, implying that trigeminal projections reach PbN gustatory neurons. Among such cells, a subpopulation responsive to the bitter taste stimuli quinine and cycloheximide, and aversive concentrations of sodium, cofired to agonists of nocisensitive TRP channels, including capsaicin, mustard oil, and noxious heat. Such neurons populated the lateral PbN. Further, nociceptive activity in PbN bitter taste neurons was suppressed during optogenetic-assisted inhibition of the Vc, implying convergent trigeminal input contributed to such activity. Our results reveal a novel role for PbN gustatory cells in cross-system signaling related to protection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior data suggest that gustatory and trigeminal neural pathways intersect and overlap in the parabrachial area. However, no study has directly examined such overlap and why it may exist. Here we found that parabrachial gustatory neurons can receive afferent projections from trigeminal nuclei and fire to oral nociceptive stimuli that excite somatosensory receptors and fibers. Activation to aversive nociceptive stimuli in gustatory cells was associated with responding to behaviorally avoided bitter tastants. We were further able to show that silencing trigeminal projections inhibited nociceptive activity in parabrachial bitter taste neurons. Our results imply that in the parabrachial area, there is predictable overlap between taste and somatosensory processing related to protective coding and that classically defined taste neurons contribute to this process.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1621?rss=1">A Distinct Visual Pathway Mediates High-Intensity Light Adaptation of the Circadian Clock in Drosophila</a></h4>

<p>To provide organisms with a fitness advantage, circadian clocks have to react appropriately to changes in their environment. High-intensity (HI) light plays an essential role in the adaptation to hot summer days, which especially endanger insects of desiccation or prey visibility. Here, we show that solely increasing light intensity leads to an increased midday siesta in <i>Drosophila</i> behavior. Interestingly, this change is independent of the fly's circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome and is solely caused by a small visual organ, the Hofbauer–Buchner eyelets. Using receptor knock-downs, immunostaining, and recently developed calcium tools, we show that the eyelets activate key core clock neurons, namely the s-LN<sub>v</sub>s, at HI. This activation delays the decrease of PERIOD (PER) in the middle of the day and propagates to downstream target clock neurons that prolong the siesta. We show a new pathway for integrating light-intensity information into the clock network, suggesting new network properties and surprising parallels between <i>Drosophila</i> and the mammalian system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability of animals to adapt to their ever-changing environment plays an important role in their fitness. A key player in this adaptation is the circadian clock. For animals to predict the changes of day and night, they must constantly monitor, detect and incorporate changes in the environment. The appropriate incorporation and reaction to high-intensity (HI) light is of special importance for insects because they might suffer from desiccation during hot summer days. We show here that different photoreceptors have specialized functions to integrate low-intensity, medium-intensity, or HI light into the circadian system in <i>Drosophila</i>. These results show surprising parallels to mammalian mechanisms, which also use different photoreceptor subtypes to respond to different light intensities.</p>

<p>Newborn dentate granule cells (DGCs) are generated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of rodents through a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is subjected to tight intrinsic and extrinsic regulation. The use of retroviruses encoding fluorescent proteins has allowed the characterization of the maturation dynamics of newborn DGCs, including their morphological development and the establishment and maturation of their afferent and efferent synaptic connections. However, the study of a crucial cellular compartment of these cells, namely, the axon initial segment (AIS), has remained unexplored to date. The AIS is not only the site of action potential initiation, but it also has a unique molecular identity that makes it one of the master regulators of neural plasticity and excitability. Here we examined the dynamics of AIS formation in newborn DGCs of young female adult C57BL/6J mice <i>in vivo</i>. Our data reveal notable changes in AIS length and thickness throughout cell maturation under physiological conditions and show that the most remarkable structural changes coincide with periods of intense morphological and functional remodeling. Moreover, we demonstrate that AIS development can be modulated extrinsically by both neuroprotective (environmental enrichment) and detrimental (lipopolysaccharide from <i>Escherichia coli</i>) stimuli.</p>

<p>Neurons have high plasticity in developmental and juvenile stages that decreases in adulthood. Mitochondrial dynamics are highly important in neurons to maintain normal function. To compare dependency on mitochondrial dynamics in juvenile and adult stages, we generated a mouse model capable of selective timing of the expression of a mutant of the mitochondrial fusion factor <i>Mitofusin 2</i> (<i>MFN2</i>). Mutant expression in the juvenile stage had lethal effects. Contrastingly, abnormalities did not manifest until 150 d after mutant expression during adulthood. After this silent 150 d period, progressive neurodegeneration, abnormal behaviors, and learning and memory deficits similar to those seen in human neurodegenerative diseases were observed. This indicates that abnormal neuronal mitochondrial dynamics seriously affect survival during early life stages and can also significantly damage brain function after maturation. Our findings highlight the need to consider the timing of disease onset in mimicking human neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To compare the dependency on mitochondrial dynamics in neurons in juvenile and adult stages, we generated a mouse model expressing a mutant of the mitochondrial fusion factor <i>MFN2</i> in an arbitrary timing. Juvenile expression of the mutant showed acute and severe phenotypes and had lethal effects; however, post-adult expression induced delayed but progressive phenotypes resembling those found in human neurodegenerative diseases. Our results indicate that abnormal neuronal mitochondrial dynamics seriously affect survival during early life stages and can also significantly damage brain function after maturation. This strongly suggests that the timing of expression should be considered when establishing an animal model that closely resembles human neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>KCNQ (Kv7, "M-type") K<sup>+</sup> channels and TRPC (transient receptor potential, "canonical") cation channels are coupled to neuronal discharge properties and are regulated via G<sub>q/11</sub>-protein-mediated signals. Stimulation of G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled receptors both consumes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) via phosphalipase Cβ hydrolysis and stimulates PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis via rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> and other signals. Using brain-slice electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from male and female mice, we characterized threshold K<sup>+</sup> currents in dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) and CA1 pyramidal cells, the effects of G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> acetylcholine (M<sub>1</sub>R) stimulation on M current and on neuronal discharge properties, and elucidated the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved. We observed disparate signaling cascades between DGGCs and CA1 neurons. DGGCs displayed M<sub>1</sub>R enhancement of M-current, rather than suppression, due to stimulation of PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis, which was paralleled by increased PIP<sub>2</sub>-gated G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> currents as well. Deficiency of KCNQ2-containing M-channels ablated the M<sub>1</sub>R-induced enhancement of M-current in DGGCs. Simultaneously, M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation in DGGCs induced robust increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, mostly due to TRPC currents, consistent with, and contributing to, neuronal depolarization and hyperexcitability. CA1 neurons did not display such multimodal signaling, but rather M current was suppressed by M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation in these cells, similar to the previously described actions of M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation on M-current in peripheral ganglia that mostly involves PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion. Therefore, these results point to a pleiotropic network of cholinergic signals that direct cell-type-specific, precise control of hippocampal function with strong implications for hyperexcitability and epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At the neuronal membrane, protein signaling cascades consisting of ion channels and metabotropic receptors govern the electrical properties and neurotransmission of neuronal networks. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are G-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors that control the excitability of neurons through regulating ion channels, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and other second-messenger cascades. We have illuminated previously unknown actions of muscarinic stimulation on the excitability of hippocampal principal neurons that include M channels, TRPC (transient receptor potential, "canonical") cation channels, and powerful regulation of lipid metabolism. Our results show that these signaling pathways, and mechanisms of excitability, are starkly distinct between peripheral ganglia and brain, and even between different principal neurons in the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Excitatory synapses can be potentiated by chemical neuromodulators, including 17β-estradiol (E2), or patterns of synaptic activation, as in long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we investigated kinases and calcium sources required for acute E2-induced synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus of each sex and tested whether sex differences in kinase signaling extend to LTP. We recorded EPSCs from CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices from adult rats and used specific inhibitors of kinases and calcium sources. This revealed that, although E2 potentiates synapses to the same degree in each sex, cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) is required to initiate potentiation only in females. In contrast, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Src tyrosine kinase, and rho-associated kinase are required for initiation in both sexes; similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-activated kinase II is required for expression/maintenance of E2-induced potentiation in both sexes. Calcium source experiments showed that L-type calcium channels and calcium release from internal stores are both required for E2-induced potentiation in females, whereas in males, either L-type calcium channel activation or calcium release from stores is sufficient to permit potentiation. To investigate the generalizability of a sex difference in the requirement for PKA in synaptic potentiation, we tested how PKA inhibition affects LTP. This showed that, although the magnitude of both high-frequency stimulation-induced and pairing-induced LTP is the same between sexes, PKA is required for LTP in females but not males. These results demonstrate latent sex differences in mechanisms of synaptic potentiation in which distinct molecular signaling converges to common functional endpoints in males and females.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemical- and activity-dependent neuromodulation alters synaptic strength in both male and female brains, yet few studies have compared mechanisms of neuromodulation between the sexes. Here, we studied molecular signaling that underlies estrogen-induced and activity-dependent potentiation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. We found that, despite similar magnitude increases in synaptic strength in males and females, the roles of cAMP-regulated protein kinase, internal calcium stores, and L-type calcium channels differ between the sexes. Therefore, latent sex differences in which the same outcome is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms in males and females include kinase and calcium signaling involved in synaptic potentiation, demonstrating that sex is an important factor in identification of molecular targets for therapeutic development based on mechanisms of neuromodulation.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the major developmental disorders
affecting children. Recently, it has been hypothesized that ASD is associated
with atypical brain connectivities. A substantial body of researches use
Pearson's correlation coefficients, mutual information, or partial correlation
to investigate the differences in brain connectivities between ASD and typical
controls from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However,
correlation or partial correlation does not directly reveal causal influences -
the information flow - between brain regions. Comparing to correlation,
causality pinpoints the key connectivity characteristics and removes redundant
features for diagnosis.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a two-step method for large-scale and cyclic causal
discovery from fMRI. It can identify brain causal structures without doing
interventional experiments. The learned causal structure, as well as the causal
influence strength, provides us the path and effectiveness of information flow.
With the recovered causal influence strength as candidate features, we then
perform ASD diagnosis by further doing feature selection and classification. We
apply our methods to three datasets from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
(ABIDE).
</p>
<p>From experimental results, it shows that with causal connectivities, the
diagnostic accuracy largely improves. A closer examination shows that
information flows starting from the superior front gyrus to default mode
network and posterior areas are largely reduced. Moreover, all enhanced
information flows are from posterior to anterior or in local areas. Overall, it
shows that long-range influences have a larger proportion of reductions than
local ones, while local influences have a larger proportion of increases than
long-range ones. By examining the graph properties of brain causal structure,
the group of ASD shows reduced small-worldness.

<p>The entrainment between weakly-coupled nonlinear oscillators, as well as
between complex signals such as those representing physiological activity, is
frequently assessed in terms of whether a stable relationship is detectable
between the instantaneous phases extracted from the measured or simulated
time-series via the analytic signal. Here, we demonstrate that adding a
possibly complex constant value to this normally null-mean signal has a
non-trivial warping effect. Among other consequences, this introduces a level
of sensitivity to the amplitude fluctuations and average relative phase. By
means of simulations of Roessler systems and experiments on single-transistor
oscillator networks, it is shown that the resulting coherence measure may have
an empirical value in improving the inference of the structural couplings from
the dynamics. When tentatively applied to the electroencephalogram recorded
while performing imaginary and real movements, this straightforward
modification of the phase locking value substantially improved the
classification accuracy. Hence, its possible practical relevance in
brain-computer and brain-machine interfaces deserves consideration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43738">Amplification of a broad transcriptional program by a common factor triggers the meiotic cell cycle in mice</a></h4>

The germ line provides the cellular link between generations of multicellular organisms, its cells entering the meiotic cell cycle only once each generation. However, the mechanisms governing this initiation of meiosis remain poorly understood. Here, we examined cells undergoing meiotic initiation in mice, and we found that initiation involves the dramatic upregulation of a transcriptional network of thousands of genes whose expression is not limited to meiosis. This broad gene expression program is directly upregulated by STRA8, encoded by a germ cell-specific gene required for meiotic initiation. STRA8 binds its own promoter and those of thousands of other genes, including meiotic prophase genes, factors mediating DNA replication and the G1-S cell-cycle transition, and genes that promote the lengthy prophase unique to meiosis I. We conclude that, in mice, the robust amplification of this extraordinarily broad transcription program by a common factor triggers initiation of meiosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43088">Two distinct mechanisms target the autophagy-related E3 complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure</a></h4>

In autophagy, Atg proteins organize the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) to initiate autophagosome formation. Previous studies in yeast revealed that the autophagy-related E3 complex Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 is recruited to the PAS via Atg16 interaction with Atg21, which binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) produced at the PAS, to stimulate conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine. Here, we discover a novel mechanism for the PAS targeting of Atg12-Atg5-Atg16, which is mediated by the interaction of Atg12 with the Atg1 kinase complex that serves as a scaffold for PAS organization. While autophagy is partially defective without one of these mechanisms, cells lacking both completely lose the PAS localization of Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 and show no autophagic activity. As with the PI3P-dependent mechanism, Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 recruited via the Atg12-dependent mechanism stimulates Atg8 lipidation, but also has the specific function of facilitating PAS scaffold assembly. Thus, this study significantly advances our understanding of the nucleation step in autophagosome formation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42372">TMEM266 is a functional voltage sensor regulated by extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup></a></h4>

Voltage-activated ion channels contain S1-S4 domains that sense membrane voltage and control opening of ion-selective pores, a mechanism that is crucial for electrical signaling. Related S1-S4 domains have been identified in voltage-sensitive phosphatases and voltage-activated proton channels, both of which lack associated pore domains. hTMEM266 is a protein of unknown function that is predicted to contain an S1-S4 domain, along with partially structured cytoplasmic termini. Here we show that hTMEM266 forms oligomers, undergoes both rapid (µs) and slow (ms) structural rearrangements in response to changes in voltage, and contains a Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site that can regulate the slow conformational transition. Our results demonstrate that the S1-S4 domain in hTMEM266 is a functional voltage sensor, motivating future studies to identify cellular processes that may be regulated by the protein. The ability of hTMEM266 to respond to voltage on the µs timescale may be advantageous for designing new genetically encoded voltage indicators.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42282">Basalin is an evolutionarily unconstrained protein revealed via a conserved role in flagellum basal plate function</a></h4>

Most motile flagella have an axoneme that contains nine outer microtubule doublets and a central pair (CP) of microtubules. The CP coordinates the flagellar beat and defects in CP projections are associated with motility defects and human disease. The CP nucleate near a ‘basal plate’ at the distal end of the transition zone (TZ). Here, we show that the trypanosome TZ protein ‘basalin’ is essential for building the basal plate, and its loss is associated with CP nucleation defects, inefficient recruitment of CP assembly factors to the TZ, and flagellum paralysis. Guided by synteny, we identified a highly divergent basalin ortholog in the related Leishmania species. Basalins are predicted to be highly unstructured, suggesting they may act as ‘hubs’ facilitating many protein-protein interactions. This raises the general concept that proteins involved in cytoskeletal functions and appearing organism-specific, may have highly divergent and cryptic orthologs in other species.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38298">Functional instability allows access to DNA in longer Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE) arrays</a></h4>

Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) bind DNA through an array of tandem 34-residue repeats. How TALE repeat domains wrap around DNA, often extending more than 1.5 helical turns, without using external energy is not well understood. Here, we examine the kinetics of DNA binding of TALE arrays with varying numbers of identical repeats. Single molecule fluorescence analysis and deterministic modeling reveal conformational heterogeneity in both the free- and DNA-bound TALE arrays. Our findings, combined with previously identified partly folded states, indicate a TALE instability that is functionally important for DNA binding. For TALEs forming less than one superhelical turn around DNA, partly folded states inhibit DNA binding. In contrast, for TALEs forming more than one turn, partly folded states facilitate DNA binding, demonstrating a mode of 'functional instability' that facilitates macromolecular assembly. Increasing repeat number slows down interconversion between the various DNA-free and DNA-bound states.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37271">EFHC1, implicated in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, functions at the cilium and synapse to modulate dopamine signaling</a></h4>

Neurons throughout the mammalian brain possess non-motile cilia, organelles with varied functions in sensory physiology and cellular signaling. Yet, the roles of cilia in these neurons are poorly understood. To shed light into their functions, we studied EFHC1, an evolutionarily conserved protein required for motile cilia function and linked to a common form of inherited epilepsy in humans, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). We demonstrate that <i>C. elegans</i> EFHC-1 functions within specialized non-motile mechanosensory cilia, where it regulates neuronal activation and dopamine signaling. EFHC-1 also localizes at the synapse, where it further modulates dopamine signaling in cooperation with the orthologue of an R-type voltage-gated calcium channel. Our findings unveil a previously undescribed dual-regulation of neuronal excitability at sites of neuronal sensory input (cilium) and neuronal output (synapse). Such a distributed regulatory mechanism may be essential for establishing neuronal activation thresholds under physiological conditions, and when impaired, may represent a novel pathomechanism for epilepsy.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/563213v1?rss=1">Photoperiod-induced neurotransmitter plasticity declines with aging: an epigenetic regulation?</a></h4>

Neuroplasticity has classically been understood to arise through changes in synaptic strength or synaptic connectivity. A newly discovered form of neuroplasticity, neurotransmitter switching, involves changes in neurotransmitter identity. Chronic exposure to different photoperiods alters the number of dopamine (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH+) and somatostatin (SST+) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PaVN) of the hypothalamus of adult rats and results in discrete behavioral changes. Here we investigate whether photoperiod-induced neurotransmitter switching persists during aging and whether epigenetic mechanisms of histone acetylation and DNA methylation may contribute to this neurotransmitter plasticity. We show that this plasticity is robust at 1 and at 3 months but reduced in TH+ neurons at 12 months and completely abolished in both TH+ and SST+ neurons by 18 months. De novo methylation and histone 3 acetylation were observed following short-day photoperiod exposure in both TH+ and SST+ neurons at 1 and 3 months while an overall increase in methylation of SST+ neurons paralleled neuroplasticity reduction at 12 and 18 months. Histone acetylation increased in TH+ neurons and decreased in SST+ neurons following short-day exposure at 3 months while the total number of acetylated PaVN neurons remained constant. Reciprocal histone acetylation in TH+ and SST+ neurons suggests the importance of studying epigenetic regulation at the circuit level for identified cell phenotypes. The association of age-dependent reduction in neurotransmitter plasticity and changes in DNA methylation and acetylation patterns in two neuronal phenotypes known to switch transmitter identity suggests mechanistic insights into transmitter plasticity in the aging brain.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/562595v1?rss=1">Saccadic suppression by way of retinal-circuit image processing</a></h4>

Visual sensitivity is strongly impaired around the time of rapid eye movements. This robust perceptual phenomenon, called saccadic suppression, is frequently attributed to active suppressive signals that are directly derived from eye movement commands. Here, we show instead that visual-only mechanisms, activated by retinal-image shifts, can account for all perceptual properties of saccadic suppression that we have investigated. Such mechanisms start at the very first stage of visual processing in the brain, the retina. Critically, suppression originating in the retina outlasts perceptual suppression around the time of saccades, suggesting that movement-related signals, rather than causing suppression, may act to shorten it. Our results demonstrate a far-reaching contribution of visual processing mechanisms to saccadic suppression, starting in the retina, without the need to invoke explicit motor-based suppression commands.

Genetics highlight the central role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease but at least 36% of AD-risk genes lack good mouse orthologues. Here, we show that embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived human microglia successfully engraft the mouse brain and recapitulate transcriptionally primary human microglia derived from human surgical samples. Upon exposure to oligomeric A{beta} a wide range of AD-risk genes are expressed that are not readily studied in current mouse models for AD. This work provides a unique humanized animal model that will allow elucidating the role of genetic risk in the pathogenesis of AD.

Learning in neural networks has developed in many directions, from image recognition and speech processing to data analysis in general. Most theories relying on gradient descents tune the weights to constrain the output activity in a given range of activation levels, thereby focusing on the first-order statistics of the network activity. Here we propose a learning formalism akin to the delta rule to tune both afferent and recurrent weights in a network, which shapes the input-output mapping for covariances, i.e. the second-order statistics. Covariance patterns define a natural metric for time series that capture their propagating nature. We develop the theory for classification of time series with hidden dynamics, as determined by their spatio-temporal covariances. This brings a conceptual change of perspective by employing variability in the time series to represent the information to be learned, rather than merely being the noise that corrupts the mean signal. Closed-form expressions reveal identical pattern capacity in a binary classification task compared to the ordinary perceptron; the information density, however, exceeds the classical counterpart by a factor equal to the number of sending neurons. Our theory also complements recent studies of the relationship between noise correlation and (de)coding, showing that activity variability can be the basis for information to be learned by neural networks.

Extracellular {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) plaque deposits and inflammatory immune activation are thought to alter various aspects of tissue microstructure, such as extracellular free water, fractional anisotropy and diffusivity, as well as the density and geometric arrangement of axonal processes. Quantifying these microstructural changes in Alzheimers disease and related neurodegenerative dementias could serve to accurately monitor or predict disease course. In the present study we used high-field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to determine how A{beta} and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6), alone or in combination, affect in vivo tissue microstructure in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimers-type A{beta} deposition. TgCRND8 and non-transgenic (nTg) mice expressing brain-targeted IL6 or enhanced glial fibrillary protein (EGFP controls) were scanned at 8 months of age using a 2-shell, 54-gradient direction dMRI sequence at 11.1 Tesla. Images were processed using the free water elimination method and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model. DTI and NODDI processing in TgCRND8 mice revealed a microstructure pattern consistent with reduced white matter integrity along with an increase in density and geometric complexity of axonal and dendritic processes. This included reduced FA, mean diffusivity (MD), and free water (FW), and increased neurite density (NDI) and orientation dispersion (ODI). IL6 produced a protective-like effect on FA in TgCRND8 mice, although there were minimal microstructure changes in these mice compared IL6 expressing nTg mice. In addition, we found that NDI and ODI had an inverse relationship with the functional connectome clustering coefficient, which was affected by A{beta} and IL6. The relationship between NODDI and graph theory metrics suggests that increasing the density and orientation dispersion of neurites may relate to diminished functional network organization in the brain.

There is evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation can boost learning performance. Arguably, this boost is related to synaptic plasticity. However, the precise effects on synaptic plasticity and its underlying mechanisms are not known. We hypothesized that direct current stimulation modulates endogenous Hebbian plasticity mechanisms due to its ability to polarize cellular membrane. To test this we induced long term plasticity (LTP) using theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in rat hippocampus, and measured the effects of concurrent direct current stimulation (DCS). Soma-depolarizing DCS increased TBS-induced LTP. Oscillating current stimulation is equally effective provided the soma-depolarizing phase is time-aligned with the theta-bursts, suggesting that only instantaneous depolarization is relevant. Importantly, the effect is pathway-specific and associative. These findings are consistent with classic theory on the role of post-synaptic membrane potential in Hebbian plasticity. These data suggest that the effects of direct current stimulation are specific because they modulate endogenous Hebbian plasticity, thus inheriting its exquisite functional specificity.

A longstanding question in neuroscience is how the activity of ion channels shapes neuronal activity and, as a result, computation in circuits and networks. Optogenetic reagents are tools to answer this question by enabling precise and dynamic perturbation of cellular states. However, development of these reagents can be hampered by low-throughput assays in non-physiological contexts. Here, we develop an all optical phenotypic screen in cultured primary hippocampal neurons that enables the functional assessment of large libraries of genetically encoded optogenetic actuators. Combining real-time analysis and data reduction methods allows for continuous observation of several thousand neurons for several days without onerous data storage overhead. This screening system may be useful in a diversity of research questions that can be coupled to optical perturbation and sensing.

Leigh syndrome is a fatal neurometabolic disorder caused by defects in mitochondrial function. mTOR inhibition with rapamycin attenuates disease progression in a mouse model of Leigh syndrome (Ndufs4 KO mouse); however, the mechanism of rescue is unknown. Here we assessed the impact of rapamycin on the brain proteome and phosphoproteome of Ndufs4 KO mice. We report that rapamycin remodels the brain proteome to alter mitochondrial structure, inhibits signaling through both mTOR complexes, and inhibits multiple protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Administration of PKC inhibitors was sufficient to increase survival, delay neurological deficits, and prevent hair loss in Ndufs4 KO mice. Thus, PKC may be a viable therapeutic target for treating severe mitochondrial disease.

The white matter architecture of brain networks imparts a distinct signature on neuronal co-activation patterns. Inter-regional projections promote synchrony among distant neuronal populations, giving rise to richly patterned functional networks. A variety of statistical, communication and biophysical models have been proposed to study the relationship between brain structure and function, but the link is not yet known. In the present report we seek to relate the structural and functional connection profiles of individual brain areas. We apply a simple multilinear model that incorporates information about spatial proximity, routing and diffusion between brain regions to predict their functional connectivity. We find that structure-function relationships vary markedly across the neocortex. Structure and function correspond closely in unimodal, primary sensory and motor regions, but diverge in transmodal cortex, corresponding to the default mode and salience networks. The divergence between structure and function systematically follows functional and cytoarchitectonic hierarchies. Altogether, the present results demonstrate that structural and functional networks do not align uniformly across the brain, but gradually uncouple in higher-order polysensory areas.

Extinction-based procedures are often used to inhibit maladaptive fear responses. However, because extinction procedures show efficacy limitations, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested as a promising add-on enhancer. In this study, we tested the effect of cathodal tDCS over extinction, to unveil the processes at play that boost the effectiveness of extinction procedures and its translational potential to the treatment of anxiety disorders. We implemented a fear conditioning procedure whereby 41 healthy women (mean age = 20.51 {+/-} 5.0) were assigned to either cathodal tDCS (n=27) or sham tDCS (n=16). Fear responses were measured with self-reports, autonomic responses, and implicit avoidance tendencies. Cathodal tDCS shows no statistically significant effect in extinction, according to self-reports, and seems to even negatively affect fear conditioned skin conductance responses. However, implicit avoidance tendencies, assessed one-to-three months after the tDCS session and extinction, reveal a group difference in the avoidance tendencies towards the neutral stimuli (F (1, 41) = 12.04, p = .001, {eta}p2 = .227), with the active cathodal tDCS groups showing a positive bias but not the sham group. This suggests a decreased generalization effect in the tDCS group with a moderate effect size. That is, cathodal tDCS may have enhanced long-term distinctiveness between threatening cues and perceptively similar neutral cues through a disambiguation process of the value of the neutral stimuli - a therapeutic target in anxiety disorders. Future studies should confirm these results and extend the study of cathodal tDCS effect on short term avoidance tendencies.

Glucocorticoid receptors (GR) have diverse functions relevant to maintenance of homeostasis and adaptation to environmental challenges. Understanding the importance of tissue-specific GR function in physiology and behavior has been hampered by near-ubiquitous localization in brain and body. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create a conditional GR knockout in Sprague Dawley rats. To test the impact of cell- and region-specific GR deletion on physiology and behavior, we targeted GR knockout to output neurons of the prelimbic cortex. Prelimbic deletion of GR in females caused deficits in acquisition and extinction of fear memory during auditory fear conditioning, whereas males exhibit enhanced active-coping behavior during forced swim. Our data support the utility of this conditional knockout rat to afford high-precision deletion of GR across a variety of contexts, ranging from neuronal depletion to circuit-wide manipulations, leveraging the behavioral tractability and enhanced brain size of the rat as a model organism.

In a recent study, Shinder and Taube (2019) concluded that head direction cells in the anterior thalamus of rats are tuned to one-dimensional (1D, yaw-only) motion exclusively, in contrast to recent findings in bats (Finkelstein et al. 2015), mice (Angelaki et al. 2016; Cham et al. 2017; Laurens et al. 2017), and rats (Page et al. 2017). Here we re-interpret the author's experimental results using model comparison and demonstrate that, contrary to their conclusions, their data actually supports the dual-axis rule (Page et al. 2017) and tilted azimuth model (Laurens and Angelaki 2018), where head direction cells use gravity to integrate 3D rotation signals about all cardinal axes of the head. We further show that this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of vertical orientation tuning; i.e. whether head direction cells encode 3D orientation in the horizontal and vertical planes conjunctively. Using model simulations, we demonstrate that, even if 3D tuning existed, the experimental protocol and data analyses used by Shinder and Taube (2019) would not have revealed it. We conclude that the actual experimental data of Shinder and Taube (2019) are compatible with the 3D properties of head direction cells discovered by other groups, yet incorrect conclusions were reached because of incomplete and qualitative analyses.

In high-field fMRI research, anatomical reference information (e.g., gray matter (GM) segmentation, cortical depth delineation) is often defined in volumes acquired with pulse sequences subject to different distortions than those in functional volumes. In these cases, reliable interpretation of ultra-high resolution fMRI data depends on excellent cross-modal registration of functional volumes to reference anatomical volumes. In this paper, we describe a two-step approach to automating assessments of cross-modal registration quality for the purpose of guiding depth-dependent analysis. First, each functional/anatomical registration was scored by the ratio of the number of GM voxels in the functional data overlapping anatomical GM to the number of GM voxels in the functional data overlapping anatomical white matter (WM). This GM:WM overlap ratio provided an objective metric for determining whether an alignment algorithm had converged on a solution that would pass visual inspection. Second, surface-based maps indicating the consistency of overlap between functional and anatomical GM throughout the GM depth were generated for the entire region of cortex covered by the experiment. These maps served as a mask for the purpose of excluding regions where registration between functional and anatomical data was inadequate and thus unable to support depth-dependent analyses. We found, for both real and simulated data, that functional response profiles that were less biased toward superficial responses in regions where these metrics indicated satisfactory registration.

Light microscopy on dynamic samples, for example neural activity in the brain, requires imaging large volumes at high rates. Here, we develop a tomography approach for scanning fluorescence microscopy which allows recording volume images at frame scan rates. Volumes are imaged by simultaneously recording four independent projections at different angles using temporally multiplexed, tilted Bessel beams. From the resulting projections, volumes are reconstructed using inverse Radon transforms combined with three dimensional convolutional neural networks (U-net). This tomography approach is suitable for experiments requiring fast volume imaging of sparse samples, as for example often encountered when imaging neural activity in the brain.

<p>by Cornelia Metzig, Oliver Ratmann, Daniela Bezemer, Caroline Colijn</p>

The relationship between the underlying contact network over which a pathogen spreads and the pathogen phylogenetic trees that are obtained presents an opportunity to use sequence data to learn about contact networks that are difficult to study empirically. However, this relationship is not explicitly known and is usually studied in simulations, often with the simplifying assumption that the contact network is static in time, though human contact networks are dynamic. We simulate pathogen phylogenetic trees on dynamic Erdős-Renyi random networks and on two dynamic networks with skewed degree distribution, of which one is additionally clustered. We use tree shape features to explore how adding dynamics changes the relationships between the overall network structure and phylogenies. Our tree features include the number of small substructures (cherries, pitchforks) in the trees, measures of tree imbalance (Sackin index, Colless index), features derived from network science (diameter, closeness), as well as features using the internal branch lengths from the tip to the root. Using principal component analysis we find that the network dynamics influence the shapes of phylogenies, as does the network type. We also compare dynamic and time-integrated static networks. We find, in particular, that static network models like the widely used Barabasi-Albert model can be poor approximations for dynamic networks. We explore the effects of mis-specifying the network on the performance of classifiers trained identify the transmission rate (using supervised learning methods). We find that both mis-specification of the underlying network and its parameters (mean degree, turnover rate) have a strong adverse effect on the ability to estimate the transmission parameter. We illustrate these results by classifying HIV trees with a classifier that we trained on simulated trees from different networks, infection rates and turnover rates. Our results point to the importance of correctly estimating and modelling contact networks with dynamics when using phylodynamic tools to estimate epidemiological parameters.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rV4sMhN-YuU" width="1" />

<p>by Stephen Woloszynek, Zhengqiao Zhao, Jian Chen, Gail L. Rosen</p>

Advances in high-throughput sequencing have increased the availability of microbiome sequencing data that can be exploited to characterize microbiome community structure <i>in situ</i>. We explore using word and sentence embedding approaches for nucleotide sequences since they may be a suitable numerical representation for downstream machine learning applications (especially deep learning). This work involves first encoding (“embedding”) each sequence into a dense, low-dimensional, numeric vector space. Here, we use Skip-Gram word2vec to embed <i>k</i>-mers, obtained from 16S rRNA amplicon surveys, and then leverage an existing sentence embedding technique to embed all sequences belonging to specific body sites or samples. We demonstrate that these representations are meaningful, and hence the embedding space can be exploited as a form of feature extraction for exploratory analysis. We show that sequence embeddings preserve relevant information about the sequencing data such as <i>k</i>-mer context, sequence taxonomy, and sample class. Specifically, the sequence embedding space resolved differences among phyla, as well as differences among genera within the same family. Distances between sequence embeddings had similar qualities to distances between alignment identities, and embedding multiple sequences can be thought of as generating a consensus sequence. In addition, embeddings are versatile features that can be used for many downstream tasks, such as taxonomic and sample classification. Using sample embeddings for body site classification resulted in negligible performance loss compared to using OTU abundance data, and clustering embeddings yielded high fidelity species clusters. Lastly, the <i>k</i>-mer embedding space captured distinct <i>k</i>-mer profiles that mapped to specific regions of the 16S rRNA gene and corresponded with particular body sites. Together, our results show that embedding sequences results in meaningful representations that can be used for exploratory analyses or for downstream machine learning applications that require numeric data. Moreover, because the embeddings are trained in an unsupervised manner, unlabeled data can be embedded and used to bolster supervised machine learning tasks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R28Evhi6UHc" width="1" />

The ability to detect environmental cold serves as an important survival tool.

Adrenergic signaling profoundly modulates animal behavior. For example, the invertebrate counterpart of norepinephrine, octopamine, and its biological precursor and functional antagonist, tyramine, adjust motor behavior to different nutritional states. In Drosophila larvae, food deprivation increases locomotor speed via octopamine-mediated structural plasticity of neuromuscular synapses, whereas tyramine reduces locomotor speed, but...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/CzX5ky9yjNc" width="1" />

Abstract<p>LDB1 is a protein cofactor that participates in several multiprotein complexes with transcription factors that regulate mouse forebrain development. Since <i>Ldb1</i> null mutants display early embryonic lethality, we used a conditional knockout strategy to examine the role of LDB1 in early forebrain development using multiple Cre lines. Loss of <i>Ldb1</i> from E8.75 using Foxg1Cre caused a disruption of midline boundary structures in the dorsal telencephalon. While this Cre line gave the expected pattern of recombination of the floxed <i>Ldb1</i> locus, unexpectedly, standard Cre lines that act from E10.5 (Emx1Cre) and E11.5 (NesCre) did not show efficient or complete recombination in the dorsal telencephalon by E12.5. Intriguingly, this effect was specific to the <i>Ldb1</i> floxed allele, since three other lines including floxed Ai9 and mTmG reporters, and a floxed <i>Lhx2</i> line, each displayed the expected spatial patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the incomplete recombination of the floxed <i>Ldb1</i> locus using NesCre was limited to the dorsal telencephalon, while the ventral telencephalon and the diencephalon displayed the expected loss of <i>Ldb1</i>. This permitted us to examine the requirement for LDB1 in the development of the thalamus in a context wherein the cortex continued to express <i>Ldb1</i>. We report that the somatosensory VB nucleus is profoundly shrunken upon loss of LDB1. Our findings highlight the unusual nature of the <i>Ldb1</i> locus in terms of recombination efficiency, and also report a novel role for LDB1 during the development of the thalamus.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The role of transcriptional co-factor LDB1 in mouse forebrain development was examined using a floxed <i>Ldb1</i> line and standard Cre driver lines Foxg1Cre, Emx1Cre, and NesCre. Foxg1Cre revealed that LDB1 is a key regulator of early telencephalic midline development. Curiously, the floxed <i>Ldb1</i> locus appeared to be selectively resistant to Cre-mediated recombination in the dorsal telencephalon using Emx1Cre and NesCre. Recombination improved with time in the case of Emx1Cre. NesCre recombined the floxed Ldb1 locus efficiently in the ventral telencephalon and in the diencephalon, where a critical requirement for this factor in the development of the somatosensory VB nucleus of the thalamus was revealed. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the extent of recombination when interpreting conditional loss-of-function phenotypes.</p>

Abstract<p>While recent work has revealed how different inhibitory interneurons influence responses of cortical neurons to sensory stimuli, little is known about their distinct contributions to sensory perception. Here, we optogenetically activated different genetically defined interneurons (parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)) in visual cortex (V1) of mice working at threshold in a contrast increment detection task. The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity during visual processing altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. The impairment produced by PV or SST activation persisted over several weeks of testing. In contrast, mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of any natural visual stimulus. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Inhibitory interneurons are diverse and influence sensory responses through multiple mechanisms. Currently there is little consensus on how different inhibitory signals affect sensory perception. Here, we investigated how genetically defined interneuron subclasses (parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)) influence visual contrast perception. Mice were trained to work at threshold in a visual contrast detection task and interneuron activity was enhanced using ChannelRhodopsin-2 on a subset of trials. Different interneuron classes influenced perception in distinct ways. PV and SST stimulation impaired, whereas VIP stimulation improved visual contrast perception. With training, mice learned to perceive VIP activation in the absence of natural visual stimulation. These data highlight how different inhibitory signals affect the transformation of sensory-evoked responses into percepts.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09189">Cortical Mirror-System Activation During Real-Life Game Playing: An Intracranial Electroencephalography (EEG) Study. (arXiv:1902.09189v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Analogous to the mirror neuron system repeatedly described in monkeys as a
possible substrate for imitation learning and/or action understanding, a
neuronal execution/observation matching system (OEMS) is assumed in humans, but
little is known to what extent this system is activated in non-experimental,
real-life conditions. In the present case study, we investigated brain activity
of this system during natural, non-experimental motor behavior as it occurred
during playing of the board game "Malefiz". We compared spectral modulations of
the high-gamma band related to ipsilateral reaching movement execution and
observation of the same kind of movement using electrocorticography (ECoG) in
one participant. Spatially coincident activity during both conditions execution
and observation was recorded at electrode contacts over the premotor/primary
motor cortex. The topography and amplitude of the high-gamma modulations
related to both, movement observation and execution were clearly spatially
correlated over several fronto-parietal brain areas. Thus, our findings
indicate that a network of cortical areas contributes to the human OEMS, beyond
primary/premotor cortex including Brocas area and the temporo-parieto-occipital
junction area, in real-life conditions.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08793">A visual encoding model based on deep neural networks and transfer learning. (arXiv:1902.08793v1 [cs.CV])</a></h4>

<p>Background: Building visual encoding models to accurately predict visual
responses is a central challenge for current vision-based brain-machine
interface techniques. To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals,
visual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate
prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft
visual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven
features (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also
assume a linear mapping between feature representation to brain activity.
However, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for
maximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding
framework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer
learning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a
nonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear
mapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve
prediction accuracy on brain activity. Results: The proposed framework can
significantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e.,
V1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy.
Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding
models, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher
prediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively
anterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new
framework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings
from visual features to brain activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44341">Synergy and remarkable specificity of antimicrobial peptides <i>in vivo</i> using a systematic knockout approach</a></h4>

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are host-encoded antibiotics that combat invading microorganisms. These short, cationic peptides have been implicated in many biological processes, primarily involving innate immunity. <i>In vitro</i> studies have shown AMPs kill bacteria and fungi at physiological concentrations, but little validation has been done <i>in vivo</i>. We utilised CRISPR gene editing to delete all known immune inducible AMPs of <i>Drosophila,</i> namely: 4 Attacins, 4 Cecropins, 2 Diptericins, Drosocin, Drosomycin, Metchnikowin and Defensin. Using individual and multiple knockouts, including flies lacking all 14 AMP genes, we characterize the <i>in vivo</i> function of individual and groups of AMPs against diverse bacterial and fungal pathogens. We found that <i>Drosophila</i> AMPs act primarily against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, contributing either additively or synergistically. We also describe remarkable specificity wherein certain AMPs contribute the bulk of microbicidal activity against specific pathogens, providing functional demonstrations of highly specific AMP-pathogen interactions in an <i>in vivo</i> setting.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43606">Long-term balancing selection drives evolution of immunity genes in <i>Capsella</i></a></h4>

Genetic drift is expected to remove polymorphism from populations over long periods of time, with the rate of polymorphism loss being accelerated when species experience strong reductions in population size. Adaptive forces that maintain genetic variation in populations, or balancing selection, might counteract this process. To understand the extent to which natural selection can drive the retention of genetic diversity, we document genomic variability after two parallel species-wide bottlenecks in the genus <i>Capsella</i>. We find that ancestral variation preferentially persists at immunity related loci, and that the same collection of alleles has been maintained in different lineages that have been separated for several million years. By reconstructing the evolution of the disease related locus <i>MLO2b</i>, we find that divergence between ancient haplotypes can be obscured by referenced based re-sequencing methods, and that trans-specific alleles can encode substantially diverged protein sequences. Our data point to long term balancing selection as an important factor shaping the genetics of immune systems in plants and as the predominant driver of genomic variability after a population bottleneck.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42182">Kinesin-6 regulates cell-size-dependent spindle elongation velocity to keep mitosis duration constant in fission yeast</a></h4>

The length of the mitotic spindle scales with cell size in a wide range of organisms during embryonic development. Interestingly, in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos, this goes along with temporal regulation: larger cells speed up spindle assembly and elongation. We demonstrate that, similarly in fission yeast, spindle length and spindle dynamics adjust to cell size, which allows to keep mitosis duration constant. Since prolongation of mitosis was shown to affect cell viability, this may resemble a mechanism to regulate mitosis duration. We further reveal how the velocity of spindle elongation is regulated: coupled to cell size, the amount of kinesin-6 Klp9 molecules increases, resulting in an acceleration of spindle elongation in anaphase B. In addition, the number of Klp9 binding sites to microtubules increases overproportionally to Klp9 molecules, suggesting that molecular crowding inversely correlates to cell size and might have an impact on spindle elongation velocity control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40947">Somatic mutations in early metazoan genes disrupt regulatory links between unicellular and multicellular genes in cancer</a></h4>

Extensive transcriptional alterations are observed in cancer, many of which activate core biological processes established in unicellular organisms or suppress differentiation pathways formed in metazoans. Through rigorous, integrative analysis of genomics data from a range of solid tumours, we show many transcriptional changes in tumours are tied to mutations disrupting regulatory interactions between unicellular and multicellular genes within human gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Recurrent point mutations were enriched in regulator genes linking unicellular and multicellular subnetworks, while copy-number alterations affected downstream target genes in distinctly unicellular and multicellular regions of the GRN. Our results depict drivers of tumourigenesis as genes that created key regulatory links during the evolution of early multicellular life, whose dysfunction creates widespread dysregulation of primitive elements of the GRN. Several genes we identified as important in this process were associated with drug response, demonstrating the potential clinical value of our approach.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40613">Bumblebee visual allometry results in locally improved resolution and globally improved sensitivity</a></h4>

The quality of visual information that is available to an animal is limited by the size of its eyes. Differences in eye size can be observed even between closely related individuals, yet we understand little about how this affects vision. Insects are good models for exploring the effects of size on visual systems because many insect species exhibit size polymorphism. Previous work has been limited by difficulties in determining the 3D structure of eyes. We have developed a novel method based on x-ray microtomography to measure the 3D structure of insect eyes and to calculate predictions of their visual capabilities. We used our method to investigate visual allometry in the bumblebee <i>Bombus terrestris</i> and found that size affects specific aspects of vision, including binocular overlap, optical sensitivity, and dorsofrontal visual resolution. This reveals that differential scaling between eye areas provides flexibility that improves the visual capabilities of larger bumblebees.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40162">Motion sensing superpixels (MOSES) is a systematic computational framework to quantify and discover cellular motion phenotypes</a></h4>

Correct cell/cell interactions and motion dynamics are fundamental in tissue homeostasis, and defects in these cellular processes cause diseases. Therefore, there is strong interest in identifying factors, including drug candidates that affect cell/cell interactions and motion dynamics. However, existing quantitative tools for systematically interrogating complex motion phenotypes in timelapse datasets are limited. We present Motion Sensing Superpixels (MOSES), a computational framework that measures and characterises biological motion with a unique superpixel ‘mesh’ formulation. Using published datasets, MOSES demonstrates single-cell tracking capability and more advanced population quantification than Particle Image Velocimetry approaches. From &gt; 190 co-culture videos, MOSES motion-mapped the interactions between human esophageal squamous epithelial and columnar cells mimicking the esophageal squamous-columnar junction, a site where Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma often arise clinically. MOSES is a powerful tool that will facilitate unbiased, systematic analysis of cellular dynamics from high-content time-lapse imaging screens with little prior knowledge and few assumptions.

Engaging with vocal sounds is critical for children’s social-emotional learning, and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often ‘tune out’ voices in their environment. Little is known regarding the neurobiological basis of voice processing and its link to social impairments in ASD. Here, we perform the first comprehensive brain network analysis of voice processing in children with ASD. We examined neural responses elicited by unfamiliar voices and mother’s voice, a biologically salient voice for social learning, and identified a striking relationship between social communication abilities in children with ASD and activation in key structures of reward and salience processing regions. Functional connectivity between voice-selective and reward regions during voice processing predicted social communication in children with ASD and distinguished them from typically developing children. Results support the Social Motivation Theory of ASD by showing reward system deficits associated with the processing of a critical social stimulus, mother’s voice, in children with ASD.

Two-pore-domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels are key regulators of many physiological and pathophysiological processes and thus emerged as promising drug targets. As for other potassium channels, there is a lack of selective blockers, since drugs preferentially bind to a conserved binding site located in the central cavity. Thus, there is a high medical need to identify novel drug-binding sites outside the conserved lipophilic central cavity and to identify new allosteric mechanisms of channel inhibition. Here, we identified a novel binding site and allosteric inhibition mechanism, disrupting the recently proposed K<sup>+</sup>-flux gating mechanism of K<sub>2P</sub> channels, which results in an unusual voltage-dependent block of leak channels belonging to the TASK subfamily. The new binding site and allosteric mechanism of inhibition provide structural and mechanistic insights into the gating of TASK channels and the basis for the drug design of a new class of potent blockers targeting specific types of K<sub>2P</sub> channels.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39279">Adaptation of olfactory receptor abundances for efficient coding</a></h4>

Olfactory receptor usage is highly heterogeneous, with some receptor types being orders of magnitude more abundant than others. We propose an explanation for this striking fact: the receptor distribution is tuned to maximally represent information about the olfactory environment in a regime of efficient coding that is sensitive to the global context of correlated sensor responses. This model predicts that in mammals, where olfactory sensory neurons are replaced regularly, receptor abundances should continuously adapt to odor statistics. Experimentally, increased exposure to odorants leads variously, but reproducibly, to increased, decreased, or unchanged abundances of different activated receptors. We demonstrate that this diversity of effects is required for efficient coding when sensors are broadly correlated, and provide an algorithm for predicting which olfactory receptors should increase or decrease in abundance following specific environmental changes. Finally, we give simple dynamical rules for neural birth and death processes that might underlie this adaptation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/562165v1?rss=1">Structural disconnections explain brain network dysfunction after stroke</a></h4>

Functional connectivity (FC) studies have identified physiological signatures of stroke that correlate with behavior. Using structural and functional MRI data from 114 stroke patients, 24 matched controls, and the Human Connectome Project, we tested the hypothesis that structural disconnection, not damage to critical regions, underlies FC disruptions. Disconnection severity outperformed damage to putative FC connector nodes for explaining reductions in system modularity, and multivariate models based on disconnection outperformed damage models for explaining FC disruptions within and between systems. Across patients, disconnection and FC patterns exhibited a low-dimensional covariance dominated by a single axis linking interhemispheric disconnections to reductions in FC measures of interhemispheric system integration, ipsilesional system segregation, and system modularity, and that correlated with multiple behavioral deficits. These findings clarify the structural basis of FC disruptions in stroke patients and demonstrate a low-dimensional link between perturbations of the structural connectome, disruptions of the functional connectome, and behavioral deficits.

Precise signaling at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is essential for proper muscle contraction. In the C. elegans pharynx, acetylcholine (ACh) released from the MC and M4 motor neurons stimulates two different types of contractions in adjacent muscle cells, termed pumping and isthmus peristalsis. MC stimulates rapid pumping through the nicotinic ACh receptor EAT-2, which is tightly localized at the MC NMJ, and eat-2 mutants exhibit a slow pump rate. Surprisingly, we found that eat-2 mutants also hyperstimulated peristaltic contractions, and these are characterized by increased and prolonged Ca2+ transients in the isthmus muscles. This hyperstimulation depends on crosstalk with the GAR-3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor as gar-3 mutation specifically suppressed the prolonged contraction and increased Ca2+ observed in eat-2 mutant peristalses. Similar GAR-3 dependent hyperstimulation was also observed in mutants lacking the ace-3 acetylcholinesterase, and we suggest that NMJ defects in eat-2 and ace-3 mutants result in ACh stimulation of extrasynaptic GAR-3 receptors in isthmus muscles. gar-3 mutation also suppressed slow larval growth and prolonged lifespan phenotypes that result from dietary restriction in eat-2 mutants, indicating that crosstalk with the GAR-3 receptor has a long-term impact on feeding behavior and eat-2 mutant phenotypes.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/561910v1?rss=1">Recollection and prior knowledge recruit the left angular gyrus during recognition</a></h4>

The human angular gyrus (AG) is implicated in recollection, or our ability to retrieve detailed memory content from a specific study episode. Parallel work also highlights a key role of the AG in the representation of general knowledge and semantics. How these two lines of research converge remains unclear. The present fMRI experiment used a remember-know paradigm with famous and non-famous faces to test whether activity in the AG could be modulated by both task-specific recollection and general prior knowledge in the same participants. Increased BOLD activity in the left AG was observed during both recollection in the absence of prior knowledge (i.e., recollected &gt; non-recollected or correctly rejected non-famous faces) and when prior knowledge was accessed in the absence of recollection (i.e., famous &gt; non-famous correct rejections). This pattern was unique to the left AG, and was not present in any other regions of the lateral inferior parietal lobe. Furthermore, the response profile of the left AG was consistent with accounts of recollection strength. Recollection-related activity was greater for faces with longer exposures at encoding than those with shorter exposures and was greater for stimuli with prior knowledge than those without, despite prior knowledge being incidental to the recognition decision. Therefore, the left AG is recruited during the access of both task-specific recollection and general prior knowledge, with greater activity as the amount of retrieved information increases, irrespective of its episodic or semantic nature.

Spina bifida aperta (SBA), one of the most common congenital malformations, causes various neurological disorders. Pain is a common complaint of patients with SBA. However, little is known about the neuropathology of SBA-related pain. Because loss of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn is associated with pain, we hypothesized the existence of cross-talk between SBA-related pain and alterations in GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord. Therefore, we investigated the kinetics of GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn in a chicken model of SBA. Neonatal chicks with SBA exhibited various pain-like behaviors, such as an increased number of vocalizations with elevated intensity (loudness) and frequency (pitch), reduced mobility, difficulty with locomotion, and escape reactions. Furthermore, the chicks with SBA did not respond to standard toe-pinching, indicating disruption of the spinal cord sensorimotor networks. These behavioral observations were concomitant with loss of GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn. We also found apoptosis of GABAergic neurons in the superficial dorsal horn in the early neonatal period, although cellular abnormalization and propagation of neurodegenerative signals were evident at middle to advanced gestational stages. In conclusion, ablation of GABAergic neurons induced alterations in spinal cord neuronal networks, providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of SBA-related pain-like complications.

People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) display abnormalities in motion processing. Motion perception abnormalities in ASD have been linked to high levels of internal noise (unreliable neuronal fluctuations), and deficits in motion pooling (integrating local motion into a global percept). However, the literature overall is equivocal. Traditionally, internal noise in ASD has been investigated through additive internal noise, comparing ASD and control groups. To date, multiplicative internal noise has not been investigated in ASD, and neither type of internal noise has been investigated in relation to traits of autism in the typically-developing population. Here, we investigate how additive and multiplicative internal noise and motion pooling vary across number of autistic traits in typically developed adults. We employed a visual motion integration task with a typically developed population, measuring autistic traits with the Autism Spectrum Questionnaire (AQ). Additive and multiplicative internal noise and motion pooling were calculated from task accuracy and consistency across a range of external noise levels, using a double-pass paradigm. We found that multiplicative noise (but not additive noise, or motion pooling) correlated with AQ. Specifically, multiplicative noise increased with AQ in a coarse motion discrimination task, while it decreased with AQ in a fine motion discrimination task. We suggest that the differences in multiplicative noise may be indicative of decision-variable fluctuations, which are smaller in individuals with a higher number of autistic traits, i.e., they are more focused. Our findings indicate that looking beyond additive noise and incorporating multiplicative noise estimation paradigms can help establish whether there are differences in internal noise levels between individuals with ASD and those without.

Both visual and proprioceptive information contribute to accurate limb movement, but the mechanism of integration of these different modality signals for movement control and learning remains controversial. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of integration by examining motor adaptation when various combinations of visual and proprioceptive perturbations were applied during reaching movements. We found that the movement corrections by adaptation were explained by a mechanism known as a divisive normalization, which was previously reported to be the mechanism underlying the integration of multisensory signals in neurons. Furthermore, we found evidence that the motor memory for each sensory modality was formed separately and the outputs from these memories were integrated. These results provide a novel view of the utilization of different sensory modality signals in motor control and adaptation.

<p>by Simona Olmi, Spase Petkoski, Maxime Guye, Fabrice Bartolomei, Viktor Jirsa</p>

Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a range of epileptiform discharges. Each patient’s virtual brain was further personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ. Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients, we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii) seizure propagation is characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the proposed seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures, neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability analysis of the network dynamics, employing structural and dynamical information, estimates reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage partial epilepsy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Abc4T-wF5M" width="1" />

<p>by Tuan Pham, Julie S. Haas</p>

As information about the world traverses the brain, the signals exchanged between neurons are passed and modulated by synapses, or specialized contacts between neurons. While neurotransmitter-based synapses tend to exert either excitatory or inhibitory pulses of influence on the postsynaptic neuron, electrical synapses, composed of plaques of gap junction channels, continuously transmit signals that can either excite or inhibit a coupled neighbor. A growing body of evidence indicates that electrical synapses, similar to their chemical counterparts, are modified in strength during physiological neuronal activity. The synchronizing role of electrical synapses in neuronal oscillations has been well established, but their impact on transient signal processing in the brain is much less understood. Here we constructed computational models based on the canonical feedforward neuronal circuit, and included electrical synapses between inhibitory interneurons. We provided discrete closely-timed inputs to the circuits, and characterize the influence of electrical synapse strength on both subthreshold summation and spike trains in the output neuron. Our simulations highlight the diverse and powerful roles that electrical synapses play even in simple circuits. Because these canonical circuits are represented widely throughout the brain, we expect that these are general principles for the influence of electrical synapses on transient signal processing across the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zdK2qO6vsyc" width="1" />

<p>by Anita T. Layton, Harold E. Layton</p>

We have developed the first computational model of solute and water transport from Bowman space to the papillary tip of the nephron of a human kidney. The nephron is represented as a tubule lined by a layer of epithelial cells, with apical and basolateral transporters that vary according to cell type. The model is formulated for steady state, and consists of a large system of coupled ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations. Model solution describes luminal fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, luminal fluid solute concentrations, cytosolic solute concentrations, epithelial membrane potential, and transcellular and paracellular fluxes. We found that if we assume that the transporter density and permeabilities are taken to be the same between the human and rat nephrons (with the exception of a glucose transporter along the proximal tubule and the H<sup>+</sup>-pump along the collecting duct), the model yields segmental deliveries and urinary excretion of volume and key solutes that are consistent with human data. The model predicted that the human nephron exhibits glomerulotubular balance, such that proximal tubular Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption varies proportionally to the single-nephron glomerular filtration rate. To simulate the action of a novel diabetic treatment, we inhibited the Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) along the proximal convoluted tubule. Simulation results predicted that the segment’s Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption decreased significantly, resulting in natriuresis and osmotic diuresis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-J5UiBBRPs" width="1" />

Abstract<p>CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene <i>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor</i> (<i>Bdnf</i>) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of <i>Bdnf</i> regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient <i>in vivo</i>, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures.

Abstract<p>Methylphenidate (MPH), commonly known as Ritalin, is the most widely prescribed drug worldwide to treat patients with attention deficit disorders. Although MPH is thought to modulate catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain, it remains unclear how these neurochemical effects influence neuronal activity and lead to attentional enhancements. Studies in rodents overwhelmingly point to the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a main site of action of MPH. To understand the mechanism of action of MPH in a primate brain, we recorded the responses of neuronal populations using chronic multielectrode arrays implanted in the caudal LPFC of two macaque monkeys while the animals performed an attention task (N = 2811 neuronal recordings). Over different recording sessions (N=55), we orally administered either various doses of MPH or a placebo to the animals. Behavioral analyses revealed positive effects of MPH on task performance at specific doses. However, analyses of individual neurons activity, noise correlations, and neuronal ensemble activity using machine learning algorithms revealed no effects of MPH. Our results suggest that the positive behavioral effects of MPH observed in primates (including humans) may not be mediated by changes in the activity of caudal LPFC neurons. MPH may enhance cognitive performance by modulating neuronal activity in other regions of the attentional network in the primate brain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Methylphenidate (MPH), widely known as Ritalin, is the most prescribed drug to treat patients with attention deficits. Nonetheless, it is still unclear how and why the drug improves attention in humans. Studies in rodents point to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as the main target of MPH. To validate these findings in primates, we trained macaque monkeys to perform an attention task while under various doses of MPH. We also chronically implanted multielectrode arrays in the posterior PFC of these monkeys to record neuronal ensemble activity during the task. Surprisingly, we found no effect of the drug on neuronal activity, even at cognitive-enhancing doses of MPH. The caudal prefrontal cortex might not be the site of action of MPH in the primate brain.</p>

Abstract<p>Automatic mimicry is a critical element of social interaction. A salient type of automatic mimicry is eye contact characterized by sharing of affective and mental states among individuals. We conducted a hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving online (LIVE) and delayed off-line (REPLAY) conditions to test our hypothesis that recurrent interaction through eye contact activates the limbic mirror system, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AIC), both of which are critical for self-awareness. Sixteen pairs of human adults participated in the experiment. Given that an eye-blink represents an individual’s attentional window toward the partner, we analyzed pairwise time-series data for eye-blinks. We used multivariate autoregression analysis to calculate the noise contribution ratio (NCR) as an index of how a participant’s directional attention was influenced by that of their partner. NCR was greater in the LIVE than in the REPLAY condition, indicating mutual perceptual–motor interaction during real-time eye contact. Relative to the REPLAY condition, the LIVE condition was associated with greater activation in the left cerebellar hemisphere, vermis, and ACC, accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity between ACC and right AIC. Given the roles of the cerebellum in sensorimotor prediction and ACC in movement initiation, ACC–cerebellar activation may represent their involvement in modulating visual input related to the partner’s movement, which may, in turn, involve the limbic mirror system. Our findings indicate that mutual interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Eye contact is a key element that connects humans during social communication. We focused on a previously unaddressed characteristic of eye contact: real-time mutual interaction as a form of automatic mimicry. Our results indicate that real-time interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system. These findings underscore the importance of the mirror system and cerebellum in real-time unconscious social interaction.</p>

Abstract<p>Seizures are characterized by hypersynchronization of neuronal networks. Understanding these networks could provide a critical window for therapeutic control of recurrent seizure activity i.e., epilepsy. However, imaging seizure networks has largely been limited to microcircuits <i>in vitro</i> or small "windows" <i>in vivo</i>. Here we combine fast confocal imaging of GCaMP-expressing larval zebrafish with local field potential (LFP) recordings to study epileptiform events at whole-brain and single-neuron levels <i>in vivo</i>. Using an acute seizure model (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ), we reliably observed recurrent electrographic ictal-like events associated with generalized activation of all major brain regions and uncovered a well-preserved anterior-to-posterior seizure propagation pattern. We also examined brain-wide network synchronization and spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the optic tectum microcircuit. Brain-wide and single-neuronal level analysis of PTZ- and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-exposed zebrafish revealed distinct network dynamics associated with seizure and non-seizure hyperexcitable states, respectively. Neuronal ensembles, comprised of coactive neurons, were also uncovered during interictal-like periods. Taken together, these results demonstrate that macro- and micro-network calcium motifs in zebrafish may provide a greater understanding of epilepsy.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Monitoring the dynamic activities in large-scale neuronal networks is critical to understanding seizure initiation and propagation. Here, we utilized well-established larval zebrafish seizure protocols and fast confocal imaging of GCaMP-expressing fish to investigate the epileptic network properties at brain-wide and single-cell levels. We revealed the rapid propagation of seizure activity from anterior-to-posterior brain regions in zebrafish central nervous system. We also showed that micro-ensembles of neuronal subpopulations are active during interictal-like periods in a manner similar to that seen in human electrophysiology data sets. Our findings demonstrate that these non-invasive optical imaging approaches will advance our understanding of the network basis underlying seizures and facilitate the development of methods to suppress these events.</p>

Abstract
<p>The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) are areas affected early and severely in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and this is associated with deficits in episodic memory. Amyloid-β (Aβ), the main protein found in amyloid plaques, can affect neuronal physiology and excitability, and several AD mouse models with memory impairments display aberrant network activity, including hyperexcitability and seizures. In this study, we investigated single cell physiology in EC and network activity in EC and dentate gyrus (DG) in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat model, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in acute slices. In slices from transgenic animals up to 4 months of age, the majority of the principal neurons in Layer II of EC, fan cells and stellate cells, expressed intracellular Aβ (iAβ). Whereas the electrophysiological properties of fan cells were unaltered, stellate cells were more excitable in transgenic than in control rats. Stimulation in the DG resulted in comparable patterns in both groups at three and nine months, but at 12 months, the elicited responses in the transgenic group showed a significant preference for the enclosed blade, without any change in overall excitability. Only transient changes in the local network activity were seen in the medial EC (MEC). Although the observed changes in the McGill rat model are subtle, they are specific, pointing to a differential and selective involvement of specific parts of the hippocampal circuitry in Aβ pathology.</p>

Abstract
<p>The consolidation of newly formed memories and their retrieval are energetically demanding processes. Aerobic glycolysis (AG), also known as the Warburg effect, consists of the production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen. The astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis posits that astrocytes process glucose by AG to generate lactate, which is used as a fuel source within neurons to maintain synaptic activity. Studies in mice have demonstrated that lactate transport between astrocytes and neurons is required for long-term memory formation, yet the role of lactate production in memory acquisition and retrieval has not previously been explored. Here, we examined the effect of dichloroacetate (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of lactate production, on spatial learning and memory in mice using the Morris water maze (MWM). <i>In vivo</i> hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the mouse brain following DCA administration, concomitant with a reduction in the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. DCA exposure before each training session in the MWM impaired learning, which subsequently resulted in impaired memory during the probe trial. In contrast, mice that underwent training without DCA exposure, but received a single DCA injection before the probe trial exhibited normal memory. Our findings indicate that AG plays a key role during memory acquisition but is less important for the retrieval of established memories. Thus, the activation of AG may be important for learning-dependent synaptic plasticity rather than the activation of signaling cascades required for memory retrieval.</p>

Abstract
<p>Prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of neurobehavioral pathologies, including autism and schizophrenia. A common feature of these psychiatric disorders is prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory circuit disruption due to GABAergic interneuron alteration. Cortical interneurons are generated and migrate throughout late gestation and early infancy, making them highly susceptible to perinatal insults such as preterm birth. Term and preterm PFC pathology specimens were assessed using immunohistochemical markers for interneurons. Based on the changes seen, a new preterm encephalopathy mouse model was developed to produce similar PFC interneuron loss. Maternal immune activation (MIA; modeling chorioamnionitis, associated with 85% of extremely preterm births) was combined with chronic sublethal hypoxia (CSH; modeling preterm respiratory failure), with offspring of both sexes assessed anatomically, molecularly and neurobehaviorally. In the PFC examined from the human preterm samples compared to matched term samples at corrected age, a decrease in somatostatin (SST) and calbindin (CLB) interneurons was seen in upper cortical layers. This pattern of interneuron loss in upper cortical layers was mimicked in the mouse PFC following the combination of MIA and CSH, but not after either insult alone. This persistent interneuron loss is associated with postnatal microglial activation that occurs during CSH only after MIA. The combined insults lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits which parallel human psychopathologies that may be seen after extremely preterm birth. This new preclinical model supports a paradigm in which specific cellular alterations seen in preterm encephalopathy can be linked with a risk of neuropsychiatric sequela. Specific interneuron subtypes may provide therapeutic targets to prevent or ameliorate these neurodevelopmental risks.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify brain regions whose metabolic impairment contributes to DLB clinical core features expression and to assess the influence of severity of global cognitive impairment on the DLB‐hypometabolic‐pattern.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain FDG‐PET and information on core features were available in 171 patients belonging to the imaging repository of the European DLB‐consortium. Principal component analysis was applied to identify brain regions relevant to the local data variance. A linear regression model was applied to generate core feature<span>‐</span>specific patterns controlling for the main confounding variables (MMSE, Age, Education, Gender, and Center). Regression analysis to the locally‐normalized intensities was performed to generate a MMSE score‐sensitive map.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Parkinsonism negatively covaried with bilateral parietal, precuneus and anterior cingulate metabolism, visual‐hallucinations with bilateral dorsolateral‐frontal cortex, posterior cingulate and parietal metabolism and RBD with bilateral parieto‐occipital cortex, precuneus and ventrolateral‐frontal metabolism. VH and RBD shared a positive covariance with metabolism in medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, thalami, orbitofrontal and sensorimotor cortex. Cognitive fluctuations negatively covaried with occipital metabolism and positively with parietal lobes metabolism. MMSE positively covaried with metabolism in left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral‐parietal cortex, and left precuneus, and negatively with metabolism in insula, medial frontal gyrus, hippocampus in the left hemisphere and in right cerebellum.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Regions of more preserved metabolism are relatively consistent across the variegate DLB spectrum. By contrast, core features were associated to more prominent hypometabolism in specific regions thus suggesting a close clinical‐imaging correlation, reflecting the interplay between topography of neurodegeneration and clinical presentation in DLB patients.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
<p>Currently, the exact reasons why different α‐synucleinopathies exhibit variable pathologies and phenotypes are still unknown. A potential explanation may be the existence of distinctive α‐synuclein conformers or strains. Here, we intend to analyse the seeding activity of Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brain derived α‐synuclein seeds via real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) and to investigate the structure and morphology of the α‐synuclein aggregates generated via RT‐QuIC.</p>


<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>A misfolded α‐synuclein‐enriched brain fraction from frontal cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta tissue, isolated by several filtration and centrifugation steps, was subjected to α‐synuclein‐RT‐QuIC‐analysis. Our study included neuropathologically well‐characterised cases with DLB, PD and controls (Ctrl). Biochemical and morphological analyses of RT‐QuIC products were conducted by western blot, dot blot analysis, Raman spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy.</p>


<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>Independently from the brain region, we observed different seeding kinetics of α‐synuclein in the RT‐QuIC in patients with DLB compared to PD and Ctrl. Biochemical characterization of the RT‐QuIC product indicated the generation of a PK‐resistant and fibrillary α‐synuclein species in DLB seeded reactions, while PD and control seeds failed in the conversion of wild type α‐synuclein substrate.</p>


<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>Structural variances of α‐synuclein seeding kinetics and products in DLB and PD indicated for the first time the existence of different α‐synuclein strains in these groups. Therefore, our study contributes to a better understanding of the clinical heterogeneity among α‐synucleinopathies, offers an opportunity for a specific diagnosis and opens new avenues for the future development of strain‐specific therapies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>Patients with chronic stroke have been shown to have failure to release interhemispheric inhibition from the intact to the damaged hemisphere prior to movement execution (<i>pre‐movement‐IHI</i>). This inhibitory imbalance was found to correlate with poor motor performance in the chronic stage after stroke, and has since become a target for therapeutic interventions. The logic of this approach, however, implies that abnormal pre‐movement‐IHI is causal to poor behavioral outcome, and should therefore be present early after stroke when motor impairment is at its worst. In a longitudinal study, we investigated interhemispheric interactions by tracking patients’ pre‐movement‐IHI for one year following stroke.</p>


<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>We assessed pre‐movement‐IHI and motor behavior five times over a one‐year period after ischemic stroke in 22 patients, and in 11 healthy participants.</p>


<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>We found that pre‐movement‐IHI was normal during the acute/subacute period, and only became abnormal at the chronic stage; specifically, release of IHI in movement preparation worsened as motor behavior improved. In addition, pre‐movement‐IHI did not correlate with behavioral measures cross‐sectionally, while the longitudinal emergence of abnormal pre‐movement‐IHI from the acute to the chronic stage was inversely correlated with recovery of finger individuation.</p>


<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>These results suggest that interhemispheric imbalance is not a cause of poor motor recovery but instead might be the consequence of underlying recovery processes. These findings call into question the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to rebalance interhemispheric interactions in order to improve motor recovery after stroke.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To understand the safety, putaminal coverage, and enzyme expression of adeno‐associated viral vector serotype‐2 encoding the cDNA for the enzyme aromatic L‐amino acid decarboxylase (VY‐AADC01) delivered using novel intraoperative monitoring to optimize delivery.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifteen subjects (3 cohorts of 5) with moderately‐advanced Parkinson's disease and medically‐refractory motor fluctuations received VY‐AADC01 bilaterally co‐administered with gadoteridol to the putamen using intra‐operative MRI‐guidance to visualize the anatomic spread of the infusate and calculate coverage. Cohort 1 received 8.3×10<sup>11</sup> vg/mL and ≤450 μL per putamen (total dose ≤7.5×10<sup>11</sup> vg); cohort 2 received the same concentration (8.3×10<sup>11</sup> vg/mL) and ≤900 μL per putamen (total dose ≤1.5×10<sup>12</sup> vg); cohort 3 received 2.6×10<sup>12</sup> vg/mL and ≤900 μL per putamen (total dose ≤4.7×10<sup>12</sup> vg). (18)F‐fluoro‐L‐dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography at baseline and 6 months post‐procedure assessed enzyme activity; standard assessments measured clinical outcomes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MRI‐guided administration of ascending VY‐AADC01 doses resulted in putaminal coverage of 21% (cohort 1), 34% (cohort 2) and 42% (cohort 3). Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 showed corresponding increases in enzyme activity assessed by positron emission tomography of 13%, 56%, and 79%, and reductions in anti‐parkinsonian medication of ‐15%, ‐33%, and ‐42%, respectively at 6 months. At 12 months, there were dose‐related improvements in clinical outcomes including increases in patient‐reported ON‐time without troublesome dyskinesia (1.6, 3.3, and 1.5 hours, respectively), and quality of life.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel intraoperative monitoring of administration facilitated targeted delivery of VY‐AADC01 in this phase 1 study, which was well tolerated. Increases in enzyme expression and clinical improvements were dose dependent.</p>

<p>Cortical slow oscillations are an emergent property of the cortical network,
hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and representing a default
activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying
the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and
enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied
to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the
methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a
custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized
mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Waves Analysis
Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the
spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison
of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way,
allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects,
or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical
simulations. By using SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in
the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites.
Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the
electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an
oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral towards occipito-medial regions,
further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results
obtained on spatial characterization of slow oscillations will be essential for
producing data-driven brain simulations and for triggering a discussion on the
role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex,
improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of
delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties.

<p>Standard neuroimaging techniques provide non-invasive access not only to
human brain anatomy but also to its physiology. The activity recorded with
these techniques is generally called functional imaging, but what is observed
per se is an instance of dynamics, from which functional brain activity should
be extracted. Distinguishing between bare dynamics and genuine function is a
highly non-trivial task, but a crucially important one when comparing
experimental observations and interpreting their significance. Here we
illustrate how the ability of neuroimaging to extract genuine functional brain
activity is bounded by the structure of functional representations. To do so,
we first provide a simple definition of functional brain activity from a
system-level brain imaging perspective. We then review how the properties of
the space on which brain activity is represented allow defining relations
ranging from distinguishability to accessibility of observed imaging data. We
show how these properties result from the structure defined on dynamical data
and dynamics-to-function projections, and consider some implications that the
way and extent to which these are defined have for the interpretation of
experimental data from standard system-level brain recording techniques.

<p>Recent studies have suggested that the cognitive process of the human brain
is realized as probabilistic inference and can be further modeled by
probabilistic graphical models like Markov random fields. Nevertheless, it
remains unclear how probabilistic inference can be implemented by a network of
spiking neurons in the brain. Previous studies tried to relate the inference
equation of binary Markov random fields to the dynamic equation of spiking
neural networks through belief propagation algorithm and reparameterization,
but they are valid only for Markov random fields with limited network
structure. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network model that can
implement inference of arbitrary binary Markov random fields. Specifically, we
design a spiking recurrent neural network and prove that its neuronal dynamics
are mathematically equivalent to the inference process of Markov random fields
by adopting mean-field theory. Theoretical analysis and experimental results,

<p>Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple
spatial and temporal scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA),
characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia, to fluctuating, asynchronous
activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses a challenge for
producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors of
short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW
different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan
and at different levels, which implies a wide variety of loads of local
computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance
and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic
states. Here, we demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed
and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and
AW for bidimensional grids of neural populations, which reflects the modular
organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each
composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation,
and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying
spatial decay constant. For the largest networks the total number of synapses
was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to 64 dual-socket
nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz
clock. Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution time showed
good scaling performances from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using the
standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. We achieved simulation
speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both
cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.

<p>Here we summarize abundant excuses that support the eye detection can be as a
noninvasive approach to early diagnose some brain disorders, including
Alzheimer disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SZ) and
major depressive disorder (MDD). Real-time ocular responses in everyone are
tightly associated with emotional state and cognitive processing in the brain.
At the eyeball areas, at least changes involved saccades, pupil response,
blinking, microvascular network morphology and thickness of retinal nerve fiber
layer (RNFL) are potentially to be candidates of biomarker to screen and
evaluate brain disorders. These days medical big data will be more accessible
especially with the help of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze
precisely. Computer vision combined with machine-learning based AI particularly
deep-learning neural networks sheds a new light on cognitive neuroscience, and
many patients with psychotic disorders will primarily benefit from this
interdisciplinary advance to induce self-evaluation and real-time intervention
on brain disorders. Finally, we call for more AI applications going to approach
brain disorder issues, meanwhile, AI technology used in brain healthcare should
be working together with biological intelligence as we are running an AI
manifestation for major depression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44552">Aurora A depletion reveals centrosome-independent polarization mechanism in <i>C. elegans</i></a></h4>

How living systems break symmetry in an organized manner is a fundamental question in biology. In wild type <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i>zygotes, symmetry breaking during anterior-posterior axis specification is guided by centrosomes, resulting in anterior-directed cortical flows and a single posterior PAR-2 domain. We uncover that <i>C. elegans</i> zygotes depleted of the Aurora A kinase AIR-1 or lacking centrosomes entirely usually establish two posterior PAR-2 domains, one at each pole. We demonstrate that AIR-1 prevents symmetry breaking early in the cell cycle, whereas centrosomal AIR-1 instructs polarity initiation thereafter. Using triangular microfabricated chambers, we establish that bipolarity of <i>air-1</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) embryos occurs effectively in a cell-shape and curvature-dependent manner. Furthermore, we develop an integrated physical description of symmetry breaking, wherein local PAR-2-dependent weakening of the actin cortex, together with mutual inhibition of anterior and posterior PAR proteins, provides a mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking without centrosomes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44427">Discriminative stimuli are sufficient for incubation of cocaine craving</a></h4>

In abstinent drug addicts, cues formerly associated with drug-taking experiences gain relapse-inducing potency ('<i>incubate</i>') over time. Animal models of incubation may help develop treatments to prevent relapse, but these models have ubiquitously focused on the role of conditioned stimuli (CSs) signaling drug delivery. Discriminative stimuli (DSs) are unique in that they exert stimulus-control over both drug taking and drug seeking behavior and are difficult to extinguish. For this reason, incubation of the excitatory effects of DSs that signal drug availability, not yet examined in preclinical studies, could be relevant to relapse prevention. We trained rats to self-administer cocaine (or palatable food) under DS control, then investigated DS-controlled incubation of craving, in the absence of drug-paired CSs. DS-controlled cocaine (but not palatable food) seeking incubated over 60 days of abstinence and persisted up to 300 days. Understanding the neural mechanisms of this DS-controlled incubation holds promise for drug relapse treatments.

Piezo is a mechanosensitive ion channel that transduces mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. Here, Song et al. show that Piezo is recruited after axon injury to inhibit axon regeneration via the CamKII-Nos-PKG pathway, a process that may be evolutionarily conserved.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disease‐associated proteins are thought to propagate along neuronal processes in neurodegenerative diseases. To detect disease‐associated prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) in the vagus nerve in different forms and molecular subtypes of Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease (CJD) we applied three different anti‐PrP antibodies. We screened the vagus nerve in 162 sporadic and 30 genetic CJD cases. 4/31 VV‐2 type sporadic CJD and 7/30 genetic CJD cases showed vagal PrP<sup>Sc</sup> immunodeposits with distinct morphology. Thus PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in CJD affects the vagus nerve analogously to α‐synuclein in Parkinson's disease. The morphologically diverse deposition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in genetic and sporadic CJD argues against uniform mechanisms of propagation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>

</h2>
<p>A reliable biomarker is needed for accurate and early differentiation between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the various forms of atypical parkinsonism (AP). We used a novel real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) assay to detect alpha‐synuclein (α‐syn) aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 118 patients with parkinsonism of uncertain clinical etiology and 52 controls. Diagnostic accuracy to distinguish α‐synucleinopathies from non‐α‐synucleinopathies and controls was 84% (sensitivity 75%, specificity 94% (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.78‐0.91, p&lt;0.0001), PPV 93%). CSF α‐syn RT‐QuIC could be a useful diagnostic tool to help clinicians differentiate α‐synucleinopathies from other forms of parkinsonism when the clinical picture is uncertain.</p>

Recent decades have seen dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries, typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology that is used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms that are used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information.

<p>by Nir Even-Chen, Blue Sheffer, Saurabh Vyas, Stephen I. Ryu, Krishna V. Shenoy</p>

Voluntary movements are widely considered to be planned before they are executed. Recent studies have hypothesized that neural activity in motor cortex during preparation acts as an ‘initial condition’ which seeds the proceeding neural dynamics. Here, we studied these initial conditions in detail by investigating 1) the organization of neural states for different reaches and 2) the variance of these neural states from trial to trial. We examined population-level responses in macaque premotor cortex (PMd) during the preparatory stage of an instructed-delay center-out reaching task with dense target configurations. We found that after target onset the neural activity on single trials converges to neural states that have a clear low-dimensional structure which is organized by both the reach endpoint and maximum speed of the following reach. Further, we found that variability of the neural states during preparation resembles the spatial variability of reaches made in the absence of visual feedback: there is less variability in direction than distance in neural state space. We also used offline decoding to understand the implications of this neural population structure for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). We found that decoding of angle between reaches is dependent on reach distance, while decoding of arc-length is independent. Thus, it might be more appropriate to quantify decoding performance for discrete BMIs by using arc-length between reach end-points rather than the angle between them. Lastly, we show that in contrast to the common notion that direction can better be decoded than distance, their decoding capabilities are comparable. These results provide new insights into the dynamical neural processes that underline motor control and can inform the design of BMIs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N3F6MvYWZS4" width="1" />

Mutation signatures in cancer genomes reflect endogenous and exogenous mutational processes, offering insights into tumour etiology, features for prognostic and biologic stratification and vulnerabilities to be exploited therapeutically. We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n = 755 samples total). We show how introducing correlated structure both within and between modes of mutation can increase accuracy of signature discovery, particularly in the context of sparse data. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, and provides a statistical modeling framework to incorporate additional features of interest for future studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7X5eaEu-c" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (PCD), contributes to neurodegeneration in several disorders, including ALS. Supporting this view, investigations in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of ALS have implicated key molecular determinants of necroptosis in the death of spinal motor neurons (MNs). Consistent with a pathogenic role of necroptosis in ALS, we showed increased mRNA levels for the three main necroptosis effectors <i>Ripk1</i>, <i>Ripk3</i>, and <i>Mlkl</i> in the spinal cord of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) transgenic mice (Tg), an established model of ALS. In addition, protein levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1; but not of RIPK3, MLKL or activated MLKL) were elevated in spinal cord extracts from these Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. In postmortem motor cortex samples from sporadic and familial ALS patients, no change in protein levels of RIPK1 were detected. Silencing of <i>Ripk3</i> in cultured MNs protected them from toxicity associated with SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> astrocytes. However, constitutive deletion of <i>Ripk3</i> in Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice failed to provide behavioral or neuropathological improvement, demonstrating no similar benefit of <i>Ripk3</i> silencing <i>in vivo</i>. Lastly, we detected no genotype-specific myelin decompaction, proposed to be a proxy of necroptosis in ALS, in either Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> or <i>Optineurin</i> knock-out mice, another ALS mouse model. These findings argue against a role for RIPK3 in Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-induced neurodegeneration and call for further preclinical investigations to determine if necroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALS.</p>

<p>We develop a method for the automated detection and segmentation of speech
balloons in comic books, including their carrier and tails. Our method is based
on a deep convolutional neural network that was trained on annotated pages of
the Graphic Narrative Corpus. More precisely, we are using a fully
convolutional network approach inspired by the U-Net architecture, combined
with a VGG-16 based encoder. The trained model delivers state-of-the-art
performance with an F1-score of over 0.94. Qualitative results suggest that
wiggly tails, curved corners, and even illusory contours do not pose a major
problem. Furthermore, the model has learned to distinguish speech balloons from
captions. We compare our model to earlier results and discuss some possible
applications.

<p>Olfaction is the first sensory modality to develop during fetal life in
mammals, and plays a key role in the various behaviors of neonates such as
feeding and social interaction. Odorant cues (i.e., mother or predator scents)
can trigger potentiation or inhibition of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV)
emitted by pups following their isolation. Here, we report how USV are
inhibited by olfactory cues using a sono-olfactometer that has been designed to
quantify precisely olfaction in pups congenitally infected by cytomegalovirus.
This olfactory-driven behavioral test assesses the USV emitted in presence of
unfamiliar odorants such as citral scent or adult male mouse scent. We measure
the number of USV emitted as an index of odorant detection during the three
periods of the 5-min isolation time of the pup into the sono-olfactometer:
first period without any odorant, second period with odorant exposure and last
period with exhaust odorant. This protocol can be easily used to reveal
olfactory deficits in pups with altered olfactory system due to toxic lesions
or infectious diseases.

<p>Whole-brain computational modeling based on structural connectivity measures
has shown great promise in successfully simulating fMRI BOLD signals that
includes temporal co-activation patterns that are highly similar to empirical
functional connectivity patterns during resting state. Importantly, previous
studies have shown that spontaneous fluctuations in co-activation patterns of
distributed brain regions have an inherent dynamic nature with regard to the
frequency spectrum of intrinsic brain oscillations. In this modeling study, we
introduce frequency dynamics into a system of coupled oscillators, where each
oscillator represents the local mean-field model of a brain region. We first
show that the collective behavior of interacting oscillators reproduces
previously shown features of brain dynamics. Our analysis of static and dynamic
measures of simulated BOLD fMRI signals support the notion that the frequency
of each oscillator is modulated by flow of activity in its neighborhood.
Second, we examine the effects of simulated lesions in gray brain matter by
applying a new perturbation protocol to our model. We present a new approach to
map the effects of vulnerability in brain networks and introducing a measure of
regional hazardousness based on mapping of the degree of divergence in a
feature space consisting of graph theoretical measures.

<p>We studied the interactions between different temporal scales of diffusion
processes on complex networks and found them to be stronger in scale-free (SF)
than in Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, especially for the case of phase-amplitude
coupling (PAC)-the phenomenon where the phase of an oscillatory mode modulates
the amplitude of another oscillation. We found that SF networks facilitate PAC
between slow and fast frequency components of the diffusion process, whereas ER
networks enable PAC between slow-frequency components. Nodes contributing the
most to the generation of PAC in SF networks were non-hubs that connected with
high probability to hubs. Additionally, brain networks from healthy controls
(HC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients presented a weaker PAC between slow
and fast frequencies than SF, but higher than ER. We found that PAC decreased
in AD compared to HC and was more strongly correlated to the scores of two
different cognitive tests than what the strength of functional connectivity
was, suggesting a link between cognitive impairment and multi-scale information
flow in the brain.

<p>by David Aagten-Murphy, Paul M. Bays</p>

Visuospatial working memory enables us to maintain access to visual information for processing even when a stimulus is no longer present, due to occlusion, our own movements, or transience of the stimulus. Here we show that, when localizing remembered stimuli, the precision of spatial recall does not rely solely on memory for individual stimuli, but additionally depends on the relative distances between stimuli and visual landmarks in the surroundings. Across three separate experiments, we consistently observed a spatially selective improvement in the precision of recall for items located near a persistent landmark. While the results did not require that the landmark be visible throughout the memory delay period, it was essential that it was visible both during encoding and response. We present a simple model that can accurately capture human performance by considering relative (allocentric) spatial information as an independent localization estimate which degrades with distance and is optimally integrated with egocentric spatial information. Critically, allocentric information was encoded without cost to egocentric estimation, demonstrating independent storage of the two sources of information. Finally, when egocentric and allocentric estimates were put in conflict, the model successfully predicted the resulting localization errors. We suggest that the relative distance between stimuli represents an additional, independent spatial cue for memory recall. This cue information is likely to be critical for spatial localization in natural settings which contain an abundance of visual landmarks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zTQCOc-GLrU" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Scott A Alpizar, In Ha Cho, Michael B Hoppa</p><div><p>Ion channels are microscopic pore proteins in the membrane that open and close in response to chemical and electrical stimuli. This simple concept underlies rapid electrical signaling in the brain as well as several important aspects of neural plasticity. Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.</p></div>

Based on morphology it is often challenging to distinguish between the many different soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. Moreover, outcome of disease is highly variable even between patients with the same disease. Machine learning on transcriptome sequencing data could be a valuable new tool to understand differences between and within entities. Here we used machine learning analysis to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for soft tissue sarcomas. Gene expression data was used from the Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression data and the French Sarcoma Group. We identified three groups of tumors that overlap in their molecular profile as seen with unsupervised t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering and a deep neural network. The three groups corresponded to subtypes that are morphologically overlapping. Using a random forest algorithm, we identified novel diagnostic markers for soft tissue sarcoma that distinguished between synovial sarcoma and MPNST, and that we validated using qRT-PCR in an independent series. Next, we identified prognostic genes that are strong predictors of disease outcome when used in a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The prognostic genes were further validated in expression data from the French Sarcoma Group. One of these, <i>HMMR</i>, was validated in an independent series of leiomyosarcomas using immunohistochemistry on tissue micro array as a prognostic gene for disease-free interval. Furthermore, reconstruction of regulatory networks combined with data from the Connectivity Map showed, amongst others, that HDAC inhibitors could be a potential effective therapy for multiple soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. A viability assay with two HDAC inhibitors confirmed that both leiomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma are sensitive to HDAC inhibition. In this study we identified novel diagnostic markers, prognostic markers and therapeutic leads from multiple soft tissue sarcoma gene expression datasets. Thus, machine learning algorithms are powerful new tools to improve our understanding of rare tumor entities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nvDdAFQafQ0" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25442?af=R">High frequency oscillation networks and surgical outcome in adult focal epilepsy</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether high frequency oscillations (HFOs) show spatiotemporal propagation and assess the relevance of the earliest oscillations in relation to the seizure onset zone and postsurgical outcome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively investigated the intracerebral EEG of patients who became seizure free after subsequent surgery. We marked HFOs during one hour of recordings. We calculated the time delay between pairs of channels as the median delay between their HFOs, and constructed a time line of the delay of each channel with respect to the earliest channel (first source channel). A network was defined when a temporal order could be established among the channels based on the existence of statistically significant delays.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fifteen patients with good surgical outcome were included. We found ripple networks in all patients, and fast ripple networks in 9. For ripples, first source channels were found in a higher proportion in the seizure onset zone than the rest of the network channels (15/27, 56% vs. 93/262, 35%; p=0.04). For both ripples and fast ripples, first source channels were resected more often that the rest of the network channels (Ripples: 13/27, 48% vs. 65/262, 25%; p=0.01. Fast ripples: 8/9, 89% vs. 17/40, 43%; p=0.002); channels with the highest rates of ripples and fast ripples were resected in a similar proportion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results demonstrate that interictal HFOs are organized in networks, and indicate a possible need for the resection of first source channels. However, resecting them is not superior to resecting channels with highest rates of HFOs.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During the 1990s we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, prior concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. 95% of twins are now deceased. Here we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Probandwise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed <span>&lt;</span>50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1539?rss=1">Increased Resurgent Sodium Currents in Nav1.8 Contribute to Nociceptive Sensory Neuron Hyperexcitability Associated with Peripheral Neuropathies</a></h4>

<p>Neuropathic pain is a significant public health challenge, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN) may be caused by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, a sodium channel subtype predominantly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons. However, it is not clear how Nav1.8 disease mutations induce sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Here we studied two mutations in Nav1.8 associated with hypersensitive sensory neurons: G1662S reported in painful SFN; and T790A, which underlies increased pain behaviors in the <i>Possum</i> transgenic mouse strain. We show that, in male DRG neurons, these mutations, which impair inactivation, significantly increase TTX-resistant resurgent sodium currents mediated by Nav1.8. The G1662S mutation doubled resurgent currents, and the T790A mutation increased them fourfold. These unusual currents are typically evoked during the repolarization phase of action potentials. We show that the T790A mutation greatly enhances DRG neuron excitability by reducing current threshold and increasing firing frequency. Interestingly, the mutation endows DRG neurons with multiple early afterdepolarizations and leads to substantial prolongation of action potential duration. In DRG neurons, siRNA knockdown of sodium channel β4 subunits fails to significantly alter T790A current density but reduces TTX-resistant resurgent currents by 56%. Furthermore, DRG neurons expressing T790A channels exhibited reduced excitability with fewer early afterdepolarizations and narrower action potentials after β4 knockdown. Together, our data demonstrate that open-channel block of TTX-resistant currents, enhanced by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, can make major contributions to the hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, likely leading to altered sensory phenotypes including neuropathic pain in SFN.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work demonstrates that two disease mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 that induce nociceptor hyperexcitability increase resurgent currents. Nav1.8 is crucial for pain sensations. Because resurgent currents are evoked during action potential repolarization, they can be crucial regulators of action potential activity. Our data indicate that increased Nav1.8 resurgent currents in DRG neurons greatly prolong action potential duration and enhance repetitive firing. We propose that Nav1.8 open-channel block is a major factor in Nav1.8-associated pain mechanisms and that targeting the molecular mechanism underlying these unique resurgent currents represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of aberrant pain sensations.</p>

<p>Overreactivity and defensive behaviors in response to tactile stimuli are common symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Similarly, somatosensory hypersensitivity has also been described in mice lacking ASD-associated genes such as <i>Fmr1</i> (fragile X mental retardation protein 1). <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice also show reduced functional connectivity between sensory cortical areas, which may represent an endogenous biomarker for their hypersensitivity. Here, we measured whole-brain functional connectivity in <i>Engrailed-2</i> knock-out (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup>) adult mice, which show a lower expression of <i>Fmr1</i> and anatomical defects common to <i>Fmr1</i> knock-outs. MRI-based resting-state functional connectivity in adult <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice revealed significantly reduced synchronization in somatosensory-auditory/associative cortices and dorsal thalamus, suggesting the presence of aberrant somatosensory processing in these mutants. Accordingly, when tested in the whisker nuisance test, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> but not WT mice of both sexes showed fear behavior in response to repeated whisker stimulation. <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice undergoing this test exhibited decreased c-Fos-positive neurons (a marker of neuronal activity) in layer IV of the primary somatosensory cortex and increased immunoreactive cells in the basolateral amygdala compared with WT littermates. Conversely, when tested in a sensory maze, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> and WT mice spent a comparable time in whisker-guided exploration, indicating that whisker-mediated behaviors are otherwise preserved in <i>En2</i> mutants. Therefore, fearful responses to somatosensory stimuli in <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice are accompanied by reduced basal connectivity of sensory regions, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala, suggesting that impaired somatosensory processing is a common feature in mice lacking ASD-related genes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Overreactivity to tactile stimuli is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Recent studies performed in mice bearing ASD-related mutations confirmed these findings. Here, we evaluated the behavioral response to whisker stimulation in mice lacking the ASD-related gene <i>Engrailed-2</i> (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice). Compared with WT controls, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice showed reduced functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex, which was paralleled by fear behavior, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala in response to repeated whisker stimulation. These results suggest that impaired somatosensory signal processing is a common feature in mice harboring ASD-related mutations.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1505?rss=1">Degeneration of ipRGCs in Mouse Models of Huntington's Disease Disrupts Non-Image-Forming Behaviors Before Motor Impairment</a></h4>

<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express the photopigment melanopsin, are photosensitive neurons in the retina and are essential for non-image-forming functions, circadian photoentrainment, and pupillary light reflexes. Five subtypes of ipRGCs (M1–M5) have been identified in mice. Although ipRGCs are spared in several forms of inherited blindness, they are affected in Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are associated with impaired circadian rhythms. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the <i>huntingtin</i> gene. In addition to motor function impairment, HD mice also show impaired circadian rhythms and loss of ipRGC. Here, we found that, in HD mouse models (R6/2 and N171-82Q male mice), the expression of melanopsin was reduced before the onset of motor deficits. The expression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, was associated with the survival of ipRGCs. The number of M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 male mice was reduced due to apoptosis, whereas non-M1 ipRGCs were relatively resilient to HD progression. Most importantly, the reduced innervations of M1 ipRGCs, which was assessed by X-gal staining in R6/2-OPN4<sup>Lacz/+</sup> male mice, contributed to the diminished light-induced c-fos and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which may explain the impaired circadian photoentrainment in HD mice. Collectively, our results show that M1 ipRGCs were susceptible to the toxicity caused by mutant Huntingtin. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and disrupted circadian regulation during HD progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian disruption is a common nonmotor symptom of Huntington's disease (HD). In addition to the molecular defects in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the cause of circadian disruption in HD remains to be further explored. We hypothesized that ipRGCs, by integrating light input to the SCN, participate in the circadian regulation in HD mice. We report early reductions in melanopsin in two mouse models of HD, R6/2, and N171-82Q. Suppression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, by mutant Huntingtin might mediate the reduced number of ipRGCs. Importantly, M1 ipRGCs showed higher susceptibility than non-M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 mice. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and the circadian abnormality during HD progression.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1484?rss=1">Activation of 5-HT1A Receptors Promotes Retinal Ganglion Cell Function by Inhibiting the cAMP-PKA Pathway to Modulate Presynaptic GABA Release in Chronic Glaucoma</a></h4>

<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor agonists are neuroprotective in CNS injury models. However, the neuroprotective functional implications and synaptic mechanism of 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) agonist, in an adult male Wistar rat model of chronic glaucoma model remain unknown. We found that ocular hypertension decreased 5-HT1A receptor expression in rat retinas because the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was significantly reduced in rats with induced ocular hypertension relative to that in control retinas and 8-OH-DPAT enhanced the RGC viability. The protective effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by intravitreal administration of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 or the selective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531. Using patch-clamp techniques, spontaneous and miniature GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) of RGCs in rat retinal slices were recorded. 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic sIPSCs and mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs. Among the signaling cascades mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor, the role of cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling was investigated. The 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes at the synaptic level were enhanced by PKA inhibition by H-89 and blocked by PKA activation with bucladesine. Furthermore, the density of phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA)/PKA was significantly increased in glaucomatous retinas and 8-OH-DPAT significantly decreased p-PKA/PKA expression, which led to the inhibition of PKA phosphorylation upon relieving neurotransmitter GABA release. These results showed that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in retinas facilitated presynaptic GABA release functions by suppressing cAMP-PKA signaling and decreasing PKA phosphorylation, which could lead to the de-excitation of RGC circuits and suppress excitotoxic processes in glaucoma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found that serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the retina (5-HT1A receptors) were downregulated after intraocular pressure elevation. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrated differences in the frequencies of miniature GABAergic IPSCs (mIPSCs) in ON- and OFF-type retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGCs in normal and glaucomatous retinal slices. Therefore, phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition upon release of the neurotransmitter GABA was eliminated by 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), which led to increased levels of GABAergic mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs, thus enhancing RGC viability and function. These protective effects were blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635. This study identified a novel mechanism by which activation of 5-HT1A receptors protects damaged RGCs via the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway that modulates GABAergic presynaptic activity.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inward. We assessed how early in the multiple sclerosis course a "surface‐in" process of injury suggesting progressive biology may begin.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We focused on the thalamus, which notably has both a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface and a white matter interface. Thalamic volume trajectories were assessed in a prospectively followed cohort of children from initial presentation with either multiple sclerosis or monophasic acquired demyelination, and healthy controls. Voxelwise volume changes were calculated using deformation‐based morphometry, and analyzed in relation to distance from the CSF interface by mixed effects modeling and semiparametric smoothing methods.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty‐seven children with multiple sclerosis and 73 children with monophasic demyelination were prospectively followed with yearly brain scans (mean follow‐up = 4.6 years, standard deviation = 1.9). A total of 282 healthy children with serial scans were included as controls. Relative to healthy controls, children with multiple sclerosis and children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated volume loss in thalamic regions adjacent to the white matter. However, only children with multiple sclerosis exhibited an additional surface‐in gradient of thalamic injury on the ventricular side, which was already notable in the first year of clinical disease (asymptote estimate = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44–4.58, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and worsened over time (asymptote:time estimate = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12–0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.0021).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that a multiple sclerosis disease‐specific surface‐in process of damage can manifest at the earliest stages of the disease. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–12</p>

Synapse dysfunction is thought to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. In this issue of Neuron, Tsai et al. (2019) uncover how membrane phospholipid biosynthesis regulates Drosophila photoreceptor (PR) degeneration and the synaptic vesicle pool through a transcriptional-translational feedback loop from the synaptic terminal to the nucleus.

In this issue of Neuron, Li et al. (2019) distinguish two separable GABAergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with differential μ-opioid receptor regulation, each targeting different postsynaptic neurons and promoting opposing behavioral states.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is not only processed to the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide but also to various types of secreted APP variants. In a recent issue of Science, Rice et al. (2019) now demonstrate that secreted APP functions as a modulator of synaptic transmission by binding to GABABR1a.

Accurate sensing of changes in environmental temperature is a fundamental process. Budelli et al. (2019) describe a specific type of phasic thermosensory neurons in the Drosophila arista, dubbed “cooling cells,” that rely on ionotropic receptors (IRs) for their function and mediate cold and warm avoidance.

<p>by Daniel Rüdiger, Sascha Young Kupke, Tanja Laske, Pawel Zmora, Udo Reichl</p>

Influenza A viruses (IAV) are commonly used to infect animal cell cultures for research purposes and vaccine production. Their replication is influenced strongly by the multiplicity of infection (MOI), which ranges over several orders of magnitude depending on the respective application. So far, mathematical models of IAV replication have paid little attention to the impact of the MOI on infection dynamics and virus yields. To address this issue, we extended an existing model of IAV replication in adherent MDCK cells with kinetics that explicitly consider the time point of cell infection. This modification does not only enable the fitting of high MOI measurements, but also the successful prediction of viral release dynamics of low MOI experiments using the same set of parameters. Furthermore, this model allows the investigation of defective interfering particle (DIP) propagation in different MOI regimes. The key difference between high and low MOI conditions is the percentage of infectious virions among the total virus particle release. Simulation studies show that DIP interference at a high MOI is determined exclusively by the DIP content of the seed virus while, in low MOI conditions, it is predominantly controlled by the <i>de novo</i> generation of DIPs. Overall, the extended model provides an ideal framework for the prediction and optimization of cell culture-derived IAV manufacturing and the production of DIPs for therapeutic use.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NatcusQY3NQ" width="1" />

<p>by Hongyu Zhou, Zheng Dong, Gennady Verkhivker, Brian D. Zoltowski, Peng Tao</p>

The fungal circadian clock photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) contains a photosensitive allosteric light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domain that undergoes a large N-terminal conformational change. The mechanism by which a blue-light driven covalent bond formation leads to a global conformational change remains unclear, which hinders the further development of VVD as an optogenetic tool. We answered this question through a novel computational platform integrating Markov state models, machine learning methods, and newly developed community analysis algorithms. Applying this new integrative approach, we provided a quantitative evaluation of the contribution from the covalent bond to the protein global conformational change, and proposed an atomistic allosteric mechanism leading to the discovery of the unexpected importance of A’α/Aβ and previously overlooked Eα/Fα loops in the conformational change. This approach could be applicable to other allosteric proteins in general to provide interpretable atomistic representations of their otherwise elusive allosteric mechanisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJ65cTk-XxE" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/fl8k8W5KC3g/article">A saturated reaction in repressor synthesis creates a daytime dead zone in circadian clocks</a></h4>

<p>by Koichiro Uriu, Hajime Tei</p>

Negative feedback loops (NFLs) for circadian clocks include light-responsive reactions that allow the clocks to shift their phase depending on the timing of light signals. Phase response curves (PRCs) for light signals in various organisms include a time interval called a dead zone where light signals cause no phase shift during daytime. Although the importance of the dead zone for robust light entrainment is known, how the dead zone arises from the biochemical reactions in an NFL underlying circadian gene expression rhythms remains unclear. In addition, the observation that the light-responsive reactions in the NFL vary between organisms raises the question as to whether the mechanism for dead zone formation is common or distinct between different organisms. Here we reveal by mathematical modeling that the saturation of a biochemical reaction in repressor synthesis in an NFL is a common mechanism of daytime dead zone generation. If light signals increase the degradation of a repressor protein, as in <i>Drosophila</i>, the saturation of repressor mRNA transcription nullifies the effect of light signals, generating a dead zone. In contrast, if light signals induce the transcription of repressor mRNA, as in mammals, the saturation of repressor translation can generate a dead zone by cancelling the influence of excess amount of mRNA induced by light signals. Each of these saturated reactions is located next to the light-responsive reaction in the NFL, suggesting a design principle for daytime dead zone generation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fl8k8W5KC3g" width="1" />

<p>by Muhammad Ali Al-Radhawi, Domitilla Del Vecchio, Eduardo D. Sontag</p>

Phenotypical variability in the absence of genetic variation often reflects complex energetic landscapes associated with underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this view, different phenotypes are associated with alternative states of complex nonlinear systems: stable attractors in deterministic models or modes of stationary distributions in stochastic descriptions. We provide theoretical and practical characterizations of these landscapes, specifically focusing on stochastic Slow Promoter Kinetics (SPK), a time scale relevant when transcription factor binding and unbinding are affected by epigenetic processes like DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. In this case, largely unexplored except for numerical simulations, adiabatic approximations of promoter kinetics are not appropriate. In contrast to the existing literature, we provide rigorous analytic characterizations of multiple modes. A general formal approach gives insight into the influence of parameters and the prediction of how changes in GRN wiring, for example through mutations or artificial interventions, impact the possible number, location, and likelihood of alternative states. We adapt tools from the mathematical field of singular perturbation theory to represent stationary distributions of Chemical Master Equations for GRNs as mixtures of Poisson distributions and obtain explicit formulas for the locations and probabilities of metastable states as a function of the parameters describing the system. As illustrations, the theory is used to tease out the role of cooperative binding in stochastic models in comparison to deterministic models, and applications are given to various model systems, such as toggle switches in isolation or in communicating populations, a synthetic oscillator, and a trans-differentiation network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iXjE6wxdvww" width="1" />

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and computational technologies have enabled routine analysis of large-scale single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, scRNA-seq technologies have suffered from several technical challenges, including low mean expression levels in most genes and higher frequencies of missing data than bulk population sequencing technologies. Identifying functional gene sets and their regulatory networks that link specific cell types to human diseases and therapeutics from scRNA-seq profiles are daunting tasks. In this study, we developed a Component Overlapping Attribute Clustering (COAC) algorithm to perform the localized (subpopulation) gene co-expression network analysis from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles. Gene subnetworks that represent specific gene co-expression patterns are inferred from the components of a decomposed matrix of scRNA-seq profiles. We showed that single-cell gene subnetworks identified by COAC from multiple time points within cell phases can be used for cell type identification with high accuracy (83%). In addition, COAC-inferred subnetworks from melanoma patients’ scRNA-seq profiles are highly correlated with survival rate from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Moreover, the localized gene subnetworks identified by COAC from individual patients’ scRNA-seq data can be used as pharmacogenomics biomarkers to predict drug responses (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranges from 0.728 to 0.783) in cancer cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. In summary, COAC offers a powerful tool to identify potential network-based diagnostic and pharmacogenomics biomarkers from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiologic studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with tHcy (n=18), folate (n=3), vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (n=1), and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (n=14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n=16 952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404 630 non‐cases).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13‐1.58, <i>P</i>=6.7×10<sup>‐4</sup>) per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by single‐nucleotide polymorphisms at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> levels were 0.49 (95% 0.34‐0.71, <i>p</i>=1.3×10<sup>‐4</sup>) and 0.70 (95% 0.52‐0.94, <i>p</i>=0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0366-18.2019v1?rss=1">An adenosine A2A receptor antagonist improves multiple symptoms of repeated quinpirole induced psychosis</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the repeated rise of concerns (obsessions) and repetitive unwanted behavior (compulsions). Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-choice drug, response rates to SSRI treatment vary between symptom dimensions. In this study, to find a therapeutic target for SSRI-resilient OCD symptoms, we evaluated treatment responses of quinpirole sensitization-induced OCD-related behaviors in mice. SSRI administration rescued the cognitive inflexibility, as well as hyperactivity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), while no improvement was observed for the repetitive behavior. D<sub>2</sub> receptor signaling in the central striatum (CS) was involved in SSRI-resistant repetitive behavior. An adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist, istradefylline, which rescued abnormal excitatory synaptic function in the CS indirect pathway medium spiny neurons of sensitized mice, alleviated both of the QNP-induced abnormal behaviors with only short-term administration. These results provide a new insight into therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant OCD symptoms and indicate the potential of A<sub>2A</sub> antagonists as a rapid-acting anti-OCD drug.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Clinical studies show distinct therapeutic efficacies for SSRIs between subtypes of OCD symptoms. While abnormal activity in the cortico-striatal pathway is critically involved in the pathophysiology of OCD, the neurological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant symptoms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that repeated injection of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist, quinpirole elicited two distinct OCD-related behaviors; cognitive inflexibility (SSRI-responsive) and repetitive behavior (SSRI-resistant). While SSRI treatment normalized hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex, we also demonstrated the imbalanced excitatory inputs in the central striatum of quinpirole-treated mice and the therapeutic potential of an A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist as a modulator of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs).</p>

Over a billion people worldwide are affected by vitamin D deficiency. Although vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired cognition, the mechanisms mediating this link are poorly understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has now emerged as an important participant of synaptic plasticity and a new hypothesis is that vitamin D may interact with aggregates of the ECM, perineuronal nets (PNNs), to regulate brain plasticity. Dysregulation of PNNs caused by vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the presentation of cognitive deficits.

From an evolutionary perspective, the genes of enteric microbes transmitted reliably across generations are nearly as much a part of the human organism as our own genes. Disruption of the microbiome leading to extinction of key ‘heirloom’ taxa can deprive individuals of metabolic pathways that have been present in their ancestors for millennia. Some of these pathways support essential synthesis and toxin clearance processes, including the generation of blood–brain barrier-crossing metabolic products crucial for normal brain function.

Gene mutations associated with painless phenotypes offer great insight for analgesic development. Using a multi-modal approach, McDermott et al. show that mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 cause congenital insensitivity to pain due to a lack of functional nociceptors.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25428?af=R">The blood pressure paradox in acute ischemic stroke</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the association of poststroke baseline blood pressure with cerebral collateral flow and functional outcome in acute ischemic patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients identified with large vessel occlusion/stenosis with baseline multimodal computed tomography, follow‐up imaging, and complete clinical profiles were included. A 90‐day modified Rankin Scale of 0–1 was defined as an excellent functional outcome. Cerebral collateral flow was quantified by the volume ratio of tissue within the delay time &gt;3 seconds perfusion lesion with severely delayed contrast transit (delay time &gt;3 seconds/delay time &gt;6 seconds).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 306 patients included in this study. With every increase of 10 mmHg in baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome decreased by 12% in multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.048). Conversely, increased baseline blood pressure was associated with better collateral flow. In subgroup analysis of patients with major reperfusion, higher blood pressure was associated with decreased infarct growth and a better clinical outcome, and vice versa in patients without reperfusion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis was associated with better collateral flow. However, for patients without reperfusion, higher baseline blood pressure was associated with increased infarct growth, leading to an unfavorable clinical outcome. The relationship between blood pressure and outcomes is highly dependent on reperfusion, and active blood pressure–lowering treatment may be inappropriate in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to reperfusion treatment.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R">Functional deficiency in endogenous interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist in patients with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We recently reported successful treatment of a child with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), a subtype of new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), with the recombinant interleukin‐1 (IL1) receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous IL1RA production or function is deficient in FIRES patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Levels of IL1β and IL1RA were measured in serum and CSF. The inhibitory activity of endogenous IL1RA was assessed using a cell‐based reporter assay. <i>IL1RN</i> gene variants were identified by sequencing. Expression levels for the secreted and intracellular isoforms of IL1RA were measured in patient and control cells by real‐time polymerase chain reaction.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of endogenous IL1RA and IL1β were elevated in the serum and CSF of patients with FIRES (n=7) relative to healthy controls (n=10). Serum from FIRES patients drove IL1R signaling activity and potentiated IL1R signaling in response to exogenous IL1β in a cell‐based reporter assay. Functional assessment of endogenous IL1RA activity in three FIRES patients revealed attenuated inhibition of IL1R signaling. Sequencing of <i>IL1RN</i> in our index patient revealed multiple variants. This was accompanied by reduced expression of intracellular but not secreted isoforms of IL1RA in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that FIRES is associated with reduced expression of intracellular IL1RA isoforms and a functional deficiency in IL1RA inhibitory activity. These observations may provide insight into disease pathogenesis for FIRES and other inflammatory seizure disorders and may provide a valuable biomarker for therapeutic decision‐making.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25438?af=R">SCN1A gain‐of‐function in early infantile encephalopathy</a></h4>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense <i>SCN1A</i> variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well‐defined genotype‐phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early‐infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than the typical <i>SCN1A</i> Dravet syndrome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive active potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neuron. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and also showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>From a biophysical perspective the T226M mutation produces gain‐of‐function. Somewhat paradoxically our data suggest that this gain‐of‐function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This “functional dominant negative” interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.</p>

Recent analyses of MDGA–neuroligin complexes revealed the structural basis of this activity and indicate that MDGAs interact with all neuroligins with differential affinities. Surprisingly, analyses of mouse mutants revealed a functional divergence, with targeted mutation of <em>Mdga1</em> and <em>Mdga2</em> elevating inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Further research is needed to determine the synapse-specific organizing properties of MDGAs in neural circuits, which may depend on relative levels and subcellular distributions of each MDGA, neuroligin and neurexin.

Abstract
<p>Large-scale slow oscillations allow the integration of neuronal activity across brain regions during sensory or cognitive processing. However, evidence that this form of coding also holds for pathological networks, such as for distributed networks in epileptic disorders, does not yet exist. Here, we show in a mouse model of unilateral hippocampal epilepsy that epileptic fast ripples generated in the neocortex distant from the primary focus occur during transient trains of interictal epileptic discharges. During these epileptic paroxysms, local phase-locking of neuronal firing and a phase–amplitude coupling of the epileptic discharges over a slow oscillation at 3–5 Hz are detected. Furthermore, the buildup of the slow oscillation begins in the bihippocampal network that includes the focus, which synchronizes and drives the activity across the large-scale epileptic network into the frontal cortex. This study provides the first functional description of the emergence of neocortical fast ripples in hippocampal epilepsy and shows that cross-frequency coupling might be a fundamental mechanism underlying the spreading of epileptic activity.</p>

Abstract
<p>Learning to read specializes a portion of the left mid-fusiform cortex for printed word recognition, the putative visual word form area (VWFA). This study examined whether a VWFA specialized for English is sufficiently malleable to support learning a perceptually atypical second writing system. The study utilized an artificial orthography, HouseFont, in which house images represent English phonemes. House images elicit category-biased activation in a spatially distinct brain region, the so-called parahippocampal place area (PPA). Using house images as letters made it possible to test whether the capacity for learning a second writing system involves neural territory that supports reading in the first writing system, or neural territory tuned for the visual features of the new orthography. Twelve human adults completed two weeks of training to establish basic HouseFont reading proficiency and underwent functional neuroimaging pre and post-training. Analysis of three functionally defined regions of interest (ROIs), the VWFA, and left and right PPA, found significant pre-training versus post-training increases in response to HouseFont words only in the VWFA. Analysis of the relationship between the behavioral and neural data found that activation changes from pre-training to post-training within the VWFA predicted HouseFont reading speed. These results demonstrate that learning a new orthography utilizes neural territory previously specialized by the acquisition of a native writing system. Further, they suggest VWFA engagement is driven by orthographic functionality and not the visual characteristics of graphemes, which informs the broader debate about the nature of category-specialized areas in visual association cortex.</p>

Abstract
<p>The membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, that synthesizes cyclic GMP for use as a second messenger for visual transduction in retinal rods and cones, is stimulated by bicarbonate. Bicarbonate acts directly on ROS-GC1, because it enhanced the enzymatic activity of a purified, recombinant fragment of bovine ROS-GC1 consisting solely of the core catalytic domain. Moreover, recombinant ROS-GC1 proved to be a true sensor of bicarbonate, rather than a sensor for CO<sub>2</sub>. Access to bicarbonate differed in rods and cones of larval salamander, <i>Ambystoma tigrinum</i>, of unknown sex. In rods, bicarbonate entered at the synapse and diffused to the outer segment, where it was removed by Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent exchange. In contrast, cones generated bicarbonate internally from endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> or from exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> that was present in extracellular solutions of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate production from both sources of CO<sub>2</sub> was blocked by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase II expression was verified immunohistochemically in cones but not in rods. In addition, cones acquired bicarbonate at their outer segments as well as at their inner segments. The multiple pathways for access in cones may support greater uptake of bicarbonate than in rods and buffer changes in its intracellular concentration.</p>

<p>Ferroptotic death is a mechanism for tumor suppression by pharmacological inhibitors that target the X<sub>c</sub>  <sup>–</sup> transporter (cystine/glutamate antiporter) in a host of non-CNS and CNS tumors. Inhibition of this transporter leads to reduction of cystine uptake, cyst(e)ine deprivation, subsequent depletion of the versatile antioxidant glutathione, and reactive lipid species-dependent death. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of the X<sub>c</sub>  <sup>–</sup> transporter can also induce neuronal cell death raising concerns about toxicity in the CNS and PNS if these agents are used for chemotherapy. Here, we show that ferroptotic death induced by the canonical ferroptosis inducer erastin is similar in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and primary cortical neurons although cell death is mediated more potently in cancer cells. Reducing the toxicity of ferroptosis inducers will require, among other things, the identification of agents that protect neurons from ferroptosis but exacerbate it in tumor cells. Although we show that a number of agents known to block ferroptosis in primary mouse neurons also inhibit ferroptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively protect neurons while augmenting ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results further suggest that cell death pathways induced by erastin in these two cell types are statistically identical to each other and identical to oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons, where death is also mediated via inhibition of X<sub>c</sub><sup>–</sup> cystine transport. Together, these studies identify HDACs inhibitors as a novel class of agents to augment tumor suppression by ferroptosis induction and to minimize neuronal toxicity that could manifest as peripheral neuropathy or chemo brain.</p>

<p>Low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) that express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 are thought to signal affective touch, and may also play a role in mechanical allodynia. However, the nature of the central termination of C-LTMRs in the dorsal horn remains largely unexplored. Here, we used light and electron microscopy in combination with VGLUT3 immunolabeling as a marker of C-LTMR terminations to investigate this issue. VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMRs formed central terminals of Type II glomeruli in the inner part of lamina II of the dorsal horn, often establishing multiple asymmetric synapses with postsynaptic dendrites but also participating in synaptic configurations with presynaptic axons and dendrites. Unexpectedly, essentially all VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals showed substantial VGLUT1 expression in the rat, whereas such terminals in mice lacked VGLUT1. Most VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals exhibited weak-to-moderate VGLUT2 expression. Further, C-LTMR terminals formed numerous synapses with excitatory protein kinase C (PKC) interneurons and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons, whereas synapses with calretinin neurons were scarce. C-LTMR terminals rarely if ever established synapses with neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R)-possessing dendrites traversing lamina II. Thus, VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals appear to largely correspond to neurofilament-lacking central terminals of Type II glomeruli in inner lamina II and can thus be identified at the ultrastructural level by morphological criteria. The participation of C-LTMR terminals in Type II glomeruli involving diverse populations of interneuron indicates highly complex modes of integration of C-LTMR mediated signaling in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, differences in VGLUT1 expression indicate distinct species differences in synaptic physiology of C-LTMR terminals.</p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Changliang Liu, Pascal S Kaeser</p><div><p>Dopamine controls motor functions, motivation, and reward-related learning through G-protein coupled receptor signaling. The current working model is that upon release, dopamine diffuses to influence many target cells via wide-spread receptors. Recent studies, however, suggest that dopamine release is fast and generates small signaling hotspots. In this review, we summarize progress on the understanding of the dopamine release apparatus and evaluate how its properties may shape dopamine signaling during firing. We discuss how mechanisms of regulation may act through this machinery and propose that striatal architecture for dopamine signaling may have evolved to support rapid dopamine coding.</p></div>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>LRRK2</i> mutations, the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) display incomplete penetrance, indicating the importance of other genetic and environmental influences on disease pathogenesis in <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers. The present study investigates whether urate, an antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, and inverse risk factor for idiopathic PD, is one such candidate biomarker of PD risk modulation in pathogenic <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Banked plasma samples or urate levels were obtained for three cohorts of age‐ and sex‐matched subjects with and without a known <i>LRRK2</i> mutation in PD and unaffected controls to conduct a pilot study of 192 subjects from the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium (LCC) and two validation studies of 380 additional subjects from the LCC and of 922 subjects from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative. Urate levels were compared by multiple regression between subjects with and without a PD diagnosis conditional on <i>LRRK2</i> status, controlling for age and sex.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Non‐manifesting <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers had significantly higher levels of urate than those who developed PD in each of the three independent cohorts. A meta‐analysis demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 0.62 mg/dL (p&lt;0.001), with similar results for separate assessments of women (p&lt;0.02) and men (p&lt;0.001). A 2 mg/dL increment in urate concentration decreased the odds of having PD by more than 50% (OR = 0.48; p = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings identify and substantiate urate as a biomarker of resistance to PD among <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study analyzed serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) in 2 European cohorts of 312 MS patients to investigate whether NfL are biomarkers of PML during natalizumab treatment. The cohort comprised 25 PML, 136 natalizumab‐treated, and 151 untreated MS patients. Patients subsequently developing PML had similar NfL to other natalizumab‐treated MS patients. At PML onset, NfL were 10‐fold higher than in the pre‐PML condition and in natalizumab‐treated or untreated MS patients, and NfL continued to increase until onset of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The results suggest that in natalizumab‐treated patients NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML.</p>

Myelin is a multilayer lipid membrane structure that wraps and insulates axons, allowing for the efficient propagation of action potentials. During developmental myelination of the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate and migrate to their final destination, where they terminally differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and myelinate axons. Lineage progression and terminal differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells are under tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional control.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Gladys Lima Caldeira, João Peça, Ana Luísa Carvalho</p><div><p>Growing evidence implicates synaptic proteins in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia. In fact, mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins are enriched and overlap among different conditions highlighting the complex and pleiotropic nature of these disorders. In this review, we discuss recently described candidate genes that affect excitatory synapse function and result in changes in spine number and morphology. Spine pathology has been observed in several animal models of disease and in human brain post-mortem samples from ID, ASD, and schizophrenia patients. Recent data point to convergent mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and dysfunction of microglia synaptic remodeling, underlying dendritic spine dysgenesis. Interestingly, the reversion of important pathologic features, including spine abnormalities, has been observed in adult animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that therapies may not be restricted to a specific developmental window. Shedding light on the specific mechanisms impacted in neuropsychiatric disorders will undeniably contribute to the development of more directed and personalized therapies.</p></div>

In neurons and circuits, these molecules serve especially critical functions that ensure neural activity is maintained within appropriate physiological parameters. Their targets include synaptic proteins, ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and components of essential signaling cascades. Here, we discuss how several species of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, both during development and in mature circuits. Furthermore, we present the relationships between aberrant ncRNA expression and psychiatric disorders. The research presented here demonstrates how ncRNAs can be useful tools for elucidating fundamental neurobiology mechanisms and identifying the key molecular players.</p></div>
