              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell analysis of microglial transcriptomic diversity in subarachnoid hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe stroke and the advanced treatment for SAH is still limited. Recent studies have shown that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SAH. Microglia can transform their states in response to central nervous system injury. However, the transcriptomic features of microglia remained unknown in SAH. Recent developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a possible way to solve this problem.

MethodsEndovascular perforation (EVP) murine SAH model was established to reproduce experimental SAH. Microglia states are examined with immune staining and quantitate analysis. Post-SAH microglial single-cell suspension were harvest and sequenced using 10X scRNA-seq platform. Then, the detailed single-cell transcriptomic characterization of post-SAH microglia were analyzed with bioinformatics.

ResultsTranscriptional analysis revealed at least ten diverse microglial subgroups, including SAH-associated microglia (SAM), inflammatory-associated microglia (IAM) and proliferation-associated microglia (PAM), which all exhibit distinct marker gene expression patterns. Microglia subsets interaction reveals the functional relationship between elevated signaling pathways and microglial sub-populations in SAH. Receptor-ligand pair analysis revealed that complex inter-cellular interactions exist between the microglia subsets and other cell types, and indicated that microglia are important mediators of neuroinflammation after SAH. Integrated analysis with normal microglia further proved the existence of these microglia subpopulations and different gene markers associated with SAH were clarified.

ConclusionsCollectively, we first report the single-cell transcriptome of post-SAH microglia and found specific biomarkers related to the neuroinflammation in SAH. These results enhanced our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of microglial response to SAH, and may guide future development of SAH monitoring methods and therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncovering a neural circuit controlling adult quiescent neural stem cell activation in the subventricular zone</a></h4>

              
                The maintenance and differentiation of the adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) are controlled by cell-intrinsic molecular pathways that interact with extrinsic signaling cues. How neurogenesis in the SVZ is regulated by neural circuit activity remains poorly understood. Here we identified a novel neural circuit that regulates the state of lateral ventricular wall (LV) NSCs. Our results demonstrate that direct glutamatergic inputs from the frontal cortex, as well as local inhibitory interneurons, control the activity of subependymal cholinergic neurons. In vivo optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of defined neuronal populations within this circuit were sufficient to control LV NSC proliferation and SVZ neurogenesis. Moreover, acetylcholine (Ach), which activates M1 muscarinic ACh receptors, triggers the activation of quiescent NSCs. These findings shed light on neural activity-dependent regulation of postnatal and adult LV NSCs activation and SVZ neurogenesis.

                The primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) has greatly expanded to evolve specialized architecture, but its roles in top-down brain control remain enigmatic. Based on connectomics mapping of the marmoset PFC, we characterized two contrasting features of corticocortical and corticostriatal projections. One is the  focalness of projections, exemplified by multiple columnar axonal terminations in the cortical layers and the other is the  widespreadness of weaker projections, whose patterns consisted of several common motifs representing the framework of PFC connectivity. We clarified the topographic rules of distribution for these features, which should constrain how PFC neurons can coordinate to control the target regions as populations. These features are observed only primitively in rodents and are considered critical in understanding the roles of the PFC in neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Progress toward the development of brain-computer interfaces has signaled the potential to restore, replace, or augment lost or impaired neurological function in a variety of disease states. Existing brain-computer interfaces rely on invasive surgical procedures or brain-penetrating electrodes, which limit addressable applications of the technology and the number of eligible patients. Here we describe a novel approach to constructing a neural interface, comprising conformable thin-film electrode arrays and a minimally invasive surgical delivery system that together facilitate communication with large portions of the cortical surface in bidirectional fashion (enabling both recording and stimulation). We demonstrate the safety and feasibility of rapidly delivering reversible implants containing over 2,000 microelectrodes to multiple functional regions in both hemispheres of the Gottingen minipig brain simultaneously, without requiring a craniotomy, at an effective insertion rate faster than 40 ms per channel, without damaging the cortical surface. We further demonstrate the performance of this system for high-density neural recording, focal cortical stimulation, and accurate neural decoding. Such a system promises to accelerate efforts to better decode and encode neural signals, and to expand the patient population that could benefit from neural interface technology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient simulation of 3D reaction-diffusion in models of neurons and networks</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity is the result of both the electrophysiology and chemophysiology. A neuron can be well represented for the purposes of electrophysiological simulation as a tree composed of connected cylinders. This representation is also apt for 1D simulations of their chemophysiology, provided the spatial scale is larger than the diameter of the cylinders and there is radial symmetry. Higher dimensional simulation is necessary to accurately capture the dynamics when these criteria are not met, such as with wave curvature, spines, or diffusion near the soma. We have developed a solution to enable efficient finite volume method simulation of reaction-diffusion kinetics in intracellular 3D regions in neuron and network models and provide an implementation within the NEURON simulator. An accelerated version of the CTNG 3D reconstruction algorithm transforms morphologies suitable for ion-channel based simulations into consistent 3D voxelized regions. Kinetics are then solved using a parallel algorithm based on Douglas-Gunn that handles the irregular 3D geometry of a neuron; these kinetics are coupled to NEURON's 1D mechanisms for ion channels, synapses, etc. The 3D domain may cover the entire cell or selected regions of interest. Simulations with dendritic spines and of the soma reveal details of dynamics that would be missed in a pure 1D simulation. We describe and validate the methods and discuss their performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Region-specific alterations of perineuronal net expression in postmortem autism brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variance in ASD is often associated with mechanisms that broadly fall into the category of neuroplasticity. Parvalbumin positive neurons and their surrounding perineuronal nets (PNNs) are important factors in critical period plasticity and have both been implicated in ASD. PNNs are found in high density within output structures of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, two regions that are densely connected to many other brain areas and have the potential to participate in the diverse array of symptoms present in an ASD diagnosis. The dentate nucleus and globus pallidus were therefore assessed for differences in PNN expression in human postmortem ASD brain tissue. While Purkinje cell loss is a consistent neuropathological finding in ASD, in this cohort, the Purkinje cell targets within the dentate nucleus did not show differences in number of cells with or without a PNN. However, the density of parvalbumin positive neurons with a PNN were significantly reduced in the globus pallidus internus and externus of ASD cases, which was not dependent on seizure status. It is unclear whether these alterations manifest during development or are a consequence of activity-dependent mechanisms that lead to altered network dynamics later in life.

                Bayesian Brain theory suggests brain utilises predictive processing framework to interpret the noisy world. Predictive processing is essential to perception, action, cognition and psychiatric disease, but underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain undelineated. Here we show the neuronal cell-type and circuit basis for visual predictive processing in awake, head-fixed mice during self-initiated running. Preceding running, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing inhibitory interneurons (INs) in primary visual cortex (V1) are robustly activated in absence of structured visual stimuli. This pre-running activation is mediated via distal top-down projections from frontal, parietal and retrosplenial areas known for motion planning, but not local excitatory inputs associated with the bottom-up pathway. Somatostatin (SST) INs show pre-running suppression and post-running activation, indicating a VIP-SST motif. Differential VIP-SST peri-running dynamics anisotropically suppress neighbouring pyramidal (Pyr) neurons, preadapting Pyr neurons to the incoming running. Our data delineate key neuron types and circuit elements of predictive processing brain employs in action and perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in vivo pig model for testing novel PET radioligands targeting cerebral protein aggregates</a></h4>

              
                Positron emission tomography (PET) has become an essential clinical tool for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal accumulation of proteins like amyloid-{beta} or tau. Despite many attempts, it has not been possible to develop an appropriate radioligand for imaging aggregated -synuclein, which is seen in, e.g., Parkinson's Disease. Access to a large animal model with -synuclein pathology would critically enable a more translationally appropriate evaluation of novel radioligands. We here established a pig model with cerebral injections of -synuclein preformed fibrils or brain homogenate from postmortem human brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia with Lewy body (DLB) into the pig's brain using minimally invasive surgery and validated against saline injections. In the absence of a suitable -synuclein radioligand, we validated the model with an unselective amyloid-{beta} tracer [11C]PIB, which has a high affinity for {beta}-sheet structures in aggregates. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI confirmed that the blood-brain barrier function was intact. A few hours post-injection, pigs were PET scanned with [11C]PIB. Quantification was done with Logan invasive graphical analysis and simplified reference tissue model 2 using the occipital cortex as a reference region. After the scan, we retrieved the brains to confirm successful injection using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. We found four times higher [11C]PIB uptake in AD-homogenate-injected regions and two times higher uptake in -synuclein-preformed-fibrils-injected regions compared to the saline-injected regions. The [11C]PIB uptake was the same in the occipital cortex, cerebellum, DLB-homogenate, and saline-injected regions. With its large brains and ability to undergo repeated PET scans as well as neurosurgical procedures, the pig provides a robust, cost-effective, and good translational model for assessment of novel radioligands including, but not limited to, proteinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-individual deep image reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                The sensory cortex is characterized by general organizational principles such as topography and hierarchy. However, measured brain activity given identical input exhibits substantially different patterns across individuals. While anatomical and functional alignment methods have been proposed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, it remains unclear whether and how hierarchical and fine-grained representations can be converted between individuals while preserving the encoded perceptual contents. In this study, we evaluated machine learning models called neural code converters that predict one's brain activity pattern (target) from another's (source) given the same stimulus by the decoding of hierarchical visual features and the reconstruction of perceived images. The training data for converters consisted of fMRI data obtained with identical sets of natural images presented to pairs of individuals. Converters were trained using the whole visual cortical voxels from V1 through the ventral object areas, without explicit labels of visual areas. We decoded the converted brain activity patterns into hierarchical visual features of a deep neural network (DNN) using decoders pre-trained on the target brain and then reconstructed images via the decoded features. Without explicit information about visual cortical hierarchy, the converters automatically learned the correspondence between the visual areas of the same levels. DNN feature decoding at each layer showed higher decoding accuracies from corresponding levels of visual areas, indicating that hierarchical representations were preserved after conversion. The viewed images were faithfully reconstructed with recognizable silhouettes of objects even with relatively small amounts of data for converter training. The conversion also allows pooling data across multiple individuals, leading to stably high reconstruction accuracy compared to those converted between individuals. These results demonstrate that the conversion learns hierarchical correspondence and preserves the fine-grained representations of visual features, enabling visual image reconstruction using decoders trained on other individuals.

                Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations of the Drosophila planar cell polarity gene prickle (pk) result in altered microtubule-mediated vesicular transport in larval motor axons, as well as adult neuronal circuit hyperexcitability and epileptic behavior. It is also known that mutant alleles of the prickle-prickle (pkpk) and prickle-spiny-legs (pksple) isoforms differ in phenotype but display isoform counterbalancing effects in heteroallelic pkpk/pksple flies to ameliorate adult motor circuit and behavioral hyperexcitability. We have further investigated the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and uncovered robust phenotypes in both pkpk and pksple alleles (heretofore referred to as pk and sple alleles, respectively), including synaptic terminal overgrowth, as well as irregular motor axon terminal excitability, poor vesicle release synchronicity, and altered efficacy of synaptic transmission. We observed significant increase in whole-cell excitatory junctional potential (EJP) in pk homozygotes, which was restored to near WT level in pk/sple heterozygotes. We further examined motor terminal excitability sustained by presynaptic Ca2+ channels, under the condition of pharmacological blockade of Na+ and K+ channel function. Such manipulation revealed extreme Ca2+ channel-dependent nerve terminal excitability in both pk and sple mutants. However, when combined in pk/sple heterozygotes, such terminal hyper-excitability was restored to nearly normal. Focal recording from individual synaptic boutons revealed asynchronous vesicle release in both pk and sple homozygotes, which nevertheless persisted in pk/sple heterozygotes without indications of isoform counter-balancing effects. Similarly, the overgrowth at NMJs was not compensated in pk/sple heterozygotes, exhibiting an extremity comparable to that in pk and sple homozygotes. Our observations uncovered differential roles of the pk and sple isoforms and their distinct interactions in the various structural and functional aspects of the larval NMJ and adult neural circuits.

                Hippocampal CA1 cells take part in reliable, time-locked activity sequences in tasks that involve an association between stimuli, in a manner that tiles the interval between the stimuli. Such cells have been termed time cells. Here we adopt a first-principles approach to comparing diverse analysis and detection algorithms for identifying time cells. We developed a resource for generating synthetic activity datasets using calcium signals recorded in vivo from mouse hippocampus using 2-photon imaging, for template response waveforms. We assigned known, ground truth values for properties of time cells in this synthetic dataset, including noise, timing imprecision, hit-trial ratio and calcium event width. These datasets were the input to a pipeline for testing multiple algorithms for time cell detection to determine the conditions for which they were best suited, and evaluate their effective operating ranges. We find that most algorithms are sensitive to noise. Only a few methods benefit from larger event widths. Reassuringly, most methods are insensitive to timing imprecision, and exhibit successful time cell detection even at low hit trial ratios. Importantly, all methods show good concordance in identifying cells as time cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced synaptic activity and dysregulated extracellular matrix pathways are common phenotypes in midbrain neurons derived from sporadic and mutation-associated Parkinson's disease patients</a></h4>

              
                Several mutations that cause Parkinson's disease (PD) have been identified over the past decade. These account for 15-25% of PD cases; the rest of the cases are considered sporadic. Currently, it is accepted that PD is not a single monolithic disease but rather a constellation of diseases with some common phenotypes. While rodent models exist for some of the PD-causing mutations, research on the sporadic forms of PD is lagging due to a lack of cellular models. In our study, we differentiated PD patient-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of several PD-causing mutations as well as from sporadic PD patients. Strikingly, we observed a common neurophysiological phenotype: Neurons derived from PD patients had a severe reduction in the rate of synaptic currents compared to those derived from healthy controls. While the relationship between mutations in genes such as the SNCA and LRRK2 and a reduction in synaptic transmission has been investigated before, here we show evidence that the pathogenesis of the synapses in neurons is a general phenotype in PD. Analysis of RNA sequencing results displayed changes in gene expression in different synaptic mechanisms as well as other affected pathways such as extracellular matrix-related pathways. Some of these dysregulated pathways are common to all PD patients (monogenic or idiopathic). Our data, therefore, shows pathways and mechanisms that are central and convergent to PD and suggests a strong involvement of the tetra-partite synapse in PD pathology.

                It is unclear why and how children learn more efficiently than adults, although inhibitory systems, which play an important role in stabilizing learning, are immature in children. Here, we found that despite a lower baseline concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in early visual cortical areas in children (8 to 11 years old) than adults (18 to 35 years old), children exhibited a rapid boost of GABA immediately after visual training, whereas the concentration of GABA in adults remained unchanged after training. Moreover, behavioral experiments showed that children stabilized visual learning much faster than adults, showing rapid development of resilience to retrograde interference. These results together suggest that inhibitory systems in children's brains are more dynamic and adapt more quickly to stabilize learning than in adults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-Translational Tubulin Modifications in Differentiated Human Neural Stem Cells</a></h4>

              
                The tubulin protein fulfills a variety of cellular functions that range from chromosomal separation to locomotion. The functional diversity of tubulin is achieved through the expression of specific tubulin isotypes in different cell types or developmental time periods. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of tubulin also are vital for specific intracellular tasks, such as binding and recruiting motor proteins. In neurons, the isotypic expression profile for tubulin is well characterized, and the importance of PTMs for proper neuronal function has gained recent attention due to their implication in neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast, the role of tubulin specializations in the specification of neural cell fate has received minimal attention and studies of tubulin PTMs and isotypes in neuroglia such as astrocytes are relatively few. To bridge this knowledge gap, we undertook an analysis of PTMs in neurons and astrocytes derived from the federally approved H9 hESC-derived human neural stem cell (hNSC) line. In hNSCs, basal cells can be directed to assume neural fate as neurons or astrocytes by specifying different media growth conditions. Immunocytochemical methods, fluorescent antibody probes, and confocal microscopy facilitated image acquisition of fluorescent signals from class III {beta}- tubulin ({beta}III-tubulin), acetylated tubulin, and polyglutamylated tubulin. Fluorescent probe intensities were assessed with the EBImage package for the statistical programming language R and compared using Student's t-tests. Qualitative analysis indicated that {beta}III-tubulin, acetylated tubulin, and polyglutamylated tubulin were expressed to some degree in basal hNSCs and their media-differentiated hNSC neuronal and astroglial progeny. In media-differentiated hNSC astrocyte progeny, quantification and statistical analysis of fluorescence probe intensity showed that acetylated tubulin/ {beta}III-tubulin ratios were greater than the ratio for polyglutamylated tubulin/ {beta}III-tubulin. These findings represent a snapshot of the dynamic and varied changes tubulin expression profile during the specification of neural cell fate. Results imply that investigations of tubulin PTMs have the potential to advance our understanding of the generation and regeneration of nervous tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maturation of prefrontal input to dorsal raphe increases behavioral persistence in mice</a></h4>

              
                The ability to persist towards a desired objective is a fundamental aspect of behavioral control whose impairment is implicated in several behavioral disorders. One of the prominent features of behavioral persistence is that its maturation occurs relatively late in development. This is presumed to echo the developmental time course of a corresponding circuit within late-maturing parts of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex, but the specific identity of the responsible circuits is unknown. Here, we describe the maturation of the projection from layer 5 neurons of the prefrontal cortex to the dorsal raphe nucleus in mice. We show using pathway-specific optogenetic stimulation that this connection undergoes a dramatic increase in synaptic potency between postnatal weeks 3 and 8, corresponding to the transition from juvenile to adult. We then show that this period corresponds to an increase in the behavioral persistence that mice exhibit in a foraging task. Finally, we use genetic targeting to selectively ablate this pathway in adulthood and show that mice revert to a behavioral phenotype similar to juveniles. These results suggest that the prefrontal to dorsal raphe pathway is a critical anatomical and functional substrate of the development and manifestation of behavioral control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contribution of behavioural variability to representational drift</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal responses to similar stimuli change dynamically over time, raising the question of how internal representations can provide a stable substrate for neural coding. While the drift of these representations is mostly characterized in relation to external stimuli or tasks, behavioural or internal state of the animal is also known to modulate the neural activity. We therefore asked how the variability of such modulatory mechanisms can contribute to representational drift. By analysing publicly available datasets from the Allen Brain Observatory, we found that behavioural variability significantly contributes to changes in stimulus-induced neuronal responses across various cortical areas in the mouse. This effect could not be explained by a gain model in which change in the behavioural state scaled the signal or the noise. A better explanation was provided by a model in which behaviour contributed independently to neuronal tuning. Our results are consistent with a view in which behaviour modulates the low-dimensional, slowly-changing setpoints of neurons, upon which faster operations like sensory processing are performed. Importantly, our analysis suggests that reliable but variable behavioural signals might be misinterpreted as representational drift, if neuronal representations are only characterized in the stimulus space and marginalised over behavioural parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiplex labeling and manipulation of endogenous neuronal proteins using sequential CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in methods enable labeling of individual endogenous proteins with fluorophores, to determine their spatiotemporal expression in intact biological preparations. However, multiplex knock-in methods remain limited, particularly in postmitotic cells, due to a high degree of crosstalk between genome editing events. We present Conditional Activation of Knock-in Expression (CAKE), which delivers efficient, flexible and accurate multiplex genome editing in neurons. CAKE is based on sequential gRNA expression operated by a Cre- or Flp-recombinase to control the time window for genomic integration of each donor sequence, which diminishes crosstalk between genome editing events. Importantly, CAKE is compatible with multiple CRISPR/Cas9 strategies, and we show the utilization of CAKE for co-localization of various endogenous proteins, including synaptic scaffolds, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptor subunits. Knock-in efficacy was highly sensitive to DNA vector amount, while knock-in crosstalk was dependent on the rate of donor DNA integration and timing of Cre activation. We applied CAKE to study the co-distribution of endogenous synaptic proteins using dual-color single-molecule localization microscopy, and we introduced dimerization modules to acutely control synaptic receptor dynamics in living neurons. Taken together, CAKE is a versatile method for multiplex protein labeling, enabling accurate detection, precise localization and acute manipulation of endogenous proteins in single cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Testing the state-dependent model of time perception against experimental evidence</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated movements, speech and other actions are impossible without precise timing. Realistic computational models of interval timing in the mammalian brain are expected to provide key insights into the underlying mechanisms of timing. Existing computational models of time perception have only been partially replicating experimental observations, such as the linear increase of time, the dopaminergic modulation of this increase, and the scalar property, i.e., the linear increase of the standard deviation of temporal estimates. In this work, we incorporate the state-dependent computational model, which encodes time in the dynamic evolution of network states without the need for a specific network structure into a biologically plausible prefrontal cortex (PFC) model based on in vivo and in vitro recordings of rodents. Specifically, we stimulated 1000 neurons in the beginning and in the end of a range of different time intervals, extracted states of neurons and trained the readout layer based on these states using least squares to predict the respective inter stimulus interval. We show that the naturally occurring heterogeneity in cellular and synaptic parameters in the PFC is sufficient to encode time over several hundreds of milliseconds. The readout faithfully represents the duration between two stimuli applied to the superficial layers of the network, thus fulfilling the requirement of a linear encoding of time. A simulated activation of the D2 dopamine receptor leads to an overestimation and an inactivation to an underestimation of time, in line with experimental results. Furthermore, we show that the scalar property holds true for intervals of several hundred milliseconds, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the origin of the scalar property as well as its deviations. We conclude that this model can represent durations up to 750 ms in a biophysically plausible setting, compatible with experimental findings in this regime.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expectation violations produce error signals in mouse V1</a></h4>

              
                Repeated exposure to visual sequences changes the form of evoked activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). Predictive coding theory provides a potential explanation for this, namely that plasticity shapes cortical circuits to encode spatiotemporal predictions and that subsequent responses are modulated by the degree to which actual inputs match these expectations. Here we use a recently developed statistical modeling technique called Model-Based Targeted Dimensionality Reduction (MbTDR) to study visually-evoked dynamics in mouse V1 in context of a previously described experimental paradigm called "sequence learning". We report that evoked spiking activity changed significantly with training, in a manner generally consistent with the predictive coding framework. Neural responses to expected stimuli were suppressed in a late window (100-150ms) after stimulus onset following training, while responses to novel stimuli were not. Omitting predictable stimuli led to increased firing at the expected time of stimulus onset, but only in trained mice. Substituting a novel stimulus for a familiar one led to changes in firing that persisted for at least 300ms. In addition, we show that spiking data can be used to accurately decode time within the sequence. Our findings are consistent with the idea that plasticity in early visual circuits is involved in coding spatiotemporal information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prelimbic proBDNF facilitates memory destabilization by regulation of neuronal function in juveniles</a></h4>

              
                Fear regulation changes as a function of age and adolescence is a key developmental period for the continued maturation of fear neural circuitry. The involvement of prelimbic proBDNF in fear memory extinction and its mediated signaling were reported previously. Given the inherent high level of proBDNF during juvenile period, we tested whether prelimbic proBDNF regulated synaptic and neuronal functions allowing to influencing retrieval-dependent memory processing. By examining freezing behavior of auditory fear conditioned rats, we found high levels of prelimbic proBDNF in juvenile rats enhanced destabilization of the retrieval-dependent weak but not strong fear memory through activating p75NTR-GluN2B signaling. This modification was attributed to the increment in proportion of thin type spine and promotion in synaptic function, as evidence by facilitation of NMDA-mediated EPSCs and GluN2B-dependent synaptic depression. The strong prelimbic theta- and gamma-oscillation coupling predicted the suppressive effect of proBDNF on the recall of post-retrieval memory. Our results critically emphasize the importance of developmental proBDNF for modification of retrieval-dependent memory and provide a potential critical targeting to inhibit threaten memories associated with neurodevelopment disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast parametric curve matching (FPCM) for automatic spike detection</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a widely spread neurological disease, whose treatment often requires resection of the pathological cortical tissue. Interictal spike analysis observed in the non-invasively collected EEG or MEG data offers an attractive way to localize epileptogenic cortical structures for surgery planning purposes. Interictal spike detection in lengthy multichannel data is a daunting task that is still often performed manually. This frequently limits such an analysis to a small portion of the data which renders the appropriate risks of missing the potentially epileptogenic region. While a plethora of automatic spike detection techniques have been developed each with its own assumptions and limitations, non of them is ideal and the best results are achieved when the output of several automatic spike detectors are combined. This is especially true in the low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To this end we propose a novel biomimetic approach for automatic spike detection based on a constrained mixed spline machinery that we dub as fast parametric curve matching (FPCM). Using the peak-wave shape parametrization, the constrained parametric morphological model is constructed and convolved with the observed multichannel data to efficiently determine mixed spline parameters corresponding to each time-point in the dataset. Then the logical predicates that directly map to verbalized text-book like descriptions of the expected interictal event morphology allow us to accomplish the spike detection task. The results of simulations mimicking typical low SNR scenario show the robustness and high ROC AUC values of the FPCM method as compared to the spike detection performed using more conventional approaches such as wavelet decomposition, template matching or simple amplitude thresholding. Applied to the real MEG and EEG data from the human patients and to rat ECoG data, the FPCM technique demonstrates reliable detection of the interictal events and localization of epileptogenic zones concordant with independent conclusions made by the epileptologist. Since the FPCM is computationally light, tolerant to high amplitude artifacts and flexible to accommodate verbalized descriptions of the arbitrary target morphology, it may complement the existing arsenal of means for analysis of noisy interictal datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta- and gamma-band oscillatory uncoupling in the macaque hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Nested hippocampal oscillations in the rodent gives rise to temporal coding that may underlie learning, memory, and decision making. Theta/gamma coupling in rodent CA1 occurs during exploration and sharp-wave ripples during quiescence. Whether these oscillatory regimes extend to primates is less clear. We therefore sought to identify correspondences in frequency bands, nesting, and behavioral coupling taken from macaque hippocampus. We found that, in contrast to the rodent, theta and gamma frequency bands in macaque CA1 were segregated by behavioral states. Beta/gamma (15-70Hz) had greater power during visual search while theta (7-10 Hz) dominated during quiescence. Moreover, delta/theta (3-8 Hz) amplitude was strongest when beta2/slow gamma (20-35 Hz) amplitude was weakest, though the low frequencies coupled with higher, ripple frequencies (60-150 Hz). The distribution of spike-field coherence revealed three peaks matching the 3-10 Hz, 20-30 Hz and 60-150 Hz bands; however, the low frequency effects were primarily due to sharp-wave ripples. Accordingly, no intrinsic theta spiking rhythmicity was apparent. These results support a role for beta2/slow gamma modulation in CA1 during active exploration in the primate that is decoupled from theta oscillations. These findings diverge from the rodent oscillatory canon and call for a shift in focus and frequency when considering the primate hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White-matter degradation and dynamical compensation support age-related functional alterations in human brain</a></h4>

              
                Structural connectivity of the brain at different ages is analyzed using diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The largest decrease of the number and average length of stream- lines is found for the long inter-hemispheric links, with the strongest impact for frontal regions. From the BOLD functional MRI (fMRI) time series we identify age-related changes of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) and spatial covariation features of the FC links captured by meta- connectivity (MC). They indicate more constant dFC, but wider range and variance of MC. Finally we applied computational whole-brain network model based on oscillators, which mechanistically expresses the impact of the spatio-temporal structure of the brain (weights and the delays) to the dynamics. With this we tested several hypothesis, which revealed that the spatio-temporal reorga- nization of the brain with ageing, supports the observed functional fingerprints only if the model accounts for: (i) compensation of the individual brains for the overall loss of structural connectivity, and (ii) decrease of propagation velocity due to the loss of myelination. We also show that having these two conditions, it is sufficient to decompose the time-delays as bimodal distribution that only distinguishes between intra- and inter-hemispheric delays, and that the same working point also captures the static FC the best.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Patterns of Arc mRNA expression in the rat brain following dual recall of fear- and reward-based socially acquired information</a></h4>

              
                The ability to learn new information and behaviors is a vital component of survival in most animal species. This learning can occur via direct experience or through observation of another individual (i.e., social learning). While research focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of direct learning is prevalent, less work has aimed at understanding the brain circuitry mediating the acquisition and recall of socially acquired information. We aimed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying recall of socially acquired information by having rats sequentially recall a socially transmitted food preference (STFP) and a fear association via fear conditioning by-proxy (FCbP). Brain tissue was processed for mRNA expression of the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc, which reliably expresses in the cell nucleus following transcription before migrating to the cytoplasm over the next 25 minutes. Given this timeframe, we were able to identify whether Arc transcription was triggered by STFP recall, FCbP recall, or following recall of both memories. Surprisingly - and contrary to past research examining expression of other IEGs following STFP or FCbP recall separately - we found no differences in any of the Arc expression measures across a number of prefrontal regions and the vCA3 of the hippocampus between controls, demonstrators, and observers, though we did detect an overall effect of sex in a number of regions. We theorize that these results may indicate that relatively little Arc-dependent neural restructuring is taking place in the prefrontal cortices following recall of a recently socially acquired information or directly acquired fear associations in these areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin modulates social brain network correlations in resting and task state</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide that modulates social behaviors and the social brain. The effects of OT on the social brain can be tracked by assessing the neural activity in the resting and task states, providing a system-level framework for characterizing state-based functional relationships of its distinct effect. Here, we contribute to this framework by examining how OT modulates social brain network correlations during the resting and task states using fMRI. Firstly, we investigated network activation, followed by analyzing the relationship between networks and individual differences measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the Big-Five scales. Subsequently, we evaluated functional connectivity in both states. Finally, the relationship between networks across the states was represented by the predictive power of networks in the resting state for task-evoked activity. The difference in predicted accuracy between subjects displayed individual variations in this relationship. Our results showed decreased dorsal default mode network (DDMN) for OT group in the resting state. Additionally, only in the OT group, the activity of the DDMN in the resting state had the largest predictive power for task-evoked activation of the precuneus network (PN). The results also demonstrated OT reduced individual variation of PN, specifically, the difference of accuracy between predicting a subject's own and others' PN task activation. These findings suggest a distributed but modulatory effect of OT on the association between resting brain networks and task-dependent brain networks, showing increased DDMN to PN connectivity after OT administration, which may support OT-induced distributed processing during task performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A systematic characterization of intrinsically formed microglia-like cells during retinal organoid differentiation.</a></h4>

              
                Brain organoids differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells provide a unique opportunity to investigate the development, organization and connectivity of neurons in a complex cellular environment. However, organoids usually lack microglia, brain-resident immune cells which are both present in the early human embryonic brain and participate in neuronal circuit development. Here, we find that microglia innately develop in unguided retinal organoid differentiation between week 3 and 4 in 2.5D culture and appear later in floating, non-pigmented, 3D-cystic compartments. We enriched for cystic structures using a low-dosed BMP4 application and performed mass spectrometry, thus defining the protein composition of microglia-containing compartments. We found that cystic compartments expressed both mesenchymal and epithelial markers with microglia enriched in the mesenchymal region. Interestingly, microglia-like cells started to express the border-associated macrophage marker CD163. The preferential localization of human microglia to a mesenchymal compartment provides insight into the behavior and migration of microglia. The model will ultimately allow detailed study of these enigmatic cells and how they enter and distribute within the human brain.

                The timing of neuronal responses is considered to be important for information transferring and communication across individual neurons. However, the sources of variabilities in the timing of neuronal responses are not well understood and sometimes over-interpreted. A systematic variability in the response latencies of the primary visual cortex has been reported in presence of drifting grating stimulus. Whereas the response latencies are systematically dependent on stimulus orientation. To understand the underlying mechanism of these systematic latencies, we recorded the neuronal response of the cat visual cortex, area 17, and simulated the response latency of V1 neurons, with two geometric models. We showed that outputs of these two models significantly predict the response latencies of the electrophysiology recording during orientation tasks. The periodic patterns created in the raster plots were dependent on the relative position of the stimulus rotation center and the receptive-field sub-regions. We argue the position of stimulus is contributing to systematic response latencies, dependent on drifting orientation. Therefore, we provide a toolbox based on our geometrical model for determining the exact location of RF sub-regions. Our result indicates that a major source of neuronal variability is the lack of fine-tuning in the task parameters. Considering the simplicity of the orientation selectivity task, we argue fine-tuning of stimulus properties is crucial for deduction of neural variability in higher-order cortical areas and understanding their neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired endogenous neurosteroid signaling contributes to behavioral deficits associated with chronic stress</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric illnesses, including depression; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby stress leads to mood disorders remain unclear. The recent FDA approval of antidepressants with novel mechanisms of action, like Zulresso(R), a synthetic neuroactive steroid analog with molecular pharmacology similar to allopregnanolone, has spurred interest in new therapeutic targets and, potentially, novel pathophysiological mechanisms for depression. Allopregnanolone acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (GABAARs), acting preferentially at {delta} subunit-containing receptors ({delta}-GABAARs). Accumulating clinical and preclinical evidence supports the antidepressant effects of exogenous administration of allopregnanolone and allopregnanolone analogs; however, the role of endogenous neurosteroids in the pathophysiology of depression remains unknown. Here, we examine whether altered neurosteroid signaling may contribute to behavioral deficits following chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in mice. We first identified reductions in expression of {delta}-GABAARs, the predominant site of action of 5a-reduced neuroactive steroids, following CUS. Additionally, utilizing LC-MS/MS we discovered a decrease in levels of allopregnanolone in the BLA, but not plasma of mice following CUS, an indication of impaired neurosteroid synthesis. CRISPR knockdown the rate-limiting enzymes involved in allopregnanolone synthesis, 5-reductase type 1 and 2, in the BLA mimicked the behavioral deficits associated with CUS in mice. Furthermore, overexpression expression of 5-reductase type 1 and 2 in the BLA improved behavioral outcomes. Collectively, this suggests chronic stress impairs endogenous neurosteroid signaling in the BLA which is sufficient to induce behavioral deficits similar to those observed following CUS. Further, these studies suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of allopregnanolone-based treatments may be due to their ability to directly target the underlying pathophysiology of mood disorders. Therefore, targeting endogenous neurosteroidogenesis may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of mood disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The synaptic organization in the  C. elegans neural network suggests significant local compartmentalized computations</a></h4>

              
                Neurons are characterized by elaborate tree-like dendritic structures that support local computations by integrating multiple inputs from upstream presynaptic neurons. It is less clear if simple neurons, consisting of a few or even a single neurite, may perform local computations as well. To address this question, we focused on the compact neural network of C. elegans animals for which the full wiring diagram is available, including the coordinates of individual synapses. We find that the positions of the chemical synapses along the neurites are not randomly distributed, nor can they be explained by anatomical constraints. Instead, synapses tend to form clusters, an organization that supports local compartmentalized computations. In mutually-synapsing neurons, connections of opposite polarity cluster separately, suggesting that positive and negative feedback dynamics may be implemented in discrete compartmentalized regions along neurites. In triple-neuron circuits, the non-random synaptic organization may facilitate local functional roles, such as signal integration and coordinated activation of functionally-related downstream neurons. These clustered synaptic topologies emerge as a guiding principle in the network presumably to facilitate distinct parallel functions along a single neurite, effectively increasing the computational capacity of the neural network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors modulate HCN channel properties in vestibular ganglion neurons</a></h4>

              
                Vestibular efferent neurons play an important role in shaping vestibular afferent excitability and accordingly, on the information encoded by their spike patterns. Efferent-modulation is linked to muscarinic signaling cascades that affect ion channel conductances, most notably low-voltage gated potassium channels such as KCNQ. Here we tested and found that muscarinic signaling cascades also modulate hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide gated channels (HCN). HCN channels play a key role in controlling spike-timing regularity and a non-chemical form of transmission between type I hair cells and vestibular afferents. The impact of cholinergic efferent input on HCN channels was assessed using voltage-clamp methods, which measure currents in the disassociated cell bodies of vestibular ganglion neurons (VGN). Membrane properties in VGN were characterized before and after administration of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist Oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M). We found that Oxo-M shifted the voltage-activation range of HCN channels in the positive direction by 4.1 +/- 1.1 mV, which more than doubled the available current when held near rest at -60 mV (a 184 +/- 90.1% increase, n=19). This effect was not blocked by pre-treating the cells with a KCNQ channel blocker, linopirdine, which suggests that this effect is not dependent on KCNQ currents. We also found that HCN channel properties in the baseline condition and sensitivity to mAChR activation depended on cell size and firing patterns. Large-bodied neurons with onset firing patterns had the most depolarized activation range and least sensitivity to mAChR activation. Together, our results highlight the complex and dynamic regulation of HCN channels in VGN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">INFLUENCE OF RAT CENTRAL THALAMIC NEURONS ON FORAGING BEHAVIOR IN A HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BL) is a major regulator of foraging behavior. Following BL inactivation, rats become indifferent to predators. However, at odds with the view that the amygdala detects threats and generate defensive behaviors, most BL neurons have reduced firing rates during foraging and at proximity of the predator. In search of the signals determining this unexpected activity pattern, this study considered the contribution of the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT), which sends a strong projection to BL, mostly targeting its principal neurons. Inactivation of CMT or BL with muscimol abolished the rats normally cautious behavior in the foraging task. Moreover, unit recordings revealed that CMT neurons showed large but heterogeneous activity changes during the foraging task, with many neurons decreasing or increasing their discharge rates, with a modest bias for the latter. A generalized linear model revealed that CMT neurons encode many of the same task variables as principal BL cells. However, the nature (inhibitory vs. excitatory) and relative magnitude of the activity modulations seen in CMT neurons differed markedly from those of principal BL cells but were very similar to those of fast-spiking BL interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that, during the foraging task, CMT inputs fire some principal BL neurons, recruiting feedback interneurons in BL, resulting in the widespread inhibition of principal BL cells.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in which upper and lower motor neuron loss is the primary phenotype, leading to muscle weakness and wasting, respiratory failure, and death. Although a portion of ALS cases are linked to one of over 50 unique genes, the vast majority of cases are sporadic in nature. However, the mechanisms underlying the motor neuron loss in either familial or sporadic ALS are not entirely clear. Here we used induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a set of identical twin brothers discordant for ALS to assess the role of astrocytes and microglia on the expression and accumulation of neurofilament proteins in motor neurons. We found that motor neurons derived from the affected twin exhibited increased transcript levels of all three neurofilament isoforms and increased expression of phosphorylated neurofilament puncta. We further found that treatment of the motor neurons with astrocyte conditioned medium and microglial conditioned medium significantly impacted neurofilament deposition. Together, these data suggest that glial-secreted factors can alter neurofilament pathology in ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A common human brain-derived neurotrophic factor polymorphism leads to sustained depression of excitatory synaptic transmission by isoflurane in hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Multiple presynaptic and postsynaptic targets have been identified for the reversible neurophysiological effects of general anesthetics on synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. However, the synaptic mechanisms involved in persistent depression of synaptic transmission resulting in more prolonged neurological dysfunction following anesthesia are less clear. Here, we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor implicated in synaptic plasticity and dysfunction, enhances glutamate synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and that attenuation of vesicular BDNF release by isoflurane contributes to transient depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in mice. This reduction in synaptic vesicle exocytosis was irreversible in neurons that release less endogenous BDNF due to a polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) compared to wild-type mouse hippocampal neurons following isoflurane exposure. These effects were prevented by exogenous application of BDNF. Our findings identify a role for a common human BDNF single nucleotide polymorphism (Val66Met; rs6265) in persistent changes of synaptic function following isoflurane exposure. These persistent alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission have important implications for the role of genotype in anesthetic effects on synaptic plasticity and neurocognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Superficial white matter microstructure affects processing speed in cerebral small vessel disease</a></h4>

              
                White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a typical feature of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). This condition contributes to about 50% of dementias worldwide, a massive health burden in aging. Microstructural alterations in the deep white matter (DWM) have been widely examined in CSVD. However, little is known about abnormalities in the superficial white matter (SWM) and their relevance for processing speed, the main cognitive deficit in CSVD. In this paper, 141 patients with CSVD were studied. Processing speed was assessed by the completion time of the Trail Making Test Part A. White matter abnormalities were assessed by WMH burden (lesion volume on T2-FLAIR) and diffusion MRI, including DTI and free-water (FW) imaging microstructure measures. The results of our study indicate that the superficial white matter may play a particularly important role in cognitive decline in CSVD. SWM imaging measures resulted in a large contribution to processing speed, despite a relatively small WMH burden in the SWM. SWM FW had the strongest association with processing speed among all imaging markers and, unlike the other diffusion MRI measures, significantly increased between two patient subgroups with the lowest WMH burdens (possibly representing early stages of disease). When comparing two patient subgroups with the highest WMH burdens, the involvement of WMH in the SWM was accompanied by significant differences in processing speed and white matter microstructure. Given significant effects of WMH volume and regional FW on processing speed, we performed a mediation analysis. SWM FW was found to fully mediate the association between WMH volume and processing speed, while no mediation effect of DWM FW was observed. Overall, our findings identify SWM abnormalities in CSVD and suggest that the SWM has an important contribution to processing speed. Results indicate that FW in the SWM is a sensitive marker of microstructural changes associated with cognition in CSVD. This study extends the current understanding of CSVD-related dysfunction and suggests that the SWM, as an understudied region, can be a potential target for monitoring pathophysiological processes in future research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Roles for Mitochondrial Complex I subunits in regulating synaptic transmission and growth</a></h4>

              
                To identify conserved components of synapse function that are also associated with human diseases, we conducted a genetic screen. We used the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. We employed RNA interference (RNAi) on selected targets and assayed synapse function by electrophysiology. We focused our screen on genetic factors known to be conserved from human neurological or muscle functions (321 total RNAi lines screened). Knockdown of a particular Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunit gene (ND-20L) lowered levels of NMJ neurotransmission. Due to the severity of the phenotype, we studied MCI function further. Knockdown of core MCI subunits concurrently in neurons and muscle led to impaired neurotransmission. Further, pharmacology targeting MCI phenocopied the impaired neurotransmission phenotype. Finally, MCI subunit knockdowns led to profound cytological defects, including reduced NMJ growth and altered NMJ morphology. Mitochondria are essential for cellular bioenergetics and produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Five multi-protein complexes achieve this task, and MCI is the largest. Impaired Mitochondrial Complex I subunits in humans are associated with disorders such as Parkinsons disease, Leigh syndrome, and cardiomyopathy. Together, our data present an analysis of Complex I in the context of synapse function and plasticity. We speculate that in the context of human MCI dysfunction, similar neuronal and synaptic defects could contribute to pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Xenopus neuromast bioassay for chemical ototoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ototoxic chemicals can impair the senses of hearing and balance in mammals through irreversible damage to the mechanosensory bundles of inner ear hair cells. Fish and amphibians are useful models for investigating ototoxicity because their inner ear hair cells, like those of mammals, are susceptible to damage by ototoxins. Moreover, amphibian mechanosensation is augmented by a lateral line organ on the body surface that comprises external mechanosensory hair cells. The lateral line hair cells are arranged in clusters (neuromasts) and are structurally and functionally similar to inner ear hair cells, but are more accessible for experimental manipulation. Herein, we implemented neuromasts of the amphibian (Xenopus) lateral line as an organ system for evaluating the effects of ototoxic chemicals, such as antibiotics, on mechanosensory hair cell bundles. Methods: We examined the ultrastructure of larval Xenopus laevis neuromasts with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after larvae were continuously exposed to ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations (gentamicin; streptomycin; neomycin) for 72 hours. Results: SEM images demonstrated that 72 hours of exposure to antibiotic concentrations greater than 25 M reduced the hair cell bundle number in lateral line neuromasts. Conclusion: Therapeutic drug studies will benefit from the incorporation of bioassay strategies that evaluate ototoxicity across multiple species including genera of amphibian origin such as Xenopus. Our outcomes support the use of the Xenopus lateral line for identification of potential ototoxic chemicals and suggest that Xenopus neuromast hair cell bundles can withstand antibiotic exposure. The Xenopus bioassay presented here can be incorporated into drug discovery methodology as a high-resolution phenotypic screen for ototoxic effects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Decision prioritization and causal reasoning in decision hierarchies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ariel Zylberberg</p>

From cooking a meal to finding a route to a destination, many real life decisions can be decomposed into a hierarchy of sub-decisions. In a hierarchy, choosing which decision to think about requires planning over a potentially vast space of possible decision sequences. To gain insight into how people decide what to decide on, we studied a novel task that combines perceptual decision making, active sensing and hierarchical and counterfactual reasoning. Human participants had to find a target hidden at the lowest level of a decision tree. They could solicit information from the different nodes of the decision tree to gather noisy evidence about the target’s location. Feedback was given only after errors at the leaf nodes and provided ambiguous evidence about the cause of the error. Despite the complexity of task (with 10<sup>7</sup> latent states) participants were able to plan efficiently in the task. A computational model of this process identified a small number of heuristics of low computational complexity that accounted for human behavior. These heuristics include making categorical decisions at the branching points of the decision tree rather than carrying forward entire probability distributions, discarding sensory evidence deemed unreliable to make a choice, and using choice confidence to infer the cause of the error after an initial plan failed. Plans based on probabilistic inference or myopic sampling norms could not capture participants’ behavior. Our results show that it is possible to identify hallmarks of heuristic planning with sensing in human behavior and that the use of tasks of intermediate complexity helps identify the rules underlying human ability to reason over decision hierarchies.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adropin is a secreted peptide, which is composed of 43 amino acids and shows an effective role in regulating energy metabolism and insulin resistance. Motor coordination and locomotor activity were improved by adropin in the cerebellum. However, it is not known whether adropin administration has an effect on spatial learning and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of adropin on spatial learning and memory and characterized the biochemical properties of adropin in the hippocampus. Thirty male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups as control and adropin groups. The control group received 0.9% NaCl intracerebroventricular for 6 days, while the adropin groups received 1 nmol of adropin dissolved in 0.9% NaCl (for 6 days). The Morris water maze, Y maze, and object location recognition tests were performed to evaluate learning and memory. Also, the locomotor activity tests were measured to assess the motor function. The expression of Akt, phospho-Akt, CREB, phospho-CREB, Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), phospho-GSK3β, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit were determined in the hippocampal tissues by using western blot. Behavior tests showed that adropin significantly increase spatial memory performance. Meanwhile, the western blot analyses revealed that the phosphorylated form of the Akt and CREB were enhanced with adropin administration in the hippocampus. Also, the expression of BDNF showed an enhancement in adropin group in comparison to the control group.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Generation and diversification of recombinant monoclonal antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Antibodies are indispensable tools used for a large number of applications in both foundational and translational bioscience research; however, there are drawbacks to using traditional antibodies generated in animals. These include a lack of standardization leading to problems with reproducibility, high costs of antibodies purchased from commercial sources, and ethical concerns regarding the large number of animals used to generate antibodies. To address these issues, we have developed practical methodologies and tools for generating low-cost, high-yield preparations of recombinant monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments directed to protein epitopes from primary sequences. We describe these methods here, as well as approaches to diversify monoclonal antibodies, including customization of antibody species specificity, generation of genetically encoded small antibody fragments, and conversion of single chain antibody fragments (<i>e.g.</i> scFv) into full-length, bivalent antibodies. This study focuses on antibodies directed to epitopes important for mitosis and kinetochore function; however, the methods and reagents described here are applicable to antibodies and antibody fragments for use in any field.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Superior colliculus drives stimulus-evoked directionally biased saccades and attempted head movements in head-fixed mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals investigate their environments by directing their gaze towards salient stimuli. In the prevailing view, mouse gaze shifts entail head rotations followed by brainstem-mediated eye movements, including saccades to reset the eyes. These 'recentering' saccades are attributed to head movement-related vestibular cues. However, microstimulating mouse superior colliculus (SC) elicits directed head and eye movements resembling SC-dependent sensory-guided gaze shifts in other species, suggesting that mouse gaze shifts may be more flexible than has been recognized. We investigated this possibility by tracking eye and attempted head movements in a head-fixed preparation that eliminates head movement-related sensory cues. We found tactile stimuli evoke directionally biased saccades coincident with attempted head rotations. Differences in saccade endpoints across stimuli are associated with distinct stimulus-dependent relationships between initial eye position and saccade direction and amplitude. Optogenetic perturbations revealed SC drives these gaze shifts. Thus, head-fixed mice make sensory-guided, SC-dependent gaze shifts involving coincident, directionally biased saccades and attempted head movements. Our findings uncover flexibility in mouse gaze shifts and provide a foundation for studying head-eye coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A theory of synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and precise neuronal communication is enabled through a highly synchronous release of signaling molecules neurotransmitters within just milliseconds of the action potential. Yet neurotransmitter release lacks a theoretical framework that is both phenomenologically accurate and mechanistically realistic. Here, we present an analytic theory of the action-potential-triggered neurotransmitter release at the chemical synapse. The theory is demonstrated to be in detailed quantitative agreement with existing data on a wide variety of synapses from electrophysiological recordings in vivo and fluorescence experiments in vitro. Despite up to ten orders of magnitude of variation in the release rates among the synapses, the theory reveals that synaptic transmission obeys a simple, universal scaling law, which we confirm through a collapse of the data from strikingly diverse synapses onto a single master curve. This universality is complemented by the ability of the theory to readily extract, through a fit to the data, the kinetic and energetic parameters that uniquely identify each synapse. The theory provides a means to detect cooperativity among the SNARE complexes that mediate vesicle fusion and reveals such cooperativity in several existing data sets. The theory is further applied to establish connections between molecular constituents of synapses and synaptic function. The theory allows competing hypotheses of short-term plasticity to be tested and identifies the regimes where particular mechanisms of synaptic facilitation dominate or, conversely, fail to account for the existing data for the paired-pulse ratio. The derived trade-off relation between the transmission rate and fidelity shows how transmission failure can be controlled by changing the microscopic properties of the vesicle pool and SNARE complexes. The established condition for the maximal synaptic efficacy reveals that no fine tuning is needed for certain synapses to maintain near-optimal transmission. We discuss the limitations of the theory and propose possible routes to extend it. These results provide a quantitative basis for the notion that the molecular-level properties of synapses are crucial determinants of the computational and information-processing functions in synaptic transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Defining the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosome identifies SMIM4 and TMEM223 as respiratory chain assembly factors</a></h4>

              
                Human mitochondria express a genome that encodes thirteen core subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). These proteins insert into the inner membrane co-translationally. Therefore, mitochondrial ribosomes engage with the OXA1L-insertase and membrane-associated proteins, which support membrane insertion of translation products and early assembly steps into OXPHOS complexes. To identify ribosome-associated biogenesis factors for the OXPHOS system, we purified ribosomes and associated proteins from mitochondria. We identified TMEM223 as a ribosome-associated protein involved in complex IV biogenesis. TMEM223 stimulates the translation of COX1 mRNA and is a constituent of early COX1 assembly intermediates. Moreover, we show that SMIM4 together with C12ORF73 interacts with newly synthesized cytochrome <i>b</i> to support initial steps of complex III biogenesis in complex with UQCC1 and UQCC2. Our analyses define the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosome and reveal novel assembly factors for complex III and IV biogenesis that link early assembly stages to the translation machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SSNA1 stabilizes dynamic microtubules and detects microtubule damage</a></h4>

              
                Sjögren's Syndrome Nuclear Autoantigen 1 (SSNA1/NA14) is a microtubule-associated protein with important functions in cilia, dividing cells and developing neurons. However, the direct effects of SSNA1 on microtubules are not known. We employed <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution with purified proteins and TIRF microscopy to investigate the activity of human SSNA1 on dynamic microtubule ends and lattices. Our results show that SSNA1 modulates all parameters of microtubule dynamic instability - slowing down the rates of growth, shrinkage and catastrophe, and promoting rescue. We find that SSNA1 forms stretches along growing microtubule ends and binds cooperatively to the microtubule lattice. Furthermore, SSNA1 is enriched on microtubule damage sites, occurring both naturally, as well as induced by the microtubule severing enzyme spastin. Finally, SSNA1 binding protects microtubules against spastin's severing activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SSNA1 is both a potent microtubule stabilizing protein and a novel sensor of microtubule damage; activities that likely underlie SSNA1's functions on microtubule structures in cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">pH-dependent 11° F1FO ATP synthase sub-steps reveal insight into the FO torque generating mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Most cellular ATP is made by rotary F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> ATP synthases using proton translocation-generated clockwise torque on the F<sub>O</sub> c-ring rotor, while F<sub>1</sub>-ATP hydrolysis can force counterclockwise rotation and proton pumping. The F<sub>O</sub> torque-generating mechanism remains elusive even though the F<sub>O</sub> interface of stator subunit-a, which contains the transmembrane proton half-channels, and the c-ring is known from recent F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> structures. Here, single-molecule F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> rotation studies determined that the pKa values of the half-channels differ, show that mutations of residues in these channels change the pKa values of both half-channels, and reveal the ability of F<sub>O</sub> to undergo single c-subunit rotational stepping. These experiments provide evidence to support the hypothesis that proton translocation through F<sub>O</sub> operates via a Grotthuss mechanism involving a column of single water molecules in each half-channel linked by proton translocation-dependent c-ring rotation. We also observed pH-dependent 11° ATP synthase-direction sub-steps of the <i>E. coli</i> c<sub>10</sub>-ring of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> against the torque of F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase-dependent rotation that result from H<sup>+</sup> transfer events from F<sub>O</sub> subunit-a groups with a low pKa to one c-subunit in the c-ring, and from an adjacent c-subunit to stator groups with a high pKa. These results support a mechanism in which alternating proton translocation-dependent 11° and 25° synthase-direction rotational sub-steps of the c<sub>10</sub>-ring occur to sustain F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> ATP synthesis.

                Activation of T cells requires a rapid surge in cellular protein synthesis. However, the role of translation initiation in the early induction of specific genes remains unclear. Here we show human translation initiation factor eIF3 interacts with select immune system related mRNAs including those encoding the T cell receptor (TCR) subunits TCRA and TCRB. Binding of eIF3 to the <i>TCRA</i> and <i>TCRB</i> mRNA 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) depends on CD28 coreceptor signaling and regulates a burst in TCR translation required for robust T cell activation. Use of the <i>TCRA</i> or <i>TCRB</i> 3'-UTRs to control expression of an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) improves the ability of CAR-T cells to kill tumor cells <i>in vitro</i>. These results identify a new mechanism of eIF3-mediated translation control that can aid T cell engineering for immunotherapy applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential regulation of prelimbic and thalamic transmission to the basolateral amygdala by acetylcholine receptors</a></h4>

              
                The amygdalar anterior basolateral nucleus (BLa) plays a vital role in emotional behaviors. This region receives dense cholinergic projections from basal forebrain which are critical in regulating neuronal activity and synaptic transmission. Cholinergic signaling in BLa is thought to occur through both a slow mode of volume transmission as well as a rapid, phasic mode. However, the relative effect of each mode of signaling in BLa is not understood. Here, we used electrophysiology and optogenetics in mouse brain slices to compare regulation of afferent input from cortex and thalamus to the BLa by these two modes of transmission. Phasic ACh release evoked by single pulse stimulation of cholinergic terminals had a biphasic effect on glutamatergic transmission at cortical input, producing rapid nicotinic receptor-mediated facilitation followed by slower muscarinic receptor (mAChR)-mediated depression. In contrast, tonic elevation of ACh through application of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine suppressed glutamatergic transmission at cortical inputs through mAChRs only. This suppression was not observed at thalamic inputs to BLa. In agreement with this pathway-specificity, the mAChR agonist, muscarine more potently suppressed transmission at inputs from prelimbic cortex (PL) than thalamus. Muscarinic inhibition at PL input was dependent on presynaptic M4 mAChRs, while at thalamic input it depended upon M3 mAChR-mediated stimulation of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Muscarinic inhibition at both pathways was frequency-dependent, allowing only high frequency activity to pass. These findings demonstrate complex cholinergic regulation of afferent input to BLa that depends upon the mode of ACh release and is both pathway specific and frequency dependent.

                Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation is a posttranslational modification involved in key regulatory events catalyzed by ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs). Substrate identification and localization of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP12 at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) hinted at the involvement of ARTs in intracellular traffic. We find that Golgin-97, a TGN protein required for the formation and...

     alt="Structural analysis of the microglia–interneuron interactions in the CA1 hippocampal area of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease"/>
<p>This study provides new insights into the structural interactions between microglia and two types of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons defined by expression of parvalbumin or somatostatin. We report a high level of structural interactions between microglia and both types of interneurons, with cell-type-specific differences in contact location and interaction area. Furthermore, these interactions were preserved in the APP/PS1 mouse model of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD), suggesting that physical interactions between microglia and interneurons remain stable. However, the fraction of microglia contacts onto interneuron dendrites was significantly decreased, indicating that, under AD-like conditions, the somatic control of interneurons by microglia becomes more functionally relevant and may control the firing behavior of interneurons to maintain the network inhibition/excitation balance.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia can interact with glutamatergic neurons and, through control of synaptic elements, regulate their physiological function. Much less is known about the partnership between microglia and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Here, we compared the interactions between microglia and parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SOM+) expressing interneurons in the CA1 hippocampal area of APP/PS1 transgenic mice that mimic certain aspects of the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We first uncovered a high level of interactions between microglia and two types of interneurons, with 98% of SOM+ and 90% of PV+ cells receiving different types of putative microglial contacts. The latter included the microglia soma to the interneuron soma (Soma<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub>), the microglia process to the interneuron soma (Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub>) and the microglia process to the interneuron dendrite (Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Dend<sub>IN</sub>) interactions. Moreover, we found significantly larger areas of interaction for the Soma<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub> and the Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Dend<sub>IN</sub> type of contacts between microglia and SOM+ cells. In contrast, PV+ cells exhibited larger areas for the Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub> interactions. Second, in APP/PS1 mice, although the overall microglia interactions with interneurons remained preserved, the fraction of interneurons receiving putative microglia contacts on their dendrites was reduced, and larger areas of interactions were observed for somatic contacts, suggesting a stronger modulation of the interneuron output by microglia in AD. In summary, these results reveal microglia as important partners of hippocampal PV+ and SOM+ GABAergic cells, with interneuron type-specific pattern of interactions. Thus, microglia may play an essential role in the operation of interneurons under normal conditions and their dysfunction in disease.</p>

                <p>by Nik J. Cunniffe, Nick P. Taylor, Frédéric M. Hamelin, Michael J. Jeger</p>

Many plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors. Transmission can be described as persistent or non-persistent depending on rates of acquisition, retention, and inoculation of virus. Much experimental evidence has accumulated indicating vectors can prefer to settle and/or feed on infected versus noninfected host plants. For persistent transmission, vector preference can also be conditional, depending on the vector’s own infection status. Since viruses can alter host plant quality as a resource for feeding, infection potentially also affects vector population dynamics. Here we use mathematical modelling to develop a theoretical framework addressing the effects of vector preferences for landing, settling and feeding–as well as potential effects of infection on vector population density–on plant virus epidemics. We explore the consequences of preferences that depend on the host (infected or healthy) and vector (viruliferous or nonviruliferous) phenotypes, and how this is affected by the form of transmission, persistent or non-persistent. We show how different components of vector preference have characteristic effects on both the basic reproduction number and the final incidence of disease. We also show how vector preference can induce bistability, in which the virus is able to persist even when it cannot invade from very low densities. Feedbacks between plant infection status, vector population dynamics and virus transmission potentially lead to very complex dynamics, including sustained oscillations. Our work is supported by an interactive interface https://plantdiseasevectorpreference.herokuapp.com/. Our model reiterates the importance of coupling virus infection to vector behaviour, life history and population dynamics to fully understand plant virus epidemics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Realistic retinal modeling unravels the differential role of excitation and inhibition to starburst amacrine cells in direction selectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elishai Ezra-Tsur, Oren Amsalem, Lea Ankri, Pritish Patil, Idan Segev, Michal Rivlin-Etzion</p>

Retinal direction-selectivity originates in starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which display a centrifugal preference, responding with greater depolarization to a stimulus expanding from soma to dendrites than to a collapsing stimulus. Various mechanisms were hypothesized to underlie SAC centrifugal preference, but dissociating them is experimentally challenging and the mechanisms remain debatable. To address this issue, we developed the Retinal Stimulation Modeling Environment (RSME), a multifaceted data-driven retinal model that encompasses detailed neuronal morphology and biophysical properties, retina-tailored connectivity scheme and visual input. Using a genetic algorithm, we demonstrated that spatiotemporally diverse excitatory inputs–sustained in the proximal and transient in the distal processes–are sufficient to generate experimentally validated centrifugal preference in a single SAC. Reversing these input kinetics did not produce any centrifugal-preferring SAC. We then explored the contribution of SAC-SAC inhibitory connections in establishing the centrifugal preference. SAC inhibitory network enhanced the centrifugal preference, but failed to generate it in its absence. Embedding a direction selective ganglion cell (DSGC) in a SAC network showed that the known SAC-DSGC asymmetric connectivity by itself produces direction selectivity. Still, this selectivity is sharpened in a centrifugal-preferring SAC network. Finally, we use RSME to demonstrate the contribution of SAC-SAC inhibitory connections in mediating direction selectivity and recapitulate recent experimental findings. Thus, using RSME, we obtained a mechanistic understanding of SACs’ centrifugal preference and its contribution to direction selectivity.

                <p>by Chiara Gastaldi, Tilo Schwalger, Emanuela De Falco, Rodrigo Quian Quiroga, Wulfram Gerstner</p>

Assemblies of neurons, called concepts cells, encode acquired concepts in human Medial Temporal Lobe. Those concept cells that are shared between two assemblies have been hypothesized to encode associations between concepts. Here we test this hypothesis in a computational model of attractor neural networks. We find that for concepts encoded in sparse neural assemblies there is a minimal fraction <i>c</i><sub>min</sub> of neurons shared between assemblies below which associations cannot be reliably implemented; and a maximal fraction <i>c</i><sub>max</sub> of shared neurons above which single concepts can no longer be retrieved. In the presence of a periodically modulated background signal, such as hippocampal oscillations, recall takes the form of association chains reminiscent of those postulated by theories of free recall of words. Predictions of an iterative overlap-generating model match experimental data on the number of concepts to which a neuron responds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Unsupervised discovery of dynamic cell phenotypic states from transmitted light movies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Phuc Nguyen, Sylvia Chien, Jin Dai, Raymond J. Monnat Jr, Pamela S. Becker, Hao Yuan Kueh</p>

Identification of cell phenotypic states within heterogeneous populations, along with elucidation of their switching dynamics, is a central challenge in modern biology. Conventional single-cell analysis methods typically provide only indirect, static phenotypic readouts. Transmitted light images, on the other hand, provide direct morphological readouts and can be acquired over time to provide a rich data source for dynamic cell phenotypic state identification. Here, we describe an end-to-end deep learning platform, UPSIDE (Unsupervised Phenotypic State IDEntification), for discovering cell states and their dynamics from transmitted light movies. UPSIDE uses the variational auto-encoder architecture to learn latent cell representations, which are then clustered for state identification, decoded for feature interpretation, and linked across movie frames for transition rate inference. Using UPSIDE, we identified distinct blood cell types in a heterogeneous dataset. We then analyzed movies of patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells, from which we identified stem-cell associated morphological states as well as the transition rates to and from these states. UPSIDE opens up the use of transmitted light movies for systematic exploration of cell state heterogeneity and dynamics in biology and medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Ultradian rhythms of AKT phosphorylation and gene expression emerge in the absence of the circadian clock components Per1 and Per2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rona Aviram, Vaishnavi Dandavate, Gal Manella, Marina Golik, Gad Asher</p>

Rhythmicity of biological processes can be elicited either in response to environmental cycles or driven by endogenous oscillators. In mammals, the circadian clock drives about 24-hour rhythms of multitude metabolic and physiological processes in anticipation to environmental daily oscillations. Also at the intersection of environment and metabolism is the protein kinase—AKT. It conveys extracellular signals, primarily feeding-related signals, to regulate various key cellular functions. Previous studies in mice identified rhythmicity in AKT activation (pAKT) with elevated levels in the fed state. However, it is still unknown whether rhythmic AKT activation can be driven through intrinsic mechanisms. Here, we inspected temporal changes in pAKT levels both in cultured cells and animal models. In cultured cells, pAKT levels showed circadian oscillations similar to those observed in livers of wild-type mice under free-running conditions. Unexpectedly, in livers of <i>Per1</i>,<i>2</i><sup>−/−</sup> but not of <i>Bmal1</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice we detected ultradian (about 16 hours) oscillations of pAKT levels. Importantly, the liver transcriptome of <i>Per1</i>,<i>2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice also showed ultradian rhythms, corresponding to pAKT rhythmicity and consisting of AKT-related genes and regulators. Overall, our findings reveal ultradian rhythms in liver gene expression and AKT phosphorylation that emerge in the absence of environmental rhythms and <i>Per1</i>,<i>2</i><sup>−/−</sup> genes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Fatigue is a frequent and severe symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its pathophysiological origin remains incompletely understood. We aimed to examine the predictive value of subcortical gray matter volumes for fatigue severity at disease onset and after four years by applying structural equation modeling (SEM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multi-center cohort study included 601 treatment-naive MS patients after the first demyelinating event. All patients underwent a standardized 3T MRI protocol. A subgroup of 230 patients with available clinical follow-up data after four years was also analyzed. Associations of subcortical volumes (included into SEM) with MS-related fatigue were studied regarding their predictive value. In addition, subcortical regions that have a central role in the brain network (hubs) were determined through structural covariance network (SCN) analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Predictive causal modeling identified volumes of the caudate (s [standardized path coefficient]=0.763, p=0.003 [left]; s=0.755, p=0.006 [right]), putamen (s=0.614, p=0.002 [left]; s=0.606, p=0.003 [right]) and pallidum (s=0.606, p=0.012 [left]; s=0.606, p=0.012 [right]) as prognostic factors for fatigue severity in the cross-sectional cohort. Moreover, the volume of the pons was additionally predictive for fatigue severity in the longitudinal cohort (s=0.605, p=0.013). In the SCN analysis, network hubs in patients with fatigue worsening were detected in the putamen (p=0.008 [left]; p=0.007 [right]) and pons (p=0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We unveiled predictive associations of specific subcortical gray matter volumes with fatigue in an early and initially untreated MS cohort. The colocalization of these subcortical structures with network hubs suggests an early role of these brain regions in terms of fatigue evolution.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bisphosphonate drugs have actions in the lung and inhibit the mevalonate pathway in alveolar macrophages</a></h4>

              
                Bisphosphonates drugs target the skeleton and are used globally for the treatment of common bone disorders. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates act by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in bone-resorbing osteoclasts but, surprisingly, also appear to reduce the risk of death from pneumonia. We overturn the long-held belief that these drugs act only in the skeleton and show that a fluorescently labelled bisphosphonate is internalised by alveolar macrophages and large peritoneal macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, a single dose of a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in mice was sufficient to inhibit the mevalonate pathway in tissue-resident macrophages, causing the build-up of a mevalonate metabolite and preventing protein prenylation. Importantly, one dose of bisphosphonate enhanced the immune response to bacterial endotoxin in the lung and increased the level of cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar fluid. These studies suggest that bisphosphonates, as well as preventing bone loss, may boost immune responses to infection in the lung and provide a mechanistic basis to fully examine the potential of bisphosphonates to help combat respiratory infections that cause pneumonia.

                A fundamental unit of neural computation is the action potential. While significant advances have been made in the ability to sample action potentials of large numbers of individual neurons in animal models, translation of these methodologies to humans has been lacking due to clinical time constraints, electrical noise in the operating room, and reliability of the methodology. Here we present a reliable method for intraoperative recording of dozens of neurons in humans using the Neuropixels probe, yielding up to ~100 simultaneously-recorded single-units (n=596 across 11 recordings in 8 participants). Most single-units were active within 1 minute of reaching target depth, compatible with clinical time constraints. Cell pairs active close in time were spatially closer in most recordings, demonstrating the power to resolve complex cortical dynamics. Altogether, this approach provides access to population single-unit activity across the depth of human neocortex at scales previously only accessible in animal models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Information encoded in volumes and areas of dendritic spines is nearly maximal across mammalian brains</a></h4>

              
                Long-term information associated with neuronal memory resides in dendritic spines. However, spines can have a limited size due to metabolic and neuroanatomical constraints, which should effectively limit the amount of encoded information in excitatory synapses. This study investigates how much information can be stored in the sizes of dendritic spines, and whether is it optimal in any sense? It is shown here, using empirical data for several mammalian brains across different regions and physiological conditions, that dendritic spines nearly maximize entropy contained in their volumes and surface areas for a given mean size. This result is essentially independent of the type of a fitting distribution to size data, as both short- and heavy-tailed distributions yield similar nearly 100 % information efficiency in the majority of cases, although heavy-tailed distributions slightly better fit the data. On average, the highest information is contained in spine volume, and the lowest in spine length or spine head diameter. Depending on a species and brain region, a typical spine can encode between 6.1 and 10.8 bits of information in its volume, and 3.1-8.1 bits in its surface area. Our results suggest a universality of entropy maximization in spine volumes and areas, which can be a new principle of memory storing in synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Properties and proximity proteomics of synaptopodin provide insight into the molecular organization of the spine apparatus of dendritic spines</a></h4>

              
                The spine apparatus is a specialization of the neuronal ER in dendritic spines consisting of stacks of interconnected cisterns separated by a dense matrix. Synaptopodin, a specific actin binding protein of the spine apparatus, is essential for its formation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We show that synaptopodin, when expressed in fibroblasts, forms actin-rich structures with connections to the ER, and that an ER-tethered synaptopodin assembles into liquid condensates. We also identified protein neighbors of synaptopodin in spines by in vivo proximity biotinylation. We validated a small subset of such proteins and showed that they co-assemble with synaptopodin in living cells. One of them is Pdlim7, an actin binding protein not previously identified in spines, and we show its precise colocalization with synaptopodin. We suggest that the matrix of the spine apparatus has the property of a liquid protein condensate generated by a multiplicity of low affinity interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Map-independent representation of an aggression-promoting social cue in the main olfactory pathway</a></h4>

              
                While the olfactory system is required for proper social behaviors, the molecular basis for how social cues are detected via the main olfactory pathway of mammals is not well-characterized. Trimethylamine is a volatile, sex-specific odor found in adult male mouse urine that selectively activates main olfactory sensory neurons that express trace amine-associated receptor 5 (TAAR5). Here we show that trimethylamine, acting via TAAR5, elicits state-dependent attraction or aversion in male mice and drives inter-male aggression. Genetic knockout of TAAR5 significantly reduces aggression-related behaviors, while adding trimethylamine augments aggressive behavior towards juvenile males. We further show that transgenic expression of TAAR5 specifically in olfactory sensory neurons rescues aggressive behaviors in knockout mice, despite extensive remapping of TAAR5 projections to the olfactory bulb. Our results identify a specific main olfactory input that detects a prominent male-specific odor to induce inter-male aggression in a mammalian species and reveal that apparently innate behavioral responses are independent of patterned glomerular input to the olfactory bulb.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic inhibition of the dorsal hippocampus CA3 region during early-stage cocaine-memory reconsolidation disrupts subsequent context-induced cocaine seeking in rats</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is key to the long-term maintenance of cocaine memories following retrieval-induced memory destabilization; even though, it is not the site of protein synthesis-dependent memory reconsolidation. Here, we took advantage of the temporal and spatial specificity of an optogenetic manipulation to examine the role of the cornu ammonis 3 subregion of the DH (dCA3) in early-stage cocaine-memory reconsolidation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats expressing eNpHR3.0 in the DH were trained to self-administer cocaine in a distinct context and underwent extinction training in a different context. Rats then received a 15-min memory-reactivation session, to destabilize cocaine memories and trigger reconsolidation, or remained in their home cages (no-reactivation controls). Optogenetic inhibition of the dCA3 for 1 h immediately, but not 1 h, after memory reactivation resulted in cocaine-memory impairment as indicated by reduction in drug-seeking behavior selectively in the cocaine-paired context 3 d later, at test, relative to responding in no-inhibition, no-reactivation, and no-eNpHR3.0 controls. Cocaine-memory impairment was associated with reduced c-Fos expression, an index of neuronal activation, in the dCA3 stratum lucidum (SL) and stratum pyramidale (SP) at test. Based on these observations and extant literature, we postulate that recurrent circuits in the SP are activated during early-stage memory reconsolidation to maintain labile cocaine memories prior to protein synthesis-dependent restabilization in another brain region, such as the basolateral amygdala. Furthermore, SL and SP interneurons may enhance memory reconsolidation by limiting synaptic noise in the SP and also contribute to recall as elements of the updated cocaine engram or retrieval links.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BDNF-induced BDNF release mediates presynaptic LTP and is regulated by cannabinoids</a></h4>

              
                Although brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its effector, Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), are implicated in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal input region that expresses uniquely high levels of BDNF, repetitive activation of mossy cells (MCs) induces a presynaptic, BDNF/TrkB-dependent form of LTP at MC to granule cell (GC) synapses. Here, we report that activity-induced BDNF release from MC axons in mice elicits postsynaptic BDNF release in a TrkB- and calcium-dependent manner, and that BDNF-induced BDNF release is essential for LTP induction. Suppression of BDNF release by tonic and phasic activity of presynaptic type-1 cannabinoid receptors dampened LTP, revealing an unprecedented role of these receptors in controlling neuropeptide release. Lastly, BDNF-mediated MC-GC LTP can be elicited in vivo. Thus, BDNF-induced BDNF release emerges as a mechanism for activity-dependent LTP that may contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prolactin action is necessary for parental behavior in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Parental care is critical for successful reproduction in mammals. In comparison to maternal care, the neuroendocrine mechanisms supporting paternal care are less well-studied. Laboratory mice show a mating-induced suppression of infanticide (normally observed in virgins) and onset of paternal behavior. Using this model, we sought to investigate whether the hormone prolactin plays a role in paternal behavior, as it does for maternal behavior. First, using c-fos immunoreactivity in Prlr-IRES-Cre-tdtomato reporter mouse sires, we show that the circuitry activated during paternal interactions contains prolactin-responsive neurons, including the medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and medial amygdala. To evaluate whether prolactin action is required for the establishment and display of paternal behavior, we conditionally deleted the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from 3 distinct cell types: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and CaMKII-expressing forebrain neurons. Prlr-deletion from CaMKII-expressing forebrain neurons, but not from glutamatergic or GABAergic cells, resulted in a profound effect on paternal behavior, as none of these males completed the pup retrieval task. Finally, although sires do not show an acute increase in circulating prolactin levels in response to pups, pharmacological blockade of prolactin-release at the time of pup exposure resulted in failure to retrieve pups, similar to when the Prlr was deleted from CaMKII neurons, with prolactin administration rescuing this behavior. Taken together, our data show that paternal behavior in sires is dependent on basal levels of circulating prolactin acting at the Prlr on CaMKII-expressing neurons. These new data in male mice demonstrate that prolactin has a similar action in both sexes to promote parental care.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical glutamatergic projection neuron types contribute to distinct functional subnetworks</a></h4>

              
                The cellular basis of cerebral cortex functional architecture remains not well understood. A major challenge is to monitor and decipher neural network dynamics across broad cortical areas yet with projection neuron (PN) type resolution in real time during behavior. Combining genetic targeting and wide-field imaging, we monitored activity dynamics of subcortical-projecting (PTFezf2) and intratelencephalic-projecting (ITPlxnD1) types across dorsal cortex of mice during multiple brain states and behaviors. ITPlxnD1 and PTFezf2 showed distinct activation patterns during wakeful resting, spontaneous movements, and upon sensory stimulation. Distinct ITPlxnD1 and PTFezf2 subnetworks dynamically tuned to different sensorimotor components of a naturalistic feeding behavior, and optogenetic inhibition of subnetwork nodes disrupted specific behavioral components. ITPlxnD1 and PTFezf2 projection patterns supported their subnetwork activation patterns. Our results suggest that, in addition to the concept of columnar organization, dynamic areal and PN type-specific subnetworks is a key feature of cortical functional architecture linking microcircuit components with global brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A meta-analysis of task-based differences in bilingual L1 and L2 language networks</a></h4>

              
                The functional organization of first (L1) and second (L2) language processing in bilinguals remains a topic of great interest to the neurolinguistics community. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies report meaningful differences in the location and extent of hemodynamic changes between tasks performed in the L1 and L2, yet there is no consensus on whether these networks can be considered truly distinct. In part, this may be due to the multiplicity of task designs implemented in such studies, which complicates the interpretation of their findings. This paper compares the results of previous bilingual meta-analyses to a new ALE meta-analysis that categorizes neuroimaging studies by task design. Factors such as the age of L2 acquisition (AoA) and the L2 language proficiency level of participants are also considered. The findings support previous accounts of the effect of participant characteristics on linguistic processing, while at the same time revealing dissociable differences in fMRI activation for L1 and L2 networks within and across tasks that appear independent of these external factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Narcolepsy and the Dissociation of REM Sleep and Cataplexy through Ambient Temperature Manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Narcolepsy is characterized by increased REM sleep propensity and cataplexy. Although narcolepsy is caused by the selective loss or dysfunction of hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons within the lateral hypothalamus (LH), mechanisms underlying REM sleep propensity and cataplexy remain to be elucidated. We have recently shown that wild type (WT) mice increase REM sleep expression when exposed to thermoneutral ambient temperature (Ta) warming during the light (inactive) phase. We hypothesized that the loss of Hcrt may lead to exaggerated responses with respect to increased REM sleep and cataplexy during Ta warming. To test this hypothesis, Hcrt-KO mice were implanted for chronic sleep recordings and housed in a temperature-controlled cabinet. Sleep-wake expression and both spontaneous cataplexy and food-elicited cataplexy were evaluated at constant Ta and during a Ta manipulation protocol. Here we show several unexpected findings. First, Hcrt-KO mice show opposite circadian patterns with respect to REM sleep responsiveness to thermoneutral Ta warming compared to WT mice. As previously demonstrated, WT mice increased REM sleep when Ta warming is presented during the inactive (light) phase, whereas Hcrt-KO showed a significant decrease in REM sleep expression. In contrast, Hcrt-KO mice increased REM sleep expression upon exposure to Ta warming when presented during the active (dark) phase, a circadian time when WT mice showed no significant changes in REM sleep as a function of Ta. Second, we found that REM sleep and cataplexy can be dissociated through Ta manipulation. Specifically, although Ta warming significantly increased REM sleep expression in Hcrt-KO mice during the active phase, cataplexy bout number and total cataplexy duration significantly decreased. In contrast, cataplexy expression was favoured during Ta cooling when REM sleep expression significantly decreased. Finally, video actigraphy and sleep-wake recordings in Hcrt-KO mice demonstrated that Ta manipulation did not significantly alter waking motor activity patterns or waking or NREM sleep durations. These data suggest that neural circuits gating REM sleep and cataplexy expression can be dissociated with Ta manipulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception and propagation of activity through the cortical hierarchy is determined by neural variability</a></h4>

              
                The brains of higher organisms are composed of anatomically and functionally distinct regions performing specialised tasks; but regions do not operate in isolation. Orchestration of complex behaviours requires communication between brain regions, but how neural activity dynamics are organised to facilitate reliable transmission is not well understood. We studied this process directly by generating neural activity that propagates between brain regions and drives behaviour, allowing us to assess how populations of neurons in sensory cortex cooperate to transmit information. We achieved this by imaging two hierarchically organised and densely interconnected regions, the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (S1 and S2) in mice while performing two-photon photostimulation of S1 neurons and assigning behavioural salience to the photostimulation. We found that the probability of perception is determined not only by the strength of the photostimulation signal, but also by the variability of S1 neural activity. Therefore, maximising the signal-to-noise ratio of the stimulus representation in cortex is critical to its continued propagation downstream. Further, we show that propagated, behaviourally salient activity elicits balanced, persistent, and generalised activation of the downstream region. Hence, our work adds to existing understanding of cortical function by identifying how population activity is formatted to ensure robust transmission of information, allowing specialised brain regions to communicate and coordinate behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excitatory effect of biphasic kHz field stimulation on CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices</a></h4>

              
                Background: Electrical stimulation in the kilohertz-frequency range has been successfully used for treatment of various neurological disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying this stimulation are poorly understood. Objective: To study the effect of kilohertz-frequency electric fields on neuronal membrane biophysics we developed a reliable experimental method to measure responses of single neurons to kilohertz field stimulation in brain slice preparations. Methods: In the submerged brain slice pyramidal neurons of the CA1 subfield were recorded in the whole-cell configuration before, during and after stimulation with an external electric field at 2kHz, 5kHz or 10 kHz. Results: Reproducible excitatory changes in rheobase and spontaneous firing were elicited during kHz-field application at all stimulating frequencies. The rheobase only decreased and spontaneous firing either was initiated in silent neurons or became more intense in previously spontaneously active neurons. Response thresholds were higher at higher frequencies. Blockade of glutamatergic synaptic transmission did not alter the magnitude of responses. Inhibitory synaptic input was not changed by kilohertz field stimulation. Conclusion: kHz-frequency current applied in brain tissue has an excitatory effect on pyramidal neurons during stimulation. This effect is more prominent and occurs at a lower stimulus intensity at a frequency of 2kHz as compared to 5kHz and 10kHz.

                The evolution of species involves changes in the timeline of key developmental programs. Among these, neuronal development is considerably prolonged in the human cerebral cortex compared with other mammals, leading to brain neoteny. Here we explore whether mitochondria influence the species-specific properties of cortical neuron maturation. By comparing human and mouse cortical neuronal maturation at high temporal and cell resolution, we found a slower pattern of mitochondria development in human cortical neurons compared with the mouse, together with lower mitochondria metabolic activity, particularly oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation of mitochondria metabolism in human neurons resulted in accelerated maturation, leading to excitable and complex cells weeks ahead of time. Our data identify mitochondria as important regulators of the pace of neuronal development underlying human-specific features of brain evolution.

                Biological aging is the strongest factor associated with the clinical phenotype of multiple sclerosis (MS). Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) typically presents in the third or fourth decade, while the mean age of presentation of progressive MS (pMS) is 45 years old. Here we show that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), induced by the adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic CD4+ Th17 cells, is more severe, and less like to remit, in middle-aged compared with young adult mice. Donor T cells and neutrophils are more abundant, while B cells are relatively sparse, in central nervous system (CNS) infiltrates of the older mice. Experiments with reciprocal bone marrow chimeras demonstrate that radio-resistant, non-hematopoietic cells play a dominant role in shaping age-related features of the neuroinflammatory response, as well as the clinical course, during EAE. Reminiscent of pMS, EAE in middle-aged adoptive transfer recipients is characterized by widespread microglial activation. Microglia from older mice express a distinctive transcriptomic profile, suggestive of enhanced chemokine synthesis and antigen presentation. Collectively, our findings suggest that drugs that suppress microglial activation, and acquisition or expression of aging-associated properties, may be beneficial in the treatment of progressive forms of inflammatory demyelinating disease.

                Individuals who have Down syndrome (trisomy 21) are at greatly increased risk of developing Alzheimers disease - dementia. Alzheimers disease is characterised by the accumulation in the brain of amyloid-{beta} plaques that are a product of amyloid precursor protein, encoded by the APP gene on chromosome 21. In Down syndrome the first site of amyloid-{beta} accumulation is within endosomes and changes to endosome biology occur early in disease. Here we determine if primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from two mouse models of Down syndrome can be used to study endosome and APP cell biology. We report that in these cellular models of Down syndrome endosome number, size and APP processing are not altered, likely because APP is not dosage sensitive in these models, despite three copies of App .

<p>Glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I–II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. Based on dendritic morphology, we divided them into three and six groups in laminae I–II and III–IV, respectively. At least one type of neurons in laminae III–IV may project its axon into laminae I–II. We also provided experimental evidence indicating that there are glycine-only neurons and axon terminals in laminae I–II. The glycine-only neurons may express retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor β and/or receptor tyrosine kinase Ret, but there might be other neurochemical markers that are still awaiting identification.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A growing body of experimental evidence shows that glycinergic inhibition plays vital roles in spinal pain processing. In spite of this, however, our knowledge about the morphology, neurochemical characteristics, and synaptic relations of glycinergic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn is very limited. The lack of this knowledge makes our understanding about the specific contribution of glycinergic neurons to spinal pain processing quite vague. Here we investigated the morphology and neurochemical characteristics of glycinergic neurons in laminae I–IV of the spinal dorsal horn using a GlyT2::CreERT2-tdTomato transgenic mouse line. Confirming previous reports, we show that glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I–II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. First in the literature, we provide experimental evidence indicating that in addition to neurons in which glycine colocalizes with GABA, there are glycinergic neurons in laminae I–II that do not express GABA and can thus be referred to as glycine-only neurons. According to the shape and size of cell bodies and dendritic morphology, we divided the tdTomato-labeled glycinergic neurons into three and six morphological groups in laminae I–II and laminae III–IV, respectively. We also demonstrate that most of the glycinergic neurons co-express neuronal nitric oxide synthase, parvalbumin, the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, and the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor β (RORβ), but there might be others that need further neurochemical characterization. The present findings may foster our understanding about the contribution of glycinergic inhibition to spinal pain processing.</p>

     alt="The effects of orexin-A and orexin receptors on anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in a male rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder"/>
<p>Single prolonged stress (SPS) rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. SPS reduced the expression levels of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and increased the expression levels of OX1R in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Moreover, the intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated anxiety-like behaviors, improved the reduction of locomotor activity in SPS rats, and partly restored OX1R levels in the mPFC. Therefore, the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in post-traumatic stress disorder.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Orexin neurons play an important role in stress-related mental disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety- and depression-related symptoms commonly occur in combination with PTSD. However, the role of the orexin system in mediating alterations in these affective symptoms remains unclear. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. In the present study, we investigated anxiety- and depression-related behavioral changes using the elevated plus maze, the sucrose preference test, and the open field test in male rats with single prolonged stress (SPS) induced-PTSD. The expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the mPFC was detected and quantified by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that the SPS rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. Furthermore, SPS resulted in reductions in the expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and the increased the expression of OX1R in the mPFC. The intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated behavioral changes in SPS rats and partly restored the increased levels of OX1R in the mPFC. These results suggest that the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in PTSD.</p>

     alt="A sex-specific feedback projection from aromatase-expressing neurons in the medial amygdala to the accessory olfactory bulb"/>
<p>Aromatase neurons are distributed in clustered populations primarily in a network of brain regions (red) devoted to social behavior. Out of all potential sources of aromatase neurons, only the ventral medial amygdala projects back to the accessory olfactory bulb. The population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the ventral medial amygdala also expresses ERα and displays two sex differences: (1) aromatase-expressing neurons are larger in females; (2) there are more aromatase-expressing neurons in male mice.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) plays a critical role in classifying pheromonal signals. Here we identify two previously undescribed sources of aromatase signaling in the AOB: (1) a population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the AOB itself; (2) a tract of aromatase-expressing axons which originate in the ventral medial amygdala (MEA) and terminate in the AOB. Using a retrograde tracer in conjunction with a transgenic strategy to label aromatase-expressing neurons throughout the brain, we found that a single contiguous population of neurons in the ventral MEA provides the only significant feedback by aromatase-expressing neurons to the AOB. This population expresses the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and displayed anatomical sex differences in the number of neurons (higher in male mice) and the size of cell bodies (larger in females). Given the previously established relationship between aromatase expression, estrogen signaling, and the function of sexually dimorphic circuits, we suggest that this feedback population is well-positioned to provide neuroendocrine feedback to modulate sensory processing of social stimuli in the AOB.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1, α2, and α3 subunits cause a wide range of disabling neurological disorders, and dysfunction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to neuronal injury in stroke and dementia. To better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is important to determine the expression patterns of the different Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits within the brain and among specific cell types. Using two available scRNA-Seq databases from the adult mouse nervous system, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of the different isoforms of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α, β and <i>Fxyd</i> subunits at the single-cell level among brain regions and various neuronal populations. We subsequently identified specific types of neurons enriched with transcripts for α1 and α3 isoforms and elaborated how α3-expressing neuronal populations govern cerebellar neuronal circuits. We further analyzed the co-expression network for α1 and α3 isoforms, highlighting the genes that positively correlated with α1 and α3 expression. The top 10 genes for α1 were <i>Chn2</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Selm</i>, <i>Kcnc1</i>, <i>Snrk</i>, <i>Snap25</i>, <i>Ckb</i> and <i>Ccndbp1</i> and for α3 were <i>Sorcs3</i>, <i>Eml5</i>, <i>Neurod2</i>, <i>Ckb</i>, <i>Tbc1d4</i>, <i>Ptprz1</i>, <i>Pvrl1</i>, <i>Kirrel3</i>, <i>Pvalb</i>, and <i>Asic2</i>.</p>

     alt="Constitutive tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-deficiency causes a reduction in spine density in mouse dentate granule cells accompanied by homeostatic adaptations of spine head size"/>
<p>TNF plays a role in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the CNS. To investigate whether constitutive TNF-deficiency affects the number and geometry of dendritic spines, dentate granule cells of TNF-deficient mice and controls were intracellularly filled and immunolabeled for the plasticity-related protein Synaptopodin (SP), which marks strong and stable spines. Spine head area, density, presence of SP and SP cluster size were analyzed blindly. Constitutively TNF-deficient granule cells had ∼20% fewer spines compared to controls and exhibited a homeostatic increase in head size of large SP+ spines. These changes are similar to those reported after entorhinal denervation of granule cells.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The majority of excitatory synapses terminating on cortical neurons are found on dendritic spines. The geometry of spines, in particular the size of the spine head, tightly correlates with the strength of the excitatory synapse formed with the spine. Under conditions of synaptic plasticity, spine geometry may change, reflecting functional adaptations. Since the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to influence synaptic transmission as well as Hebbian and homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity, we speculated that TNF-deficiency may cause concomitant structural changes at the level of dendritic spines. To address this question, we analyzed spine density and spine head area of Alexa568-filled granule cells in the dentate gyrus of adult C57BL/6J and TNF-deficient (TNF-KO) mice. Tissue sections were double-stained for the actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein synaptopodin (SP), a molecular marker for strong and stable spines. Dendritic segments of TNF-deficient granule cells exhibited ∼20% fewer spines in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus compared to controls, indicating a reduced afferent innervation. Of note, these segments also had larger spines containing larger SP-clusters. This pattern of changes is strikingly similar to the one seen after denervation-associated spine loss following experimental entorhinal denervation of granule cells: Denervated granule cells increase the SP-content and strength of their remaining spines to homeostatically compensate for those that were lost. Our data suggest a similar compensatory mechanism in TNF-deficient granule cells in response to a reduction in their afferent innervation.</p>

     alt="The complex synaptic pathways onto a looming-detector neuron revealed using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy"/>
<p>We traced two trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons, in separate larval locusts from their synapses with the LGMD1 in the lobula complex (LOX) through the second optic chiasm (OCH2) back into the medulla. In the medulla, we found not only downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron but also a feedback loop with TmA neurons making outputs and receiving inputs.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of locusts to detect looming stimuli and avoid collisions or predators depends on a neuronal circuit in the locust's optic lobe. Although comprehensively studied for over three decades, there are still major questions about the computational steps of this circuit. We used fourth instar larvae of <i>Locusta migratoria</i> to describe the connection between the lobula giant movement detector 1 (LGMD1) neuron in the lobula complex and the upstream neuropil, the medulla. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the connecting neurons termed trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons and their synaptic connectivity. This enabled us to trace neurons over several hundred micrometers between the medulla and the lobula complex while identifying their synapses. We traced two different TmA neurons, each from a different individual, from their synapses with the LGMD in the lobula complex up into the medulla and describe their synaptic relationships. There is not a simple downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron onto these TmA neurons; there is also a feedback loop in place with TmA neurons making outputs as well as receiving inputs. More than one type of neuron shapes the signal of the TmA neurons in the medulla. We found both columnar and trans-columnar neurons connected with the traced TmA neurons in the medulla. These findings indicate that there are computational steps in the medulla that have not been included in models of the neuronal pathway for looming detection.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic distribution and inferior colliculus projection pattern of inhibitory and excitatory cell types in the lateral superior olive of Mongolian gerbils"/>
<p>In situ hybridization was used to identify inhibitory and excitatory principal neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) of Mongolian gerbil. Inhibitory LSO neurons were less numerous and projected contralaterally. One third of excitatory neurons projected ipsilaterally and were biased to the low-frequency limb of the LSO. This projection appears species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sound localization critically relies on brainstem neurons that compare information from the two ears. The conventional role of the lateral superior olive (LSO) is extraction of intensity differences; however, it is increasingly clear that relative timing, especially of transients, is also an important function. Cellular diversity within the LSO that is not well understood may underlie its multiple roles. There are glycinergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory principal neurons in the LSO, however, there is some disagreement regarding their relative distribution and projection pattern. Here we employ in situ hybridization to definitively identify transmitter types combined with retrograde labeling of projections to the inferior colliculus (IC) to address these questions. Excitatory LSO neurons were more numerous (76%) than inhibitory ones. A smaller proportion of inhibitory neurons were IC-projecting (45% vs. 64% for excitatory) suggesting that inhibitory LSO neurons may have more projections to other regions such the lateral lemniscus or more distributed IC projections. Inhibitory LSO neurons almost exclusively projected ipsilaterally making up a sizeable proportion (41%) of the transmitter type-labeled ipsilateral IC projection from LSO and exhibited a moderate low frequency bias (10% difference H-L). Two thirds of excitatory neurons projected contralaterally and had a slight high frequency bias (4%). One third of excitatory LSO neurons projected ipsilaterally to the IC and these cells were strongly biased toward the low frequency limb of the LSO (37%). This projection appears to be species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing suggesting that it may be a specialization for such ability.</p>

     alt="The RNA-binding protein and stress granule component ATAXIN-2 is expressed in mouse and human tissues associated with glaucoma pathogenesis"/>
<p>The RNA-binding protein Ataxin 2 (ATXN2) is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and vision loss. Retinal ATXN2 is confined to spiking neurons (ganglion cells and amacrine cells) and largely absent from photoreceptors/bipolar cells and glia. Prominent expression in the trabecular meshwork and the ciliary body suggests relevance to glaucoma.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Polyglutamine repeat expansions in the <i>Ataxin-</i>2 (<i>ATXN</i>2) gene were first implicated in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2, a disease associated with degeneration of motor neurons and Purkinje cells. Recent studies linked single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene to elevated intraocular pressure in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG); yet, the localization of ATXN2 across glaucoma-relevant tissues of the vertebrate eye has not been thoroughly examined. This study characterizes ATXN2 expression in the mouse and human retina, and anterior eye, using an antibody validated in ATXN2<sup>−/−</sup> retinas. ATXN2-ir was localized to cytosolic sub compartments in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata and proximal dendrites in addition to GABAergic, glycinergic, and cholinergic amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and displaced amacrine cells. Human, but not mouse retinas showed modest immunolabeling of bipolar cells. ATXN2 immunofluorescence was prominent in the trabecular meshwork and pigmented and nonpigmented cells of the ciliary body, with analyses of primary human trabecular meshwork cells confirming the finding. The expression of ATXN2 in key POAG-relevant ocular tissues supports the potential role in autophagy and stress granule formation in response to ocular hypertension.</p>

<p>The “paintbrush” axon terminals from neurons of the nucleus isthmi parvocellularis (Ipc) exert a powerful boosting effect upon the ascending visual transmission in the optic tectum of birds. Although classically considered a cholinergic nucleus, Ipc neurons in adult chicks express VGLUT2 instead of VAChT. Performing in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in chick embryos, the authors find that both vesicular transporters are strongly expressed in Ipc neurons throughout development, along with other cholinergic markers, but there is a marked decrease in VAChT expression before hatching. Ex vivo deposits of tracer crystals and intracellular fillings reveal that Ipc axons exhibit conspicuous morphological transformations until late in development, suggesting that the presumptive dual vesicular transmitter release might be related to the growing and remodeling of this complex axon.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons can change their classical neurotransmitters during ontogeny, sometimes going through stages of dual release. Here, we explored the development of the neurotransmitter identity of neurons of the avian nucleus isthmi parvocellularis (Ipc), whose axon terminals are retinotopically arranged in the optic tectum (TeO) and exert a focal gating effect upon the ascending transmission of retinal inputs. Although cholinergic and glutamatergic markers are both found in Ipc neurons and terminals of adult pigeons and chicks, the mRNA expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, VAChT, is weak or absent. To explore how the Ipc neurotransmitter identity is established during ontogeny, we analyzed the expression of mRNAs coding for cholinergic (ChAT, VAChT, and CHT) and glutamatergic (VGluT2 and VGluT3) markers in chick embryos at different developmental stages. We found that between E12 and E18, Ipc neurons expressed all cholinergic mRNAs and also VGluT2 mRNA; however, from E16 through posthatch stages, VAChT mRNA expression was specifically diminished. Our ex vivo deposits of tracer crystals and intracellular filling experiments revealed that Ipc axons exhibit a mature paintbrush morphology late in development, experiencing marked morphological transformations during the period of presumptive dual vesicular transmitter release. Additionally, although ChAT protein immunoassays increasingly label the growing Ipc axon, this labeling was consistently restricted to sparse portions of the terminal branches. Combined, these results suggest that the synthesis of glutamate and acetylcholine, and their vesicular release, is complexly linked to the developmental processes of branching, growing and remodeling of these unique axons.</p>

<p>In the common marmoset, detailed morphological analysis of 3D-reconstructed astrocytes residing in vocal production circuits revealed that, in general, cortical astrocytes are structurally more complex than those residing within midbrain regions. We hypothesize that this morphological complexity of cortical astrocytes reflects their function in providing neuronal support or modulation of vocalization.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes, the star-shaped glial cells, are the most abundant non-neuronal cell population in the central nervous system. They play a key role in modulating activities of neural networks, including those involved in complex motor behaviors. Common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus)</i>, the most vocal non-human primate (NHP), have been used to study the physiology of vocalization and social vocal production. However, the neural circuitry involved in vocal production is not fully understood. In addition, even less is known about the involvement of astrocytes in this circuit. To understand the role, that astrocytes may play in the complex behavior of vocalization, the initial step may be to study their structural properties in the cortical and subcortical regions that are known to be involved in vocalization. Here, in the common marmoset, we identify all astrocytic subtypes seen in other primate's brains, including intralaminar astrocytes. In addition, we reveal detailed structural characteristics of astrocytes and perform morphometric analysis of astrocytes residing in the cortex and midbrain regions that are associated with vocal production. We found that cortical astrocytes in these regions illustrate a higher level of complexity when compared to those in the midbrain. We hypothesize that this complexity that is expressed in cortical astrocytes may reflect their functions to meet the metabolic/structural needs of these regions.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hyperglycemia is a comorbidity in 60&ndash;80% of stroke patients; nevertheless, neuroprotective drugs like NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists are typically assessed in normoglycemic animals at the preclinical stage before they are approved to enter clinical trials. Interestingly, as a possible explanation for the translational failure of NMDAR antagonists, it was recently reported that stroke occurring during nighttime causes smaller infarctions in rodents and therefore has a smaller window for neuroprotection. To investigate why stroke occurring during different circadian phases confers a difference in severity, we reanalyzed the published source data and found that some mice that were used in the daytime have higher blood glucose than mice that were used in the nighttime. We then repeated the experiments but found no difference in blood glucose concentration or infarct volume regardless of the circadian phase during which stroke occurs. On the other hand, induction of hyperglycemia by glucose injection reproducibly increased stroke severity. Moreover, although hyperglycemia increases infarction volume, which presumably would provide a larger window for neuroprotection, uncompetitive NMDAR antagonists were unexpectedly found to exacerbate stroke outcome by worsening hyperglycemia. Taken together, our new data and reanalysis of the published source data suggested that blood glucose during stroke, rather than the circadian phase during which stroke occurs, affects the size of the ischemic infarction; moreover, we have revealed drug-induced hyperglycemia as a potential reason for the translational failure of uncompetitive NMDAR antagonists. Future trials for this class of neuroprotective drugs should monitor patients&rsquo; blood glucose at enrollment and exclude hyperglycemic patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The automatic parameter-exploration with a machine-learning-like approach: Powering the evolutionary modeling on the origin of life</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuzhen Liang, Chunwu Yu, Wentao Ma</p>

The origin of life involved complicated evolutionary processes. Computer modeling is a promising way to reveal relevant mechanisms. However, due to the limitation of our knowledge on prebiotic chemistry, it is usually difficult to justify parameter-setting for the modeling. Thus, typically, the studies were conducted in a reverse way: the parameter-space was explored to find those parameter values “supporting” a hypothetical scene (that is, leaving the parameter-justification a later job when sufficient knowledge is available). Exploring the parameter-space manually is an arduous job (especially when the modeling becomes complicated) and additionally, difficult to characterize as regular “Methods” in a paper. Here we show that a machine-learning-like approach may be adopted, automatically optimizing the parameters. With this efficient parameter-exploring approach, the evolutionary modeling on the origin of life would become much more powerful. In particular, based on this, it is expected that more near-reality (complex) models could be introduced, and thereby theoretical research would be more tightly associated with experimental investigation in this field–hopefully leading to significant steps forward in respect to our understanding on the origin of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The quantitative basis for the redistribution of immobile bacterial lipoproteins to division septa</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lara Connolley, Joanna Szczepaniak, Colin Kleanthous, Seán M. Murray</p>

The spatial localisation of proteins is critical for most cellular function. In bacteria, this is typically achieved through capture by established landmark proteins. However, this requires that the protein is diffusive on the appropriate timescale. It is therefore unknown how the localisation of effectively immobile proteins is achieved. Here, we investigate the localisation to the division site of the slowly diffusing lipoprotein Pal, which anchors the outer membrane to the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. While the proton motive force-linked TolQRAB system is known to be required for this repositioning, the underlying mechanism is unresolved, especially given the very low mobility of Pal. We present a quantitative, mathematical model for Pal relocalisation in which dissociation of TolB-Pal complexes, powered by the proton motive force across the inner membrane, leads to the net transport of Pal along the outer membrane and its deposition at the division septum. We fit the model to experimental measurements of protein mobility and successfully test its predictions experimentally against mutant phenotypes. Our model not only explains a key aspect of cell division in Gram-negative bacteria, but also presents a physical mechanism for the transport of low-mobility proteins that may be applicable to multi-membrane organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Motif-pattern dependence of biomolecular phase separation driven by specific interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin G. Weiner, Andrew G. T. Pyo, Yigal Meir, Ned S. Wingreen</p>

Eukaryotic cells partition a wide variety of important materials and processes into biomolecular condensates—phase-separated droplets that lack a membrane. In addition to nonspecific electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions, phase separation also depends on specific binding motifs that link together constituent molecules. Nevertheless, few rules have been established for how these ubiquitous specific, saturating, motif-motif interactions drive phase separation. By integrating Monte Carlo simulations of lattice-polymers with mean-field theory, we show that the sequence of heterotypic binding motifs strongly affects a polymer’s ability to phase separate, influencing both phase boundaries and condensate properties (e.g. viscosity and polymer diffusion). We find that sequences with large blocks of single motifs typically form more inter-polymer bonds, which promotes phase separation. Notably, the sequence of binding motifs influences phase separation primarily by determining the conformational entropy of self-bonding by single polymers. This contrasts with systems where the molecular architecture primarily affects the energy of the dense phase, providing a new entropy-based mechanism for the biological control of phase separation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling CRISPR gene drives for suppression of invasive rodents using a supervised machine learning framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel E. Champer, Nathan Oakes, Ronin Sharma, Pablo García-Díaz, Jackson Champer, Philipp W. Messer</p>

Invasive rodent populations pose a threat to biodiversity across the globe. When confronted with these invaders, native species that evolved independently are often defenseless. CRISPR gene drive systems could provide a solution to this problem by spreading transgenes among invaders that induce population collapse, and could be deployed even where traditional control methods are impractical or prohibitively expensive. Here, we develop a high-fidelity model of an island population of invasive rodents that includes three types of suppression gene drive systems. The individual-based model is spatially explicit, allows for overlapping generations and a fluctuating population size, and includes variables for drive fitness, efficiency, resistance allele formation rate, as well as a variety of ecological parameters. The computational burden of evaluating a model with such a high number of parameters presents a substantial barrier to a comprehensive understanding of its outcome space. We therefore accompany our population model with a meta-model that utilizes supervised machine learning to approximate the outcome space of the underlying model with a high degree of accuracy. This enables us to conduct an exhaustive inquiry of the population model, including variance-based sensitivity analyses using tens of millions of evaluations. Our results suggest that sufficiently capable gene drive systems have the potential to eliminate island populations of rodents under a wide range of demographic assumptions, though only if resistance can be kept to a minimal level. This study highlights the power of supervised machine learning to identify the key parameters and processes that determine the population dynamics of a complex evolutionary system.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is increasing evidence for the important role of gut microbiota (GMB) in the development and progression of neurologic pathologies. Some studies have shown that modifying the microbiome profile can confer benefits to patients. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common occurrence in the general population. Although most patients recover, in a minority, disabling symptoms can persist for several months. We carried out a review of the literature to assess the effect of mTBI on GMB and to determine whether alleviating dysbiosis can improve clinical outcomes in mTBI patients. We performed searches in Medline/PubMed and Embase using the keywords “MTBI” AND “microbiome” OR “microbiota”. Additional articles were identified by manual searches and using the Google search engine. In animal models, a clear perturbation of GMB was reported following TBI and probiotic supplementation (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> or <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>) improved neurologic function. There were no studies on changes in GMB after mTBI in humans; however, pre- or probiotic supplementation reduced the infection rate in patients with severe TBI and shortened the time spent in the intensive care unit without conferring any neurologic benefits. Thus, although the findings from animal models are promising, clinical studies are needed to determine whether therapeutic strategies that restore gut microbiome profile can improve long-term outcomes of patients with mTBI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The associative network of hippocampal CA3 is thought to contribute to rapid formation of contextual memory from one-trial learning, but the network mechanisms underlying decorrelation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 is largely unknown. Kv1.2 expressions in rodent CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) are polarized to distal apical dendrites, and its downregulation specifically enhances dendritic responses to perforant pathway (PP) synaptic inputs. We found that haploinsufficiency of Kv1.2 (<i>Kcna2</i>+/−) in CA3-PCs, but not Kv1.1 (<i>Kcna1</i>+/−), lowers the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) at PP-CA3 synapses, and that the <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice are normal in discrimination of distinct contexts but impaired in discrimination of similar but slightly distinct contexts. We further examined the neuronal ensembles in CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG), which represent the two similar contexts using in situ hybridization of immediate early genes, Homer1a and Arc. The size and overlap of CA3 ensembles activated by the first visit to the similar contexts were not different between wild type and <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice, but these ensemble parameters diverged over training days between genotypes, suggesting that abnormal plastic changes at PP-CA3 synapses of <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice is responsible for the impaired pattern separation. Unlike CA3, DG ensembles were not different between two genotype mice. The DG ensembles were already separated on the first day, and their overlap did not further evolve. Eventually, the <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice exhibited larger CA3 ensemble size and overlap upon retrieval of two contexts, compared to wild type or <i>Kcna1</i>+/− mice. These results suggest that sparse LTP at PP-CA3 synapse probably supervised by mossy fiber inputs is essential for gradual decorrelation of CA3 ensembles.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Induction of Human Motor Cortex Plasticity by Theta Burst Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique with advantages of high spatial precision and ability to target deep brain regions. This study aimed to develop a TUS protocol to effectively induce brain plasticity in human subjects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An 80 s train of theta burst patterned TUS (tbTUS), regularly patterned TUS (rTUS) with the same sonication duration and sham tbTUS were delievered to the motor cortex in healthy subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to examine changes in corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and the site of plasticity induction. The effects of motor cortical tbTUS on a visuo-motor task and the effects of occipital cortex tbTUS on motor cortical excitability were also tested.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The tbTUS produced consistent increase in corticospinal excitability for at least 30 minutes while rTUS and sham tbTUS produced no significant change. tbTUS decreased short-interval intracortical inhibiton and increased intracortical facilitation. The effects of TMS in different current directions suggested that the site of the plastic changes was within the motor cortex. tbTUS to the occipital cortex did not change motor cortical excitability. Motor cortical tbTUS shortened movement time in a visuo-motor task.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>tbTUS is a novel and efficient paradigm to induce cortical plasticity in human. It has the potential to be developed for neuromodulation treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders, and to advance neuroscience research.</p>

                In the gut, coordinated cell interactions regulate tissue repair and immunity. How enteric glial cells (EGCs) mediate these processes remained elusive. In a recent paper, Progatzky et al. demonstrate that EGCs interact with immune and mesothelial cells under homeostasis and helminth infection, revealing an indispensable role of an interferon-γ (IFNγ)-EGC-CXCL10 axis in tissue repair.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial tuning of face part representations within face-selective areas revealed by high-field fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Regions sensitive to specific object categories as well as organized spatial patterns sensitive to different features have been found across the whole ventral temporal cortex (VTC). However, it is unclear that within each object category region, how specific feature representations are organized to support object identification. Would object features, such as object parts, be represented in fine-scale spatial tuning within object category-specific regions? Here, we used high-field 7T fMRI to examine the spatial tuning to different face parts within each face-selective region. Our results show consistent spatial tuning of face parts across individuals that within right posterior fusiform face area (pFFA) and right occipital face area (OFA), the posterior portion of each region was biased to eyes, while the anterior portion was biased to mouth and chin stimuli. Our results demonstrate that within the occipital and fusiform face processing regions, there exist systematic spatial tuning to different face parts that support further computation combining them.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The anterior paired lateral neuron normalizes odour-evoked activity in the Drosophila mushroom body calyx</a></h4>

              
                To identify and memorize discrete but similar environmental inputs, the brain needs to distinguish between subtle differences of activity patterns in defined neuronal populations. The Kenyon cells of the <i>Drosophila </i>adult mushroom body (MB) respond sparsely to complex olfactory input, a property that is thought to support stimuli discrimination in the MB. To understand how this property emerges, we investigated the role of the inhibitory anterior paired lateral neuron (APL) in the input circuit of the MB, the calyx. Within the calyx, presynaptic boutons of projection neurons (PNs) form large synaptic microglomeruli (MGs) with dendrites of postsynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs). Combining EM data analysis and <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging, we show that APL, via inhibitory and reciprocal synapses targeting both PN boutons and KC dendrites, normalizes odour-evoked representations in MGs of the calyx. APL response scales with the PN input strength and is regionalized around PN input distribution. Our data indicate that the formation of a sparse code by the Kenyon cells requires APL-driven normalization of their MG postsynaptic responses. This work provides experimental insights on how inhibition shapes sensory information representation in a higher brain centre, thereby supporting stimuli discrimination and allowing for efficient associative memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular structures and conformations of protocadherin-15 and its complexes on stereocilia elucidated by cryo-electron tomography</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensory transduction (MT), the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, underpins hearing and balance and is carried out within hair cells in the inner ear. Hair cells harbor actin-filled stereocilia, arranged in rows of descending heights, where the tips of stereocilia are connected to their taller neighbors by a filament composed of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), deemed the ‘tip link’. Tension exerted on the tip link opens an ion channel at the tip of the shorter stereocilia, thus converting mechanical force into an electrical signal. While biochemical and structural studies have provided insights into the molecular composition and structure of isolated portions of the tip link, the architecture, location and conformational states of intact tip links, on stereocilia, remains unknown. Here we report <i>in situ</i> cryo-electron microscopy imaging of the tip link in mouse stereocilia. We observe individual PCDH15 molecules at the tip and shaft of stereocilia and determine their stoichiometry, conformational heterogeneity, and their complexes with other filamentous proteins, perhaps including CDH23. The PCDH15 complexes occur in clusters, frequently with more than one copy of PCDH15 at the tip of stereocilia, suggesting that tip links might consist of more than one copy of PCDH15 complexes and, by extension, might include multiple MT complexes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Partial connectomes of labeled dopaminergic circuits reveal non-synaptic communication and axonal remodeling after exposure to cocaine</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic (DA) neurons exert profound influences on behavior including addiction. However, how DA axons communicate with target neurons and how those communications change with drug exposure remains poorly understood. We leverage cell type-specific labeling with large volume serial electron microscopy to detail DA connections in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) before and after exposure to cocaine. We find that individual DA axons contain different varicosity types based on their vesicle contents. Spatially ordering along individual axons further suggests that varicosity types are non-randomly organized. DA axon varicosities rarely make specific synapses (&lt;2%, 6/410), but instead are more likely to form spinule-like structures (15%, 61/410) with neighboring neurons. Days after a brief exposure to cocaine, DA axons were extensively branched relative to controls, formed blind-ended ‘bulbs’ filled with mitochondria, and were surrounded by elaborated glia. Finally, mitochondrial lengths increased by ~2.2 times relative to control only in DA axons and NAc spiny dendrites after cocaine exposure. We conclude that DA axonal transmission is unlikely to be mediated via classical synapses in the NAc and that the major locus of anatomical plasticity of DA circuits after exposure to cocaine are large-scale axonal re-arrangements with correlated changes in mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">aCPSF1 cooperates with terminator U-tract to dictate archaeal transcription termination efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Recently, aCPSF1 was reported to function as the long-sought global transcription termination factor of archaea; however, the working mechanism remains elusive. This work, through analyzing transcript-3′end-sequencing data of <i>Methanococcus maripaludis</i>, found genome-wide positive correlations of both the terminator uridine(U)-tract and aCPSF1 with hierarchical transcription termination efficacies (TTEs). In vitro assays determined that aCPSF1 specifically binds to the terminator U-tract with U-tract number-related binding affinity, and in vivo assays demonstrated the two elements are indispensable in dictating high TTEs, revealing that aCPSF1 and the terminator U-tract cooperatively determine high TTEs. The N-terminal KH domains equip aCPSF1 with specific-binding capacity to terminator U-tract and the aCPSF1-terminator U-tract cooperation; while the nuclease activity of aCPSF1 was also required for TTEs. aCPSF1 also guarantees the terminations of transcripts with weak intrinsic terminator signals. aCPSF1 orthologs from Lokiarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota exhibited similar U-tract cooperation in dictating TTEs. Therefore, aCPSF1 and the intrinsic U-rich terminator could work in a noteworthy two-in-one termination mode in archaea, which may be widely employed by archaeal phyla; using one trans-action factor to recognize U-rich terminator signal and cleave transcript 3′-end, the archaeal aCPSF1-dependent transcription termination may represent a simplified archetypal mode of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II termination machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning developmental mode dynamics from single-cell trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Embryogenesis is a multiscale process during which developmental symmetry breaking transitions give rise to complex multicellular organisms. Recent advances in high-resolution live-cell microscopy provide unprecedented insights into the collective cell dynamics at various stages of embryonic development. This rapid experimental progress poses the theoretical challenge of translating high-dimensional imaging data into predictive low-dimensional models that capture the essential ordering principles governing developmental cell migration in complex geometries. Here, we combine mode decomposition ideas that have proved successful in condensed matter physics and turbulence theory with recent advances in sparse dynamical systems inference to realize a computational framework for learning quantitative continuum models from single-cell imaging data. Considering pan-embryo cell migration during early gastrulation in zebrafish as a widely studied example, we show how cell trajectory data on a curved surface can be coarse-grained and compressed with suitable harmonic basis functions. The resulting low-dimensional representation of the collective cell dynamics enables a compact characterization of developmental symmetry breaking and the direct inference of an interpretable hydrodynamic model, which reveals similarities between pan-embryo cell migration and active Brownian particle dynamics on curved surfaces. Due to its generic conceptual foundation, we expect that mode-based model learning can help advance the quantitative biophysical understanding of a wide range of developmental structure formation processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Delilah, prospero, and D-Pax2 constitute a gene regulatory network essential for the development of functional proprioceptors</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated animal locomotion depends on the development of functional proprioceptors. While early cell-fate determination processes are well characterized, little is known about the terminal differentiation of cells within the proprioceptive lineage and the genetic networks that control them. In this work we describe a gene regulatory network consisting of three transcription factors–Prospero (Pros), D-Pax2, and Delilah (Dei)–that dictates two alternative differentiation programs within the proprioceptive lineage in <i>Drosophila</i>. We show that D-Pax2 and Pros control the differentiation of cap versus scolopale cells in the chordotonal organ lineage by, respectively, activating and repressing the transcription of <i>dei</i>. Normally, D-Pax2 activates the expression of <i>dei</i> in the cap cell but is unable to do so in the scolopale cell where Pros is co-expressed. We further show that D-Pax2 and Pros exert their effects on <i>dei</i> transcription via a 262 bp chordotonal-specific enhancer in which two D-Pax2- and three Pros-binding sites were identified experimentally. When this enhancer was removed from the fly genome, the cap- and ligament-specific expression of <i>dei</i> was lost, resulting in loss of chordotonal organ functionality and defective larval locomotion. Thus, coordinated larval locomotion depends on the activity of a <i>dei</i> enhancer that integrates both activating and repressive inputs for the generation of a functional proprioceptive organ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diversity of microglial transcriptional responses during opioid exposure and neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Microglia take on an altered morphology during chronic opioid treatment. This morphological change is broadly used to identify the activated microglial state associated with opioid side effects, including tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Following chronic opioid treatment and peripheral nerve injury (PNI) microglia in the spinal cord display similar morphological responses. Consistent with this observation, functional studies have suggested that microglia activated by PNI or opioids engage common molecular mechanisms to induce hypersensitivity. Here we conducted deep RNA sequencing of acutely isolated spinal cord microglia from male mice to comprehensively interrogate transcriptional states and mechanistic commonality between multiple OIH and PNI models. Following PNI, we identify a common early proliferative transcriptional event across models that precedes the upregulation of histological markers of activation, followed by a delayed and injury-specific transcriptional response. Strikingly, we found no such transcriptional responses associated with opioid-induced microglial activation, consistent with histological data indicating that microglia number remain stable during morphine treatment. Collectively, these results reveal the diversity of pain-associated microglial transcriptomes and point towards the targeting of distinct insult-specific microglial responses to treat OIH, PNI, or other CNS pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Landscape of human spinal cord cell type diversity at midgestation</a></h4>

              
                Understanding spinal cord generation and assembly is essential to elucidate how motor behavior is controlled and how disorders arise. The cellular landscape of the human spinal cord remains, however, insufficiently explored. Here, we profiled the midgestation human spinal cord with single cell-resolution and discovered, even at this fetal stage, remarkable heterogeneity across and within cell types. Glia displayed diversity related to positional identity along the dorso-ventral and rostro-caudal axes, while astrocytes with specialized transcriptional programs mapped onto distinct histological domains. We discovered a surprisingly early diversification of alpha () and gamma ({gamma}) motor neurons that control and modulate contraction of muscle fibers, which was suggestive of accelerated developmental timing in human spinal cord compared to rodents. Together with mapping of disease-related genes, this transcriptional profile of the developing human spinal cord opens new avenues for interrogating the cellular basis of motor control and related disorders in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Programmable Ontology Encompassing the Functional Logic of the Drosophila Brain</a></h4>

              
                The Drosophila brain has only a fraction of the number of neurons of higher organisms such as mice. Yet the sheer complexity of its neural circuits recently revealed by large connectomics datasets suggests that computationally modeling the function of fruit fly brain at this scale posits significant challenges. To address these challenges, we present here a programmable ontology that expands the scope of the current Drosophila brain anatomy ontologies to encompass the functional logic of the fly brain. The programmable ontology provides a language not only for defining functional circuit motifs but also for programmatically exploring their functional logic. To achieve this goal, we tightly integrated the programmable ontology with the workflow of the interactive FlyBrainLab computing platform. As part of the programmable ontology, we developed NeuroNLP++, a web application that supports free-form English queries for constructing functional brain circuits fully anchored on the available connectome/synaptome datasets, and the published worldwide literature. In addition, we present a methodology for including a model of the space of odorants into the programmable ontology, and for modeling olfactory sensory circuits of the antenna of the fruit fly brain that detect odorant sources. Furthermore, we describe a methodology for modeling the functional logic of the antennal lobe circuit consisting of massive local feedback loops, a characteristic feature observed across Drosophila brain regions. Finally, using a circuit library, we demonstrate the power of our methodology for interactively exploring the functional logic of the massive number of feedback loops in the antennal lobe.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single Nuclei Transcriptome Reveals Perturbed Brain Vascular Molecules in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is well-known in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the precise molecular changes contributing to its pathophysiology are unclear. To understand the transcriptional changes in brain vascular cells, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of temporal cortex tissue in 24 AD and control brains resulting in 79,751 nuclei, 4,604 of which formed three distinct vascular clusters characterized as activated pericytes, endothelia and resting pericytes. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their enriched pathways in these clusters and detected the most transcriptional changes within activated pericytes. Using our data and a knowledge-based predictive algorithm, we discovered and prioritized molecular interactions between vascular and astrocyte clusters, the main cell types of the gliovascular unit (GVU) of the BBB. Vascular targets predicted to interact with astrocytic ligands have biological functions in signaling, angiogenesis, amyloid {beta} metabolism and cytoskeletal structure. Top astrocytic and vascular interacting molecules include both novel and known AD risk genes such as APOE, APP and ECE1. Our findings provide information on transcriptional changes in predicted vascular-astrocytic partners at the GVU, bringing insights to the molecular mechanisms of BBB breakdown in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor modulates the rate of functional maturation in parvalbumin-positive interneurons</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are excitatory glutamate-gated ion channels that are expressed throughout the central nervous system. NMDARs mediate calcium entry into cells, and are involved in a host of neurological functions, including neuronal development and maturation. The GluN2A subunit, encoded by the GRIN2A gene, has a slightly delayed expression pattern, with low transcript levels during embryonic development that peak in the early neonatal period. Given its unique expression pattern and ability to speed up the synaptic time course after incorporation into the postsynaptic density compared to other GluN2 subunits, the GluN2A subunit is well positioned to participate in synaptic maturation and circuit refinement. By using Grin2a knockout mice, we show that the loss of GluN2A signaling impacts parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneuron development in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Specifically, Grin2a knockout mice have 33% more parvalbumin-positive cells in CA1 compared to wild type controls, with no impact on cholecystokinin-positive cell density. By using immunohistochemical colocalization staining and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that these excess parvalbumin cells do eventually incorporate into the hippocampal network and participate in phasic inhibition, although their presynaptic release probability may be dampened. Moreover, we show that although the morphology of Grin2a knockout parvalbumin-positive cells is unaffected, key measures of intrinsic excitability and action-potential firing properties show age-dependent alterations. Preadolescent (P20-25) parvalbumin-positive cells have an increased input resistance, longer membrane time constant, longer action-potential half-width, a lower current threshold for depolarization-induced block of action-potential firing, and a decrease in peak action-potential firing rate. Each of these electrophysiological measures becomes corrected in adulthood, reaching wild type levels, suggesting a delay of electrophysiological maturation. The circuit and behavioral implications of delayed parvalbumin-positive interneuron maturation are not known; however, we find that neonatal Grin2a knockout mice are more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide and febrile-induced seizures, consistent with a critical role for early GluN2A signaling in neuronal development and maintenance of excitatory-inhibitory balance. These results could provide insights into how loss-of-function GRIN2A human variants can generate an epileptic phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Copper imbalance linked to oxidative stress and cell death during Zika virus infection in human astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The Zika virus (ZIKV) caused neurological abnormalities in more than 3500 Brazilian newborns between 2015 and 2020. Data have pointed to oxidative stress in astrocytes as well as to dysregulations in neural cell proliferation and cell cycle as important events accounting for the cell death and neurological complications observed in Congenital Zika Syndrome. Copper imbalance has been shown to induce similar alterations in other pathologies, and disturbances in copper homeostasis have already been described in viral infections. For this reason, we investigated copper homeostasis imbalance as a factor that could contribute to the cytotoxic effects of ZIKV infection in iPSC-derived human astrocytes. Our results show that ZIKV infection leads to a downregulation of one of the transporters mediating copper release, ATP7B protein. We also observed the activation of mechanisms that counteract high copper levels, including the synthesis of copper chaperones and the reduction of the copper importer protein CTR1. Finally, we show that chelator-mediated copper sequestration in ZIKV-infected astrocytes reduces the levels of reactive oxygen species and improves cell viability, but does not change the overall percentage of infected cells. In summary, our results show that copper homeostasis imbalance plays a role in the pathology of ZIKV in astrocytes, indicating that it may also be a factor accounting for the developmental abnormalities in the central nervous system following viral infection. Evaluating micronutrient levels and the use of copper chelators in pregnant women susceptible to ZIKV infection may be promising strategies to manage novel cases of congenital ZIKV syndrome.

                <p>by Xiamin Leng, Debbie Yee, Harrison Ritz, Amitai Shenhav</p>

To invest effort into any cognitive task, people must be sufficiently motivated. Whereas prior research has focused primarily on how the cognitive control required to complete these tasks is motivated by the potential rewards for success, it is also known that control investment can be equally motivated by the potential negative consequence for failure. Previous theoretical and experimental work has yet to examine how positive and negative incentives differentially influence the manner and intensity with which people allocate control. Here, we develop and test a normative model of control allocation under conditions of varying positive and negative performance incentives. Our model predicts, and our empirical findings confirm, that rewards for success and punishment for failure should differentially influence adjustments to the evidence accumulation rate versus response threshold, respectively. This dissociation further enabled us to infer how motivated a given person was by the consequences of success versus failure.

                <p>by Marta Zaffaroni, Loup Rimbaud, Ludovic Mailleret, Nik J. Cunniffe, Daniele Bevacqua</p>

Aphids are the primary vector of plant viruses. Transient aphids, which probe several plants per day, are considered to be the principal vectors of non-persistently transmitted (NPT) viruses. However, resident aphids, which can complete their life cycle on a single host and are affected by agronomic practices, can transmit NPT viruses as well. Moreover, they can interfere both directly and indirectly with transient aphids, eventually shaping plant disease dynamics. By mean of an epidemiological model, originally accounting for ecological principles and agronomic practices, we explore the consequences of fertilization and irrigation, pesticide deployment and roguing of infected plants on the spread of viral diseases in crops. Our results indicate that the spread of NPT viruses can be <i>i</i>) both reduced or increased by fertilization and irrigation, depending on whether the interference is direct or indirect; <i>ii</i>) counter-intuitively increased by pesticide application and <i>iii</i>) reduced by roguing infected plants. We show that a better understanding of vectors’ interactions would enhance our understanding of disease transmission, supporting the development of disease management strategies.

                <p>by Daniel Müller-Komorowska, Ana Parabucki, Gal Elyasaf, Yonatan Katz, Heinz Beck, Ilan Lampl</p>

The firing of neurons throughout the brain is determined by the precise relations between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and disruption of their balance underlies many psychiatric diseases. Whether or not these inputs covary over time or between repeated stimuli remains unclear due to the lack of experimental methods for measuring both inputs simultaneously. We developed a new analytical framework for instantaneous and simultaneous measurements of both the excitatory and inhibitory neuronal inputs during a single trial under current clamp recording. This can be achieved by injecting a current composed of two high frequency sinusoidal components followed by analytical extraction of the conductances. We demonstrate the ability of this method to measure both inputs in a single trial under realistic recording constraints and from morphologically realistic CA1 pyramidal model cells. Future experimental implementation of our new method will facilitate the understanding of fundamental questions about the health and disease of the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Measuring context dependency in birdsong using artificial neural networks</a></h4>

Context dependency is a key feature in sequential structures of human language, which requires reference between words far apart in the produced sequence. Assessing how long the past context has an effect on the current status provides crucial information to understand the mechanism for complex sequential behaviors. Birdsongs serve as a representative model for studying the context dependency in sequential signals produced by non-human animals, while previous reports were upper-bounded by methodological limitations. Here, we newly estimated the context dependency in birdsongs in a more scalable way using a modern neural-network-based language model whose accessible context length is sufficiently long. The detected context dependency was beyond the order of traditional Markovian models of birdsong, but was consistent with previous experimental investigations. We also studied the relation between the assumed/auto-detected vocabulary size of birdsong (i.e., fine- vs. coarse-grained syllable classifications) and the context dependency. It turned out that the larger vocabulary (or the more fine-grained classification) is assumed, the shorter context dependency is detected.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Combination treatment optimization using a pan-cancer pathway model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robin Schmucker, Gabriele Farina, James Faeder, Fabian Fröhlich, Ali Sinan Saglam, Tuomas Sandholm</p>

The design of efficient combination therapies is a difficult key challenge in the treatment of complex diseases such as cancers. The large heterogeneity of cancers and the large number of available drugs renders exhaustive <i>in vivo</i> or even <i>in vitro</i> investigation of possible treatments impractical. In recent years, sophisticated mechanistic, ordinary differential equation-based pathways models that can predict treatment responses at a <i>molecular</i> level have been developed. However, surprisingly little effort has been put into leveraging these models to find novel therapies. In this paper we use for the first time, to our knowledge, a large-scale state-of-the-art pan-cancer signaling pathway model to identify candidates for novel combination therapies to treat individual cancer cell lines from various tissues (e.g., minimizing proliferation while keeping dosage low to avoid adverse side effects) and populations of heterogeneous cancer cell lines (e.g., minimizing the maximum or average proliferation across the cell lines while keeping dosage low). We also show how our method can be used to optimize the drug combinations used in <i>sequential</i> treatment plans—that is, optimized sequences of potentially different drug combinations—providing additional benefits. In order to solve the treatment optimization problems, we combine the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm with a significantly more scalable sampling scheme for truncated Gaussian distributions, based on a Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo method. These optimization techniques are independent of the signaling pathway model, and can thus be adapted to find treatment candidates for other complex diseases than cancers as well, as long as a suitable predictive model is available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Asymmetric and transient properties of reciprocal activity of antagonists during the paw-shake response in the cat</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica R. Parker, Alexander N. Klishko, Boris I. Prilutsky, Gennady S. Cymbalyuk</p>

Mutually inhibitory populations of neurons, half-center oscillators (HCOs), are commonly involved in the dynamics of the central pattern generators (CPGs) driving various rhythmic movements. Previously, we developed a multifunctional, multistable symmetric HCO model which produced slow locomotor-like and fast paw-shake-like activity patterns. Here, we describe asymmetric features of paw-shake responses in a symmetric HCO model and test these predictions experimentally. We considered bursting properties of the two model half-centers during transient paw-shake-like responses to short perturbations during locomotor-like activity. We found that when a current pulse was applied during the spiking phase of one half-center, let’s call it #1, the consecutive burst durations (BDs) of that half-center increased throughout the paw-shake response, while BDs of the other half-center, let’s call it #2, only changed slightly. In contrast, the consecutive interburst intervals (IBIs) of half-center #1 changed little, while IBIs of half-center #2 increased. We demonstrated that this asymmetry between the half-centers depends on the phase of the locomotor-like rhythm at which the perturbation was applied. We suggest that the fast transient response reflects functional asymmetries of slow processes that underly the locomotor-like pattern; e.g., asymmetric levels of inactivation across the two half-centers for a slowly inactivating inward current. We compared model results with those of in-vivo paw-shake responses evoked in locomoting cats and found similar asymmetries. Electromyographic (EMG) BDs of anterior hindlimb muscles with flexor-related activity increased in consecutive paw-shake cycles, while BD of posterior muscles with extensor-related activity did not change, and vice versa for IBIs of anterior flexors and posterior extensors. We conclude that EMG activity patterns during paw-shaking are consistent with the proposed mechanism producing transient paw-shake-like bursting patterns found in our multistable HCO model. We suggest that the described asymmetry of paw-shaking responses could implicate a multifunctional CPG controlling both locomotion and paw-shaking.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A systems genomics approach uncovers molecular associates of RSV severity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew N. McCall, Chin-Yi Chu, Lu Wang, Lauren Benoodt, Juilee Thakar, Anthony Corbett, Jeanne Holden-Wiltse, Christopher Slaunwhite, Alex Grier, Steven R. Gill, Ann R. Falsey, David J. Topham, Mary T. Caserta, Edward E. Walsh, Xing Qiu, Thomas J. Mariani</p>

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection results in millions of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths each year. Variations in the adaptive and innate immune response appear to be associated with RSV severity. To investigate the host response to RSV infection in infants, we performed a systems-level study of RSV pathophysiology, incorporating high-throughput measurements of the peripheral innate and adaptive immune systems and the airway epithelium and microbiota. We implemented a novel multi-omic data integration method based on multilayered principal component analysis, penalized regression, and feature weight back-propagation, which enabled us to identify cellular pathways associated with RSV severity. In both airway and immune cells, we found an association between RSV severity and activation of pathways controlling Th17 and acute phase response signaling, as well as inhibition of B cell receptor signaling. Dysregulation of both the humoral and mucosal response to RSV may play a critical role in determining illness severity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies interactors of the autophagy pathway as conserved coronavirus targets</a></h4>

Over the past 20 years, 3 highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have emerged—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, most recently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—demonstrating that coronaviruses (CoVs) pose a serious threat to human health and highlighting the importance of developing effective therapies against them. Similar to other viruses, CoVs are dependent on host factors for their survival and replication. We hypothesized that evolutionarily distinct CoVs may exploit similar host factors and pathways to support their replication cycles. Herein, we conducted 2 independent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas-9 knockout (KO) screens to identify MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E host dependency factors (HDFs) required for HCoV replication in the human Huh7 cell line. Top scoring genes were further validated and assessed in the context of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E infection as well as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strikingly, we found that several autophagy-related genes, including TMEM41B, MINAR1, and the immunophilin FKBP8, were common host factors required for pan-CoV replication. Importantly, inhibition of the immunophilin protein family with the compounds cyclosporine A, and the nonimmunosuppressive derivative alisporivir, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CoV replication in primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures, which recapitulate the natural site of virus replication. Overall, we identified host factors that are crucial for CoV replication and demonstrated that these factors constitute potential targets for therapeutic intervention by clinically approved drugs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prior uncontrolled studies have reported seizure reductions following deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), but evidence from randomized controlled studies is lacking. We aimed to formally assess the efficacy and safety of DBS to the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) for the treatment of LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized study of continuous, cycling stimulation of CM-DBS, in patients with LGS. Following pre- and post-implantation periods, half received 3 months of stimulation (blinded phase), then all received 3 months of stimulation (unblinded phase). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with ≥50% reduction in diary-recorded seizures in stimulated versus control participants, measured at the end of the blinded phase. A secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with a ≥50% reduction in electrographic seizures on 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) at the end of the blinded phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between November 2017 and December 2019, 20 young adults with LGS (17–37 years;13 women) underwent bilateral CM-DBS at a single center in Australia, with 19 randomized (treatment, n = 10 and control, n = 9). Fifty percent of the stimulation group achieved ≥50% seizure reduction, compared with 22% of controls (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44–21.45, <i>p</i> = 0.25). For electrographic seizures, 59% of the stimulation group had ≥50% reduction at the end of the blinded phase, compared with none of the controls (OR= 23.25, 95% CI = 1.0–538.4, <i>p</i> = 0.05). Across all patients, median seizure reduction (baseline vs study exit) was 46.7% (interquartile range [IQR] = 28–67%) for diary-recorded seizures and 53.8% (IQR = 27–73%) for electrographic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CM-DBS in patients with LGS reduced electrographic rather than diary-recorded seizures, after 3 months of stimulation. Fifty percent of all participants had diary-recorded seizures reduced by half at the study exit, providing supporting evidence of the treatment effect. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Regular exercise has numerous benefits for brain health, including the structure and function of the hippocampus. The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory function, and is altered in a number of psychiatric disorders associated with memory impairments (e.g., depression and schizophrenia), as well as healthy aging. While many studies have focused on how regular exercise may improve hippocampal integrity in older individuals, less is known about these effects in young to middle-aged adults. Therefore, we assessed the associations of regular exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness with hippocampal structure and function in these age groups. We recruited 40 healthy young to middle-aged adults, comprised of two groups (n = 20) who self-reported either high or low levels of exercise, according to World Health Organization guidelines. We assessed cardiorespiratory fitness using a graded exercise test (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and hippocampal structure via manual tracing of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. We also assessed hippocampal function using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to derive estimates of <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration and hippocampal-dependent associative memory and pattern separation tasks. We observed evidence of increased <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration and associative memory performance in individuals engaging in high levels of exercise. However, no differences in hippocampal volume or pattern separation capacity were observed between groups. Cardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with left and right hippocampal volume and <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration. However, no associations were observed between cardiorespiratory fitness and associative memory or pattern separation. Therefore, we provide evidence that higher levels of exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with improved hippocampal structure and function. Exercise may provide a low-risk, effective method of improving hippocampal integrity in an early-to-mid-life stage.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i>’s lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) belong to a small group of circadian clock neurons that is so far not characterized in detail. Thanks to a new highly specific split-Gal4 line, here we describe LPNs’ morphology in fine detail, their synaptic connections, daily bimodal expression of neuropeptides, and propose a putative role of this cluster in controlling daily activity and sleep patterns. We found that the three LPNs are heterogeneous. Two of the neurons with similar morphology arborize in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum and most likely promote sleep. One unique, possibly wakefulness-promoting, neuron with wider arborizations extends from the superior lateral protocerebrum toward the anterior optic tubercle. Both LPN types exhibit manifold connections with the other circadian clock neurons, especially with those that control the flies‘ morning and evening activity (M- and E-neurons, respectively). In addition, they form synaptic connections with neurons of the mushroom bodies, the fan-shaped body, and with many additional still unidentified neurons. We found that both LPN types rhythmically express three neuropeptides, Allostatin A, Allostatin C, and Diuretic Hormone 31 with maxima in the morning and the evening. The three LPN neuropeptides may, furthermore, signal to the insect hormonal center in the <i>pars intercerebralis</i> and contribute to rhythmic modulation of metabolism, feeding, and reproduction. We discuss our findings in the light of anatomical details gained by the recently published hemibrain of a single female fly on the electron microscopic level and of previous functional studies concerning the LPN.</p>

<p>We performed a systematic literature search to identify lesion locations causing visual field loss in patients with blindsight (n=34) and patients without blindsight (n=35). Resting state functional connectivity between each lesion location and all other brain voxels was computed using a large connectome database (n=1000). Connections significantly associated with blindsight (versus no blindsight) were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Functional connectivity between lesion locations and the ipsilesional medial pulvinar was significantly associated with blindsight (FWE <i>p</i>=0.029). No significant connectivity differences were found to other brain regions previously implicated in blindsight. This finding was independent of methods (e.g. flipping lesions to the left or right) and stimulus type (moving versus static).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Connectivity to the ipsilesional medial pulvinar best differentiates lesion locations associated with blindsight versus those without blindsight. Our results align with recent data from animal models and provide insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of unconscious visual abilities in patients.</p>

                Mou et al. demonstrate that observing an animal running a maze reactivates the firing sequences of the observer’s hippocampal place cells remotely during awake ripples in a physically separated observation box. Such reactivation preferentially focuses on reward sites in the maze and predicts the observer’s future spatial decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">GM-CSF production by non-classical monocytes controls antagonistic LPS-driven functions in allergic inflammation</a></h4>

              
                LPS can promote or prevent allergic sensitization. Kaur et al. demonstrate that GM-CSF segregates those different LPS-driven roles. Only allergens with cysteine protease activity trigger GM-CSF production by non-classical Ly6Clo monocytes, preventing sensitization to LPS-containing allergens by modulating the function of classical Ly6Chi monocytes and migratory dendritic cells.

                Lenoir et al. identify the mechanism that the immune regulatory protein, LGP2, uses to inhibit IRF3 and NF-κB activation. LGP2 blocks K63 polyubiquitination required for immune signaling by binding and sequestering the K63-conjugating enzyme, Ubc13/UBE2N, affecting a wide range of antiviral, cytokine, and immune signaling pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Substratum stiffness regulates Erk signaling dynamics through receptor-level control</a></h4>

              
                Farahani et al. investigate how soft microenvironments limit signal transmission through the EGFR/Erk pathway. Optogenetic stimulation reveals that the intracellular portion of the EGFR/Erk pathway remains signaling competent regardless of substratum stiffness. Rather, soft microenvironments limit Erk signaling by decreasing interactions between EGFR and its cognate ligand.
