                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days).

     alt="Mapping reward mechanisms by intracerebral self-stimulation in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)"/>
<p>

Testing the reward versus aversive value of electrical stimulation of 74 structures of the macaque brain revealed a ubiquitous distribution of valenced sites in pathways throughout the brain. Most positive were striatal and frontal cortical structures densely innervated by pathways originating in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) cell groups A9 and A10. Nevertheless, reward related more to structures' neurobehavioral function than to density of DA-innervation. Many positive sites were found in non-DA posterior cingulate cortex, and stimulation of purely sensory and motor areas was generally negative, regardless of DA innervation.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The objective of the study was to identify brain structures that mediate reward as evidenced by positive reinforcing effects of stimuli on behavior. Testing by intracerebral self-stimulation enabled monkeys to inform whether activation of ~2900 sites in 74 structures of 4 sensorimotor pathways and 4 modulatory loop pathways was positive, negative or neutral. Stimulation was rewarding at 30% of sites, negative at 17%, neutral at 52%. Virtually all (99%) structures yielded some positive or negative sites, suggesting a ubiquitous distribution of pathways transmitting valence information. Mapping of sites to structures with dense versus sparse dopaminergic (DA) or noradrenergic (NA) innervation showed that stimulation of DA-pathways was rewarding or neutral. Stimulation of NA-pathways was not rewarding. Stimulation of association areas was generally rewarding; stimulation of purely sensory or motor structures was generally negative. Reward related more to structures' sensorimotor function than to density of DA-innervation. Stimulation of basal ganglia loop pathways was rewarding except in lateral globus pallidus, an inhibitory structure in the negative feedback loop; stimulation of the cerebellar loop was rewarding in anterior vermis and the spinocerebellar pathway; and stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 loop was rewarding. While most positive sites were in the DA reward system, numerous sites in sparsely DA-innervated posterior cingulate and parietal cortices may represent a separate reward system. DA-density represents concentrations of plastic synapses that mediate acquisition of new synaptic connections. DA-sparse areas may represent innate, genetically programmed reward-associated pathways. Implications of findings in regard to response habituation and addiction are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">miR-1 coordinately regulates lysosomal v-ATPase and biogenesis to impact proteotoxicity and muscle function during aging</a></h4>

              
                Muscle function relies on the precise architecture of dynamic contractile elements, which must be fine-tuned to maintain motility throughout life. Muscle is also plastic, and remodeled in response to stress, growth, neural and metabolic inputs. The conserved muscle-enriched microRNA, miR-1, regulates distinct aspects of muscle development, but whether it plays a role during aging is unknown. Here we investigated <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> miR-1 in muscle function in response to proteostatic stress. <i>mir-1</i> deletion improved mid-life muscle motility, pharyngeal pumping, and organismal longevity upon polyQ35 proteotoxic challenge. We identified multiple vacuolar ATPase subunits as subject to miR-1 control, and the regulatory subunit <i>vha-13</i>/ATP6V1A as a direct target downregulated via its 3′UTR to mediate miR-1 physiology. miR-1 further regulates nuclear localization of lysosomal biogenesis factor HLH-30/TFEB and lysosomal acidification. Our studies reveal that miR-1 coordinately regulates lysosomal v-ATPase and biogenesis to impact muscle function and health during aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Revisiting the guidelines for ending isolation for COVID-19 patients</a></h4>

              
                Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mainstream guidelines for defining when to end the isolation of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals have been in use: the one-size-fits-all approach (i.e. patients are isolated for a fixed number of days) and the personalized approach (i.e. based on repeated testing of isolated patients). We use a mathematical framework to model within-host viral dynamics and test different criteria for ending isolation. By considering a fixed time of 10 days since symptom onset as the criterion for ending isolation, we estimated that the risk of releasing an individual who is still infectious is low (0–6.6%). However, this policy entails lengthy unnecessary isolations (4.8–8.3 days). In contrast, by using a personalized strategy, similar low risks can be reached with shorter prolonged isolations. The obtained findings provide a scientific rationale for policies on ending the isolation of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract
      </h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome scale (CCAS-S) was designed to detect specific cognitive dysfunctions in cerebellar patients but is scarcely validated in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). The objective of this study is to determine the usefulness of the CCAS-S in a Cuban cohort of SCA2 patients and the relationship of its scores with disease severity. The original scale underwent a forward and backward translation into Spanish language, followed by a pilot study to evaluate its comprehensibility. Reliability, discriminant, and convergent validity assessments were conducted in 64 SCA2 patients and 64 healthy controls matched for sex, age, and education. Fifty patients completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. The CCAS-S showed an acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.74) while its total raw score and the number of failed tests showed excellent (ICC = 0.94) and good (ICC = 0.89) test–retest reliability, respectively. Based on original cut-offs, the sensitivity of CCAS-S to detect possible/probable/definite CCAS was notably high (100%/100%/91%), but specificities were low (6%/30/64%) because the decreased specificity observed in four items. CCAS-S performance was significantly influenced by ataxia severity in patients and by education in both groups. CCAS-S scores correlated with MoCA scores, but showed higher sensitivity than MoCA to detect cognitive impairments in patients. The CCAS-S is particularly useful to detect cognitive impairments in SCA2 but some transcultural and/or age and education-dependent adaptations could be necessary to improve its diagnostic properties. Furthermore, this scale confirmed the parallelism between cognitive and motor deficits in SCA2, giving better insights into the disease pathophysiology and identifying novel outcomes for clinical trials.</p>

	<p>There is currently limited and mixed evidence for the cognitive benefits of Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) and yoga in persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (pwMCI). The objective of this study was to investigate the benefit of computerized cognitive training (CCT) vs. physical (yoga) intervention on cognitive abilities. Participants in this study were part of the larger Mayo Clinic’s Healthy Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking (HABIT) program comparative effectiveness trial. The HABIT program is designed for pwMCI and their care partner and consists of five behavioral interventions: CCT, Memory Support System-Calendar (MSS-Calendar), wellness education, support groups, and yoga. The subtractive study design randomly withheld one of the interventions for a total of five study arms. Longitudinal mixed-effects regression models were used to investigate the hypothesis that CCT and yoga has a greater positive impact on psychomotor and basic attention abilities at 12 months post-intervention as compared to the other HABIT interventions. Findings showed CCT had a positive impact compared to yoga on the Cogstate psychomotor/attention composite at 12 months post-intervention (ES = 0.54; unadjusted p value = 0.007, adjusted p value = 0.021). The impact of yoga or combining CCT with yoga did not show statistically significant improvement. Continued CCT practice at home showed further benefit on psychomotor/attention at 12 months post-intervention. There was no significant benefit of CCT or yoga on Cogstate learning/working memory composite.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cilia are dynamic subcellular systems, with core structural and functional components operating in a highly coordinated manner. Since many environmental stimuli sensed by cilia are circadian in nature, it is reasonable to speculate that genes encoding cilia structural and functional components follow rhythmic circadian patterns of expression. Using computational methods and the largest spatiotemporal gene expression atlas of primates, we identified and analyzed the circadian rhythmic expression of cilia genes across 22 primate brain areas. We found that around 73% of cilia transcripts exhibited circadian rhythmicity across at least one of 22 brain regions. In 12 brain regions, cilia transcriptomes were significantly enriched with circadian oscillating transcripts, as compared to the rest of the transcriptome. The phase of the cilia circadian transcripts deviated from the phase of the majority of the background circadian transcripts, and transcripts coding for cilia basal body components accounted for the majority of cilia circadian transcripts. In addition, adjacent or functionally connected brain nuclei had large overlapping complements of circadian cilia genes. Most remarkably, cilia circadian transcripts shared across the basal ganglia nuclei and the prefrontal cortex peaked in these structures in sequential fashion that is similar to the sequential order of activation of the basal ganglia-cortical circuitry in connection with movement coordination, albeit on completely different timescales. These findings support a role for the circadian spatiotemporal orchestration of cilia gene expression in the normal physiology of the basal ganglia-cortical circuit and motor control. Studying orchestrated cilia rhythmicity in the basal ganglia-cortical circuits and other brain circuits may help develop better functional models, and shed light on the causal effects cilia functions have on these circuits and on the regulation of movement and other behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Machine Learning-Based Pipette Positional Correction for Automatic Patch Clamp In Vitro</a></h4>

              
                <p>Patch clamp electrophysiology is a common technique used in neuroscience to understand individual neuron behavior, allowing one to record current and voltage changes with superior spatiotemporal resolution compared with most electrophysiology methods. While patch clamp experiments produce high fidelity electrophysiology data, the technique is onerous and labor intensive. Despite the emergence of patch clamp systems that automate key stages in the typical patch clamp procedure, full automation remains elusive. Patch clamp pipettes can miss the target cell during automated experiments because of positioning errors in the robotic manipulators, which can easily exceed the diameter of a neuron. Further, when patching in acute brain slices, the inherent light scattering from non-uniform brain tissue can complicate pipette tip identification. We present a convolutional neural network (CNN), based on ResNet101, to identify and correct pipette positioning errors before each patch clamp attempt, thereby preventing the deleterious effects of and accumulation of positioning errors. This deep-learning-based pipette detection method enabled superior localization of the pipette within 0.62 &plusmn; 0.58 &mu;m, resulting in improved cell detection success rate and whole-cell patch clamp success rates by 71% and 59%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art cross-correlation method. Furthermore, this technique reduced the average time for pipette correction by 81%. This technique enables real-time correction of pipette position during patch clamp experiments with similar accuracy and quality of recording to manual patch clamp, making notable progress toward full human-out-of-the-loop automation for patch clamp electrophysiology.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Generalization of sensorimotor adaptation across limbs, known as interlimb transfer, is a well-demonstrated phenomenon in humans, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Theoretical models suggest that interlimb transfer is mediated by interhemispheric transfer of information via the corpus callosum. We thus hypothesized that lesions of the corpus callosum, especially to its midbody connecting motor, supplementary motor, and premotor areas of the two cerebral hemispheres, would impair interlimb transfer of sensorimotor adaptation. To test this hypothesis, we recruited three patients: two rare stroke patients with recent, extensive callosal lesions including the midbody and one patient with complete agenesis. A prismatic adaptation paradigm involving unconstrained arm reaching movements was designed to assess interlimb transfer from the prism-exposed dominant arm (DA) to the unexposed non-dominant arm (NDA) for each participant. Baseline results showed that spatial performance of each patient did not significantly differ from controls, for both limbs. Further, each patient adapted to the prismatic perturbation, with no significant difference in error reduction compared with controls. Crucially, interlimb transfer was found in each patient. The absolute magnitude of each patient&rsquo;s transfer did not significantly differ from controls. These findings show that sensorimotor adaptation can transfer across limbs despite extensive lesions or complete absence of the corpus callosum. Therefore, callosal pathways connecting homologous motor, premotor, and supplementary motor areas are not necessary for interlimb transfer of prismatic reach adaptation. Such interlimb transfer could be mediated by transcallosal splenium pathways (connecting parietal, temporal and visual areas), ipsilateral cortico-spinal pathways or subcortical structures such as the cerebellum.</p>

                The prevalence of Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) is increasing at an alarming rate in the world. Most of the HSV2 cases are not diagnosed properly, although a range of molecular and serological diagnoses exist. Herein, we have reported a very rapid detection method specific for HSV2 using real-time PCR. The primers specific for HSV2 were designed using the Primer-BLAST tool and 120 base pairs of the polymerase gene were amplified using real-time PCR with SYBR Green dye. The designed primer pair was found highly efficient in detecting only HSV2 DNA, but not HSV1. The threshold cycle (Ct) value for HSV2 reactions by designed primers was found to be an average of 22.55 for a standard copy number of viral DNA that may denote the efficiency of the primers. The melting temperature (Tm) of the amplicon using designed primers (82.60C) was also higher than that using reference primers (about 780C), indicating the high GC content of the amplified template. The designed primer pair will help clinicians to detect the HSV2 DNA specifically and diagnose the associated disease rapidly.

                RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely adopted affordable method for large scale gene expression profiling. However, user-friendly and versatile tools for wet-lab biologists to analyse RNA-seq data beyond standard analyses such as differential expression, are rare. Especially, the analysis of time-series data is difficult for wet-lab biologists lacking advanced computational training. Furthermore, most meta-analysis tools are tailored for model organisms and not easily adaptable to other species. With RNfuzzyApp, we provide a user-friendly, web-based R shiny app for differential expression analysis, as well as time-series analysis of RNA-seq data. RNfuzzyApp offers several methods for normalization and differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, providing easy-to-use toolboxes, interactive plots and downloadable results. For time-series analysis, RNfuzzyApp presents the first web-based, fully automated pipeline for soft clustering with the Mfuzz R package, including methods to aid in cluster number selection, cluster overlap analysis, Mfuzz loop computations, as well as cluster enrichments. RNfuzzyApp is an intuitive, easy to use and interactive R shiny app for RNA-seq differential expression and time-series analysis, offering a rich selection of interactive plots, providing a quick overview of raw data and generating rapid analysis results. Furthermore, its orthology assignment, enrichment analysis, as well as ID conversion functions are accessible to non-model organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current situation of vaccine injury compensation program and a future perspective in light of COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vaccines have had a great impact on disease prevention and mortality reduction. Very rarely, vaccines also can result in serious adverse effects. In consideration of this fact, vaccine injury compensation programs have been implemented in many countries to compensate a vaccinee for associated adverse effects. The existing vaccine injury compensation system addresses routine immunization schemes. However, there are rising concerns about the compensation for adverse effects caused by new vaccines such as those developed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this article is to review the existing vaccine injury compensation programs in different countries. The review also highlights the necessity to include all upcoming new vaccines for COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases in the compensation schemes. Methods: Published articles relating to vaccine compensation injury programs, vaccines, injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and deaths resulting from vaccination were searched in data bases. Through a careful review of the abstracts, 25 relevant articles were selected for analysis. Results: We identified 27 countries on four continents with vaccine injury compensation schemes: 17 countries in Europe, 7 countries in Asia, the United States, a Canadian Province and New Zealand. No programs were identified in Africa and in South America. Program design, funding, and eligibility for compensation vary vastly between countries. We identified 17 countries operating well-established vaccine injury compensation programs. However, minimal information is available on numerous other countries. Conclusion: We have identified 27 countries operating vaccine injury compensation programs. In Canada, Quebec is the only province with a scheme; however, discussions are ongoing in Canada for nationwide implementation in light of COVID 19.  Study limitations include limited scientific material, which hindered our research. Additional data concerning payout for each type of injury and the number of claimants related to a specific vaccine injury worldwide could provide a more comprehensive analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Autoencoder based local T cell repertoire density can be used to classify samples and T cell receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shirit Dvorkin, Reut Levi, Yoram Louzoun</p>

Recent advances in T cell repertoire (TCR) sequencing allow for the characterization of repertoire properties, as well as the frequency and sharing of specific TCR. However, there is no efficient measure for the local density of a given TCR. TCRs are often described either through their Complementary Determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences, or theirV/J usage, or their clone size. We here show that the local repertoire density can be estimated using a combined representation of these components through distance conserving autoencoders and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). We present ELATE–an Encoder-based LocAl Tcr dEnsity and show that the resulting density of a sample can be used as a novel measure to study repertoire properties. The cross-density between two samples can be used as a similarity matrix to fully characterize samples from the same host. Finally, the same projection in combination with machine learning algorithms can be used to predict TCR-peptide binding through the local density of known TCRs binding a specific target.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bernard Cazelles, Clara Champagne, Benjamin Nguyen-Van-Yen, Catherine Comiskey, Elisabeta Vergu, Benjamin Roche</p>

The effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we propose to estimate <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted by Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data. Except for the specific model structure, it is non-specifically assumed that the transmission rate follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the observations. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub><i>(t)</i>. Besides, it allows to assess and to interpret the evolution of transmission with respect to the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland. We can thus estimate a reduction of more than 80% for the first wave in all the studied regions but a smaller reduction for the second wave when the epidemic was less active, around 45% in France but just 20% in Ireland. For the third wave in Ireland the reduction was again significant (>70%).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bridging cell-scale simulations and radiologic images to explain short-time intratumoral oxygen fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica L. Kingsley, James R. Costello, Natarajan Raghunand, Katarzyna A. Rejniak</p>

Radiologic images provide a way to monitor tumor development and its response to therapies in a longitudinal and minimally invasive fashion. However, they operate on a macroscopic scale (average value per voxel) and are not able to capture microscopic scale (cell-level) phenomena. Nevertheless, to examine the causes of frequent fast fluctuations in tissue oxygenation, models simulating individual cells’ behavior are needed. Here, we provide a link between the average data values recorded for radiologic images and the cellular and vascular architecture of the corresponding tissues. Using hybrid agent-based modeling, we generate a set of tissue morphologies capable of reproducing oxygenation levels observed in radiologic images. We then use these in silico tissues to investigate whether oxygen fluctuations can be explained by changes in vascular oxygen supply or by modulations in cellular oxygen absorption. Our studies show that intravascular changes in oxygen supply reproduce the observed fluctuations in tissue oxygenation in all considered regions of interest. However, larger-magnitude fluctuations cannot be recreated by modifications in cellular absorption of oxygen in a biologically feasible manner. Additionally, we develop a procedure to identify plausible tissue morphologies for a given temporal series of average data from radiology images. In future applications, this approach can be used to generate a set of tissues comparable with radiology images and to simulate tumor responses to various anti-cancer treatments at the tissue-scale level.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Explaining distortions in metacognition with an attractor network model of decision uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadim A. A. Atiya, Quentin J. M. Huys, Raymond J. Dolan, Stephen M. Fleming</p>

Metacognition is the ability to reflect on, and evaluate, our cognition and behaviour. Distortions in metacognition are common in mental health disorders, though the neural underpinnings of such dysfunction are unknown. One reason for this is that models of key components of metacognition, such as decision confidence, are generally specified at an algorithmic or process level. While such models can be used to relate brain function to psychopathology, they are difficult to map to a neurobiological mechanism. Here, we develop a biologically-plausible model of decision uncertainty in an attempt to bridge this gap. We first relate the model’s uncertainty in perceptual decisions to standard metrics of metacognition, namely mean confidence level (bias) and the accuracy of metacognitive judgments (sensitivity). We show that dissociable shifts in metacognition are associated with isolated disturbances at higher-order levels of a circuit associated with self-monitoring, akin to neuropsychological findings that highlight the detrimental effect of prefrontal brain lesions on metacognitive performance. Notably, we are able to account for empirical confidence judgements by fitting the parameters of our biophysical model to first-order performance data, specifically choice and response times. Lastly, in a reanalysis of existing data we show that self-reported mental health symptoms relate to disturbances in an uncertainty-monitoring component of the network. By bridging a gap between a biologically-plausible model of confidence formation and observed disturbances of metacognition in mental health disorders we provide a first step towards mapping theoretical constructs of metacognition onto dynamical models of decision uncertainty. In doing so, we provide a computational framework for modelling metacognitive performance in settings where access to explicit confidence reports is not possible.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dimeric allostery mechanism of the plant circadian clock photoreceptor ZEITLUPE</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Francesco Trozzi, Feng Wang, Gennady Verkhivker, Brian D. Zoltowski, Peng Tao</p>

In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domain containing protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL) integrates light quality, intensity, and duration into regulation of the circadian clock. Recent structural and biochemical studies of ZTL indicate that the protein diverges from other members of the LOV superfamily in its allosteric mechanism, and that the divergent allosteric mechanism hinges upon conservation of two signaling residues G46 and V48 that alter dynamic motions of a Gln residue implicated in signal transduction in all LOV proteins. Here, we delineate the allosteric mechanism of ZTL via an integrated computational approach that employs atomistic simulations of wild type and allosteric variants of ZTL in the functional dark and light states, together with Markov state and supervised machine learning classification models. This approach has unveiled key factors of the ZTL allosteric mechanisms, and identified specific interactions and residues implicated in functional allosteric changes. The final results reveal atomic level insights into allosteric mechanisms of ZTL function that operate via a non-trivial combination of population-shift and dynamics-driven allosteric pathways.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for models that can project epidemic trends, explore intervention scenarios, and estimate resource needs. Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Insights into substrate recognition and specificity for IgG by Endoglycosidase S2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Asaminew H. Aytenfisu, Daniel Deredge, Erik H. Klontz, Jonathan Du, Eric J. Sundberg, Alexander D. MacKerell Jr</p>

Antibodies bind foreign antigens with high affinity and specificity leading to their neutralization and/or clearance by the immune system. The conserved N-glycan on IgG has significant impact on antibody effector function, with the endoglycosidases of <i>Streptococcus pyogen</i>es deglycosylating the IgG to evade the immune system, a process catalyzed by the endoglycosidase EndoS2. Studies have shown that two of the four domains of EndoS2, the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) and the glycoside hydrolase (GH) domain site are critical for catalytic activity. To yield structural insights into contributions of the CBM and the GH domains as well as the overall flexibility of EndoS2 to the proteins’ catalytic activity, models of EndoS2-Fc complexes were generated through enhanced-sampling molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation and site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) docking followed by reconstruction and multi-microsecond MD simulations. Modeling results predict that EndoS2 initially interacts with the IgG through its CBM followed by interactions with the GH yielding catalytically competent states. These may involve the CBM and GH of EndoS2 simultaneously interacting with either the same Fc CH2/CH3 domain or individually with the two Fc CH2/CH3 domains, with EndoS2 predicted to assume closed conformations in the former case and open conformations in the latter. Apo EndoS2 is predicted to sample both the open and closed states, suggesting that either complex can directly form following initial IgG-EndoS2 encounter. Interactions of the CBM and GH domains with the IgG are predicted to occur through both its glycan and protein regions. Simulations also predict that the Fc glycan can directly transfer from the CBM to the GH, facilitating formation of catalytically competent complexes and how the 734 to 751 loop on the CBM can facilitate extraction of the glycan away from the Fc CH2/CH3 domain. The predicted models are compared and consistent with Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange data. In addition, the complex models are consistent with the high specificity of EndoS2 for the glycans on IgG supporting the validity of the predicted models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Projecting contact matrices in 177 geographical regions: An update and comparison with empirical data for the COVID-19 era</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kiesha Prem, Kevin van Zandvoort, Petra Klepac, Rosalind M. Eggo, Nicholas G. Davies, Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group , Alex R. Cook, Mark Jit</p>

Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">IVEN: A quantitative tool to describe 3D cell position and neighbourhood reveals architectural changes in FGF4-treated preimplantation embryos</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica E. Forsyth, Ali H. Al-Anbaki, Roberto de la Fuente, Nikkinder Modare, Diego Perez-Cortes, Isabel Rivera, Rowena Seaton Kelly, Simon Cotter, Berenika Plusa</p>

Architectural changes at the cellular and organism level are integral and necessary to successful development and growth. During mammalian preimplantation development, cells reduce in size and the architecture of the embryo changes significantly. Such changes must be coordinated correctly to ensure continued development of the embryo and, ultimately, a successful pregnancy. However, the nature of such transformations is poorly defined during mammalian preimplantation development. In order to quantitatively describe changes in cell environment and organism architecture, we designed Internal Versus External Neighbourhood (IVEN). IVEN is a user-interactive, open-source pipeline that classifies cells into different populations based on their position and quantifies the number of neighbours of every cell within a dataset in a 3D environment. Through IVEN-driven analyses, we show how transformations in cell environment, defined here as changes in cell neighbourhood, are related to changes in embryo geometry and major developmental events during preimplantation mammalian development. Moreover, we demonstrate that modulation of the FGF pathway alters spatial relations of inner cells and neighbourhood distributions, leading to overall changes in embryo architecture. In conjunction with IVEN-driven analyses, we uncover differences in the dynamic of cell size changes over the preimplantation period and determine that cells within the mammalian embryo initiate growth phase only at the time of implantation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Classification of small ruminant lentivirus subtype A2, subgroups 1 and 2 based on whole genome comparisons and complex recombination patterns [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) cause a multisystemic chronic wasting disease in sheep across much of the world. SRLV subtype A2 is prevalent in North America and further classified into multiple subgroups based on variation in the group antigens gene (gag) and envelope (env) genes. In sheep, the ovine transmembrane protein 154 (TMEM154) gene is associated with SRLV susceptibility. Ewes with at least one copy of TMEM154 encoding a full-length protein with glutamate at position 35 (E35; haplotypes 2 and 3), are highly susceptible to SRLV infection while ewes with any combination of TMEM154 haplotypes which encodes lysine (K35; haplotype 1), or truncated proteins (haplotypes 4 and 6) are several times less so. A2 subgroups 1 and 2 are associated with host TMEM154 genotypes; subgroup 1 with the K35/K35 genotype and subgroup 2 with the E35/E35 genotype. Methods:  Sequence variation within and among full-length assemblies of SRLV subtype A2 subgroups 1 and 2 was analyzed to identify genome-scale recombination patterns and subgroup-specific variants. Results:  Consensus viral genomes were assembled from 23 infected sheep, including animals of assorted TMEM154 genotypes comprised of haplotypes 1, 2, or 3. Viral genome analysis identified viral subgroups 1 and 2 among the samples, and revealed additional sub-structure within subgroup 2 based on models predicting complex patterns of recombination between the two subgroups in several genomes. Animals with evidence of dual subgroup infection also possessed the most diverse quasi-species and the most highly recombined consensus genomes. After accounting for recombination, 413 subgroup diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Conclusions:  The viral subgroup framework developed to classify SRLV consensus genomes along a continuum of recombination suggests that animals with the TMEM154 E35/K35 genotype may represent a reservoir for producing viral genomes representing recombination between A2 subgroups 1 and 2.

                Background: Women with epilepsy face difficult choices whether to continue antiepileptic drug treatment during pregnancy, as uncontrolled seizures carry great risk to mother and fetus but continuing treatment may have adverse effects on baby’s development. This study aimed at evaluating antiepileptic drug entry into developing brain. Methods: Anaesthetised pregnant, non-pregnant adult females, postnatal and fetal rats were injected intraperitoneally with different doses, single or in combinations, of valproate and lamotrigine, within clinical range. Injectate included 3H-labelled drug. After 30min, CSF, blood and brain samples were obtained; radioactivity measured using liquid scintillation counting. Some animals were also exposed to valproate in feed throughout pregnancy and into neonatal period. Drug levels measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results given as CSF or tissue/plasma% as index of drug entry. Results: Entry of valproate into brain and CSF was higher at E19 and P4 compared to adult and was dose-dependent except at E19; placental transfer increased significantly at highest dose of 100mg/kg. Lamotrigine entry into the brain was dose dependent only at E19. Chronic valproate treatment, or combination of valproate and lamotrigine had little effect on either drug entry, except for reduced valproate brain entry in adult brain with chronic treatment. Placental transfer decreased significantly after chronic valproate treatment. LC-MS measurement of valproate in adults confirmed that rat plasma values were within the clinical range and CSF/plasma and brain/plasma ratios for LC-MS and 3H-valproate were similar. Conclusion: Results suggest that entry of valproate may be higher in developing brain, the capacity of barrier mechanism is mostly unaffected by doses within the clinical range, with or without addition of lamotrigine. Chronic valproate exposure may result in upregulation in cellular mechanisms restricting its entry into the brain. Entry of lamotrigine was little different at different ages and was not dose dependent.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As an effective antiviral therapy is not available for the treatment of the current rapidly and continuously spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is very crucial to find an alternative treatment strategy. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has been used for prevention and treatment of many emerging infectious diseases, however, the results of current studies on CP in COVID-19 are not consistent. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CP therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while evaluating patient and donor-related factors that might influence the therapeutic outcome. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 312 patients with either severe or critical COVID-19, who were admitted to Al-Hakeem and Al-Amal hospitals in Al-Najaf city, Iraq from June to August 2020.  The patients were allocated to either the plasma therapy group (152 patients) who received CP combined with standard therapy or the standard therapy group (160 patients). The outcome measures were the 21-day mortality rate and time to clinical improvement. Results: The overall cumulative survival rate was significantly higher in patients who received CP compared to standard therapy alone at 21 days (68.3% vs. 46.8%, p-value = 0.010), with mean survival at 17.6 vs. 15.3 days, (p-value = 0.010). In multivariate analysis, the plasma therapy effect was an independent predictor of survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval: 0.368, 0.177 – 0.765). In terms of clinical improvement, the use of CP resulted in shorter clinical improvement (median duration of improvement: 8 vs. 11 days, p-value = 0.007), with 74.3% improvement rate after 21 days in CP compared to 65.0% in standard therapy. Conclusions: Therapy with CP in combination with standard therapy, independently improved survival in hospitalized patient with severe or critical COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Long-term effect of full-body pulsed electromagnetic field and exercise protocol in the treatment of men with osteopenia or osteoporosis: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic disease affecting bones. Objective: To investigate the long-term effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) combined with exercise protocol on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers in men with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Methods: Ninety-five males with osteopenia or osteoporosis (mean age, 51.26 ± 2.41 years; mean height, 176 ± 2.02 cm; mean weight, 83.08 ± 2.60 kg; mean body–mass index (BMI), 26.08 ± 1.09 kg/m2) participated in the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received a full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PEMF +EX), Group 2 received a placebo full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PPEMF +EX), and Group 3 received a full-body PEMF alone (PEMF). PEMF was applied for the whole body using a full-body mat three times per week for 12 weeks, with an exercise protocol that includes flexibility, aerobic exercise, strengthening, weight-bearing, and balance exercises followed by whole-body vibration (WBV) training. Outcome measures include BMD of total hip and lumbar spine and bone markers [serum osteocalcin (s-OC), Serum amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-NTX), Serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX), Parathyroid hormones (PTH), Bone-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (Vit D)]. Results: The BMD of total hip and lumbar spine was significantly increased post-treatment in all groups, and more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than Group 3. There was a significant difference in bone markers in all groups, more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than in Group 3. Conclusion: PEMF combined with exercise protocol exerts a potent role for treating OP, is more effective than exercise and PEMF alone for increasing BMD and enhancing bone formation, and suppresses bone-resorption markers after 12-weeks of treatment with the impact lasting up to 6 months.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Metabolite signature of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the Alzheimer's Disease metabolite signature through magnetic resonance spectroscopy in adults with Down syndrome and its relation with Alzheimer's Disease biomarkers and cortical thickness.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 118 adults with Down syndrome from the Down Alzheimer Barcelona Imaging Initiative and 71 euploid healthy controls from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration cohort. We measured the levels of myo-inositol (a marker of neuroinflammation) and N-acetyl-aspartate (a marker of neuronal integrity) in the precuneus using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We investigated the changes with age and along the disease continuum (asymptomatic, prodromal Alzheimer's Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease dementia stages). We assessed the relationship between these metabolites and Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio, phosphorylated tau-181, NfL, and YKL-40 Cerebrospinal fluid levels as well as amyloid positron emission tomography uptake using Spearman correlations controlling for multiple comparisons. Finally, we computed the relationship between cortical thickness and metabolite levels using Freesurfer.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Asymptomatic adults with Down syndrome had a 27.5% increase in the levels of myo-inositol, but equal levels of N-acetyl-aspartate compared to euploid healthy controls. With disease progression, myo-inositol levels increased while N-acetyl-aspartate levels decreased in symptomatic stages of the disease. Myo-inositol was associated with amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration markers, mainly at symptomatic stages of the disease, whereas N-acetyl-aspartate was related to neurodegeneration biomarkers in symptomatic stages. Both metabolites were significantly associated with cortical thinning, mainly in symptomatic participants.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy detects Alzheimer's disease related inflammation and neurodegeneration, and could be a good noninvasive disease-stage biomarker in Down syndrome.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sequence structure organizes items in varied latent states of working memory neural network</a></h4>

              
                In memory experiences, events do not exist independently but are linked with each other via structure-based organization. Structure context largely influences memory behavior, but how it is implemented in the brain remains unknown. Here, we combined magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings, computational modeling, and impulse-response approaches to probe the latent states when subjects held a list of items in working memory (WM). We demonstrate that sequence context reorganizes WM items into distinct latent states, i.e., being reactivated at different latencies during WM retention, and the reactivation profiles further correlate with recency behavior. In contrast, memorizing the same list of items without sequence task requirements weakens the recency effect and elicits comparable neural reactivations. Computational modeling further reveals a dominant function of sequence context, instead of passive memory decaying, in characterizing recency effect. Taken together, sequence structure context shapes the way WM items are stored in the human brain and essentially influences memory behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Autoregulatory control of microtubule binding in doublecortin-like kinase 1</a></h4>

              
                The microtubule-associated protein, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), is highly expressed in a range of cancers and is a prominent therapeutic target for kinase inhibitors. The physiological roles of DCLK1 kinase activity and how it is regulated remain elusive. Here, we analyze the role of mammalian DCLK1 kinase activity in regulating microtubule binding. We find that DCLK1 autophosphorylates a residue within its C-terminal tail to restrict its kinase activity and prevent aberrant hyperphosphorylation within its microtubule-binding domain. Removal of the C-terminal tail or mutation of this residue causes an increase in phosphorylation within the doublecortin domains, which abolishes microtubule binding. Therefore, autophosphorylation at specific sites within DCLK1 have diametric effects on the molecule's association with microtubules. Our results suggest a mechanism by which DCLK1 modulates its kinase activity to tune its microtubule-binding affinity. These results provide molecular insights for future therapeutic efforts related to DCLK1's role in cancer development and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cdc4 phospho-degrons allow differential regulation of Ame1CENP-U protein stability across the cell cycle</a></h4>

              
                Kinetochores are multi-subunit protein assemblies that link chromosomes to microtubules of the mitotic and meiotic spindle. It is still poorly understood how efficient, centromere-dependent kinetochore assembly is accomplished from hundreds of individual protein building blocks in a cell cycle dependent manner. Here, by combining comprehensive phosphorylation analysis of native Ctf19<sup>CCAN</sup> subunits with biochemical and functional assays in the model system budding yeast, we demonstrate that Cdk1 phosphorylation activates phospho-degrons on the essential subunit Ame1<sup>CENP-U </sup>which are recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF-Cdc4. Gradual phosphorylation of degron motifs culminates in M-Phase and targets the protein for degradation. Binding of the Mtw1<sup>Mis12</sup> complex shields the proximal phospho-degron, protecting kinetochore-bound Ame1 from the degradation machinery. Artificially increasing degron strength partially suppresses the temperature-sensitivity of a <i>cdc4</i> mutant, while overexpression of Ame1-Okp1 is toxic in SCF mutants, demonstrating the physiological importance of this mechanism. We propose that phospho-regulated clearance of excess CCAN subunits facilitates efficient centromere-dependent kinetochore assembly. Our results suggest a novel strategy for how phospho-degrons can be used to regulate the assembly of multi-subunit complexes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Predominantly linear summation of metabotropic postsynaptic potentials follows coactivation of neurogliaform interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Summation of ionotropic receptor-mediated responses is critical in neuronal computation by shaping input-output characteristics of neurons. However, arithmetics of summation for metabotropic signals are not known. We characterized the combined ionotropic and metabotropic output of neocortical neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) using electrophysiological and anatomical methods in the rat cerebral cortex. These experiments revealed that GABA receptors are activated outside release sites and confirmed coactivation of putative NGFCs in superficial cortical layers in vivo. Triple recordings from presynaptic NGFCs converging to a postsynaptic neuron revealed sublinear summation of ionotropic GABAA responses and linear summation of metabotropic GABAB responses. Based on a model combining properties of volume transmission and distributions of all NGFC axon terminals, we predict that in 83% of cases one or two NGFCs can provide input to a point in the neuropil. We suggest that interactions of metabotropic GABAergic responses remain linear even if most superficial layer interneurons specialized to recruit GABAB receptors are simultaneously active.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A Brownian ratchet model for DNA loop extrusion by the cohesin complex</a></h4>

              
                The cohesin complex topologically encircles DNA to promote sister chromatid cohesion. Alternatively, cohesin extrudes DNA loops, thought to reflect chromatin domain formation. Here, we propose a structure-based model explaining both activities. ATP and DNA binding promote cohesin conformational changes that guide DNA through a kleisin N-gate into a DNA gripping state. Two HEAT-repeat DNA binding modules, associated with cohesin’s heads and hinge, are now juxtaposed. Gripping state disassembly, following ATP hydrolysis, triggers unidirectional hinge module movement, which completes topological DNA entry by directing DNA through the ATPase head gate. If head gate passage fails, hinge module motion creates a Brownian ratchet that, instead, drives loop extrusion. Molecular-mechanical simulations of gripping state formation and resolution cycles recapitulate experimentally observed DNA loop extrusion characteristics. Our model extends to asymmetric and symmetric loop extrusion, as well as z-loop formation. Loop extrusion by biased Brownian motion has important implications for chromosomal cohesin function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Living with relatives offsets the harm caused by pathogens in natural populations</a></h4>

              
                Living with relatives can be highly beneficial, enhancing reproduction and survival. High relatedness can, however, increase susceptibility to pathogens. Here, we examine whether the benefits of living with relatives offset the harm caused by pathogens, and if this depends on whether species typically live with kin. Using comparative meta-analysis of plants, animals, and a bacterium (<i>n</i><sub>species</sub> = 56), we show that high within-group relatedness increases mortality when pathogens are present. In contrast, mortality decreased with relatedness when pathogens were rare, particularly in species that live with kin. Furthermore, across groups variation in mortality was lower when relatedness was high, but abundances of pathogens were more variable. The effects of within-group relatedness were only evident when pathogens were experimentally manipulated, suggesting that the harm caused by pathogens is masked by the benefits of living with relatives in nature. These results highlight the importance of kin selection for understanding disease spread in natural populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spike frequency adaptation supports network computations on temporally dispersed information</a></h4>

              
                For solving tasks such as recognizing a song, answering a question, or inverting a sequence of symbols, cortical microcircuits need to integrate and manipulate information that was dispersed over time during the preceding seconds. Creating biologically realistic models for the underlying computations, especially with spiking neurons and for behaviorally relevant integration time spans, is notoriously difficult. We examine the role of spike frequency adaptation in such computations and find that it has a surprisingly large impact. The inclusion of this well-known property of a substantial fraction of neurons in the neocortex – especially in higher areas of the human neocortex – moves the performance of spiking neural network models for computations on network inputs that are temporally dispersed from a fairly low level up to the performance level of the human brain.

                Respiratory complex I is a multi-subunit membrane protein complex that reversibly couples NADH oxidation and ubiquinone reduction with proton translocation against trans-membrane potential. Complex I from <i>Escherichia coli </i>is among the best functionally characterized complexes, but its structure remains unknown, hindering further mechanistic studies to understand the enzyme coupling mechanism. Here we describe the single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the entire catalytically active <i>E. coli</i> complex I reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. The structure of this mesophilic bacterial complex I displays highly dynamic connection between the peripheral and membrane domains. The peripheral domain assembly is stabilized by unique terminal extensions and an insertion loop. The membrane domain structure reveals novel dynamic features. Unusual conformation of the conserved interface between the peripheral and membrane domains suggests an uncoupled conformation of the complex. Considering constraints imposed by the structural data we suggest a new simple hypothetical coupling mechanism for the molecular machine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HOXA9 promotes MYC-mediated leukemogenesis by maintaining gene expression for multiple anti-apoptotic pathways</a></h4>

              
                HOXA9 is often highly expressed in leukemias. However, its precise roles in leukemogenesis remain elusive. Here, we show that HOXA9 maintains gene expression for multiple anti-apoptotic pathways to promote leukemogenesis. In MLL fusion-mediated leukemia, MLL fusion directly activates the expression of MYC and HOXA9. Combined expression of MYC and HOXA9 induced leukemia, whereas single gene transduction of either did not, indicating a synergy between MYC and HOXA9. HOXA9 sustained expression of the genes implicated in the hematopoietic precursor identity when expressed in hematopoietic precursors, but did not reactivate it once silenced. Among the HOXA9 target genes, <i>BCL2</i> and <i>SOX4</i> synergistically induced leukemia with <i>MYC</i>. Not only BCL2, but also SOX4 suppressed apoptosis, indicating that multiple anti-apoptotic pathways underlie cooperative leukemogenesis by HOXA9 and MYC. These results demonstrate that HOXA9 is a crucial transcriptional maintenance factor that promotes MYC-mediated leukemogenesis, potentially explaining why HOXA9 is highly expressed in many leukemias.

                Chondrocytes in the resting zone of the postnatal growth plate are characterized by slow cell cycle progression, and encompass a population of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-expressing skeletal stem cells that contribute to the formation of columnar chondrocytes. However, how these chondrocytes are maintained in the resting zone remains undefined. We undertook a genetic pulse-chase approach to isolate slow cycling, label-retaining chondrocytes (LRCs) using a chondrocyte-specific doxycycline-controllable Tet-Off system regulating expression of histone 2B-linked GFP. Comparative RNA-seq analysis identified significant enrichment of inhibitors and activators for Wnt signaling in LRCs and non-LRCs, respectively. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PTHrP<sup>+</sup> resting chondrocytes using <i>Pthlh-creER</i> and <i>Apc</i>-floxed allele impaired their ability to form columnar chondrocytes. Therefore, slow-cycling chondrocytes are maintained in a Wnt-inhibitory environment within the resting zone, unraveling a novel mechanism regulating maintenance and differentiation of PTHrP<sup>+</sup> skeletal stem cells of the postnatal growth plate.

To fill these gaps, this work exploits a method for defining vector representations that bind discrete (symbol-like) entities to points in continuous topological spaces in order to simulate and predict the behavior of a range of dynamical systems. These vector representations are spatial semantic pointers (SSPs), and we demonstrate that they can (1) be used to model dynamical systems involving multiple objects represented in a symbol-like manner and (2) be integrated with deep neural networks to predict the future of physical trajectories. These results help unify what have traditionally appeared to be disparate approaches in machine learning.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection">The Fisher information matrix (FIM) plays an essential role in statistics and machine learning as a Riemannian metric tensor or a component of the Hessian matrix of loss functions. Focusing on the FIM and its variants in deep neural networks (DNNs), we reveal their characteristic scale dependence on the network width, depth, and sample size when the network has random weights and is sufficiently wide. This study covers two widely used FIMs for regression with linear output and for classification with softmax output. Both FIMs asymptotically show pathological eigenvalue spectra in the sense that a small number of eigenvalues become large outliers depending on the width or sample size, while the others are much smaller. It implies that the local shape of the parameter space or loss landscape is very sharp in a few specific directions while almost flat in the other directions. In particular, the softmax output disperses the outliers and makes a tail of the eigenvalue density spread from the bulk. We also show that pathological spectra appear in other variants of FIMs: one is the neural tangent kernel; another is a metric for the input signal and feature space that arises from feedforward signal propagation. Thus, we provide a unified perspective on the FIM and its variants that will lead to more quantitative understanding of learning in large-scale DNNs.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection">Summarizing large-scale directed graphs into small-scale representations is a useful but less-studied problem setting. Conventional clustering approaches, based on Min-Cut-style criteria, compress both the vertices and edges of the graph into the communities, which lead to a loss of directed edge information. On the other hand, compressing the vertices while preserving the directed-edge information provides a way to learn the small-scale representation of a directed graph. The reconstruction error, which measures the edge information preserved by the summarized graph, can be used to learn such representation. Compared to the original graphs, the summarized graphs are easier to analyze and are capable of extracting group-level features, useful for efficient interventions of population behavior. In this letter, we present a model, based on minimizing reconstruction error with nonnegative constraints, which relates to a Max-Cut criterion that simultaneously identifies the compressed nodes and the directed compressed relations between these nodes. A multiplicative update algorithm with column-wise normalization is proposed. We further provide theoretical results on the identifiability of the model and the convergence of the proposed algorithms. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.</span>

              <h4><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/neco">Learning Brain Dynamics With Coupled Low-Dimensional Nonlinear Oscillators and Deep Recurrent Networks</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection">Many natural systems, especially biological ones, exhibit complex multivariate nonlinear dynamical behaviors that can be hard to capture by linear autoregressive models. On the other hand, generic nonlinear models such as deep recurrent neural networks often require large amounts of training data, not always available in domains such as brain imaging; also, they often lack interpretability. Domain knowledge about the types of dynamics typically observed in such systems, such as a certain type of dynamical systems models, could complement purely data-driven techniques by providing a good prior. In this work, we consider a class of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models known as van der Pol (VDP) oscil lators and evaluate their ability to capture a low-dimensional representation of neural activity measured by different brain imaging modalities, such as calcium imaging (CaI) and fMRI, in different living organisms: larval zebrafish, rat, and human. We develop a novel and efficient approach to the nontrivial problem of parameters estimation for a network of coupled dynamical systems from multivariate data and demonstrate that the resulting VDP models are both accurate and interpretable, as VDP's coupling matrix reveals anatomically meaningful excitatory and inhibitory interactions across different brain subsystems. VDP outperforms linear autoregressive models (VAR) in terms of both the data fit accuracy and the quality of insight provided by the coupling matrices and often tends to generalize better to unseen data when predicting future brain activity, being comparable to and sometimes better than the recurrent neural networks (LSTMs). Finally, we demonstrate that our (generative) VDP model can also serve as a data-augmentation tool leading to marked improvements in predictive accuracy of recurrent neural networks. Thus, our work contributes to both basic and applied dimensions of neuroimaging: gaining scientific insights and improving brain-based predictive models, an area of potentially high practical importance in clinical diagnosis and neurotechnology.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection">Deep learning is often criticized by two serious issues that rarely exist in natural nervous systems: overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. It can even memorize randomly labeled data, which has little knowledge behind the instance-label pairs. When a deep network continually learns over time by accommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Referred to as the <span style="font-style:italic;">neural variability</span>, it is well known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous systems. Thus, it motivates us to design a similar mechanism, named <span style="font-style:italic;">artificial neural variability</span> (ANV), that helps artificial neural networks learn some advantages from “natural” neural networks. We rigorously prove that ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the training data and the learned model. This result theoretically guarantees ANV a strictly improved generalizability, robustness to label noise, and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We then devise a <span style="font-style:italic;">neural variable risk minimization</span> (NVRM) framework and <span style="font-style:italic;">neural variable optimizers</span> to achieve ANV for conventional network architectures in practice. The empirical studies demonstrate that NVRM can effectively relieve overfitting, label noise memorization, and catastrophic forgetting at negligible costs.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection">A complex-valued Hopfield neural network (CHNN) is a multistate Hopfield model. A quaternion-valued Hopfield neural network (QHNN) with a twin-multistate activation function was proposed to reduce the number of weight parameters of CHNN. Dual connections (DCs) are introduced to the QHNNs to improve the noise tolerance. The DCs take advantage of the noncommutativity of quaternions and consist of two weights between neurons. A QHNN with DCs provides much better noise tolerance than a CHNN. Although a CHNN and a QHNN with DCs have the samenumber of weight parameters, the storage capacity of projection rule for QHNNs with DCs is half of that for CHNNs and equals that of conventional QHNNs. The small storage capacity of QHNNs with DCs is caused by projection rule, not the architecture. In this work, the ebbian rule is introduced and proved by stochastic analysis that the storage capacity of a QHNN with DCs is 0.8 times as many as that of a CHNN.</span>

              <h4><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/neco">Power Function Error Initialization Can Improve Convergence of Backpropagation Learning in Neural Networks for Classification</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection">Supervised learning corresponds to minimizing a loss or cost function expressing the differences between model predictions yn and the target values tn given by the training data. In neural networks, this means backpropagating error signals through the transposed weight matrixes from the output layer toward the input layer. For this, error signals in the output layer are typically initialized by the difference yn- tn, which is optimal for several commonly used loss functions like cross-entropy or sum of squared errors. Here I evaluate a more general error initialization method using power functions |yn- tn|q for q&gt;0, corresponding to a new family of loss functions that generalize cross-entropy. Surprisingly, experiments on various learning tasks reveal that a proper choice of q can significantly improve the speed and convergence of backpropagation learning, in particular in deep and recurrent neural networks. The results suggest two main reasons for the observed improvements. First, compared to cross-entropy, the new loss functions provide better fits to the distribution of error signals in the output layer and therefore maximize the model's likelihood more efficiently. Second, the new error initialization procedure may often provide a better gradient-to-loss ratio over a broad range of neural output activity, thereby avoiding flat loss landscapes with vanishing gradients.</span>

The proposed algorithm is tested on one-, two- and three-dimensional tasks, as well as on the MNIST handwritten digits data set and validated using spectral analysis and topological data analysis tools. We also demonstrate the ability of the randomized self-organizing map to gracefully reorganize itself in case of neural lesion and/or neurogenesis.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection">Neurons are connected to other neurons by axons and dendrites that conduct signals with finite velocities, resulting in delays between the firing of a neuron and the arrival of the resultant impulse at other neurons. Since delays greatly complicate the analytical treatment and interpretation of models, they are usually neglected or taken to be uniform, leading to a lack in the comprehension of the effects of delays in neural systems. This letter shows that heterogeneous transmission delays make small groups of neurons respond selectively to inputs with differing frequency spectra. By studying a single integrate-and-fire neuron receiving correlated time-shifted inputs, it is shown how the frequency response is linked to both the strengths and delay times of the afferent connections. The results show that incorporating delays alters the functioning of neural networks, and changes the effect that neural connections and synaptic strengths have.</span>

                Age and sex have been associated with changes in functional brain network topology, which may in turn affect cognition in older adults. We explored this question further by examining differences in 11 resting-state graph theory measures with respect to age, sex, and their relationships with cognitive performance in 17,127 UK Biobank participants. Age was associated with an overall decrease in the effectiveness of network communication (i.e. integration) and loss of functional specialisation (i.e. segregation) of specific brain regions. Sex differences were also observed, with women showing more efficient networks which were less segregated than in men. Age-related changes were also more apparent in men than women, which suggests that men may be more vulnerable to cognitive decline with age. Interestingly, while network segregation and strength of limbic network were only nominally associated with cognitive performance, the network measures collectively were significantly associated with cognition. This may imply that individual measures may be inadequate to capture much of the variance in neural activity or its output and need further refinement.

                Expected reward is known to affect planning strategies through modulation of movement vigor. Strikingly, although current theories suggest that movement planning consists in selecting a goal-directed control policy, the influence of reward on feedback control strategies remains unknown. Here we investigated this question in three human reaching experiments. First, we varied the explicit reward associated with the goal target and found an overall increase in movement vigor for higher reward targets, highlighted by larger velocities, feedback responses to external loads, and background muscle activity. Then, assuming that larger feedback gains were used to reject perturbations, we sought to investigate whether this effect hindered online decisions to switch to a new target in the presence of multiple successful goals. We indeed observed idiosyncratic switching strategies dependent on both target rewards and movement vigor, such that the more vigorous movements were less likely to switch to a new goal following perturbations. To gain further insight into a causal influence of movement vigor on rapid motor decisions, we demonstrated that biasing the baseline activity and reflex gains by means of a background load evoked a larger proportion of target switches in the direction opposite to the background load associated with lower muscle activity. Our results highlight the competition between movement vigor and flexibility to switch target during movement.

                Spontaneous neuronal activity strongly impacts stimulus encoding and behavioral responses. We sought to determine the effects of neocortical prestimulus activity on stimulus detection. We trained mice in a selective whisker detection task, in which they learned to respond (lick) to target stimuli in one whisker field and ignore distractor stimuli in the contralateral whisker field. During expert task performance, we used widefield Ca2+ imaging to assess prestimulus and post-stimulus neuronal activity broadly across frontal and parietal cortices. We found that lower prestimulus activity correlated with enhanced stimulus detection: lower prestimulus activity predicted response versus no response outcomes and faster reaction times. The activity predictive of trial outcome was distributed through dorsal neocortex, rather than being restricted to whisker or licking regions. Using principal component analysis, we demonstrate that response trials are associated with a distinct and less variable prestimulus neuronal subspace. For single units, prestimulus choice probability was weak yet distributed broadly, with lower than chance choice probability correlating with stronger sensory and motor encoding. These findings support a low amplitude, low variability, optimal prestimulus cortical state for stimulus detection that presents globally and predicts response outcomes for both target and distractor stimuli.

                Humans and many animals devalue future rewards as a function of time (temporal discounting). Increased discounting has been linked to various psychiatric conditions, including substance-use-disorders, behavioral addictions and obesity. Despite its high intra-individual stability, temporal discounting is partly under contextual control. One prominent manipulation that has been linked to increases in discounting is the exposure to highly arousing appetitive cues. However, results from trial-wise cue exposure studies appear highly mixed, and changes in physiological arousal were not adequately controlled. Here we tested the effects of appetitive (erotic), aversive and neutral visual cues on temporal discounting in thirty-five healthy male participants. The contribution of single-trial physiological arousal was assessed using comprehensive monitoring of autonomic activity (pupil size, heart rate, electrodermal activity). Physiological arousal was elevated following aversive and in particular erotic cues. In contrast to our pre-registered hypothesis, if anything, we observed decreased temporal discounting following erotic cue exposure. Aversive cues tended to increase decision noise. Computational modeling revealed that trial-wise arousal only accounted for minor variance over and above aversive and erotic condition effects, arguing against a general effect of physiological arousal on temporal discounting.

                The conceptualization of emotional states as patterns of interactions between large-scale brain networks has recently gained support. Yet, few studies have directly examined the brain's network structure during emotional experiences. Here, we investigated the brain's functional network organization during experiences of sadness, amusement, and neutral states elicited by movies, in addition to a resting-state. We tested the effects of the experienced emotion on individual variability in the brain's functional connectome. Next, for each state, we defined a modular organization of the brain and quantified its segregation and integration. Our results show that emotional states increase the similarity between and within individuals in the brain's functional connectome. Second, in the brain's modular organization, sadness, relative to amusement, was associated with higher integration and increased connectivity of cognitive control networks: the salience and fronto-parietal networks. Modular metrics of brain segregation and integration were further associated with the reported emotional valence. Last, in both the functional connectome and emotional report, a higher similarity was found among women. Our results suggest that the experience of emotion is linked to a reconfiguration of whole-brain distributed, not emotion-specific, functional brain networks and that the topological structure carries information about the subjective emotional experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectivity between the hippocampus and default mode network during the relief, but not elicitation, of curiositysupports curiosity-enhanced memory enhancements</a></h4>

              
                Consistent with the idea that curiosity enhances information seeking, it has been shown that activity within both the dopaminergic circuit and hippocampus supports curiosity-enhanced learning. However, the role of whole-brain mechanisms involved in cognitive control (fronto-parietal network; FPN) and memory integration (default mode network; DMN) that might underpin curiosity states and their effects on memory remain elusive. We hypothesised that the FPN and DMN should distinguish between high- and low-curiosity conditions and be recruited more heavily for later remembered information associated with high-curiosity. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging whilst participants completed a trivia paradigm, in which we presented trivia questions associated with high- and low-curiosity, followed by the associated answer. After a short delay, we tested memory for trivia answers. We adopted a network-based parcellation of the brain into subnetworks of the FPN and DMN to examine how neural activity within, and functional connectivity between, each subnetwork predicts curiosity-enhanced memory. Across elicitation and relief of curiosity, we found focal recruitment of FPNA and widespread recruitment of DMN subnetworks in support of curiosity and curiosity-enhanced memory. Most importantly, during the elicitation of curiosity, functional subcortical connectivity and across cortical networks, but not subcortical-cortical coupling, correlated with curiosity-enhanced memory. However, during the relief of curiosity, coupling between subcortical regions and DMNA emerged in support of curiosity-enhanced memory. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence about how neuromodulatory mechanisms via the hippocampal-dopaminergic circuit trigger states of curiosity and thereby communicate to higher-order cortical regions to facilitate curiosity-enhanced memory.

                Escalation of drug use is a hallmark stage in the transition to addiction and uncovering its underlying brain molecular mechanisms constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, we report in rats with extended access to heroin for self-administration that miR-3594-5p was upregulated in the dorsal striatum at late, but not early, stages during escalation when excessive heroin intake plateaued. Striatal miR-3594-5p bound directly to the 3'UTR region of Sez6 transcript and inhibited its expression, thereby decreasing the mature form of the translated SEZ6 protein. This miR-3594-5p/Sez6 interaction was specific to heroin, as it was not observed with cocaine, and correlated with the severity of heroin intake escalation. Our findings reveal that miRNA alterations during escalation of drug self-administration are spatially and temporally regulated and drug-specific.

                For mammals, successful parturition and breastfeeding are critical to the survival of offspring. Pulsatile release of the hormone oxytocin mediates uterine contraction during parturition and milk ejection during lactation. These oxytocin pulses are generated by unique activity patterns of the central neuroendocrine oxytocin neurons located in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamus. However, the maternal activities of oxytocin neurons remain elusive because most classical electrophysiological studies in anesthetized rats have lacked the genetically defined cell identity of oxytocin neurons. We herein introduce viral genetic approaches in mice to characterize the maternal pulsatile activities of oxytocin neurons by fiber-photometry-based chronic in vivo Ca2+ imaging. We also demonstrate the pharmaco-genetic manipulation of oxytocin pulses during lactation via activating a prominent pre-synaptic structure of oxytocin neurons defined by retrograde trans-synaptic tracing. Collectively, our study opens a new avenue for the neuroscience of maternal neuroendocrine functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of theta transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on exploration and exploitation during uncertain decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Exploring ones surroundings may yield unexpected rewards, but is associated with uncertainty and risk. Alternatively, exploitation of certain outcomes is related to low risk, yet potentially better outcomes remain unexamined. As such, risk-taking behavior depends on perceived uncertainty and a trade-off between exploration-exploitation. Previously, it has been suggested that risk-taking may relate to theta activity in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, previous studies hinted at a relationship between a right-hemispheric bias in frontal theta asymmetry and risky behavior. In the present double-blind sham-controlled within-subject study, we applied bifrontal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at the theta frequency (5 Hz) on eighteen healthy volunteers during a gambling task. Two tACS montages with either left-right or posterior-anterior current flow were employed at an intensity of 1 mA. Results showed that, compared to sham, theta tACS increased perceived uncertainty irrespective of current flow direction. Despite this observation, no direct effect of tACS on exploration behavior and general risk-taking was observed. Furthermore, frontal theta asymmetry was more right-hemispherically biased after posterior-anterior tACS, compared to sham. Finally, we used electric field simulation to identify which regions were targeted by the tACS montages as an overlap in regions may explain why the two montages resulted in comparable outcomes. Our findings provide a first step towards understanding the relationship between frontal theta oscillations and different features of risk-taking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A single exposure to altered auditory feedback causes observable sensorimotor adaptation in speech</a></h4>

              
                Sensory errors caused by perturbations to movement-related feedback induce two types of behavioral changes that oppose the perturbation: rapid compensation within a movement, as well as longer-term adaptation of subsequent movements. Although adaptation is hypothesized to occur whenever a sensory error is perceived (including after a single exposure to altered feedback), adaptation of articulatory movements in speech has only been observed after repetitive exposure to auditory perturbations, questioning both current theories of speech sensorimotor adaptation as well as the universality of more general theories of adaptation. Thus, positive evidence for the hypothesized single-exposure or 'one-shot' learning would provide critical support for current theories of speech sensorimotor learning and control and align adaptation in speech more closely with other motor domains. We measured one-shot learning in a large dataset in which participants were exposed to intermittent, unpredictable auditory perturbations to their vowel formants (the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract that distinguish between different vowels). On each trial, participants spoke a word out loud while their first formant was shifted up, shifted down, or remained unshifted. We examined whether the perturbation on a given trial affected speech on the subsequent, unperturbed trial. We found that participants adjusted their first formant in the opposite direction of the preceding shift, demonstrating that learning occurs even after a single auditory perturbation as predicted by current theories of sensorimotor adaptation. While adaptation and the preceding compensation responses were correlated, this was largely due to differences across individuals rather than within-participant variation from trial to trial. These findings are more consistent with theories that hypothesize adaptation is driven directly by updates to internal control models than those that suggest adaptation results from incorporation of feedback responses from previous productions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neuronal code for space in hippocampal coactivity dynamics independent of place fields</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampus CA1 place cells express a spatial neural code by discharging action potentials in cell-specific locations ('place fields'), but their discharge timing is also coordinated by multiple mechanisms, suggesting an alternative 'ensemble cofiring' neural code, potentially distinct from place fields. We compare the importance of these distinct information representation schemes for encoding environments. Using miniature microscopes, we recorded the ensemble activity of mouse CA1 principal neurons expressing GCaMP6f across a multi-week experience of two distinct environments. We find that both place fields and ensemble coactivity relationships are similarly reliable within environments and distinctive between environments. Decoding the environment from cell-pair coactivity relationships is effective and improves after removing cell-specific place tuning. Ensemble decoding relies most crucially on anti-coactive cell pairs distributed across CA1 and is independent of place cell firing fields. We conclude that ensemble cofiring relationships constitute an advantageous neural code for environmental space, independent of place fields.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Caldendrin represses neurite regeneration via a sex-dependent mechanism in sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Caldendrin is a calmodulin-like Ca2+ binding protein that is expressed primarily in neurons and regulates multiple effectors including Cav1 L-type Ca2+ channels. Here, we tested the hypothesis that caldendrin regulates Cav1-dependent pathways that repress neurite growth in dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs). By immunofluorescence, caldendrin was localized in medium- and large- diameter DRGNs. Consistent with an inhibitory effect of caldendrin on neurite growth, neurite initiation and growth was enhanced in dissociated DRGNs from caldendrin knockout (KO) mice compared to those from wild type (WT) mice. In an in vitro axotomy assay, caldendrin KO DRGNs grew longer neurites via a mechanism that was more sensitive to inhibitors of transcription as compared to WT DRGNs. Strong depolarization, which normally represses neurite growth through activation of Cav1 channels, had no effect on neurite growth in DRGN cultures from female caldendrin KO mice. Remarkably, DRGNs from caldendrin KO males were no different from those of WT males in terms of depolarization-dependent neurite growth repression. We conclude that caldendrin opposes neurite regeneration and growth, and this involves coupling of Cav1 channels to growth-inhibitory pathways in DRGNs of females but not males. Our findings suggest that caldendrin KO mice represent an ideal model in which to interrogate the transcriptional pathways controlling neurite regeneration and how these pathways may differ in males and females.

                An image projected onto the retina is composed of local contrasts in color and brightness, both of which can aid in any visual perception task. Recent investigations of the mouse ventral retina demonstrate that rod and cone responses are combined to detect changes between UV and green light, thus providing a new model for color vision. An important question is how the spatial representations of both color and brightness contrast are transformed by downstream circuits. Its known that SF tuning of brightness contrast is sharpened at the level of mouse primary visual cortex, yet color contrast is untested. Here, we presented sinewave gratings that drive one of four axes of rod and cone contrast space, including brightness contrast (rod+cone) and color contrast (rod-cone). We find that V1 neurons are tuned to higher spatial frequencies of brightness contrast than color contrast, and are most responsive to color at the lowest spatial frequencies. These results are consistent with a model of single-opponency between rods and cones, but do not match its classic description. The data can instead be described by a simple model of convergent ON and OFF inputs to V1, which randomly pool discrete quantities of each photoreceptor class. Unlike classic depictions of single-opponency, this model requires minimal constraints on the circuit, accounts for our observed bandpass spatial frequency tuning of rod and cone isolating contrast, and is consistent with recent studies showing unselective pooling from photoreceptors in the retina.

                Corticofugal projections to evolutionarily ancient, sub-cortical structures are ubiquitous across mammalian sensory systems. These descending pathways enable the neocortex to control ascending sensory representations in a predictive or feedback manner, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we combine optogenetic approaches with in vivo and in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology to study the projection from auditory cortex to the inferior colliculus (IC), a major descending auditory pathway that controls IC neuron feature selectivity, plasticity and auditory perceptual learning. Although individual auditory cortico-collicular synapses were generally weak, IC neurons often integrated inputs from multiple corticofugal axons that generated reliable, tonic depolarizations even during prolonged presynaptic activity. Latency measurements in vivo showed that descending signals reach the IC within 30 ms of sound onset, which in IC neurons corresponded to the peak of synaptic depolarizations evoked by short sounds. Activating ascending and descending pathways at latencies expected in vivo caused a NMDA receptor dependent, supra-linear EPSP summation, indicating that descending signals can non-linearly amplify moment-to-moment acoustic responses. Our results shed light upon the synaptic bases of descending sensory control, and imply that heterosynaptic cooperativity contributes to sub-cortical plasticity and perceptual learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Understanding associative false memories in aging using multivariate analyses</a></h4>

              
                Associative memory declines in aging arise, in part, from age-related increases in false memories to recombined lures. Studies have shown that there is a benefit to associative memory if the configural context of associative pairs is maintained from encoding to retrieval. The current study aimed to examine whether this benefit of contextual congruency is reduced in aging, and whether the neural similarity of memory representations between targets and lures underlies age- related increases in false memories. Behaviorally, both age groups benefited from target pairs presented in a visual format that was congruent with how the pair was learned. While no age difference was observed in hits, the typical age-related increase in false alarms was found. Congruent with behavioral results, neither the relationship between target-related patterns of neural activity across memory phases (as measured by ERS) nor the discriminability of target classification as a function of condition at retrieval (as measured by MVPA). However, with regard to false memories, older adults exhibited overall lower pattern similarity for hits and FAs compared to hits and CRs (as measured by RSA). Additionally, Hit-FA RSA correlated with age- related increases in associative FAs across visual, frontal, and parietal cortices. Results suggest that while neural processes supporting associative memory retrieval are dependent on configural congruency between encoding and retrieval, there is no difference as to how congruency affects these processes in aging. Additionally, similarity of target and lure processing may reflect reduced diagnosticity of information processing in aging.

                No therapy is currently available for CDKL5 (cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5) deficiency disorder (CDD), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene. Although delivery of a wild-type copy of the mutated gene to cells represents the most curative approach for a monogenic disease, proof-of-concept studies highlight significant efficacy caveats for brain gene therapy. Herein, we used a secretable TATk-CDKL5 protein to enhance the efficiency of a gene therapy for CDD. We found that, although AAVPHP.B_Igk-TATk-CDKL5 and AAVPHP.B_CDKL5 vectors had similar brain infection efficiency, the AAVPHP.B_Igk-TATk-CDKL5 vector led to a higher CDKL5 protein replacement due to secretion and transduction of the TATk-CDKL5 protein into the neighboring cells. Importantly, Cdkl5 KO mice treated with the AAVPHP.B_Igk-TATk-CDKL5 vector showed a behavioral and neuroanatomical improvement in comparison with vehicle-treated Cdkl5 KO mice or Cdkl5 KO mice treated with the AAVPHP.B_CDKL5 vector, indicating that a gene therapy based on a secretable recombinant TATk-CDKL5 protein is more effective at compensating Cdkl5-null brain defects than gene therapy based on the expression of the native CDKL5.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resiniferatoxin hampers the nocifensive response of Caenorhabditis elegans to noxious heat, and pathway analysis revealed that the Wnt signaling pathway is involved</a></h4>

              
                Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is a metabolite extracted from Euphorbia resinifera. RTX is a potent capsaicin analog with specific biological activities resulting from its agonist activity with the transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). RTX has been examined as a pain reliever, and more recently, investigated for its ability to desensitize cardiac sensory fibers expressing TRPV1 to improve chronic heart failure (CHF) outcomes using validated animal models. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) expresses orthologs of vanilloid receptors activated by capsaicin, producing antinociceptive effects. Thus, we used C. elegans to characterize the antinociceptive properties and performed proteomic profiling to uncover specific signaling networks. After exposure to RTX, wild-type (N2) and mutant C. elegans were placed on petri dishes divided into quadrants for heat stimulation. The thermal avoidance index was used to phenotype each tested C. elegans experimental group. The data revealed for the first time that RTX can hamper the nocifensive response of C. elegans to noxious heat. The effect was reversed 6 h after RTX exposure. Additionally, we identified the RTX target, the C. elegans transient receptor potential channel OCR-3. The proteomics and pathway enrichment analysis results suggest that Wnt signaling is triggered by the agonistic effects of RTX on C. elegans vanilloid receptors.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Internalizing symptoms typically emerge in adolescence and are more prevalent in females than in males; in contrast, externalizing symptoms typically emerge in childhood and are more commonly observed in males. Previous research has implicated aspects of white matter organization, including fractional anisotropy (FA), of cerebral tracts in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Although the cerebellum has been posited to integrate limbic and cortical regions, its role in psychopathology is not well understood. In this longitudinal study, we investigated whether FA of the superior (SCP), middle (MCP), and inferior cerebellar peduncles (ICP) predict change in symptoms and whether sex moderates this association. One hundred eleven adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report, assessing symptoms at baseline (ages 9–13 years) and again 2 years later. Participants also underwent diffusion-weighted imaging at baseline. We used deterministic tractography to segment and compute mean FA of the cerebellar peduncles. Lower FA of the right SCP at baseline predicted increases in internalizing symptoms in females only. Lower FA in the right SCP and ICP also predicted increases in externalizing symptoms in females, but these associations did not survive multiple comparison correction. There was no association between FA of the cerebellar peduncles and change in symptoms in males or between MCP FA and symptom changes in males or females. Organizational properties of the SCP may be a sex-specific marker of internalizing symptom changes in adolescence. The cerebellar peduncles should be explored further in future studies to elucidate sex differences in symptoms.</p>

	<p>Background: The directional preference of otolith-related vestibular neurons elucidates the neuroanatomical link of labyrinths, but few direct experimental data have been provided. Methods: The directional preference of otolith-related vestibular neurons was measured in the vestibular nucleus using chemically induced unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL). For the model evaluation, static and dynamic behavioral tests as well as a histological test were performed. Extracellular neural activity was recorded for the neuronal responses to the horizontal head rotation and the linear head translation. Results: Seventy-seven neuronal activities were recorded, and the total population was divided into three groups: left UL (20), sham (35), and right UL (22). Based on directional preference, two sub-groups were again classified as contra- and ipsi-preferred neurons. There was no significance in the number of those sub-groups (contra-, 15/35, 43%; ipsi-, 20/35, 57%) in the sham (p = 0.155). However, more ipsi-preferred neurons (19/22, 86%) were observed after right UL (p = 6.056 × 10−5), while left UL caused more contra-preferred neurons (13/20, 65%) (p = 0.058). In particular, the convergent neurons mainly led this biased difference (ipsi-, 100% after right UL and contra-, 89% after left UL) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002). Conclusions: The directional preference of the neurons depended on the side of the lesion, and its dominance was mainly led by the convergent neurons.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been harmed by the coronavirus, and older adults have remained isolated for a long time with many restrictions. The aim of this study was to measure the decline in cognitive, functional, and affective status in a care facility after the lockdown in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with previous measures in order to determine if this decline was accelerated. (2) Methods: Ninety-eight participants were recruited. Data from three retrospective pre-lockdown assessments and an additional post-lockdown assessment were analyzed. Mixed ANOVA analyses were performed according to the Clinical Dementia Rating levels, considering social-contact frequency during the lockdown as a covariate. (3) Results: The cognitive and functional scores were lower and depression scores were higher after the strict lockdown, accelerating a general pattern of decline that was already present in LTCF residents. The frequency of social contact eliminated the measurement differences in the cognitive and functional scores and the group differences in depression scores. (4) Conclusions: The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in an LTCF were mediated by the frequency of contact. Clinical implications: Preventive measures must be taken to ensure social contact with relatives and friends and reduce the negative consequences of social isolation in LTCFs.</p>

                Slow-wave sleep is characterized by near-synchronous fluctuations between neocortical Up and Down states. Hay et al. report an active mechanism of globally synchronized Down transition by midline thalamic inputs. Synchronization of slow oscillations allows coordinated activation of brain areas, a feature thought to be important for memory consolidation.

                  <p class="a-plus-plus">We explored the organization of motor units recorded in the flexor digitorum superficialis into stable groups (MU-modes) and force-stabilizing synergies in spaces of MU-modes. Young, healthy participants performed one-finger and three-finger accurate cyclical force production tasks. Two wireless sensor arrays (Trigno Galileo, Delsys, Inc.) were placed over the proximal and distal portions of the muscle for surface recording and identification of motor unit action potentials. Principal component analysis with Varimax rotation and factor extraction was used to identify MU-modes. The framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis was used to analyze inter-cycle variance in the space of MU-modes and compute the index of force-stabilizing synergy. Multiple linear regression between the first MU-mode in the three-finger task and the first MU-modes in the three single-finger tasks showed no differences between the data recorded by the two electrodes suggesting that MU-modes were unlikely to be synonymous with muscle compartments. Multi-MU-mode synergies stabilizing task force were documented across all tasks. In contrast, there were no force-stabilizing synergies in the three-finger task analyzed in the space of individual finger forces. Our results confirm the synergic organization of motor units in single-finger tasks and, for the first time, expand this result to multi-finger tasks. We offer an interpretation of the findings within the theoretical scheme of control with spatial referent coordinates expanded to the analysis of individual motor units. The results confirm trade-offs between synergies at different hierarchical levels and expand this notion to intra-muscle synergies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Necroptosis increases with age in the brain and contributes to age-related neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), termed neuroinflammation, is a hallmark of aging and a proposed mediator of cognitive decline associated with aging. Neuroinflammation is characterized by the persistent activation of microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) being one of the well-known activators of microglia. Because necroptosis is a cell death pathway that induce inflammation through the release of DAMPs, we hypothesized that an age-associated increase in necroptosis contributes to increased neuroinflammation with age. The marker of necroptosis, phosphorylated form of MLKL (P-MLKL), and kinases in the necroptosis pathway (RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL) showed a region-specific increase in the brain with age, specifically in the cortex layer V and the CA3 region of the hippocampus of mice. Similarly, MLKL-oligomers, which causes membrane binding and permeabilization were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampus of old mice relative to young mice. Nearly 70 to 80% of P-MLKL immunoreactivity was localized to neurons and less than 10% was localized to microglia, whereas no P-MLKL was detected in astrocytes. P-MLKL expression in neurons was detected in the soma, not in the processes. Blocking necroptosis using Mlkl-/- mice reduced markers (Iba-1 and GFAP) of neuroinflammation in the brains of old mice and short-term treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1s, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, in the hippocampus of old mice. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time that brain necroptosis increases with age and contributes to age-related neuroinflammation in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Sensory Neurons in Painful Diabetic Neuropathy Reveals Inflammation and Neuronal Loss</a></h4>

              
                Pathological sensations caused by peripheral painful neuropathy occurring in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are often described as sharp and burning and are commonly spontaneous in origin. Proposed etiologies implicate dysfunction of nociceptive sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) induced by generation of reactive oxygen species, microvascular defects, and ongoing axonal degeneration and regeneration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to diabetic pain, DRGs were acquired postmortem from patients who had been experiencing painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and subjected to transcriptome analyses to identify genes contributing to pathological processes and neuropathic pain. DPN occurs in distal extremities resulting in the characteristic glove and stocking pattern. Accordingly, the L4 and L5 DRGs, which contain the perikarya of primary afferent neurons innervating the foot, were analyzed from five DPN patients and compared with seven controls. Transcriptome analyses identified 844 differentially expressed genes. We observed increases in levels of inflammation-associated genes from macrophages in DPN patients that may contribute to increased pain hypersensitivity and, conversely, there were frequent decreases in neuronally-related genes. The elevated inflammatory gene profile and the accompanying downregulation of multiple neuronal genes provide new insights into intraganglionic pathology and mechanisms causing neuropathic pain in DPN patients with T2DM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron-Glia Signaling Regulates the Onset of the Antidepressant Response</a></h4>

              
                Commonly prescribed antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) take weeks to achieve therapeutic benefits1, 2. The underlying mechanisms of why antidepressants take weeks or months to reverse depressed mood are not understood. Using a single cell sequencing approach, we analyzed gene expression changes in mice subjected to stress-induced depression and determined their temporal response to antidepressant treatment in the cerebral cortex. We discovered that both glial and neuronal cell populations elicit gene expression changes in response to stress, and that these changes are reversed upon treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac), a widely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Upon reproducing the molecular signaling events regulated by fluoxetine3 in a cortical culture system, we found that these transcriptional changes are serotonin-dependent, require reciprocal neuron-glia communication, and involve temporally-specified sequences of autoregulation and cross-regulation between FGF2 and BDNF signaling pathways. Briefly, stimulation of Fgf2 synthesis and signaling directly regulates Bdnf synthesis and secretion cell-non-autonomously requiring neuron-glia interactions, which then activates neuronal BDNF-TrkB signaling to drive longer-term neuronal adaptations4-6 leading to improved mood. Our studies highlight temporal and cell type specific mechanisms promoting the onset of the antidepressant response, that we propose could offer novel avenues for mitigating delayed onset of antidepressant therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A distributed dopamine-gated circuit underpins reproductive state-dependent behavior in Drosophila females</a></h4>

              
                Motherhood induces a drastic, sometimes long-lasting, change in internal state and behavior in most female animals. Here, we show that a mating-induced increase in olfactory attraction of female Drosophila flies to nutrients relies on interconnected neural pathways in the two higher olfactory brain regions, the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom body (MB). Using whole brain calcium imaging, we find that mating does not induce a global change in the activity of the whole brain nor of entire brain regions, suggesting specific neuronal or network changes in the olfactory system. Systematic behavioral screening and electron microscopy (EM) connectomics identify two types of LH output neurons required for the attraction of females to polyamines -one of them previously implicated in the processing of male pheromones. In addition, we characterize multiple MB pathways capable of inducing or suppressing polyamine attraction, with synaptic connections to the identified LH neurons and a prominent role for the {beta}'1 compartment. Moreover, {beta}'1 dopaminergic neurons are modulated by mating and are sufficient to replace mating experience in virgins inducing the lasting behavioral switch in female preference. Taken together, our data in the fly suggests that reproductive state-dependent expression of female choice behavior is regulated by a dopamine-gated distributed learning circuit comprising both higher olfactory brain centers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PiRATeMC: A highly flexible, scalable, and affordable system for obtaining high quality video recordings for behavioral neuroscience.</a></h4>

              
                With the recent development and rapidly accelerating adoption of machine-learning based rodent behavioral tracking tools such as DeepLabCut, one common variable that can impact the quality and consistency of results is the camera system. Many experimenters use webcams, GoPros, or other commercially available cameras that are not only relatively expensive, but offer very little flexibility over recording parameters. These cameras are not optimized for recording many types of behavioral experiments, which can lead to suboptimal video quality. Furthermore, it is a challenge, if not impossible, to synchronize multiple cameras with each other, or to send/receive a trigger with external signals such as a TTL pulse or a network connection. We have developed an affordable ecosystem of behavioral recording equipment, PiRATeMC (Pi-based Remote Acquisition Technology for Motion Capture), that relies on Raspberry Pi Camera Boards that are ideal for recording in both bright light, low light, and dark conditions under infrared light. PiRATeMC offers users control over nearly every recording parameter. This setup can easily be scaled up and synchronously controlled in clusters via a self-contained network to record a large number of simultaneous behavioral sessions without burdening institutional network infrastructure. Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for novice and inexperienced programmers interested in using an open-source recording system, with a large online community that is very active in developing novel open-source tools. Moreover, it easily interfaces with Arduinos and other microcontrollers, allowing simple synchronization and interfacing of video recording with nearly any behavioral equipment using GPIO pins to send or receive 3.3V or 5V signals, I2C, or serial communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateral habenula M2 muscarinic receptor control of neuronal activity and cocaine seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                The lateral habenula (LHb) plays a central role in balancing reward and aversion by opposing the contributions of brain reward nuclei. Using a rat cocaine self-administration model, we previously found that LHb inhibition or non-selective blockade of LHb muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) led to persistent cocaine seeking despite its signaled unavailability. As understanding roles for the LHb and cholinergic signaling in behavioral control is important to psychiatric illness and addiction, we examine how mAChRs act on LHb neurons using in vitro electrophysiology. We find that different groups of LHb neurons are depolarized or hyperpolarized by the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh), and that CCh could inhibit GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs to these cells. Presynaptic CCh effects were reversed by the M2 mAChR (M2R) antagonist AFDX-116, but not by pirenzepine, an M1R antagonist. Contemporaneous measurement of CCh effects on synaptic inhibition and excitation in LHb neurons showed a smaller effect on inhibition, suggesting a net shift in synaptic integration toward greater inhibition by mAChRs. Synaptic currents elicited by light-activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) axons in the LHb, following channelrhodopsin-2 transfection of VTA, were also inhibited by M2Rs, suggesting the VTA as at least one M2R-sensitive LHb afferent. Finally, Go-NoGo cocaine seeking studies showed that blockade of LHb M2Rs, and not M1Rs, triggered continued cocaine seeking. These data identify LHb M2Rs as a potential control point of LHb function that enables withholding responses for cocaine and define cellular mechanisms through which mAChRs modulate LHb activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The olfactory organ is a unique site for resident neutrophils in the brain</a></h4>

              
                For decades we have known that the brain "drains" through the subarachnoid space following a route that crosses the cribriform plate to the nasal mucosa and cervical lymph nodes. Yet little is known about the potential role of the olfactory epithelia and associated lymphatic vasculature in the immune response. To better understand the immune response in the olfactory organs we used cell-specific fluorescent reporter lines in dissected, intact adult brains to visualize blood-lymphatic vasculature and neutrophils in the olfactory sensory system. Here we show that the extensive blood vasculature of the olfactory organs is associated with a lymphatic cell type resembling high endothelial venules (HEVs) of the lymph nodes in mammals and a second resembling Mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLECs) that extended from the brain to the peripheral olfactory epithelia. Surprisingly, the olfactory organs contained the only neutrophil populations observed in the brain. Damage to the olfactory epithelia resulted in a rapid increase of neutrophils within the olfactory organs as well as the appearance of neutrophils in the brain suggesting that neutrophils enter the brain in response to damage. Analysis of cell division during and after damage showed an increase in BrdU labeling in the olfactory epithelia and a subset of the neutrophils. Our results reveal a unique population of neutrophils in the olfactory organs that are associated with an extensive lymphatic vasculature suggesting a dual olfactory-immune function for this unique sensory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strong and opponent contributions of dorsomedial striatal pathways to behavior depends on cognitive demands and task strategy</a></h4>

              
                A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output. Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, has remained unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) depends on a task's cognitive demands. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that - even within a single task - the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the cognitive demands imposed by a task, as well as the strategy that mice pursue within a task, determine whether DMS pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glutamatergic dysfunction leads to a hyper-dopaminergic phenotype through deficits in short-term habituation: a mechanism for aberrant salience.</a></h4>

              
                Psychosis in disorders like schizophrenia is commonly associated with aberrant salience and elevated striatal dopamine. However, the underlying cause(s) of this hyper-dopaminergic state remain elusive. Various lines of evidence point to glutamatergic dysfunction and impairments in synaptic plasticity in the aetiology of schizophrenia, including deficits associated with the GluA1 AMPAR subunit. GluA1 knockout (Gria1-/-) mice provide a model of impaired synaptic plasticity in schizophrenia and exhibit a selective deficit in a form of short-term memory which underlies short-term habituation. As such, these mice are unable to reduce attention to recently presented stimuli. In this study we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure phasic dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens of Gria1-/- mice to determine whether this behavioral phenotype might be a key driver of a hyper-dopaminergic state. There was no effect of GluA1 deletion on electrically-evoked dopamine responses in anaesthetized mice, demonstrating normal endogenous release properties of dopamine neurons in Gria1-/- mice. Furthermore, dopamine signals were initially similar in Gria1-/- mice compared to controls in response to both sucrose rewards and neutral light stimuli. They were also equally sensitive to changes in the magnitude of delivered rewards. In contrast, however, these stimulus-evoked dopamine signals failed to habituate with repeated presentations in Gria1-/- mice, resulting in a task-relevant, hyper-dopaminergic phenotype. Thus, here we show that GluA1 dysfunction, resulting in impaired short-term habituation, is a key driver of enhanced striatal dopamine responses, which may be an important contributor to aberrant salience and psychosis in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.

	<p>Objective: There is growing evidence that in adults, higher levels of handgrip strength (HGS) are linked to better cognitive performance. However, the relationship between HGS and cognitive performance has not been sufficiently investigated in special cohorts, such as individuals with hypertension who have an intrinsically higher risk of cognitive decline. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between HGS and cognitive performance in adults with hypertension using data from the Global Ageing and Adult Health Survey (SAGE). Methods: A total of 4486 Chinese adults with hypertension from the SAGE were included in this study. Absolute handgrip strength (aHGS in kilograms) was measured using a handheld electronic dynamometer, and cognitive performance was assessed in the domains of short-term memory, delayed memory, and language ability. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to examine the association between relative handgrip strength (rHGS; aHGS divided by body mass index) and measures of cognitive performance. Results: Overall, higher levels of rHGS were associated with higher scores in short-term memory (β = 0.20) and language (β = 0.63) compared with the lowest tertiles of rHGS. In male participants, higher HGS was associated with higher scores in short-term memory (β = 0.31), language (β = 0.64), and delayed memory (β = 0.22). There were no associations between rHGS and cognitive performance measures in females. Conclusion: We observed that a higher level of rHGS was associated with better cognitive performance among hypertensive male individuals. Further studies are needed to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms, including sex-specific differences driving the relationship between measures of HGS and cognitive performance in individuals with hypertension.</p>

	<p>The known theories discussing the essence of consciousness have been recently updated. This prompts an attempt to integrate these explanations concerning several distinct components of the consciousness phenomenon such as the ego, and qualia perceptions. Therefore, it is useful to consider the latest publications on the ‘Orch OR’ and ‘cemi’ theories, which assume that quantum processing occurs in microtubules and that the brain’s endogenous electromagnetic field is important. The authors combine these explanations with their own theory describing the neural circuits realizing imagery. They try to present such an interdisciplinary, integrated theoretical model in a manner intuitively understandable to people with a typical medical education. In order to do this, they even refer to intuitively understandable metaphors. The authors maintain that an effective comprehension of consciousness is important for health care professionals because its disorders are frequent medical symptoms in emergencies, during general anesthesia and in the course of cognitive disorders in elderly people. The authors emphasize the current possibilities to verify these theses regarding the essence of consciousness thanks to the development of functional brain imaging methods—magnetoencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation—as well as clinical studies on the modification of perceptions and feelings by such techniques as mindfulness and the use of certain psychoactive substances, especially among people with self-awareness and identity disorders.</p>

	<p>The search for and development of new neuroprotective (or cerebroprotective) drugs, as well as suitable methods for their preclinical efficacy evaluation, are priorities for current biomedical research. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, such as mafedine and dexmedetomidine, are a highly appealing group of drugs capable of reducing neurological deficits which result from brain trauma and vascular events in both experimental animals and human patients. Thus, our aim was to assess the effects of mafedine and dexmedetomidine on the brain’s electrical activity in a controlled cortical-impact model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. The functional status of the animals was assessed by electrocorticography (ECoG), using ECoG electrodes which were chronically implanted in different cortical regions. The administration of intraperitoneal mafedine sodium at 2.5 mg∙kg−1 at 1 h after TBI induction, and daily for the following 6 days, restored interhemispheric connectivity in remote brain regions and intrahemispheric connections within the unaffected hemisphere at post-TBI day 7. Animals that had received mafedine sodium also demonstrated an improvement in cortical responses to photic and somatosensory stimulation. Dexmedetomidine at 25 μg∙kg−1 did not affect the brain’s electrical activity in brain-injured rats. Our results confirm the previously described neuroprotective effects of mafedine sodium and suggest that ECoG registration and analysis are a viable method evaluating drug efficacy in experimental animal models of TBI.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">With disease-modifying approaches under evaluation in ataxia-telangiectasia and other ataxias, there is a need for objective and reliable biomarkers of free-living motor function. In this study, we test the hypothesis that metrics derived from a single wrist sensor worn at home provide accurate, reliable, and interpretable information about neurological disease severity in children with A-T.</p>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">A total of 15 children with A-T and 15 age- and sex-matched controls wore a sensor with a triaxial accelerometer on their dominant wrist for 1 week at home. Activity intensity measures, derived from the sensor data, were compared with in-person neurological evaluation on the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) and performance on a validated computer mouse task.</p>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Children with A-T were inactive the same proportion of each day as controls but produced more low intensity movements (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01; Cohen’s <em class="a-plus-plus">d</em> = 1.48) and fewer high intensity movements (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001; Cohen’s <em class="a-plus-plus">d</em> = 1.71). The range of activity intensities was markedly reduced in A-T compared to controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.0001; Cohen’s <em class="a-plus-plus">d</em> = 2.72). The activity metrics correlated strongly with arm, gait, and total clinical severity (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em>: 0.71–0.87; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.0001), correlated with specific computer task motor features (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em>: 0.67–0.92; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01), demonstrated high reliability (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em>: 0.86–0.93; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.00001), and were not significantly influenced by age in the healthy control group.</p>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Motor activity metrics from a single, inexpensive wrist sensor during free-living behavior provide accurate and reliable information about diagnosis, neurological disease severity, and motor performance. These low-burden measurements are applicable independent of ambulatory status and are potential digital behavioral biomarkers in A-T.</p>

	<p>According to the Unaccusative Hypothesis, intransitive verbs are divided into unaccusative and unergative ones based on the distinction of their syntactic properties, which has been proved by previous theoretical and empirical evidence. However, debate has been raised regarding whether intransitive verbs in Mandarin Chinese can be split into unaccusative and unergative ones syntactically. To analyze this theoretical controversy, the present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the neural processing of deep unaccusative, unergative sentences, and passive sentences (derived structures undergoing a syntactic movement) in Mandarin Chinese. The results revealed no significant difference in the neural processing of deep unaccusative and unergative sentences, and the comparisons between passive sentences and the other sentence types revealed activation in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) and the left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG). These findings indicate that the syntactic processing of unaccusative and unergative verbs in Mandarin Chinese is highly similar but different from that of passive verbs, which suggests that deep unaccusative and unergative sentences in Mandarin Chinese are both base-generated structures and that there is no syntactic distinction between unaccusative and unergative verbs in Mandarin Chinese.</p>

	<p>Musical training has been shown to have a positive influence on a variety of skills, including auditory-based tasks and nonmusical cognitive and executive functioning tasks; however, because previous investigations have yielded mixed results regarding the relationship between musical training and these skills, the purpose of this study was to examine and compare the auditory processing skills of children who receive focused, daily musical training with those with more limited, generalized musical training. Sixteen typically developing children (second–fourth grade) from two different schools receiving different music curricula were assessed on measures of pitch discrimination, temporal sequencing, and prosodic awareness. The results indicated significantly better scores in pitch discrimination abilities for the children receiving daily, focused musical training (School 1) compared to students attending music class only once per week, utilizing a more generalized elementary school music curriculum (School 2). The findings suggest that more in-depth and frequent musical training may be associated with better pitch discrimination abilities in children. This finding is important given that the ability to discriminate pitch has been linked to improved phonological processing skills, an important skill for developing spoken language and literacy. Future investigations are needed to determine whether the null findings for temporal sequencing and prosodic awareness can be replicated or may be different for various grades and tasks for measuring these abilities.</p>

	<p>Objective: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) represents a diagnostic challenge considering the great variability of clinical presentation and multiorgan involvement. In the present study, we report the prevalence of kidney involvement and kidney function over time in a cohort of ATTRv patients with different transthyretin gene mutations. Patients and Methods: For this study, we systematically collected data from all patients with a diagnosis of ATTRv followed at the Neurology Unit of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS. Kidney involvement was defined as presence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &amp;amp;lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 obtained with CKD-EPI equation, abnormal urinary protein excretion (UPE) (&amp;amp;gt;150 mg/24 h) and/or albuminuria &amp;amp;gt;30 mg/24 h (or mg/g creatinine). The analysis included data from 46 patients with 122 measurements of serum creatinine. Results: Among the 46 patients included in the analysis, kidney involvement was present in 37%, with 15% showing reduced eGFR and 22% abnormal UPE (63% of patients with available UPE data). No single predictor was associated with either eGFR values or its slope over time. Conclusions: Kidney involvement is quite common in patients with ATTRv regardless of the underlying genetic variant. In particular, abnormal UPE appears to be a common feature of the disease.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Infants acquire the ability to roll over from the supine to the prone position, which requires body coordination of multiple degrees of freedom under dynamic interactions with the ground. Although previous studies on infant rolling observed kinematic characteristics, little is known about the kinetic characteristics of body segments in contact with the surface. We measured the ground contact pressure under the arms, legs, head, and proximal body segments using a pressure mat and their displacements using a three-dimensional motion capture system. The data obtained from 17 infants aged 9–10 months indicated that most of them showed 2–4 of 6 highly observed movement patterns, including 1 axial rolling, 2 spinal flexion, and 3 shoulder girdle leading patterns. The arms and legs had small contributions to the ground contact pressure in the axial rolling and spinal flexion patterns. The ipsilateral leg in relation to the rolling direction was involved in supporting the body weight in only 1 shoulder girdle leading pattern. The contralateral leg showed large peak pressure to push on the floor before rolling in 3 shoulder girdle leading patterns. The results indicate that infants can produce multiple rolling-over patterns with different strategies to coordinate their body segments and interact with the floor. The results of the analysis of the movement patterns further suggest that few patterns correspond to those reported in adults. This implies that infants generate unique motor patterns by taking into account their own biomechanical constraints.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Subpopulations of primary nociceptors (C- and Aδ-fibers), express the TRPV1 receptor for heat and capsaicin. During cutaneous inflammation, these afferents may become sensitized, leading to primary hyperalgesia. It is known that TRPV1<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> nociceptors are involved in heat hyperalgesia; however, their involvement in mechanical hyperalgesia is unclear. This study explored the contribution of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors in the development of mechanical and heat hyperalgesia in humans following ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation. Skin areas in 18 healthy volunteers were randomized to treatment with 8% capsaicin/vehicle patches for 24 h. After patches removal, one capsaicin-treated area and one vehicle area were irradiated with 2xMED (minimal erythema dose) of UVB. 1, 3 and 7 days post-UVB exposure, tests were performed to evaluate the development of UVB-induced cutaneous hyperalgesia: thermal detection and pain thresholds, pain sensitivity to supra-threshold heat stimuli, mechanical pain threshold and sensitivity, touch pleasantness, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), inflammatory response, pigmentation and micro-vascular reactivity. Capsaicin pre-treatment, in the UVB-irradiated area (Capsaicin + UVB area), increased heat pain thresholds (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.05), and decreased supra-threshold heat pain sensitivity (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.05) 1, 3 and 7 days post-UVB irradiation, while mechanical hyperalgesia resulted unchanged (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &gt; 0.2). No effects of capsaicin were reported on touch pleasantness (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 1), TEWL (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.31), inflammatory response and pigmentation (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &gt; 0.3) or micro-vascular reactivity (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &gt; 0.8) in response to the UVB irradiation. 8% capsaicin ablation predominantly defunctionalizes TRPV1<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-expressing cutaneous nociceptors responsible for heat pain transduction, suggesting that sensitization of these fibers is required for development of heat hyperalgesia following cutaneous UVB-induced inflammation but they are likely only partially necessary for the establishment of robust primary mechanical hyperalgesia.</p>

                Teleost fishes comprise one-half of all vertebrate species and possess a duplicated genome. This whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurred on the teleost stem lineage in an ancient common ancestor of all living teleosts and is hypothesized as a trigger of their exceptional evolutionary radiation. Genomic and phylogenetic data indicate that WGD...
