                arXiv:2502.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study forms part of a research project that aims to develop cognition-enabled robotic agents with environmental interaction capabilities close to human proficiency. This approach is based on human-derived neuronal data in combination with a shared ontology to enable robots to learn from human experiences. To gain further insight into the relation between human neuronal activity patterns and ontological classes, we introduced General Linear Model (GLM) analyses on fMRI data of participants who were presented with complex naturalistic video stimuli comparable to the robot tasks. We modeled four event classes (pick, place, fetch and deliver) attached to different environmental and object-related context and employed a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) on associated brain activity patterns as a starting point for an automatic hierarchical clustering. Based on the default values for the Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF), the activity patterns were reliably grouped according to their parent classes of object interaction and navigation. Although fetch and deliver events were also distinguished by neuronal patterns, pick and place events demonstrated higher ambiguity with respect to neuronal activation patterns. Introducing a shorter HRF time-to-peak leads to a more reliable grouping of all four semantic classes, despite contextual factors. These data might give novel insights into the neuronal representation of complex stimuli and may enable further research in ontology validation in cognition-enabled robotics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09077">$^{18}$F-FDG brain PET hypometabolism in post-SARS-CoV-2 infection: substrate for persistent/delayed disorders?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Several brain complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported. It has been moreover speculated that this neurotropism could potentially cause a delayed outbreak of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases of neuroinflammatory origin. A propagation mechanism has been proposed across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, from the nose to the olfactory epithelium, and possibly afterward to other limbic structures, and deeper parts of the brain including the brainstem. Methods: Review of clinical examination, and whole-brain voxel-based analysis of $^{18}$F-FDG PET metabolism in comparison with healthy subjects (p voxel<0.001, p-cluster<0.05, uncorrected), of two patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 explored at the post-viral stage of the disease. Results: Hypometabolism of the olfactory/rectus gyrus was found on the two patients, especially one with 4-week prolonged anosmia. Additional hypometabolisms were found within amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, cingulate cortex, pre-/post-central gyrus, thalamus/hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla in the other patient who complained of delayed onset of a painful syndrome. Conclusion: These preliminary findings reinforce the hypotheses of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism through the olfactory bulb and the possible extension of this impairment to other brain structures. $^{18}$F-FDG PET hypometabolism could constitute a cerebral quantitative biomarker of this involvement. Post-viral cohort studies are required to specify the exact relationship between such hypometabolisms and the possible persistent disorders, especially involving cognitive or emotion disturbances, residual respiratory symptoms, or painful complaints.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02962">Intrinsic motivation as constrained entropy maximization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.02962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Intrinsic motivation" refers to the capacity for intelligent systems to be motivated endogenously, i.e. by features of agential architecture itself rather than by learned associations between action and reward. This paper views active inference, empowerment, and other formal accounts of intrinsic motivation as variations on the theme of constrained maximum entropy inference, providing a general perspective on intrinsic motivation complementary to existing frameworks. The connection between free energy and empowerment noted in previous literature is further explored, and it is argued that the maximum-occupancy approach in practice incorporates an implicit model-evidence constraint.

                arXiv:2410.00318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, defined by its ubiquitous yet irreplaceable role in human activities ranging from routine tasks to civil engineering. Embedding machines with mechanical reasoning is therefore an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Here, we leveraged 155 cognitive experiments to test the understanding of system stability, gears and pulley systems, leverage principle, inertia and motion, and fluid mechanics in 26 Vision Language Models (VLMs). Results indicate that VLMs consistently perform worse than humans on all domains, while demonstrate significant difficulty in reasoning about gear systems and fluid mechanics. Notably, their performance on these tasks do not improve as number of parameters increase, suggesting that current attention-based architecture may fail to grasp certain underlying mechanisms required for mechanical reasoning, particularly those pertaining to mental simulations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15001">What if Eye...? Computationally Recreating Vision Evolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.15001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision systems in nature show remarkable diversity, from simple light-sensitive patches to complex camera eyes with lenses. While natural selection has produced these eyes through countless mutations over millions of years, they represent just one set of realized evolutionary paths. Testing hypotheses about how environmental pressures shaped eye evolution remains challenging since we cannot experimentally isolate individual factors. Computational evolution offers a way to systematically explore alternative trajectories. Here we show how environmental demands drive three fundamental aspects of visual evolution through an artificial evolution framework that co-evolves both physical eye structure and neural processing in embodied agents. First, we demonstrate computational evidence that task specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution - orientation tasks like navigation in a maze leads to distributed compound-type eyes while an object discrimination task leads to the emergence of high-acuity camera-type eyes. Second, we reveal how optical innovations like lenses naturally emerge to resolve fundamental tradeoffs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover systematic scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing, showing how task complexity drives coordinated evolution of sensory and computational capabilities. Our work introduces a novel paradigm that illuminates evolutionary principles shaping vision by creating targeted single-player games where embodied agents must simultaneously evolve visual systems and learn complex behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08860">Brain in the Dark: Design Principles for Neuromimetic Inference under the Free Energy Principle</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionised artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling automatic feature extraction and function approximation from raw data. However, it faces challenges such as a lack of out-of-distribution generalisation, catastrophic forgetting and poor interpretability. In contrast, biological neural networks, such as those in the human brain, do not suffer from these issues, inspiring AI researchers to explore neuromimetic deep learning, which aims to replicate brain mechanisms within AI models. A foundational theory for this approach is the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which despite its potential, is often considered too complex to understand and implement in AI as it requires an interdisciplinary understanding across a variety of fields. This paper seeks to demystify the FEP and provide a comprehensive framework for designing neuromimetic models with human-like perception capabilities. We present a roadmap for implementing these models and a Pytorch code repository for applying FEP in a predictive coding network.

                arXiv:2502.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal processing is fundamental for both biological and artificial intelligence systems, as it enables the comprehension of dynamic environments and facilitates timely responses. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) excel in handling such data with high efficiency, owing to their rich neuronal dynamics and sparse activity patterns. Given the recent surge in the development of SNNs, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation of their temporal processing capabilities. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth assessment of commonly used neuromorphic benchmarks, revealing critical limitations in their ability to evaluate the temporal processing capabilities of SNNs. To bridge this gap, we further introduce a benchmark suite consisting of three temporal processing tasks characterized by rich temporal dynamics across multiple timescales. Utilizing this benchmark suite, we perform a thorough evaluation of recently introduced SNN approaches to elucidate the current status of SNNs in temporal processing. Our findings indicate significant advancements in recently developed spiking neuron models and neural architectures regarding their temporal processing capabilities, while also highlighting a performance gap in handling long-range dependencies when compared to state-of-the-art non-spiking models. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and outline potential avenues for future research.

                arXiv:2502.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has garnered significant attention as a privacy-preserving machine learning framework for sample-aligned feature federation. However, traditional VFL approaches do not address the challenges of class and feature continual learning, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge from previous tasks. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel vertical federated continual learning method, named Vertical Federated Continual Learning via Evolving Prototype Knowledge (V-LETO), which primarily facilitates the transfer of knowledge from previous tasks through the evolution of prototypes. Specifically, we propose an evolving prototype knowledge method, enabling the global model to retain both previous and current task knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a model optimization technique that mitigates the forgetting of previous task knowledge by restricting updates to specific parameters of the local model, thereby enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments conducted in both CIL and FIL settings demonstrate that our method, V-LETO, outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 10.39% and 35.15% for CIL and FIL tasks, respectively. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/V-LETO-0108/README.md.

                arXiv:2502.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional heat-load generation pattern of combined heat and power generators has become a problem leading to renewable energy source (RES) power curtailment in cold regions, motivating the proposal of a planning model for alternative heat sources. The model aims to identify non-dominant capacity allocation schemes for heat pumps, thermal energy storage, electric boilers, and combined storage heaters to construct a Pareto front, considering both economic and sustainable objectives. The integration of various heat sources from both generation and consumption sides enhances flexibility in utilization. The study introduces a novel optimization algorithm, the adaptive multi-objective Bayesian optimization (AMBO). Compared to other widely used multi-objective optimization algorithms, AMBO eliminates predefined parameters that may introduce subjectivity from planners. Beyond the algorithm, the proposed model incorporates a noise term to account for inevitable simulation deviations, enabling the identification of better-performing planning results that meet the unique requirements of cold regions. What's more, the characteristics of electric-thermal coupling scenarios are captured and reflected in the operation simulation model to make sure the simulation is close to reality. Numerical simulation verifies the superiority of the proposed approach in generating a more diverse and evenly distributed Pareto front in a sample-efficient manner, providing comprehensive and objective planning choices.

                arXiv:2502.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of $\Omega(\log\log d)$ hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of $d$ numbers. Additionally, under our assumption, we provide a combinatorial proof that 3 hidden layers are necessary to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers.

                arXiv:2502.09393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time autonomous systems utilize multi-layer computational frameworks to perform critical tasks such as perception, goal finding, and path planning. Traditional methods implement perception using occupancy grid mapping (OGM), segmenting the environment into discretized cells with probabilistic information. This classical approach is well-established and provides a structured input for downstream processes like goal finding and path planning algorithms. Recent approaches leverage a biologically inspired mathematical framework known as vector symbolic architectures (VSA), commonly known as hyperdimensional computing, to perform probabilistic OGM in hyperdimensional space. This approach, VSA-OGM, provides native compatibility with spiking neural networks, positioning VSA-OGM as a potential neuromorphic alternative to conventional OGM. However, for large-scale integration, it is essential to assess the performance implications of VSA-OGM on downstream tasks compared to established OGM methods. This study examines the efficacy of VSA-OGM against a traditional OGM approach, Bayesian Hilbert Maps (BHM), within reinforcement learning based goal finding and path planning frameworks, across a controlled exploration environment and an autonomous driving scenario inspired by the F1-Tenth challenge. Our results demonstrate that VSA-OGM maintains comparable learning performance across single and multi-scenario training configurations while improving performance on unseen environments by approximately 47%. These findings highlight the increased generalizability of policy networks trained with VSA-OGM over BHM, reinforcing its potential for real-world deployment in diverse environments.

Abstract: Navigation is controlled by at least two partially dissociable, concurrently developed systems in the brain. The cognitive map informs an organism of its location and bearing, updated by distance-based prediction and vestibular integration. Response-based systems, on the other hand, directly evaluate movement decisions from immediate percepts. Here we demonstrate the sufficiency of visual response-based decision-making in a classic open field navigation task often assumed to require a cognitive map. Three distinct strategies emerge to robustly navigate to a hidden goal, each conferring contextual tradeoffs, as well as aligning with behavior observed with rodents, insects, fish, and sperm cells. We propose reframing navigation from the bottom-up, without assuming online access to computationally expensive top-down representations, to better explain behavior under energetic or attentional constraints.

Abstract: Today, machine learning tools, particularly artificial neural networks, have become crucial for diverse applications. However, current digital computing tools to train and deploy artificial neural networks often struggle with massive data sizes and high power consumptions. Optical computing provides inherent parallelism accommodating high-resolution input data and performs fundamental operations with passive optical components. However, most of the optical computing platforms suffer from relatively low accuracies for machine learning tasks due to fixed connections while avoiding complex and sensitive techniques. Here, we demonstrate a genetically programmable yet simple optical neural network to achieve high performances with optical random projection. By genetically programming the orientation of the scattering medium which acts as a random projection kernel and only using 1% of the search space, our novel technique finds an optimum kernel and improves initial test accuracies by 8-41% for various machine learning tasks. Through numerical simulations and experiments on a number of datasets, we validate the programmability and high-resolution sample processing capabilities of our design. Our optical computing method presents a promising approach to achieve high performance in optical neural networks with a simple and scalable design.

Adolescent populations with depression are a particularly challenging demographic to treat as early intervention is crucial to prevent treatment resistance, but treatment options are limited. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive option for TRD in adults as well as adolescents, offering hope for patients who have not responded to conventional therapies. This review examines the convergence of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a tool to examine how TMS modulates functional connectivity in adolescents with MDD. Such analyses have led to advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD, TRD, and the mechanisms of TMS. We review this evidence, evaluate methodological approaches, and identify critical gaps in the existing literature, highlighting how neuroimaging-guided TMS protocols offer a promising therapeutic avenue for adolescent TRD, particularly in cases where conventional treatments have proven ineffective.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-204/v1?src=rss">Towards Enhanced Healthcare: A Mixed Methods Exploration of Responsiveness in Gamo Gofa Zone Hospitals, Southern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Assessing health service responsiveness is crucial for evaluating a health system’s ability to address non-health related aspects of care. This study aimed to assess the responsiveness of inpatient and outpatient services and identify influencing factors in Gamo Gofa zone hospitals, southern Ethiopia from March 2011 to June 2013. Methods A mixed methods approach was employed, involving systematic random sampling for surveys and purposive sampling for focus group discussions. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, mean score calculations, principal component analysis, and regression analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted on the transcribed qualitative data, which were triangulated with the quantitative findings. Results A survey of 419 individuals and focus group discussions with 72 participants revealed disparities in responsiveness. Dignity and confidentiality were rated high, while basic amenities for inpatients and prompt attention to outpatients were notably lacking. Principal component analysis identified patient-centered communication, patient-centered care environments, and prompt attention as key factors underlying responsiveness. The qualitative findings emphasized healthcare providers’ time insensitivity, inadequate facilities, and limited patient involvement in decision-making. Conclusion This study highlights significant gaps in health service responsiveness in Gamo Gofa zone hospitals. Interventions targeting deficiencies in patient-centered communication, patient- centered care environment and prompt attention can enhance healthcare quality and patient-centeredness. Addressing these areas is critical for improving the overall patient experience.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-955/v2?src=rss">Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Propensity to Cheat Scale Validation in the Ethiopian Public Higher Education Institutions [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study was primarily intended to validate a comprehensive and psychometrically acceptable measure of students’ propensity to cheat (PTC) behavior among undergraduate students in Ethiopian universities by assessing their engagement in different types of cheating behavior. Methods The present study employed an explanatory research design using a questionnaire based on the Propensity to Cheat Scale (PCS). The questionnaire was administered to 500 university students (male = 367 [73.4%]; female = 133 [26.6%]) selected from three Ethiopian public universities between November and January 2022. In order to measure the underlying variables of propensity towards cheating, a factor model is developed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the students’ perceived PTC. The internal consistency of the PTC scale was assessed using reliability analysis, and validity evaluations were conducted to confirm the scale’s discriminant and convergent validity. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results revealed a good fit to the data, and the internal consistency of the PCS was found to be strong, providing a reliable measure of students’ propensity for cheating. Validity evaluations, including discriminant validity and convergent validity, confirmed the validity of the scale. The average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability values also supported the scale’s convergent validity. The multidimensional concept of the PTC was supported by a four-factor solution consisting of 26 reliable and valid items. Conclusion The findings of the study demonstrate that the scale has also provided sufficient evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. By establishing discriminant and convergent validity, as well as reliability, through different validation procedures, the study has provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the PCS as an instrument for determining whether university students are likely to engage in cheating behavior.

                Background Current treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) mainly focused on treating symptoms. Exosome from Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (Ad-MSC) have been shown to delay degenerative process. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, radiological and histological impact of combined intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) and exosome Ad-MSCs in-vivo using a larger animal model with low-grade OA. Methods Eighteen male Ovies aries sheep underwent total lateral meniscectomy and conventional radiography was performed to confirm low-grade OA after 6 weeks. The sheep were divided into three groups, Group 1 (G1; n=6) received thrice exosome injections, G2 (n=6) received twice HA injection, and G3 (n=6) received both treatments with a 1-week interval after 10 days of meniscectomy. Clinical evaluations were conducted using the Clinical Lameness Score (CLS), radiographic with X-ray using OA score by Innes et al, while macroscopic evaluation by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Results Lameness parameter scored lowest in G3 significantly (2.0±0.0 VS 2.7±0.52 VS 2.7±0.52; p=0.024) at the second month although the overall CLS score did not significantly differ at the 3rd month. The best improvement of conventional total OA radiographic score at the 3rd month compared to all groups (5.2±1.17 vs 6.3±0.82 vs 6.7±1.03; p=0.053). Macroscopic OARSI evaluation showed no difference (p=0.711). Conclusions Combined repeated exosome Ad-MSC and HA IA injection proven to delay OA progression, however longer duration of follow up is required to evaluate its long-term effect.

                Background Poverty remained pervasive in affecting households particularly in developing countries like Ethiopia. Purpose The main target of this study was to estimate the multidimensional poverty index of households in Debre Tabor city along with the analysis of determinants of multidimensional poverty. Method The researchers selected 394 households from six Kebeles using a stratified random sampling technique. The Alkire and Foster dual cut-off method of measuring poverty was employed to estimate the multidimensional poverty index and ordered logistic regression was used to analyze the effects of determinants of multidimensional poverty. Five dimensions of poverty namely, income, education, health, living standards, and energy use were incorporated in measuring it. Results and conclusion The result revealed that 59% of households were multidimensional poor with a poverty cut-off of 33%. The multidimensional poor households were underprivileged in 54% of weighted indicators. The energy use dimension was a serious contributor to the incidence and severity of multidimensional poverty. In addition, poverty incidence by illiterate-headed household heads, with single marital status, and casual wage worker-headed households was higher relative to their counterparts. Policy recommendation We strongly recommended that education must be extensively provided not only to children but also to adults; females must be promoted to participate in business activities, credit must be expanded with an excellent follow-up, and households should participate in existing cooperatives.

                Background Pregnant women are a nutritionally vulnerable group that requires special attention due to the risk of malnutrition, which may result in low birth weight (LBW) infants. Enhancing nutritional status during pregnancy can be achieved through supplementation with locally sourced functional foods, such as dadih and bread. This study aims to evaluate the effects of dadih-based functional bread on nutritional intake, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes. Methods A randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 143 pregnant women, divided into two groups: the intervention group (IG, n = 77), who consumed dadih-based functional bread, and the control group (CG, n = 66), who consumed original functional bread. Data analysis used the independent t-test for normally distributed variables and the Mann–Whitney test for non-parametric variables. Results Significant differences were observed in carbohydrate intake during the third trimester between the IG (320.40 [198.24–666.72] grams/day) and CG (312.37 [137.87–556.85] grams/day; p = 0.019) and in fat intake (IG: 74.30 [25.53–245.47] grams/day; CG: 62.85 [21.71–128.59] grams/day; p = 0.025). A significant difference in BMI in the third month was noted between IG and CG (p = 0.025). However, no significant differences were observed in neonatal outcomes between the groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions Dadih demonstrates benefits for maternal health during pregnancy, its effects on fetal growth pa-rameters may be limited and potentially influenced by factors beyond maternal diet alone. Further research is required to explore dadih’s potential role in enhancing long-term child health outcomes.

                <p>by Ines S. C. Baptista, Suchintak Dash, Amir M. Arsh, Vinodh Kandavalli, Carlo Maria Scandolo, Barry C. Sanders, Andre S. Ribeiro</p>

Bacteria evolved genes whose single-cell distributions of expression levels are broad, or even bimodal. Evidence suggests that they might enhance phenotypic diversity for coping with fluctuating environments. We identified seven genes in <i>E. coli</i> with bimodal (low and high) single-cell expression levels under standard growth conditions and studied how their dynamics are modified by environmental and antibiotic stresses known to target gene expression. We found that all genes lose bimodality under some, but not under all, stresses. Also, bimodality can reemerge upon cells returning to standard conditions, which suggests that the genes can switch often between high and low expression rates. As such, these genes could become valuable components of future multi-stable synthetic circuits. Next, we proposed models of bimodal transcription dynamics with realistic parameter values, able to mimic the outcome of the perturbations studied. We explored several models’ tunability and boundaries of parameter values, beyond which it shifts to unimodal dynamics. From the model results, we predict that bimodality is robust, and yet tunable, not only by RNA and protein degradation rates, but also by the fraction of time that promoters remain unavailable for new transcription events. Finally, we show evidence that, although the empirical expression levels are influenced by many factors, the bimodality emerges during transcription initiation, at the promoter regions and, thus, may be evolvable and adaptable.

Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are known for their hexagonal spatial activity patterns and are thought to provide a neural metric for space, and support path integration. In this study, we further investigate grid cells as a metric of space by optimising them for a conformal isometric (CI) map of space using a model based on a superposition of plane waves. By optimising the phases within a single grid cell module, we find that the module can form a CI of two-dimensional flat space with phases arranging into a regular hexagonal pattern, supporting an accurate spatial metric. Additionally, we find that experimentally recorded grid cells exhibit CI properties, with one example module showing a phase arrangement similar to the hexagonal pattern observed in our model. These findings provide computational and preliminary experimental support for grid cells as a CI-based spatial representation. We also examine other properties that emerge in CI-optimised modules, including consistent energy expenditure across space and the minimal cell count required to support unique representation of space and maximally topologically persistent toroidal population activity. Altogether, our results suggest that grid cells are well-suited to form a CI map, with several beneficial properties arising from this organisation.

conformal prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xianghao Zhan, Qinmei Xu, Yuanning Zheng, Guangming Lu, Olivier Gevaert</p>

Accurately labeling large datasets is important for biomedical machine learning yet challenging while modern data augmentation methods may generate noise in the training data, which may deteriorate machine learning model performance. Existing approaches addressing noisy training data typically rely on strict modeling assumptions, classification models and well-curated dataset. To address these, we propose a novel reliability-based training-data-cleaning method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method uses a small set of well-curated training data and leverages ICP-calculated reliability metrics to selectively correct mislabeled data and outliers within vast quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy is validated across three classification tasks with distinct modalities: filtering drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with free-text title and abstract, predicting ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels of noise to the training labels were introduced via label permutation. Our training-data-cleaning method significantly enhanced the downstream classification performance (paired t-tests, <i>p</i> ≤ 0 . 05 among 30 random train/test partitions): significant accuracy enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4% increase from 0.812 to 0.905), significant AUROC and AUPRC enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% increase from 0.597 to 0.739 for AUROC, and 69.8% increase from 0.183 to 0.311 for AUPRC), and significant accuracy and macro-average F1-score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing experiments (up to 74.6% increase from 0.351 to 0.613 for accuracy, and 89.0% increase from 0.267 to 0.505 for F1-score). The improvement can be both statistically and clinically significant for information retrieval, disease diagnosis and prognosis. The method offers the potential to substantially boost classification performance in biomedical machine learning tasks without necessitating an excessive volume of well-curated training data or strong data distribution and modeling assumptions in existing semi-supervised learning methods.

Forecasting the occurrence and absence of novel disease outbreaks is essential for disease management, yet existing methods are often context-specific, require a long preparation time, and non-outbreak prediction remains understudied. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework using a feature-based time series classification (TSC) method to forecast outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We tested our methods on synthetic data from a Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model for slowly changing, noisy disease dynamics. Outbreak sequences give a transcritical bifurcation within a specified future time window, whereas non-outbreak (null bifurcation) sequences do not. We identified incipient differences, reflected in 22 statistical features and 5 early warning signal indicators, in time series of infectives leading to future outbreaks and non-outbreaks. Classifier performance, given by the area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC), ranged from 0 . 99 for large expanding windows of training data to 0 . 7 for small rolling windows. The framework is further evaluated on four empirical datasets: COVID-19 incidence data from Singapore, 18 other countries, and Edmonton, Canada, as well as SARS data from Hong Kong, with two classifiers exhibiting consistently high accuracy. Our results highlight detectable statistical features distinguishing outbreak and non-outbreak sequences well before potential occurrence, in both synthetic and real-world datasets presented in this study.

<i>Hermetia illucens</i> is an important insect resource. Studies have shown that exploring the effects of Cu<sup>2+</sup>-stressed on the growth and development of the <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome holds significant scientific importance. There are three major challenges in the current studies of <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data analysis: firstly, the lack of available genomic data which limits researchers in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data analysis. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, there are no Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature selection models designed specifically for <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome. Unlike human genomic data, noise in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> data is a more serious problem. Third, how to choose those genes located in the pathway enrichment region. Existing models assume that each gene probe has the same priori weight. However, researchers usually pay more attention to gene probes which are in the pathway enrichment region. Based on the above challenges, we initially construct experiments and establish a new Cu<sup>2+</sup>-stressed <i>Hermetia illucens</i> growth genome dataset. Subsequently, we propose AWGE-ESPCA: an edge Sparse PCA model based on adaptive noise elimination regularization and weighted gene network. The AWGE-ESPCA model innovatively proposes an adaptive noise elimination regularization method, effectively addressing the noise challenge in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data. We also integrate the known gene-pathway quantitative information into the Sparse PCA(SPCA) framework as a priori knowledge, which allows the model to filter out the gene probes in pathway-rich regions as much as possible. Ultimately, this study conducts five independent experiments and compared four latest Sparse PCA models as well as representative supervised and unsupervised baseline models to validate the model performance. The experimental results demonstrate the superior pathway and gene selection capabilities of the AWGE-ESPCA model. Ablation experiments validate the role of the adaptive regularizer and network weighting module. To summarize, this paper presents an innovative unsupervised model for <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome analysis, which can effectively help researchers identify potential biomarkers. In addition, we also provide a working AWGE - ESPCA model code in the address: https://github.com/yhyresearcher/AWGE_ESPCA.

                <p>by Alexa Aucoin, Kevin K. Lin, Katalin M. Gothard</p>

The amygdala responds to a large variety of socially and emotionally salient environmental and interoceptive stimuli. The context in which these stimuli occur determines their social and emotional significance. In canonical neurophysiological studies, the fast-paced succession of stimuli and events induce phasic changes in neural activity. During inter-trial intervals neural activity is expected to return to a stable and featureless level of spontaneous activity, often called baseline. In previous studies we found that context, such as the presence of a social partner, induces brain states that can transcend the fast-paced succession of stimuli and can be recovered from the spontaneous, inter-trial firing rate of neurons. Indeed, the spontaneous firing rates of neurons in the amygdala are different during blocks of gentle grooming touches delivered by a trusted social partner, and during blocks of non-social airflow stimuli delivered by a computer-controlled air valve. Here, we examine local field potentials (LFPs) recorded during periods of spontaneous activity to determine whether information about context can be extracted from these signals. We found that information about social vs. non-social context is present in the local field potential during periods of spontaneous activity between the application of grooming and airflow stimuli, as machine learning techniques can reliably decode context from spectrograms of spontaneous LFPs. No significant differences were detected between the nuclei of the amygdala that receive direct or indirect inputs from areas of the prefrontal cortex known to coordinate flexible, context-dependent behaviors. The lack of nuclear specificity suggests that context-related synaptic inputs arise from a shared source, possibly interoceptive inputs, that signal the physiological state of the body during social and non-social blocks of tactile stimulation.

                <p>by Deepanshu N. D. Singh, Abigail R. E. Roberts, Xiaocui Wang, Guiyi Li, Enrique Quesada Moraga, David Alliband, Elizabeth Ballou, Hung-Ji Tsai, Alicia Hidalgo</p>

Fungi can intervene in hosts’ brain function. In humans, they can drive neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. However, how fungi alter the host brain is unknown. The mechanism underlying innate immunity to fungi is well-known and universally conserved downstream of shared Toll/TLR receptors, which via the adaptor MyD88 and the transcription factor Dif/NFκB, induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). However, in the brain, Toll-1 could also drive an alternative pathway via Sarm, which causes cell death instead. Sarm is the universal inhibitor of MyD88 and could drive immune evasion. Here, we show that exposure to the fungus <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> reduced fly life span, impaired locomotion and caused neurodegeneration. <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> entered the <i>Drosophila </i>brain and induced the up-regulation of <i>AMPs</i>, and the Toll adaptors <i>wek</i> and <i>sarm</i>, within the brain. RNAi knockdown of <i>Toll-1, wek</i> or <i>sarm</i> concomitantly with infection prevented <i>B. bassiana-</i>induced cell loss. By contrast, over-expression of <i>wek</i> or <i>sarm</i> was sufficient to cause neuronal loss in the absence of infection. Thus, <i>B. bassiana</i> caused cell loss in the host brain via Toll-1/Wek/Sarm signalling driving immune evasion. A similar activation of Sarm downstream of TLRs upon fungal infections could underlie psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases in humans.

Tropical forests hold most of Earth’s biodiversity and a higher concentration of threatened mammals than other biomes. As a result, some mammal species persist almost exclusively in protected areas, often within extensively transformed and heavily populated landscapes. Other species depend on remaining remote forested areas with sparse human populations. However, it remains unclear how mammalian communities in tropical forests respond to anthropogenic pressures in the broader landscape in which they are embedded. As governments commit to increasing the extent of global protected areas to prevent further biodiversity loss, identifying the landscape-level conditions supporting wildlife has become essential. Here, we assessed the relationship between mammal communities and anthropogenic threats in the broader landscape. We simultaneously modeled species richness and community occupancy as complementary metrics of community structure, using a state-of-the-art community model parameterized with a standardized pan-tropical data set of 239 mammal species from 37 forests across 3 continents. Forest loss and fragmentation within a 50-km buffer were associated with reduced occupancy in monitored communities, while species richness was unaffected by them. In contrast, landscape-scale human density was associated with reduced mammal richness but not occupancy, suggesting that sensitive species have been extirpated, while remaining taxa are relatively unaffected. Taken together, these results provide evidence of extinction filtering within tropical forests triggered by anthropogenic pressure occurring in the broader landscape. Therefore, existing and new reserves may not achieve the desired biodiversity outcomes without concurrent investment in addressing landscape-scale threats.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.087, p = 0.001). Social support was significantly related to Academic stress (β = 0.117, p = 0.031) and self-efficacy (β =0.088, p = 0.021). However, both social support (β = 0.099, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.646, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.012, CI [0.002, 0.024], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.057, CI [0.006, 0.111], p = 0.068). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

                Background Biogas production from different types of biodegradable wastes used as an alternative for fossil fuels for energy consumption and biodegradable waste management. Biogas is a cost-effective, ecologically friendly, sustainable energy source that is also a reliable method to handle food waste. Methods This study used rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F to maximize the production of biogas from household consumption of three substrates such as cattle manure, cafeteria leftover foods, and fruit and vegetable wastes. Plastic 0.6 L digesters operating at a mesophilic temperature (30°C) were used to produce biogas from the mixed waste. Biogas production was recorded after the 60-day retention period. Standard methods were used to figure out parameters like pH, total solids, organic carbon volatile solids, and moisture content of the raw mixed wastes. This study was carried out experimentally using factorial patterns and a completely randomized 6 × 2 design. The water displacement method was used to estimate the average amount of biogas generated by a 0.6 L digester. Result The corresponding VS/TS ratios for cattle manure, fruit and vegetable waste, and leftover cafeteria food waste were 91.2%, 80.2%, and 78.3%. More biogas was produced using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F than from mixed wastes without inoculums. The highest volume of biogas (6900.3 ml) was generated by mixing 10 ml of S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F with the rumen fluids (100 ml). The digester that included 100 ml of rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae was the optimum performance for biogas production. Conclusion This result suggests that using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as inoculums in a biogas digestor can enhance the production of biogas.

                Microglia are known to be involved in the modulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a recent study, Jacquet et al. describe how microglia degrade larger Aβ aggregates by forming lysosomal synapses, further implicating the microglial release of lysosomal Aβ, amongst other processes, in the growth and spread of fibrillary Aβ.

                Zhou et al. demonstrate that exposure to extracellular LDs triggers a global transcriptional response in macrophages, leading to attenuation of proinflammatory signaling. TREM2 and MS4A7 are dispensable for LD efferocytosis but contribute to its inhibitory effects on macrophage inflammatory response.

                Lu et al. show the mechanism of APA regulation in macrophages upon VSV infection. MAVS activates the nuclear import of SYVN1, and then SYVN1 catalyzes the ubiquitination of CPSF6, resulting in CPSF6 degradation, APA switching, and antiviral effects. They identify the APA regulation mechanism in antiviral immune responses.

              <h4><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02766-9">When noise becomes the signal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 13 February 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02766-9">doi:10.1038/s41567-024-02766-9</a></p>Even a child intuitively understands the cold of winter or the heat of a hot summer day. However, when it comes to a scientific definition of temperature, things get murky quickly. As Aaron Hui explains, measuring electrical noise is one way to measure temperature directly.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101950">From histology to macroscale function in the human amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a subcortical region in the mesiotemporal lobe that plays a key role in emotional and sensory functions. Conventional neuroimaging experiments treat this structure as a single, uniform entity, but there is ample histological evidence for subregional heterogeneity in microstructure and function. The current study characterized subregional structure-function coupling in the human amygdala, integrating <i>post-mortem</i> histology and in vivo MRI at ultra-high fields. Core to our work was a novel neuroinformatics approach that leveraged multiscale texture analysis as well as non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to identify salient dimensions of microstructural variation in a 3D <i>post-mortem</i> histological reconstruction of the human amygdala. We observed two axes of subregional variation in this region, describing inferior-superior as well as mediolateral trends in microstructural differentiation that in part recapitulated established atlases of amygdala subnuclei. Translating our approach to in vivo MRI data acquired at 7 Tesla, we could demonstrate the generalizability of these spatial trends across 10 healthy adults. We then cross-referenced microstructural axes with functional blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal analysis obtained during task-free conditions, and revealed a close association of structural axes with macroscale functional network embedding, notably the temporo-limbic, default mode, and sensory-motor networks. Our novel multiscale approach consolidates descriptions of amygdala anatomy and function obtained from histological and in vivo imaging techniques.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95334">Mechanism of dimer selectivity and binding cooperativity of BRAF inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant signaling of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> is a major cancer driver. Current FDA-approved RAF inhibitors selectively inhibit the monomeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and suffer from tumor resistance. Recently, dimer-selective and equipotent RAF inhibitors have been developed; however, the mechanism of dimer selectivity is poorly understood. Here, we report extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the monomeric and dimeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in the apo form or in complex with one or two dimer-selective (PHI1) or equipotent (LY3009120) inhibitor(s). The simulations uncovered the unprecedented details of the remarkable allostery in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimerization and inhibitor binding. Specifically, dimerization retrains and shifts the αC helix inward and increases the flexibility of the DFG motif; dimer compatibility is due to the promotion of the αC-in conformation, which is stabilized by a hydrogen bond formation between the inhibitor and the αC Glu501. A more stable hydrogen bond further restrains and shifts the αC helix inward, which incurs a larger entropic penalty that disfavors monomer binding. This mechanism led us to propose an empirical way based on the co-crystal structure to assess the dimer selectivity of a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor. Simulations also revealed that the positive cooperativity of PHI1 is due to its ability to preorganize the αC and DFG conformation in the opposite protomer, priming it for binding the second inhibitor. The atomically detailed view of the interplay between BRAF dimerization and inhibitor allostery as well as cooperativity has implications for understanding kinase signaling and contributes to the design of protomer selective RAF inhibitors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104052">A within-host infection model to explore tolerance and resistance</a></h4>

              
                How are some individuals surviving infections while others die? The answer lies in how infected individuals invest into controlling pathogen proliferation and mitigating damage, two strategies respectively called resistance and disease tolerance. Pathogen within-host dynamics (WHD), influenced by resistance, and its connection to host survival, determined by tolerance, decide the infection outcome. To grasp these intricate effects of resistance and tolerance, we used a deterministic theoretical model where pathogens interact with the immune system of a host. The model describes the positive and negative regulation of the immune response, consider the way damage accumulate during the infection and predicts WHD. When chronic, infections stabilize at a Set-Point Pathogen Load (SPPL). Our model predicts that this situation can be transient, the SPPL being then a predictor of life span which depends on initial condition (e.g. inoculum). When stable, the SPPL is rather diagnostic of non lethal chronic infections. In lethal infections, hosts die at a Pathogen Load Upon Death (PLUD) which is almost independent from the initial conditions. As the SPPL, the PLUD is affected by both resistance and tolerance but we demonstrate that it can be used in conjunction with mortality measurement to distinguish the effect of disease tolerance from that of resistance. We validate empirically this new approach, using Drosophila melanogaster and the pathogen Providencia rettgeri. We found that, as predicted by the model, hosts that were wounded or deficient of key antimicrobial peptides had a higher PLUD, while Catalase mutant hosts, likely to have a default in disease tolerance, had a lower PLUD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101388">Quantification of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium population dynamics in murine infection using a highly diverse barcoded library</a></h4>

              
                Murine models are often used to study the pathogenicity and dissemination of the enteric pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium. Here, we quantified <i>S</i>. Typhimurium population dynamics in mice using the STAMPR analytic pipeline and a highly diverse <i>S</i>. Typhimurium barcoded library containing ~55,000 unique strains distinguishable by genomic barcodes by enumerating <i>S</i>. Typhimurium founding populations and deciphering routes of spread in mice. We found that a severe bottleneck allowed only one in a million cells from an oral inoculum to establish a niche in the intestine. Furthermore, we observed compartmentalization of pathogen populations throughout the intestine, with few barcodes shared between intestinal segments and feces. This severe bottleneck widened and compartmentalization was reduced after streptomycin treatment, suggesting the microbiota plays a key role in restricting the pathogen’s colonization and movement within the intestine. Additionally, there was minimal sharing between the intestine and extraintestinal organ populations, indicating dissemination to extraintestinal sites occurs rapidly, before substantial pathogen expansion in the intestine. Bypassing the intestinal bottleneck by inoculating mice via intravenous or intraperitoneal injection revealed that <i>Salmonella</i> re-enters the intestine after establishing niches in extraintestinal sites by at least two distinct pathways. One pathway results in a diverse intestinal population. The other re-seeding pathway is through the bile, where the pathogen is often clonal, leading to clonal intestinal populations and correlates with gallbladder pathology. Together, these findings deepen our understanding of <i>Salmonella</i> population dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92405">The population genetics of convergent adaptation in maize and teosinte is not locally restricted</a></h4>

              
                What is the genetic architecture of local adaptation and what is the geographic scale over which it operates? We investigated patterns of local and convergent adaptation in five sympatric population pairs of traditionally cultivated maize and its wild relative teosinte (<i>Zea mays</i> subsp. <i>parviglumis</i>). We found that signatures of local adaptation based on the inference of adaptive fixations and selective sweeps are frequently exclusive to individual populations, more so in teosinte compared to maize. However, for both maize and teosinte, selective sweeps are also frequently shared by several populations, and often between subspecies. We were further able to infer that selective sweeps were shared among populations most often via migration, though sharing via standing variation was also common. Our analyses suggest that teosinte has been a continued source of beneficial alleles for maize, even after domestication, and that maize populations have facilitated adaptation in teosinte by moving beneficial alleles across the landscape. Taken together, our results suggest local adaptation in maize and teosinte has an intermediate geographic scale, one that is larger than individual populations but smaller than the species range.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89459">CryoEM structures of Kv1.2 potassium channels, conducting and non-conducting</a></h4>

              
                We present near-atomic-resolution cryoEM structures of the mammalian voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2 in open, C-type inactivated, toxin-blocked and sodium-bound states at 3.2 Å, 2.5 Å, 3.2 Å, and 2.9 Å. These structures, all obtained at nominally zero membrane potential in detergent micelles, reveal distinct ion-occupancy patterns in the selectivity filter. The first two structures are very similar to those reported in the related Shaker channel and the much-studied Kv1.2–2.1 chimeric channel. On the other hand, two new structures show unexpected patterns of ion occupancy. First, the toxin α-Dendrotoxin, like Charybdotoxin, is seen to attach to the negatively-charged channel outer mouth, and a lysine residue penetrates into the selectivity filter, with the terminal amine coordinated by carbonyls, partially disrupting the outermost ion-binding site. In the remainder of the filter two densities of bound ions are observed, rather than three as observed with other toxin-blocked Kv channels. Second, a structure of Kv1.2 in Na<sup>+</sup> solution does not show collapse or destabilization of the selectivity filter, but instead shows an intact selectivity filter with ion density in each binding site. We also attempted to image the C-type inactivated Kv1.2 W366F channel in Na<sup>+</sup> solution, but the protein conformation was seen to be highly variable and only a low-resolution structure could be obtained. These findings present new insights into the stability of the selectivity filter and the mechanism of toxin block of this intensively studied, voltage-gated potassium channel.

">The effect of chronic stress and chronic alcohol intake on behavior, brain structure, and functional connectivity in a rat model</a></h4>

              
                Pathological chronic stress is stress exceeding the organism's ability to cope physiologically, which may act as a risk factor in the onset and relapse of alcohol use disorder. Chronic- restraint stress (CRS) and ethanol intake are independently known to induce changes in brain structure and function, however, their combined effects on neurodevelopment over long periods of time remains largely unexplored. We conducted an in vivo longitudinal rat model with three main goals. 1) to determine if chronic stress increases ethanol intake; 2) to determine the effect of chronic- stress and ethanol intake in behavioral measures, brain structure, and function; and 3) to investigate the effect of sex. This observational study included Wistar rats assigned to four groups: 1) ethanol consumption (EtOH+/CRS-), 2) stress exposure (EtOH-/CRS+), 3) both ethanol and stress exposure (EtOH+/CRS+), and 4) control group (EtOH-/CRS-). Our results showed that chronic stress did not affect ethanol intake but led to reduced body weight gain, elevated corticosterone levels, and impaired recognition memory. Structural MRI revealed that both exposures produced additive brain volume changes in regions such as the olfactory bulb, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Functional connectivity analysis using network-based statistics identified disrupted cortical-subcortical connections. Results found here were sex-dependent in terms of volumetric changes (higher effects on males) and functional connectivity (higher effects on females). Findings suggest sex-dependent mechanisms where both chronic- ethanol intake and stress affect brain plasticity during neurodevelopment. Understanding these region-specific vulnerabilities is crucial for addressing alcohol use disorders and stress-related neuropathology.

">Social, cognitive and sensory dimensions of cortical network overconnectivity in young children with autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                The heterogeneity in both the neurobiological mechanisms and the phenotypic presentation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) poses a major challenge to clinical and translational research. Early inefficiencies in functional connectivity (FC) have been associated with ASD, yet it remains unclear whether and how abnormal brain network properties may account for individual differences across ASD-related symptomatology and behaviors. We applied source-level reconstruction to resting-state high-definition EEG data in a cohort of 113 young children (40 with ASD) to identify early global and local alterations of cortical network connectivity. We subsequently used regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA) to characterize specific FC patterns linked to variation in cognitive, social and sensory dimensions within the autism spectrum. We found increased low-frequency FC in frontotemporal cross-hemispheric networks and lateral-occipital regions of young ASD children. RCCA revealed three distinct FC patterns in recurrent ASD-related networks, each contributing to predict individual differences in cognitive, social and sensory features. These linked FC-behavior dimensions may shed light on atypical brain network topology conferring risk for specific phenotypic manifestations of ASD, which may implicate unique underlying neurobiological mechanisms.

">Sex-specific effects of appetite suppressants and stereotypy in rats</a></h4>

              
                This study investigated the sex-specific effects of commonly prescribed appetite suppressants on body weight and the manifestation of motor side effects, specifically stereotypy. Employing video recordings and DeepLabCut (DLC) for precise behavioral quantification, we analyzed stereotypy, defined as purposeless, repetitive motor behaviors, in male and female rats. Under control (saline) conditions, male rats exhibited a greater propensity for weight gain compared to females. However, in contrast, female rats demonstrated greater and more homogenous weight loss than males following the administration of diethylpropion and tesofensine. Phentermine and mazindol induced comparable weight loss in both sexes, whereas cathine elicited weight reduction exclusively in males. 5-HTP and d-amphetamine administration only prevented weight gain relative to controls. Analysis of motor side effects revealed that drugs primarily targeting dopamine pathways, specifically phentermine, mazindol, diethylpropion, cathine, and d-amphetamine, induced pronounced stereotypies, particularly head-weaving, in both sexes. Interestingly, tesofensine elicited head-weaving behavior exclusively in female subjects, albeit to a lesser extent than that observed with other dopaminergic agents; conversely, tesofensine was most frequently associated with orolingual dyskinesia. Moreover, one of the most potent forms of stereotypy backward locomotion, here referred to as "moonwalking" was sporadically observed only following the administration of phentermine, diethylpropion, cathine, and mazindol, with diethylpropion inducing it most frequently. Male subjects treated with these same drugs exhibited an unexpected effect: spontaneous ejaculations, potentially attributable to the combined effects on dopamine and serotonin signaling in brain regions regulating sexual function. Network analysis and Markov transition matrices revealed distinct behavioral profiles associated with head-weaving, which emerged as the dominant attractor state, suggesting potential mechanistic differences among these drugs. Collectively, this study provides a valuable database characterizing the behavioral side effects of appetite suppressants.

">Neural dynamics of proactive and reactive cognitive control in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed behavior requires adjusting cognitive control to both react to and prepare for conflict. Previous work indicates theta oscillations and population activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) are critical for reactive control. However, the neural mechanisms supporting proactive control are less clear. Here, we investigated the neural basis of behavioral adaptations when control is prepared in anticipation of conflict using intracranial EEG (iEEG) in dmPFC and dlPFC during a Stroop task where conflict frequency was manipulated across blocks. We observed canonical conflict-driven increases in dmPFC theta and in dmPFC and dlPFC local population activity, as indexed by high frequency activity (HFA). Conflict also suppressed theta power in both regions after the response, accentuated a pre-response beta desynchronization selectively in dlPFC, and increased a post-response beta rebound in both regions. Importantly, we identified a pre-trial marker of proactive control where dmPFC theta power increased before trials when conflict was expected, and theta, beta, and HFA conflict signals in both regions were enhanced when conflict was rare and diminished when conflict was common. These findings reveal shared HFA but dissociable oscillatory dynamics in dmPFC and dlPFC during reactive conflict processing, highlight pre-trial dmPFC theta as a potential substrate for proactive control, and refine the roles of dmPFC and dlPFC in control adaptations.

">A Novel Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease for Investigating Progressive Pathology and Neuroprotection</a></h4>

              
                Developing animal models that successfully recapitulate the features of progressive Parkinson's disease (PD) is crucial for understanding disease progression mechanisms and creating effective therapeutic interventions. In this study, we created a mouse model of PD by overexpressing -synuclein through a combined injection of AAV6--synuclein and preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the medial and lateral substantia nigra (SN). We also demonstrated that chronic administration of the c-Abl inhibitor PD180970 provides neuroprotection in this model. Mice injected with the AAV6--synuclein and PFF combination showed a progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the SN and their projections in the striatum over 24 weeks. This neuronal loss coincided with a time-dependent accumulation of phosphorylated -synuclein (p-syn) in the SN. The p-syn aggregates spread to synaptically connected DARPP-32-positive neurons in the striatum and further extended to the cortex. We also observed a contralateral spread of p-syn aggregates. Additionally, -synuclein overexpression led to a significant increase in activated microglia and astrocytes at all timepoints, with the strongest activation occurring early and gradually diminishing over time. Daily administration of PD180970 significantly reduced the loss of DA neurons caused by -synuclein injection and decreased the accumulation of p-syn in the SN. PD180970 treatment also reduced the neuroinflammation significantly. Overall, the combined injection of AAV6--synuclein and preformed fibrils into the mouse brain establishes a robust PD model, enabling detailed mechanistic studies of the disease. We further demonstrate the model's utility for chronic neuroprotection studies using the potential drug PD180970, highlighting its broad applicability.

">Common Neural Choice Signals reflect Accumulated Evidence, not Confidence</a></h4>

              
                While much research has investigated decision confidence, its neural underpinnings remain unclear. Although several studies have shown that centro-parietal EEG signals correlate with the reported level of confidence, according to recent computational work these signals reflect evidence which feeds into the computation of confidence, but they do not themselves track confidence. To test this prediction, we capitalized on our recent finding that a causal manipulation of prior beliefs selectively affects confidence, while leaving objective task performance unaffected. Using EEG recordings, we tested whether neural signals known to correlate with confidence (CPP and Pe) reflect evidence accumulation or confidence. Behaviorally, we replicated the finding that manipulating prior beliefs causally and selectively affected confidence without changing objective task performance. The EEG data showed a monotonic relation between the reported level of confidence and both CPP and Pe amplitudes. Importantly, this finding is compatible both with the theory that these signals track confidence as well as with the alternative theory that they track accumulated evidence. Critically, both neural signals were insensitive to the influence of prior beliefs on confidence, showing that they reflect the accumulated evidence that is used by the system to compute confidence, instead of directly reflecting confidence. Likewise, oscillatory activity in alpha and beta band was insensitive to the influence of prior beliefs on confidence. Decoding analyses revealed that the brain does hold shared representations for prior beliefs and confidence, and we identified a frontal signal that is sensitive to both confidence and prior beliefs. These findings are in line with recent views suggesting that the CPP and the Pe reflect evidence accumulation, which is combined with prior beliefs to form a confidence judgment.

">Successful axonal regeneration is driven by evolutionarily conserved metabolic reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Unlike mammals, zebrafish can regrow axons after injury and restore circuit function in the central nervous system (CNS). Mitochondria have been identified as key players in this process, but how different metabolic pathways work together to sustain regeneration remains unclear. Using RNA sequencing of adult zebrafish retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve crush injury, we found that oxidative phosphorylation is downregulated during axonal regrowth. Simultaneously, the thioredoxin antioxidant system was upregulated, likely to limit oxidative damage. Additionally, we observed an integrated upregulation of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway during the initial regrowth phases, possibly to provide energy and supplying NADPH for biosynthesis and antioxidant responses. We show that this metabolic reprogramming is evolutionarily conserved, as a comparable one occurs in the pro-regenerative mammalian Pten and Socs3 co-deletion model. Inhibiting glycolysis and thioredoxin in zebrafish impairs axonal regrowth, suggesting that targeting these pathways could enhance CNS regeneration in mammals.

">The Thermal Grill Elicits Central Sensitization</a></h4>

              
                The thermal grill, in which innocuous warm and cool stimuli are interlaced, can produce a paradoxical burning pain sensation--the thermal grill illusion (TGI). While the mechanisms underlying TGI remain unclear, prominent theories point to spinal dorsal horn integration of innocuous thermal inputs to elicit pain. It remains unknown whether the TGI activates peripheral nociceptors, or solely thermosensitive afferents and is integrated within the spinal cord. Different types of sensitization have established mechanisms and can inform TGI mechanisms: if the TGI elicits (1) primary hyperalgesia, peripheral nociceptors are activated; (2) secondary hyperalgesia in the absence of primary hyperalgesia, spinal integration is required; and (3) brush allodynia, wide-dynamic range neurons are involved in mediating the TGI. Here, we determine whether the TGI elicits primary hyperalgesia, secondary hyperalgesia or brush allodynia. Fifty-two participants underwent individually calibrated phasic thermal grill stimulation. We found that the TGI elicited primary hyperalgesia, but only in participants with component temperatures in the noxious range (<19 {degrees}C and >41 {degrees}C). The TGI also elicited secondary hyperalgesia, even in participants with strictly innocuous thermal inputs. No participants developed brush allodynia. We observed sex differences in primary hyperalgesia: only males exhibited thermal grill-induced primary hyperalgesia. These findings suggest that the TGI is integrated in the spinal dorsal horn, likely mediated by heat-pinch-cold (HPC) neurons, and, to some degree, by primary nociceptive afferents in males. This study shows that the TGI may have sex-dependent mechanisms and determines that HPC cells are involved in the illusory sensation of pain from innocuous thermal inputs.

">Dissociating the incubation of appetitive and consummatory behavior in a model of oral cocaine self-administration</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder remains a persistent public health dilemma that currently lacks effective treatment strategies. One key impediment to successful treatment outcomes is increased drug craving that occurs over the course of abstinence and subsequent relapse to drug use. This phenomenon, known as the incubation of drug craving, has been modeled extensively in rodent models of intravenous drug self-administration. As commonly implemented, the design of intravenous self-administration preclinical studies precludes disentangling appetitive and consummatory behaviors as drug seeking (appetitive) and taking (consummatory) is simultaneous. Here, we employed a model of oral cocaine self-administration to interrogate the incubation of drug vs nondrug craving, where the route of administration is identical between reinforcers and appetitive and consummatory behaviors are dissociable. Oral self-administration of cocaine produced detectable levels of cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine, within the blood and brain, and blood and brain levels of both substrates correlated with cocaine consumption. When tested for seeking- (lever pressing) and taking-related (magazine head entries) behavior after 1 or 21 days of forced abstinence from cocaine or saccharin, we observed incubation of lever pressing among cocaine-administering mice and incubation of magazine entries among saccharin-administering mice. These behavioral changes were accompanied by reduced expression of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of cocaine self-administering mice, regardless of abstinence. Altogether, these results underscore the utility of this model of cocaine self-administration, highlight the conserved nature of incubated cocaine seeking across routes of administration, and demonstrate the dissociable neurobehavioral sequelae of the incubation of reward seeking across reinforcer types.

">Circuit-Based Understanding of Fine Spatial Scale Clustering of Orientation Tuning in Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                In sensory cortex of brain it is often the case that neurons are spatially organized by their functional properties. A hallmark of primary visual cortex (V1) in higher mammals is a columnar functional map, where neurons tuned to different stimuli features are regularly organized in space. However, rodent visual cortex is at odds with this rule and lacks any spatially ordered functional architecture, and rather neuron feature preference is haphazardly organized in patterns termed "salt-and-pepper". This sharp contrast in feature organization between the visual cortices of rodents and higher mammals has been a persistent mystery, fueled in part by abundant evidence of conserved cortical physiology between species. In this work, we applied a novel GCaMP indicator that are localized in the nucleus of neurons during two photon imaging in mouse V1, which enabled us to overcome most spurious spatially correlated activity due to fluorescence contamination, and to ensure a faithful observation of functional organization over space. We found that the orientation tuning properties of distant neuron pairs (> 20 um) are irregularly and randomly organized, while neuron pairs that are extremely close (< 20 um) have strongly correlated orientation tuning, indicating a narrow yet strong spatially clustered organization of orientation preference, which we term "micro-clustered" organization. Exploring a circuit based model of recurrently coupled mouse V1 we derived two key predictions for the micro cluster: spatially localized recurrent connections over a comparable narrow spatial scale, and common relative spatial spreads of balanced excitation and inhibition in the network over broad spatial scales. These predictions are validated by both anatomical and optogenetic-based physiological circuit mapping experiments. Altogether, our work takes an important step in building a circuit-based theory of visual processing in mouse V1 over spatial scales that are often ignored, yet contain powerful synaptic interactions.

">Elusive scents: neurocomputational mechanisms of verbal omissions in free odor naming</a></h4>

              
                Odor naming is considered a particularly challenging cognitive test, but the underlying cause of this difficulty is unknown. People often fail to report any source label to identify common odors, resulting in omissions (i.e., a lack of response). Here, with the support of a computational model, we offer a hypothesis about the neural network mechanisms underlying odor naming omissions. Based on an evaluation of behavioral data from almost 40,000 odor naming attempts, we suggest that high omission rates are driven by odors that are referred to by multiple linguistic labels. To explain this observation at the systems level, where olfactory perception and language (semantic) processing are produced by interacting cortical systems, we developed a computational model consisting of two associatively coupled attractor memory networks (odor and language networks), and investigated the effect of Hebbian-like learning on the simulated task performance. We used distributed network representations for the odor percepts and word label mental objects, and accounted for their statistical inter-relationships (correlations) extracted from collected data on odor perceptual similarity, and from a large Swedish odor language corpus, respectively. We evaluated a novel hypothesis, that Bayesian-Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanisms can explain behavioral omissions in odor naming tasks, casting new light on the underlying mechanisms of this frequently observed memory phenomenon. Due to the nature of Bayesian-Hebbian associative learning connecting the two networks, there was a progressively weaker coupling for odors paired with multiple different labels in the encoding process (one-to-many mapping). Thus, when the model was cued with perceptual odor stimuli that established multiple word label associations (one-to-many mapping), the olfactory language network often produced subthreshold network responses, resulting in elevated omissions (opposite to one-to-few mapping scenario that led to improved performance scores). Our results are of theoretical interest, as they suggest a biologically plausible mechanism to explain a common, but poorly understood, behavioral phenomenon.

">Exposure to bullying engages social distress circuits in the adolescent and adult brain</a></h4>

              
                Despite advances in understanding the psychological and social consequences of peer victimization, the immediate effects of bullying on the central nervous system remain elusive. Here we mapped the neural responses to simulated bullying in adolescents and adults and tested whether these responses are associated with real-life victimization experiences. Fifty-one adolescents aged 11-14 years, and 47 adults underwent a functional MRI (fMRI) while watching first-person videos of bullying (victimization) in the school environment, as well as neutral and positive social interactions in a similar setting. Exposure to bullying versus positive social interaction engaged the socio-emotional and threat response systems, as well as regions related to social cognition, sensory and interoceptive processing, and motor control. These responses were consistent across adolescents and adults and dependent on the current and past victimization experiences of the participants. This large-scale activation of neural systems subserving socioemotional, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing highlights how peer victimization evokes a severe stress and alarm state in the central nervous system.

">Non-canonical internalization mechanisms of mGlu receptors</a></h4>

              
                Cell surface density of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is tightly regulated through constitutive and agonist-induced internalization. Whereas the mechanisms of constitutive internalization remain elusive, agonist-induced internalization is accepted to involve receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases (GRKs), {beta}-arrestin binding and AP2 recruitment, targeting receptors to clathrin-coated pits. Dimeric class C metabotropic glutamate (mGlu1 to 8) receptors regulate synaptic transmission but their internalization process is ambiguous. Here, we used diffusion-enhanced energy transfer (DERET) to decipher their internalization kinetics. We showed that all mGlu receptors are constitutively internalized. However, only mGlu1, 5 and 3 homodimers are agonist-induced internalized, that require neither GRKs, nor {beta}-arrestins. In contrast, the constitutive internalization involves only {beta}-arrestins. This systematic study further illustrates how different class C receptors are relative to most other GPCRs, revealing non-canonical internalization mechanisms. These insights in mGlu receptor dynamics will help promoting the therapeutic action of drugs targeting mGlu receptors.

">Cortical control of innate behavior from subcortical demonstration</a></h4>

              
                Motor control in mammals is traditionally viewed as a hierarchy of descending spinal-targeting pathways, with frontal cortex at the top. Many redundant muscle patterns can solve a given task, and this high dimensionality allows flexibility but poses a problem for efficient learning. Although a feasible solution invokes subcortical innate motor patterns, or primitives, to reduce the dimensionality of the control problem, how cortex learns to utilize such primitives remains an open question. To address this, we studied cortical and subcortical interactions as head-fixed mice learned contextual control of innate hindlimb extension behavior. Naive mice performed reactive extensions to turn off a cold air stimulus within seconds and, using predictive cues, learned to avoid the stimulus altogether in tens of trials. Optogenetic inhibition of large areas of rostral cortex completely prevented avoidance behavior, but did not impair hindlimb extensions in reaction to the cold air stimulus. Remarkably, mice covertly learned to avoid the cold stimulus even without any prior experience of successful, cortically-mediated avoidance. These findings support a dynamic, heterarchical model in which the dominant locus of control can change, on the order of seconds, between cortical and subcortical brain areas. We propose that cortex can leverage periods when subcortex predominates as demonstrations, to learn parameterized control of innate behavioral primitives.

">Perception and neural representation of intermittent odor stimuli in mice</a></h4>

              
                Odor cues in nature are sparse and highly fluctuating due to turbulent transport. To investigate how animals perceive these intermittent cues, we developed a behavioral task in which head-restrained mice made binary decisions based on the total number of discrete odor pulses presented stochastically over several seconds. Mice readily learned this task, and their performance was well-described by widely used decision models. Logistic regression of binary choices against the timing of odor pulses within the respiratory cycle revealed that mice placed higher perceptual weight to stimuli arriving during inhalation than exhalation, a phase dependency that strongly correlated with the magnitude of responses in olfactory sensory neurons. The population response of anterior piriform cortex (APCx) neurons to odor pulses was also modulated by respiration phase, although individual neurons displayed varying levels of phase-dependence. Single APCx neurons responded stochastically and transiently to odor pulses, leading to a representation that carries signatures of sensory evidence, but not its accumulation. Our study reveals that mice can integrate intermittent odor signals across dozens of breaths, but respiratory modulation of sensory inputs imposes limits on information acquisition that cortical circuits cannot overcome to improve behavior.

">Neuromodulation of the endbulb of Held synapse in the cochlear nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Synapses vary greatly in synaptic strength and plasticity, even within the same circuitry or set of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Neuromodulation is a candidate mechanism to explain some of this variability. Neuromodulators such as monoamines can differentially regulate presynaptic function as well as neuronal excitability. Variability is found also for the large calyceal synapses of the auditory pathway that are endowed with high synaptic vesicle (SV) release probability (Pvr) and large postsynaptic currents enabling reliable and temporally precise transmission of auditory information. Here we investigated whether the calyceal endbulb of Held synapse formed by auditory nerve fibers onto bushy cells (BCs) in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) is modulated by norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). Using electron microscopy (EM) of the cochlear nucleus we found evidence for putative monoaminergic varicosities in both ventral and dorsal divisions. Immunostaining for vesicular 5-HT and NE transporters revealed NE-containing and 5-HT-containing varicosities in the AVCN, juxtaposed to both endbulbs and BCs. Furthermore, we detected immunofluorescence for 5-HT1B, 5-HT4, 5-H7 receptors (R) and 2C-adrenergic receptors (AR) in BCs. We used voltage-clamp recordings from mouse BCs in order to uncover potential presynaptic effects of neuromodulation, which revealed an increase in frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) upon application of NE but not 5-HT. Evoked synaptic transmission was unaffected by the application of either NE or 5-HT. Likewise, while studying the biophysical properties of the BCs, we did not observe effects of NE or 5-HT on low-voltage-activated K+ (K+LVA) and hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation (HCN) channels during application. In summary, we report evidence for the presence of monoaminergic innervation in the cochlear nucleus and for subtle functional NE-neuromodulation at the endbulb of Held synapse.

">Developing an anatomically valid segmentation protocol for anterior regions of the medial temporal lobe for neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: Background: The anterior portion of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is one of the first regions targeted by pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE) indicating a potential for metrics from this region to serve as imaging biomarkers. Leveraging a unique post-mortem dataset of histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans we aimed to 1) develop an anatomically valid segmentation protocol for anterior entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann Area (BA) 35, and BA36 for in vivo 3 tesla (T) MRI and 2) incorporate this protocol in an automated approach. Methods: We included 20 cases (61-97 years old, 50% females) with and without neurodegenerative diseases (11 vs. 9 cases) to ensure generalizability of the developed protocol. Digitized MTL Nissl-stained coronal histology sections from these cases were annotated and registered to same-subject post-mortem MRI. The protocol was developed by determining the location of histological borders of the MTL cortices in relation to anatomical landmarks. Subsequently the protocol was applied to 15 cases twice, with a 2-week interval, to assess intra-rater reliability with the Dice Similarity Index (DSI). Thereafter it was implemented in our in-house Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS)-T1 approach and evaluated with DSIs. Results: The anterior histological border distances of ERC, BA35 and BA36 were evaluated with respect to various anatomical landmarks and the distance relative to the beginning of the hippocampus was chosen. To formulate segmentation rules, we examined the histological sections for the location of borders in relationship to anatomical landmarks in the coronal sections. The DSI for the anterior MTL cortices for the intra-rater reliability was 0.85-0.88 and for the ASHS-T1 against the manual segmentation was 0.62-0.65. Discussion: We developed a reliable segmentation protocol and incorporated it in an automated approach. Given the vulnerability of the anterior MTL cortices to tau deposition in AD and LATE, the updated approach is expected to improve imaging biomarkers for these diseases.

">Fast-timescale hippocampal processes bridge between slowly unfurling neocortical states during memory search</a></h4>

              
                Prior behavioral work showed that event structure plays a key role in our ability to mentally search through memories of continuous naturalistic experience. We hypothesized that, neurally, this memory search process involves a division of labor between slowly unfurling neocortical states representing event knowledge and fast hippocampal-neocortical communication that supports retrieval of new information at transitions between events. To test this, we tracked slow neural state-patterns in a sample of ten patients undergoing intracranial electroencephalography as they viewed a movie and then searched their memories in a structured naturalistic interview. As patients answered questions ("after X, when does Y happen next?"), state-patterns from movie-viewing were reinstated in neocortex; during memory-search, states unfurled in a forward direction. Moments of state-transition were marked by low-frequency power decreases in cortex and preceded by power decreases in hippocampus that correlated with reinstatement. Connectivity-analysis revealed information-flow from hippocampus to cortex underpinning state-transitions. Together, these results support our hypothesis that fast hippocampal processes bridge between slow neocortical states during memory search.

">Context-dependent hierarchical categorization of human faces: Behavioral and EEG/MEG evidence</a></h4>

              
                Social categorization of faces provides a key cognitive basis of human behavior and may occur along various dimensions of facial attributes. The present study investigated a potential hierarchical structure of social categorization of faces based on a superordinate (Species) versus a subordinate (Race) level of abstraction of facial attributes. We recorded behavioral performances in a face classification task and found faster responses to the same set of Asian faces when presented alternately with dog faces (a species context) relative to Black faces (a race context). In addition, using a repetition suppression (RS) paradigm, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals to Asian faces in the species and race contexts, respectively. Our analyses of the RS effects on EEG/MEG signals to Asian faces revealed that dynamic neural encoding of similarity of Asian faces occurred in the right fusiform gyrus at 140-200 ms and in the left temporoparietal junction at 317-413 ms after stimulus onset in the species context but only in the left temporoparietal junction at 317-413 ms in the race context. These behavioral and EEG/MEG findings unravel the neurocognitive mechanisms of context-dependent social categorization of faces by highlighting its hierarchically organized structure based on different levels of facial attributes.

	<p>Acupuncture is a medical tool in which a sterile needle is used to penetrate and stimulate a certain body area (acupoint), inducing a series of sensations such as numbness, dullness, or aching, often referred to as de-qi. But is that all? In this article, we adopt a Bayesian perspective to explore the cognitive and affective aspects of acupuncture beyond needling, specifically, how the body integrates bottom-up sensory signals with top-down predictions of acupuncture perception. We propose that the way in which we discern acupuncture treatment is the result of predictive coding, a probabilistic, inferential process of our brain. Active inference from both prior experience and expectations of acupuncture, when integrated with incoming sensory signals, creates a unique, individual internal generative model of our perception of acupuncture. A Bayesian framework and predictive coding may, therefore, aid in elucidating and quantifying the cognitive components of acupuncture and facilitate understanding of their differential interactions in determining individual expectations of treatment. Thus, a perception-based Bayesian model of acupuncture presented in this article may expand on how we perceive acupuncture treatment, from simply inserting needles into our body to one that encompasses a complex healing process supported by belief and hope of regaining health. By exploring how cognitive factors influence individual responsiveness to acupuncture treatment, this review sheds light on why acupuncture treatment is more effective in some individuals than in others.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prior studies have noted varied, spontaneous motor recovery in rat strains after spinal cord injury (SCI), but systematic comparisons of different locomotor measurements across different severity and sexes are lacking. Hence, we quantified hindlimb utilization in male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar rats following moderate and severe SCI. Methods: Compression SCI was induced using a 15-g clip for 180 s for moderate SCI or a 50-g aneurysm clip for 60 s for severe SCI in male and female SD and Wistar rats. Measures of locomotor performance using the Basso&amp;amp;ndash;Beattie&amp;amp;ndash;Bresnahan (BBB), CatWalk gait analysis, and horizontal ladder tests were taken postoperatively and weekly for seven weeks. Results: BBB scores indicated greater spontaneous recovery in SD rats, with females showing higher scores than males following moderate and severe SCI. No sex or strain differences were observed in the horizontal ladder test. The CatWalk results indicated greater average hindlimb swing speed in SD rats following moderate SCI, but greater print area was observed in Wistar rats after severe SCI, although female SD rats had greater print area than either male SD or female Wistar rats following moderate SCI. Conclusions: The findings that SD rats, especially females, exhibited greater spontaneous motor recovery following moderate SCI indicate the need to consider the sex and strain of rats when conducting therapeutic testing following moderate SCI. The significance of these findings is that they should facilitate the use of appropriate rat models for translational research in SCI that can be applied to future clinical trials.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Coma prognosis is challenging, as patient presentation can be misleading or uninformative when using behavioral assessments only. Event-related potentials have been shown to provide valuable information about a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s chance of survival and emergence from coma. Our prior work revealed that the mismatch negativity (MMN) in particular waxes and wanes across 24 h in some coma patients. This &amp;amp;ldquo;cycling&amp;amp;rdquo; aspect of the presence/absence of neurophysiological responses may require fine-grained tools to increase the chances of detecting levels of neural processing in coma. This study implements multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to automatically quantify patterns of neural discrimination between duration deviant and standard tones over time at the single-subject level in seventeen healthy controls and in three comatose patients. Methods: One EEG recording, containing up to five blocks of an auditory oddball paradigm, was performed in controls over a 12 h period. For patients, two EEG sessions were conducted 3 days apart for up to 24 h, denoted as day 0 and day 3, respectively. MVPA was performed using a support-vector machine classifier. Results: Healthy controls exhibited reliable discrimination or classification performance during the latency intervals associated with MMN and P3a components. Two patients showed some intervals with significant discrimination around the second half of day 0, and all had significant results on day 3. Conclusions: These findings suggest that decoding analyses can accurately classify neural responses at a single-subject level in healthy controls and provide evidence of small but significant changes in auditory discrimination over time in coma patients. Further research is needed to confirm whether this approach represents an improved technology for assessing cognitive processing in coma.</p>

	<p>Background: The construction industry faces significant safety hazards, frequent accidents, and inadequate management. Studies identify unsafe worker behaviors as the primary cause of construction accidents. However, most research overlooks the psychological state, particularly emotions, of construction workers. Methods: This study designed a behavioral experiment integrating social cognitive neuroscience, collecting real-time EEG data to classify and recognize fear, anger, and neutral emotions. Variance analysis explored differences in safety hazard identification and risk assessment under these emotional states. A total of 22 male participants were involved, with data collection lasting three days. The role of psychological capital in mediating the effects of emotions on unsafe behaviors was also examined. Results: Emotional classification using EEG signals achieved 79% accuracy by combining frequency domain and nonlinear feature extraction. Fear significantly enhanced safety hazard identification accuracy compared to neutral and anger emotions (F = 0.027, p = 0.03). Risk assessment values under fear and anger were higher than under neutral emotion (F = 0.121, p = 0.023). Psychological capital interacted significantly with emotions in hazard identification accuracy (F = 0.68, p = 0.034), response time (F = 2.562, p = 0.003), and risk assessment response time (F = 1.415, p = 0.026). Safety hazard identification correlated with the number of safety trainings (p = 0.002) and safety knowledge lectures attended (p = 0.025). Risk assessment was significantly associated with smoking (p = 0.023), alcohol consumption (p = 0.004), sleep duration (p = 0.017), and safety training (p = 0.024). Conclusions: The findings provide insights into how emotions affect safety hazard identification and risk assessment, offering a foundation for improving emotional regulation, reducing accidents, and enhancing safety management in construction.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Determine if performing ultrasound-guided, bilateral, two-level cervical sympathetic chain blocks (2LCSB) (performed on subsequent days) provides durable improvement in symptoms associated with anxiety. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted between January 2022 and November 2024. We identified 114 patients who received bilateral, 2LCSB for anxiety symptoms. Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) outcome measure scores were collected at baseline and three-months post procedure in 71 males and 43 females. Results: Out of 114 patients, 99 patients (86.8%) showed a long-lasting improvement in their GAD-7 scores. Collected GAD-7 forms had a baseline average of 15.52 (14.99 for males and 16.40 for females), which decreased after three months to an average of 7.28 (6.96 for males and 7.81 for females). This represents a 52% average improvement in anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: In individuals treated with bilateral, 2LCSB, GAD-related symptoms were improved by 52% for at least 3 months regardless of initial anxiety severity.</p>

	<p>Background: Co-occurring conditions and psychiatric comorbidities are more frequently observed in autistic individuals than in typically developing populations. Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the agreement of parent- and self-reported psychopathological assessment using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) and the Youth Self Report (YSR/11-18), respectively, in autistic adolescents without intellectual impairment. Methods: 54 autistic adolescents without intellectual impairment (11&amp;amp;ndash;18 years; M = 14.73; SD = 2.28) were assessed with a psychiatric and psychological evaluation conducted by expert clinicians also using self- and parent-reported scales and semi-structured interviews (K-SADS PL, CDI, MASC) including CBCL/6-18 and YSR/11-18. Results: According to clinical judgment, over 90% of participants had at least a comorbidity: anxiety (68.5%) and mood disorder (57.4%) were the most frequent. The results indicate significant discrepancies between parent- and self-reports across the three summary scales, which assess emotional and behavioral problems, as well as their combined presentation, often observed in youth with ASD. Specifically, differences were found in Internalizing (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), Externalizing (p = 0.013), and Total Problems (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) scales. Conclusions: The findings show the lack of agreement in parent- and self-reported scales in our sample. These results suggest the need for a cross- and multi-informant approach to support clinical judgment and understand psychopathological comorbidities of autistic adolescents without intellectual impairment.</p>

	<p>Background: Brain-inspired models are commonly employed for artificial intelligence. However, the complex environment can hinder the performance of electronic equipment. Therefore, enhancing the injury resistance of brain-inspired models is a crucial issue. Human brains have self-adaptive abilities under injury, so drawing on the advantages of the human brain to construct a brain-inspired model is intended to enhance its injury resistance. But current brain-inspired models still lack bio-plausibility, meaning they do not sufficiently draw on real neural systems&amp;amp;rsquo; structure or function. Methods: To address this challenge, this paper proposes the complex spiking neural network (Com-SNN) as a brain-inspired model, in which the topology is inspired by the topological characteristics of biological functional brain networks, the nodes are Izhikevich neuron models, and the edges are synaptic plasticity models with time delay co-regulated by excitatory synapses and inhibitory synapses. To evaluate the injury resistance of the Com-SNN, two injury-resistance metrics are investigated and compared with SNNs with alternative topologies under the stochastic removal of neuron models to simulate the consequence of stochastic attacks. In addition, the injury-resistance mechanism of brain-inspired models remains unclear, and revealing the mechanism is crucial for understanding the development of SNNs with injury resistance. To address this challenge, this paper analyzes the synaptic plasticity dynamic regulation and dynamic topological characteristics of the Com-SNN under stochastic attacks. Results: The experimental results indicate that the injury resistance of the Com-SNN is superior to that of other SNNs, demonstrating that our results can help improve the injury resistance of SNNs. Conclusions: Our results imply that synaptic plasticity is an intrinsic element impacting injury resistance, and that network topology is another element that impacts injury resistance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/7/e0216242024?rss=1">Late Development of Sensory Thresholds for Horizontal Relative Disparity in Human Visual Cortex in the Face of Precocial Development of Thresholds for Absolute Disparity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Immaturities exist at multiple levels of the developing human visual pathway, starting with immaturities in photon efficiency and spatial sampling in the retina and on through immaturities in the early and later stages of cortical processing. Here, we use steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and controlled visual stimuli to determine the degree to which sensitivity to horizontal retinal disparity is limited by the visibility of the monocular half-images, the ability to encode absolute disparity, or the ability to encode relative disparity. Responses were recorded from male and female human participants at average ages of 5.3 &plusmn; 1.6 months, 4.7&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;1.3 years, and 25.3 &plusmn; 6 years. Horizontal disparity sensitivity was measured using planar stereograms that modulated absolute disparity and stereograms portraying disparity gratings that additionally contained relative disparity. Disparity thresholds for absolute disparity changed little over development, but those for relative disparity changed by a factor of ~10. SSVEPs were also recorded in response to contrast and blur modulation of dynamic random-dot patterns to measure sensitivity to the spatiotemporal content of the monocular half-images. Equating subjective contrast and blur levels between infants, children, and adults based on these measurements did not equate disparity sensitivity. The protracted developmental sequence for horizontal relative disparity coding shown in our measurements is not simply inherited from immaturities in encoding absolute disparity or retinal image contrast but rather reflects immaturities in the computations needed to represent relative disparity that likely involves extrastriate cortical areas where relative disparity is first extracted.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/7/e0781242024?rss=1">Neural Bases of Proactive and Predictive Processing of Meaningful Subword Units in Speech Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                <p>To comprehend speech, human brains identify meaningful units, like words, in the speech stream. But whereas the English &lsquo;<I>She believed him.</I>&rsquo; has three words, the Arabic equivalent &lsquo;<I>saddaqathu</I>&rsquo; forms one word with three meaningful subword units, called morphemes: a verb stem (&lsquo;<I>saddaqa</I>&rsquo;), a subject suffix (&lsquo;-<I>t</I>-&rsquo;), and a direct object pronoun (&lsquo;-<I>hu</I>&rsquo;). It remains unclear whether and how speech comprehension involves morpheme processing, above and beyond other language units. Here, we propose and test hierarchically nested encoding models of speech comprehension: a <scp>nai&#x0308;ve</scp> model with word-, syllable-, and sound-level information; a <scp>bottom-up</scp> model with additional morpheme boundary information; and <scp>predictive</scp> models that process morphemes before these boundaries. We recorded MEG data as 27 participants (16 female) listened to Arabic sentences like &lsquo;<I>saddaqathu</I><I>.</I>&rsquo; A temporal response function analysis revealed that in temporal and left inferior frontal regions, <scp>predictive</scp> models outperform the <scp>bottom-up</scp> model, which outperforms the <scp>nai&#x0308;ve</scp> model. Moreover, verb stems were either length-<scp>ambiguous</scp> (e.g., &lsquo;<I>saddaqa</I>&rsquo; is initially mistakable for the shorter stem &lsquo;<I>sadda</I>&rsquo;, meaning &lsquo;<I>blocked</I>&rsquo;) or length-unambiguous (e.g., &lsquo;<I>qayyama</I>&rsquo;, meaning &lsquo;<I>evaluated</I>&rsquo;, cannot be mistaken for a shorter stem) but shared a uniqueness point, beyond which stem identity is disambiguated. Evoked analyses revealed differences between conditions before the uniqueness point, suggesting that, rather than await disambiguation, the brain employs <scp>proactive</scp> predictive strategies, processing accumulated input as soon as any possible stem is identifiable, even if not uniquely. These findings highlight the role of morphemes in speech and the importance of including morpheme-level information in neural and computational models of speech comprehension.</p>

                <p>How master splicing regulators cross talk with each other and to what extent transcription regulators are differentially spliced remain unclear in the developing brain. Here, cell-type&ndash;specific RNA-Seq analyses of the developing neocortex uncover variable expression of the Rbfox1/2/3 genes and enriched alternative splicing events in transcription regulators, altering protein isoforms or inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glial progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as <I>Meis2</I> and <I>Tead1</I>. Surprisingly, Rbfox proteins promote the inclusion of a mammal-specific alternative exon and a previously undescribed poison exon in <I>Ptbp1</I>. Simultaneous ablation of <I>Rbfox1/2/3</I> in the neocortex downregulates neuronal isoforms and disrupts radial neuronal migration. Furthermore, the progenitor isoform of <I>Meis2</I> promotes <I>Tgfb3</I> transcription, while the <I>Meis2</I> neuron isoform promotes neuronal differentiation. These observations indicate that transcription regulators are differentially spliced between cell types in the developing neocortex. (The sex has not been reported to affect cortical neurogenesis in mice, and embryos of both sexes were studied without distinguishing one or the other.)</p>

                <p>Spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) degeneration is a candidate factor for reduced hearing outcomes in cochlear implant (CI) users. However, there is no procedure available to identify CI contacts close to focal SGN degeneration in human patients. In an animal model, we assessed the impact of focal SGN degeneration on electrical responsiveness and derived an electrophysiological marker for the presence, location, and size of such lesions. We introduced cochlear microlesions in 13 guinea pigs (six female) and recorded electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAP) after 8&ndash;12&nbsp;d. These were compared with recordings from controls (<I>N</I> = 8) and acutely lesioned cochleae (<I>N</I> = 12). We stimulated via 6-contact CIs in monopolar configuration with symmetric, biphasic pulses of alternating polarity. We histologically assessed the lesion and its relative position to the CI contacts. The lesions (230&ndash;850&nbsp;&micro;m) significantly elevated thresholds and reduced amplitudes. The effect was found at stimulation distances of 3.5&nbsp;mm from the lesion. A novel eCAP marker, Failure Index (FI: maximal input/output ratio), was significantly elevated in the presence of degenerated SGN. It indicates the failure to efficiently transduce the stimulation current into neural activation (N1P1 amplitude). The FI showed classification accuracies of 80% and identified contacts closest to the lesion in ~80% of cases within &plusmn;700&nbsp;&micro;m (~electrode spacing) from the lesion site and was correlated with the lesion size. Thus, the FI is a clinically relevant, noninvasive marker that is suitable for clinical datasets without a priori knowledge on lesions, when combined with the statistical method of median splitting.</p>

                <p>We describe a chamber system to perform imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetic stimulation in awake and anesthetized marmosets. We developed this low-profile chamber design to be able to access the underlying tissue when needed or to leave it sealed for long periods. Such accessibility is useful to maintain chamber clarity as well as perform viral or drug injections at different time points. The chamber is flexible as either optical or electrophysiological recording can be performed in the same chamber by exchanging chamber inserts. The design provides an easy approach to day-to-day stable neural recordings that was developed for marmosets and can be extended to other species.</p>

                <p>Sensory experience during development has lasting effects on perception and neural processing. Exposing juvenile animals to artificial stimuli influences the tuning and functional organization of the auditory cortex, but less is known about how the rich acoustical environments experienced by vocal communicators affect the processing of complex vocalizations. Here, we show that in zebra finches (<I>Taeniopygia guttata</I>), a colonial-breeding songbird species, exposure to a naturalistic social-acoustical environment during development has a profound impact on auditory perceptual behavior and on cortical-level auditory responses to conspecific song. Compared to birds raised by pairs in acoustic isolation, male and female birds raised in a breeding colony were better in an operant discrimination task at recognizing conspecific songs with and without masking colony noise. Neurons in colony-reared birds had higher average firing rates, selectivity, and discriminability, especially in the narrow-spiking, putatively inhibitory neurons of a higher-order auditory area, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). Neurons in colony-reared birds were also less correlated in their tuning, more efficient at encoding the spectrotemporal structure of conspecific song, and better at filtering out masking noise. These results suggest that the auditory cortex adapts to noisy, complex acoustical environments by strengthening inhibitory circuitry, functionally decoupling excitatory neurons while maintaining overall excitatory-inhibitory balance.</p>

                <p>The cell adhesion molecule leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal protein 2 (LRRTM2) is crucial for synapse development and function. However, our understanding of its endogenous trafficking has been limited due to difficulties in manipulating its coding sequence (CDS) using standard genome editing techniques. Instead, we replaced the entire LRRTM2 CDS by adapting a two-guide CRISPR knock-in method, enabling complete control of LRRTM2. In primary rat hippocampal cultures dissociated from embryos of both sexes, N-terminally tagged, endogenous LRRTM2 was found in 80% of synapses, and synaptic LRRTM2 content correlated with PSD-95 and AMPAR levels. LRRTM2 was also enriched with AMPARs outside synapses, demonstrating the sensitivity of this method to detect relevant new biology. Finally, we leveraged total genomic control to increase the synaptic levels of LRRTM2 via simultaneous mutation of its C-terminal domain, which did not correspondingly increase AMPAR enrichment. The coding region of thousands of genes span lengths suitable for whole-CDS replacement, suggesting this simple approach will enable straightforward structure&ndash;function analysis in neurons.</p>

                <p>Hierarchy has been identified as a principle underlying the organization of human brain networks. However, it remains unclear how the network hierarchy is disrupted in Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms and how it is modulated by the underlying genetic architecture. The aim of this study was to explore alterations in the motor functional hierarchical organization of the cerebrum and their underlying genetic mechanism. In this study, the brain network hierarchy of each group was described through a connectome gradient analysis among 68 healthy controls (HC), 70 postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype, and 69 tremor-dominant (TD) subtype, including both male and female participants, according to its motor symptoms. Furthermore, transcription-neuroimaging association analyses using gene expression data from Allen Human Brain Atlas and case-control gradient differences were performed to identify genes associated with gradient alterations. Different PD motor subtypes exhibited contracted principal and secondary functional gradients relative to HC. The identified genes in different PD motor subtypes enriched for shared biological processes like metal ion transport and inorganic ion transmembrane transport. In addition, these genes were overexpressed in Ntsr+ neurons cell, enriched in extensive cortical regions and wide developmental time windows. Aberrant cerebral functional gradients in PD-related motor symptoms have been detected, and the motor-disturbed genes have shared biological functions. The present findings may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hierarchical alterations in PD.</p>

                <p>Genetic information is involved in the gradual emergence of cortical areas since the neural tube begins to form, shaping the heterogeneous functions of neural circuits in the human brain. Informed by invasive tract-tracing measurements, the cortex exhibits marked interareal variation in connectivity profiles, revealing the heterogeneity across cortical areas. However, it remains unclear about the organizing principles possibly shared by genetics and cortical wiring to manifest the spatial heterogeneity across the cortex. Instead of considering a complex one-to-one mapping between genetic coding and interareal connectivity, we hypothesized the existence of a more efficient way that the organizing principles are embedded in genetic profiles to underpin the cortical wiring space. Leveraging vertex-wise tractography in diffusion-weighted MRI, we derived the global connectopies (GCs) in both female and male to reliably index the organizing principles of interareal connectivity variation in a low-dimensional space, which captured three dominant topographic patterns along the dorsoventral, rostrocaudal, and mediolateral axes of the cortex. More importantly, we demonstrated that the GCs converge with the gradients of a vertex-by-vertex genetic correlation matrix on the phenotype of cortical morphology and the cortex-wide spatiomolecular gradients. By diving into the genetic profiles, we found that the critical role of genes scaffolding the GCs was related to brain morphogenesis and enriched in radial glial cells before birth and excitatory neurons after birth. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the existence of a genetically determined space that encodes the interareal connectivity variation, which may give new insights into the links between cortical connections and arealization.</p>

                <p>Attention is key to perception and human behavior, and evidence shows that it periodically samples sensory information (&lt;20&nbsp;Hz). However, this view has been recently challenged due to methodological concerns and gaps in our understanding of the function and mechanism of rhythmic attention. Here we used an intensive ~22&nbsp;h psychophysical protocol combined with reverse correlation analyses to infer the neural representation underlying these rhythms. Participants (male/female) performed a task in which covert spatial (sustained and exploratory) attention was manipulated and then probed at various delays. Our results show that sustained and exploratory attention periodically modulate perception via different neural computations. While sustained attention suppresses distracting stimulus features at the alpha (~12&nbsp;Hz) frequency, exploratory attention increases the gain around task-relevant stimulus feature at the theta (~6&nbsp;Hz) frequency. These findings reveal that both modes of rhythmic attention differentially shape sensory tuning, expanding the current understanding of the rhythmic sampling theory of attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/7/e1688232024?rss=1">Time Course of Orientation Ensemble Representation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Natural scenes are filled with groups of similar items. Humans employ ensemble coding to extract the summary statistical information of the environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of information processing, something particularly useful when observing natural scenes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the representation of ensemble information in the brain remain elusive. In particular, whether ensemble representation results from the mere summation of individual item representations or it engages other specific processes remains unclear. In this study, we utilized a set of orientation ensembles wherein none of the individual item orientations were the same as the ensemble orientation. We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from human participants (both sexes) when they performed an ensemble orientation discrimination task. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and the inverted encoding model (IEM) were employed to unravel the neural mechanisms of the ensemble orientation representation and track its time course. First, we achieved successful decoding of the ensemble orientation, with a high correlation between the decoding and behavioral accuracies. Second, the IEM analysis demonstrated that the representation of the ensemble orientation differed from the sum of the representations of individual item orientations, suggesting that ensemble coding could further modulate orientation representation in the brain. Moreover, using source reconstruction, we showed that the representation of ensemble orientation manifested in early visual areas. Taken together, our findings reveal the emergence of the ensemble representation in the human visual cortex and advance the understanding of how the brain captures and represents ensemble information.</p>

                <p>We aimed to identify the neuronal correlates of performance errors in a difficult timing task. Male rats were trained to seek rewards and avoid shocks depending on the position of photic conditioned stimuli (CS-R and CS-S, respectively). Then, they were exposed to conflict trials where they had to time the interval between the CS-R and CS-S to obtain rewards while avoiding footshocks. There were pronounced individual differences in behavioral strategies on conflict trials. When presented with a CS-S, some rats quickly left the shock sector, forsaking the option of earning a reward, and rarely got shocked. Others earned rewards by delaying avoidance based on the interval between the CS-R and CS-S but were shocked more often. The probability rats would fail a given trial was not stable across trials as rats engaged in incorrect trial runs that were longer than expected by chance. Since this finding suggested that rats shift between two quasi-stable processing modes, we next examined the neuronal correlates of errors. Incorrect trials coincided with reduced firing rates in CA1 and sensory cortical neurons. Moreover, trial-to-trial variations in the firing rates of simultaneously recorded neurons were more strongly correlated on error than correct trials. Last, the power of low-frequency local field potential oscillations was higher during incorrect trials. The finding that the neuronal correlates of correct and error trials are similar in the hippocampus and neocortex lead us to hypothesize that they depend on changes in the activity of common afferents, such as neuromodulatory inputs.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum, identified to be active during cognitive and social behavior, has multisynaptic connections through the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and thalamus to cortical regions, yet formation and modulation of these pathways are not fully understood. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) respond to changes in local cellular activity and emerge during development. PNNs are implicated in learning and neurodevelopmental disorders, but their role in the CN during development is unknown. Connectivity deficits, specifically between lateral CN (LCN) and cortical regions have been found in autism spectrum disorder with patients displaying reduced cognitive flexibility. To examine the role of LCN on cognition, neural activity was perturbed in both male and female mice using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) from postnatal day 21 to 35. We found that while an adolescent LCN disruption did not alter task acquisition, correct choice reversal performance was dependent on DREADD manipulation and sex. Inhibitory DREADDs improved reversal learning in males (5&nbsp;d faster to criteria), and excitatory DREADDs improved female reversal learning (10&nbsp;d faster to criteria) compared with controls. Interestingly, the DREADD manipulation in females regardless of direction reduced PNN intensity, whereas in males, only the inhibitory DREADDs reduced PNNs. This suggests a chronic adolescent LCN manipulation may have sex-specific compensatory changes in PNN structure and LCN output to improve reversal learning. This study provides new evidence for LCN in nonmotor functions and sex-dependent differences in behavior and CN plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/7/e2300232024?rss=1">Contributions of Attention to Learning in Multidimensional Reward Environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>Real-world choice options have many features or attributes, whereas the reward outcome from those options only depends on a few features or attributes. It has been shown that humans learn and combine feature-based with more complex conjunction-based learning to tackle challenges of learning in naturalistic reward environments. However, it remains unclear how different learning strategies interact to determine what features or conjunctions should be attended to and control choice behavior, and how subsequent attentional modulations influence future learning and choice. To address these questions, we examined the behavior of male and female human participants during a three-dimensional learning task in which reward outcomes for different stimuli could be predicted based on a combination of an informative feature and conjunction. Using multiple approaches, we found that both choice behavior and reward probabilities estimated by participants were most accurately described by attention-modulated models that learned the predictive values of both the informative feature and the informative conjunction. Specifically, in the reinforcement learning model that best fit choice data, attention was controlled by the difference in the integrated feature and conjunction values. The resulting attention weights modulated learning by increasing the learning rate on attended features and conjunctions. Critically, modulating decision-making by attention weights did not improve the fit of data, providing little evidence for direct attentional effects on choice. These results suggest that in multidimensional environments, humans direct their attention not only to selectively process reward-predictive attributes but also to find parsimonious representations of the reward contingencies for more efficient learning.</p>

                <p>To develop reparative therapies for neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS), we need to better understand the physiology of loss and replacement of oligodendrocytes, the cells that make myelin and are the target of damage in MS. <I>In vivo</I> two-photon fluorescence microscopy allows direct visualization of oligodendrocytes in the intact brain of transgenic mouse models, promising a deeper understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of replacing oligodendrocytes after damage. However, the task of tracking the fate of individual oligodendrocytes requires extensive effort for manual annotation and is especially challenging in three-dimensional images. While several models exist for annotating cells in two-dimensional images, few models exist to annotate cells in three-dimensional images and even fewer are designed for tracking cells in longitudinal imaging. Notably, existing options often come with a substantial financial investment, being predominantly commercial or confined to proprietary software. Furthermore, the complexity of processes and myelin formed by individual oligodendrocytes can result in the failure of algorithms that are specifically designed for tracking cell bodies alone. Here, we propose a fast, free, consistent, and unsupervised beta-mixture oligodendrocyte segmentation system (FAST) that is written in open-source software, and can segment and track oligodendrocytes in three-dimensional images over time with minimal human input. We showed that the FAST model can segment and track oligodendrocytes similarly to a blinded human observer. Although FAST was developed to apply to our studies on oligodendrocytes, we anticipate that it can be modified to study four-dimensional <I>in vivo</I> data of any brain cell with associated complex processes.</p>

                <p>The perception of scenes is associated with processing in a network of scene-selective regions in the human brain. Prior research has identified a posterior&ndash;anterior bias within this network. Posterior scene regions exhibit preferential connectivity with early visual and posterior parietal regions, indicating a role in representing egocentric visual features. In contrast, anterior scene regions demonstrate stronger connectivity with frontoparietal control and default mode networks, suggesting a role in mnemonic processing of locations. Despite these findings, evidence linking connectivity in these regions to cognitive scene processing remains limited. In this preregistered study, we obtained cognitive behavioral measures alongside resting-state fMRI data from a large-scale public dataset to investigate interindividual variation in scene processing abilities relative to the functional connectivity of the scene network. Our results revealed substantial individual differences in scene recognition, spatial memory, and navigational abilities. Resting-state functional connectivity reproduced the posterior&ndash;anterior bias within the scene network. However, contrary to our preregistered hypothesis, we did not observe any consistent associations between interindividual variation in this connectivity and behavioral performance. These findings highlight the need for further research to clarify the role of these connections in scene processing, potentially through assessments of functional connectivity during scene-relevant tasks or in naturalistic conditions.</p>

                Background This study aimed to answer the following major question: Who thinks better, non-native speakers of English or ChatGPT?. It provides evidence from processing and interpreting center-embedding English constructions that the human brain surpasses ChatGPT and that ChatGPT cannot be regarded as a theory of language. Methods Fifteen non-native English speakers were recruited as participants. A center-embedding English sentence was presented to both the study participants and the ChatGPT. The ability of the ChatGPT to predict and remember was also tested. Results The study findings reveal that the human brain is still far ahead of Large Language Models, specifically ChatGPT, even in the case of non-native speakers of L2 English. They also showed ChatGPT’s inability to predict and remember. Conclusions The study concludes that the human brain’s ability to process and interpret natural language data and to predict and remember is unique and that ChatGPT still lags behind this unique human ability.

                Backgrounds A prediction market (PM) is a process for predicting future events by gathering knowledge from participants. Researchers applied PM concept to predict the new dosage form, the industry may be able to produce incrementally modified drugs (IMDs) in the future. Methods The PM process started with building a PM based on the market scoring rule, which is a mechanism that automatically adjusts prices through the calculation of the price function by the market maker. Analysis of data according to the PM process. Since March 19, 2022, participants in Thailand’s pharmaceutical industry have been using online Zoom sessions to engage in purposive selection for trading contracts, following the submission of consent forms. Qualitative data analysis will be conducted using thematic analysis. Results A total of 28 participants. In the first round, participants were interested in investing in the sustained release, orodispersible tablet, and soft gelatin capsule. The second round was after receiving the dosage form information. Participants adjusted their investments to sustained release, orodispersible tablets, and nasal spray, by choosing to invest in the nasal spray dosage form because the company has the potential to produce. In the final round to confirm investment results the top three participants were sustained release, orodispersible tablet, and nasal spray dosage form. Conclusion The dosage forms industry is expected to produce IMDs in the future, including sustained release, orodispersible tablets, and nasal spray.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-195/v1?src=rss">Exploring predictors of psychological preparedness for flood victims: A conceptual framework for Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in Malaysia with major social, economic, and psychological consequences. Compared to material and logistical preparedness, the psychological aspects of disaster management are not given much emphasis. Methods This conceptual paper employs a systematic literature review to understand the factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. The literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, Directory of Open Access Journals, Supplemental Index and Google Scholar with keywords including “disaster preparedness, flood, natural disaster and psychological preparedness”. Articles were included if they focused on preparedness towards disasters as well as examined coping mechanisms, perceptions and preparedness behaviours in the context of flood-related crises and excluded if they lack methodological rigor. The review synthesized findings using a thematic analysis approach, identifying psychological resilience and coping strategies in flood-affected populations, the role of social support networks in preparedness and recovery as well as mental health implications of floods, including anxiety, trauma, and post-disaster recovery. This synthesis informed the development of a conceptual model to address factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. According to contemporary theories of catastrophe risk reduction and psychological resilience, critical variables included are risk perception, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social support. Results It was proposed that these factors work together to determine an individual’s psychological preparedness, enhancing their ability to cope with the psychological and emotional strain of a flood disaster. Conclusions By offering these perspectives, the study contributes to the limited academic discussion on psychological preparedness in Malaysia, which aims to improve the psychological resilience of communities vulnerable to flooding. The proposed framework emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychological preparedness into existing disaster management strategies to reduce the overall damage caused by floods.

                Background Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage 1B or higher cancers. Moringa oleifera and Plukenetia volubilis (Sacha inchi) have been reported to enhance various biological functions, including antitumor and antiproliferative activity. Methods In order to evaluate this potential present in crude extracts of the leaves of these plants, as well as the seed oil of P.volubilis, the antitumor activity was determined according to the effect of these derivatives on different biological parameters such as cytotoxicity, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis (among others), in AGS cells (CRL-1739). Results All extracts tested were cytotoxic at 90 and 160 μg/ml concentrations. P. volubilis seed oil showed 95% mortality at 1% concentration (CC50 = 46.7%). Cell proliferation was inhibited, and all extracts affected the cell cycle, but the P. volubilis oil significantly induced an accumulation of AGS cells in the sub G1 phase, inducing DNA fragmentation as a mechanism of cell death. The ethanolic M. oleifera leaf extract also inhibited cell migration. Conclusion M. oleifera, P. volubilis leaf extracts and P. volubilis seed oil can potentially be antitumor products. Further validation in a murine model of gastric cancer is needed to investigate the antitumor potential of these extracts further and to continue the development of herbal products that can help in the management of this type of tumor.

                <p>by Lars Berling, Jonathan Klawitter, Remco Bouckaert, Dong Xie, Alex Gavryushkin, Alexei J Drummond</p>

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis with MCMC algorithms generates an estimate of the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees in the form of a sample of phylogenetic trees and related parameters. The high dimensionality and non-Euclidean nature of tree space complicates summarizing the central tendency and variance of the posterior distribution in tree space. Here we introduce a new tractable tree distribution and associated point estimator that can be constructed from a posterior sample of trees. Through simulation studies we show that this point estimator performs at least as well and often better than standard methods of producing Bayesian posterior summary trees. We also show that the method of summary that performs best depends on the sample size and dimensionality of the problem in non-trivial ways.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-192/v1?src=rss">Risk assessment of ammonia leakage by fault tree analysis: Case study in the ice manufacture, Chonburi province [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Ammonia leaks during ice production can have significant impacts on the health of workers, nearby communities, and the environment. Exposure to ammonia can lead to both acute and chronic adverse effects. Methods A basic cause analysis of ammonia leakage in an ice production facility in Chonburi Province was conducted using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Boolean algebra equations were applied to construct primary causes, define failure type, and establish prioritization. Risk assessment was performed based on the criteria established by the Department of Industrial Work, incorporating both likelihood and severity to determine the risk level. Results The results identified 22 potential scenarios that contributed to ammonia leakage. When prioritizing these scenarios, dust accumulation and clogging of the fan, uninsulated ammonia transport pipes, coil obstruction due to scale build-up, incorrect shaft bearing motor, and the use of non-heat-resistant lubricants were significant contributors. Risk assessment analysis indicated both moderate and high risk of ammonia leakage. The use of incorrect bearing and non-heat-resistant lubricant in pumps was identified as high-risk, with a score of 9. Conclusions To mitigate this risk, it is necessary to replace bearings with standard ones and use heat-resistant lubricants to prevent pump failure and reduce cooling inefficiencies, which could lead to ammonia leaks. Regular inspection and maintenance should also be implemented. Furthermore, it is essential to enhance workers’ skills and expertise through training and practice.

                Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in various domains, but generating realistic human hands remains a challenge. This study explores the limitations of AI in capturing the fine details and proportions of hands, using Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) as a case study. Methods Our analysis reveals that CLIP struggles to accurately represent hands due to inadequate training data, anatomical complexities, and practical challenges. We conducted a series of tests and analyses to identify the primary causes of CLIP’s difficulties. Results Our results show that CLIP’s struggles stem from data biases and insufficient anatomical representation in training datasets. Specifically, we found distorted finger relationships, inaccurate proportions, and deviations from expected hand geometry. Conclusion This study aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the current limitations and propose possible directions for future research. By leveraging CLIP for evaluation, control algorithms for structure enforcement, DALL-E for generation, AR for gesture tracking, and 3D modeling for anatomical accuracy, we can overcome the challenges of generating realistic human hands and advance AI’s capabilities in artistic creativity

                Background Brucellosis is the most common zoonotic disease in Oman. Studies about genetic diversity of Brucella are limited in the country. This study aimed to genotype Brucella melitensis in human isolates and milk samples using multi-locus variable number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA-14) in Oman. Methods MLVA-14 was employed for forty-nine B. melitensis recovered from human isolates (n = 21), one goat isolate, and milk samples (n = 27). Results Clustering analysis separated the 49 B. melitensis strains into two main clusters including 31 genotypes. In Dhofar Governorate, shared genotypes among different animal species were identified; the same genotypes were found also in human isolates. Moreover, there was a close genetic relationship between human and milk sample strains from Dhofar and AD Dakhiliya Governorates. Phylogeography investigated by Minimum Spanning Tree analysis showed that Omani strains belonged to the East Mediterranean lineage and formed a distinct branch with a close relationship with two strains from the United Arab Emirates. Moreover, eight Omani strains genotyped from milk shared the same MLVA profile as strains from Spain, Portugal, China, India, and Turkey. The caprine isolate was an outlier correlated with a big cluster mostly formed by isolates from China with other strains from Portugal, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Mongolia, Marocco, France and Spain. Conclusions This study highlights the zoonotic nature of B. melitensis transmission from infected livestock to humans and also its circulation among different animal species. The One Health approach is the way to develop policies and programs for disease surveillance and control.

                Aim This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and associated complications, such as Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) and Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), among security personnel in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods Data were gathered from a sample of 166 security professionals, aged 25–65 years, with a minimum of 8 hours of daily work and at least 2 years of experience, using an observational, cross-sectional study design. The 10 g Semmes Weinstein monofilament testing, Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, and vibration pressure threshold were used for DPN screening followed by the DN4 questionnaire, and the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) was used for PVD assessment. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Research Board (IRB), and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Results The study found a prevalence of 9.6% of DM among security personnel in the UAE. We also found a statistically significant and strong association between DM and DPN (r=0.83; p < 0.001). In contrast, a moderate correlation was observed with PVD (r= 0.56). SPSS version 29 was used for data analysis, and statistical significance was set at a p-value ≤0.05. Conclusion The prevalence of DM among securities in UAE is 9.6%, which is significant, as the total DM prevalence in UAE according to the 2021 report is 12.3%. There is a strong correlation between DM and DPN, suggesting that security personnel could be at higher risk of developing “Diabetic Foot Syndrome” due to the nature and demands of the job. In addition, neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease can increase risk and cause associated foot complications.
