                arXiv:2508.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In early childhood education, accurately detecting behavioral and collaborative engagement is essential for fostering meaningful learning experiences. This paper presents an AI-driven approach that leverages Vision Transformers (ViTs) to automatically classify children's engagement using visual cues such as gaze direction, interaction, and peer collaboration. Utilizing the Child-Play gaze dataset, our method is trained on annotated video segments to classify behavioral and collaborative engagement states (e.g., engaged, not engaged, collaborative, not collaborative). We evaluated three state-of-the-art transformer models: Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and Swin Transformer. Among these, the Swin Transformer achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 97.58%, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling local and global attention. Our results highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures for scalable, automated engagement analysis in real-world educational settings.

                arXiv:2508.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

                arXiv:2508.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This commentary extends the discussion by Parr et al. on memory and attention beyond individual cognitive systems. From the perspective of the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis -- a framework for understanding these faculties and the emergence of language at the group level -- we introduce a hypothetical idea: that language, with its embedded distributional semantics, serves as a collectively formed external representation. CPC generalises the concepts of individual memory and attention to the collective level. This offers a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures, which may embrace collective world models learned through next-word prediction, emerge from and shape group-level cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16274">EEG Study of the Influence of Imagined Temperature Sensations on Neuronal Activity in the Sensorimotor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of sensory imagery is crucial for advancing cognitive neuroscience and developing novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigms. This study investigated the influence of imagined temperature sensations (ITS) on neural activity within the sensorimotor cortex. The experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS: 40{\deg}C Hot, 20{\deg}C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this difference was not statistically significant (p>.05). However, ERD during both ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline (p<.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual thermal perception. This insight expands our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of sensory imagery and suggests the potential utility of ITS for non-motor BCI control and neurorehabilitation technologies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16509">ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.16509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05809">Two pathways to resolve relational inconsistencies</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When individuals encounter observations that violate their expectations, when will they adjust their expectations and when will they maintain them despite these observations? For example, when individuals expect objects of type A to be smaller than objects B, but observe the opposite, when will they adjust their expectation about the relationship between the two objects (to A being larger than B)? Naively, one would predict that the larger the violation, the greater the adaptation. However, experiments reveal that when violations are extreme, individuals are more likely to hold on to their prior expectations rather than adjust them. To address this puzzle, we tested the adaptation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of relational learning and found a similar phenomenon: Standard learning dynamics dictates that small violations would lead to adjustments of expected relations while larger ones would be resolved using a different mechanism -- a change in object representation that bypasses the need for adaptation of the relational expectations. These results suggest that the experimentally-observed stability of prior expectations when facing large expectation violations is a natural consequence of learning dynamics and does not require any additional mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the effect of intermediate adaptation steps on this stability.

                arXiv:2410.10596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for artificial neural network (ANN) models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterise as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimising related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalisation, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalisations.

                arXiv:2508.16216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP, especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16204">Competition and Attraction Improve Model Fusion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However, existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features: (1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

In this paper, we propose and study an energy-information trade-off for a particular kind of memristive device - Self-Directed Channel (SDC) memristors. We perform experiments to model the energy required to set the devices into various states, as well as assessing the stability of these states over time. Based on these results, we employ a generative modelling approach, using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to characterise the storage conditional distribution, allowing us to estimate energy-information curves for a range of storage delays, showing the graceful trade-off between energy consumed and the effective capacity of the devices.

                Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for healthy nervous system function. Mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels are associated with a range of seizure conditions. The genetics of seizure conditions are complex and often challenging to study or replicate in animal models. The Drosophila melanogaster gene paralytic (para) is the sole voltage-gated sodium channel gene in flies. The paraShudderer allele causes dominant seizure activity manifest in adult morphology and behavior. In this study we replicated previous findings of paraShudderer hyperexcitability and the ability to suppress this activity with dietary supplementation of an omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Our results support the robustness of the paraShudderer phenotype and the replicability of findings across separate lab environments.

">Reelin Controls the Directional Orientation, Apical Localization and Length of Primary Cilia in Principal Neurons in the Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary cilia of pyramidal neurons in inside-out laminated regions orient predominantly toward the pial surface, reflecting reverse soma re-positioning during postnatal development. However, the mechanisms underlying the directional cilia orientation and reverse movement are unknown. Here we show that the primary cilia of pyramidal neurons are localized near the base of the apical dendrites and aligned on the nuclear side opposite to the axon initial segment. However, this pattern is not observed in atypical pyramidal neurons in the deep neocortex, excitatory neurons in non-laminated brain regions, interneurons, or astrocytes, where their cilia are irregularly positioned around the nuclei and lack preferred orientation. In Reelin-deficient mice (reeler), the directional orientation and apical localization of cilia in late-born neocortical and CA1 neurons are partially impaired, because their initial impairments are partially corrected during late postnatal development, along with a realignment of apical-basal orientation. In contrast, loss of Reelin drastically disrupts the directional orientation of primary cilia in early-born neocortical neurons and principal neurons in the piriform cortex; consistently, their cilia and centrioles do not preferably localize to the base of the apical dendrites. Additionally, Reelin deficiency increases the cilia length of principal neurons in the cerebral cortex after P14 when WT cilia stabilize, but not in interneurons, astrocytes, or excitatory neurons in non-laminated regions. Together, Reelin controls the directional orientation, intracellular localization, and length of primary cilia in principal neurons in the cerebral cortex. These results underscore primary cilia as a key apical unit, particularly prominent in late-born neurons.

">Associative synaptic plasticity creates dynamic persistent activity</a></h4>

              
                In biological neural circuits, the dynamics of neurons and synapses are tightly coupled. We study the consequences of this coupling and show that it enables a novel form of working memory. In recurrent neural network models with ongoing Hebbian plasticity, we find that, following oscillatory stimulation, neurons continue to oscillate long after the input is removed. This creates a dynamic form of memory that has no explicit storage or retrieval phases and that requires no prior knowledge of the input. We trace the mechanism of these "persistent oscillations'' to an interaction between neurons and synapses that creates complex outlier eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix. This is shown both in simulation and analytically. We leverage this mechanistic understanding to generate persistent oscillations with prespecified dynamics, creating a dynamic analog of a classical Hopfield network. Our work demonstrates that coupling neuronal and synaptic dynamics enables novel forms of computation.

">Integrated Representations of Threat and Controllability in the Lateral Frontal Pole</a></h4>

              
                Emotional processing is ubiquitous in everyday life, informing goal pursuit not only in response to current demands, but also in anticipation of future outcomes. Lateral prefrontal (LPFC) function supports cognitive control, and emerging evidence suggests a unique role for its anterior-most region -the lateral frontal pole (FPl) - in integrating putatively amygdala-originated emotion signals with goal information. However, whether these organizational properties of LPFC are expressed during the anticipation of future threat remains unknown. Here, we used FIR modeling and pattern similarity analysis to examine dynamic engagement and representational properties of distinct LPFC regions during threat anticipation requiring goal-directed action. Healthy participants (n=67) were scanned during a threat-of-shock paradigm consisting of a prolonged (18s) countdown to possible shock administration. Threat unpleasantness and controllability were manipulated orthogonally: in controllable trials, participants could avoid an unpleasant or mild shock by making a successful time-sensitive response; in uncontrollable trials, shocks were administered regardless of performance. LPFC robustly coded for anticipated threat unpleasantness, with FPl showing the strongest modulation by threat unpleasantness and controllability relative to caudal and mid-LPFC regions. Caudal and mid-LPFC maintained independent representations of threat unpleasantness and controllability. In contrast, FPl held conjunctive threat-and-controllability representations, which were associated with successful motor performance following anticipation of unpleasant shocks. Stronger conjunctive FPl representations were also associated with greater inverse amygdala-FPl coupling. Together, these findings provide insight into LPFC organization under naturalistic emotional challenges and highlight a key role for FPl in integrating affective and control-related information during threat anticipation to support goal-directed action.

">The Speed Limit of Visual Perception: Bidirectional influence of image memorability and processing speed on perceived duration and memory recall</a></h4>

              
                Visual stimuli are known to vary in their perceived duration, with some stimuli engendering so-called "time dilation" and others "time compression" effects. Previous theories have suggested these effects rely on the level of attention devoted to stimuli, magnitude of the stimulus dimension, or intensity of the population neural response, yet cannot account for the full range of experimental effects. Recently, we demonstrated that perceived time is affected by the image properties of scene clutter, size, and memorability (Ma, et al. 2024), with the former compressing and latter two dilating duration. Further, perceived duration also predicted recall of images 24h later, on top of memorability. To explain the memorability effect, we found that a recurrent convolutional neural network (rCNN) could recapitulate the time dilation effect by indexing the rate of entropy collapse, or "speed", across successive timesteps, with more memorable stimuli associated with faster speeds. Here, we replicate and extend these Wndings via three experiments (n=20ea.) where subjects performed a sub-second temporal bisection task using memorability stimuli with increasing memorability, but a constant speed (exp 1), increasing speed, but constant memorability (exp 2), or increasing in both (exp 3), each followed by a surprise memory test 24hr later. We found that either increasing memorability or speed alone led to time dilation effects, with faster/slower speeds shifting memory recall by ~8.4% in either direction. However, when both metrics increased, memorability dilated time while speed compressed it, while still improving recall overall. These Wndings can be explained by a model wherein the visual system is tuned to a preferred speed for processing stimuli that scales with the magnitude of visual response, such that stimuli closer to this speed are dilated in time. Overall, these Wndings provide a new lens for interpreting time dilation/compression effects and how visual stimuli are prioritized at temporal scales.

">Resomapper: A Versatile Pipeline for Multiparametric MRI Processing. A Demonstrative Application in Mouse Brain Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential in both research and clinical settings, with quantitative MRI (qMRI) enhancing reproducibility and sensitivity. However, qMRI processing can be complex, especially for users with limited coding experience. We introduce Resomapper, an open-source, cross-platform tool that integrates established processing libraries into a unified, user-friendly workflow, simplifying qMRI analysis while promoting accessibility, reproducibility, and data sharing. Materials and Methods: Resomapper is a Python-based pipeline designed for intuitive multiparametric MRI processing. It supports T1, T2, and T2* relaxometry, magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model fitting. The software includes advanced preprocessing options such as denoising, Gibbs artifact removal, and bias field correction. Users can process data interactively through a sequential pipeline or via an automated JSON-configured workflow, both executable through simple command-line instructions. Resomapper ensures compatibility by converting raw MRI data from different formats into the standardized NIfTI format within a BIDS-like structure, enhancing reproducibility, scalability, and data management efficiency. To demonstrate its application, we present a brain MRI study carried out on healthy, adult C57BL/6J mice, both sexes. MRI acquisitions were conducted on a Bruker Biospec 7T system using a multiparametric MRI protocol that included anatomical T2W images, T2 and T2* maps, MTI and DTI. The data were processed with Resomapper and co-registered using ANTsPy. Finally, a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis was performed to examine differences between sexes and brain areas, focusing on the cortex (Cx), hippocampus, (HPC), thalamus (Thal), and hypothalamus (HTH). Results: Differences in all MRI parameters were found across brain regions, as expected. Additionally, a small significant sex difference in T2* was observed, with higher values in the thalamus and hypothalamus of female mice compared to males. This may reflect sex-specific responses to anesthesia. Moreover, this study also serves as a reference for standardized multiparametric qMRI studies in mice using Resomapper. Conclusions: By integrating multiple processing tools into a single, accessible framework, Resomapper streamlines qMRI workflows and enables reproducible, high-quality image analysis. Thanks to its ability to handle diverse preprocessing techniques, multiple imaging modalities, and standardized data formats, the software proves to be a valuable resource for researchers with varying levels of programming expertise.

">Effect of acute elevated magnesium on bursting activity and information-processing dynamics in cortical cultures</a></h4>

              
                Magnesium (Mg2+) plays a significant role in hippocampal memory and learning and is implicated in a variety of neurological disorders, such as migraine. Despite this crucial role Mg2+ has on brain health, its effect on the dynamics of networks of neurons is still not fully understood. This study investigates the impact of several doses of elevated extracellular Mg2+ on organotypic cultures. Cultures were recorded on a 512-microelectrode array and analyzed using the burstiness index (BI), the rate of network wide bursts relative to other neuronal activity. We also use a suite of information theoretic measures to further establish the role Mg2+ plays in the brain. Elevated Mg2+ is found to have a dose-dependent increase on BI caused by a loss of network activity not contained within a burst or high firing rate activity. Information dynamics further show that the network experiences a loss of entropy and an increase in time-reversibility, connectivity, and transfer of redundant information. These factors indicate that Mg2+ causes a loss of complex activity and an increase in highly integrated, constant dynamics. This lays the groundwork for a deeper examination of the role Mg2+ plays in learning, memory and treating neurological disorders.

">A Deep Neural Network Trained on Congruent Audiovisual Speech Reports the McGurk Effect</a></h4>

              
                In the McGurk effect, incongruent auditory and visual syllables are perceived as a third, illusory syllable. The prevailing explanation for the effect is that the illusory syllable is a consensus percept intermediate between otherwise incompatible auditory and visual representations. To test this idea, we turned to a deep neural network known as AVHuBERT that transcribes audiovisual speech with high accuracy. Critically, AVHuBERT was trained only with congruent audiovisual speech, without exposure to McGurk stimuli or other incongruent speech. In the current study, when tested with congruent audiovisual "ba", "ga" and "da" syllables recorded from 8 different talkers, AVHuBERT transcribed them with near-perfect accuracy, and showed a human-like pattern of highest accuracy for audiovisual speech, slightly lower accuracy for auditory-only speech, and low accuracy for visual-only speech. When presented with incongruent McGurk syllables (auditory "ba" paired with visual "ga"), AVHuBERT reported the McGurk fusion percept of "da" at a rate of 25%, many-fold greater than the rate for either auditory or visual components of the McGurk stimulus presented on their own. To examine the individual variability that is hallmark of human perception of the McGurk effect, 100 variants of AVHuBERT were constructed. Like human observers, AVHuBERT variants was consistently accurate for congruent syllables but highly variable for McGurk syllables. Similarities between the responses of AVHuBERT and humans to congruent and incongruent audiovisual speech, including the McGurk effect, suggests that DNNs may be a useful tool for interrogating the perceptual and neural mechanisms of human audiovisual speech perception.

">Controlling malaria mosquito reproduction via the octopamine beta2 receptor</a></h4>

              
                Mosquito reproduction in a broad sense involves multiple steps from acoustic recognition of mating partners to egg hatching. We show that the octopamine receptor AgOct{beta}2R controls different aspects of this process in a sexually dimorphic manner. AgOct{beta}2R knockout males present auditory defects that impair their ability to inseminate females, whilst knockout females are sterile. These phenotypes suggest AgOct{beta}2R as a target to impair mosquito reproduction at multiple levels. We test the reproductive effects of the insecticide amitraz, an AgOct{beta}2R agonist, showing that amitraz exposure reduces insemination in the lab but not in the field and has no effects on female sterility, excluding its applicability as a mating disruptor. Pharmacological assays reveal that AgOct{beta}2R sensitivity to amitraz is reduced compared to other arthropods, but its responses can be altered by modifying residues in the binding pocket. Together, our results establish AgOct{beta}2R as a promising target to disrupt mosquito reproduction but emphasize the necessity of developing new tools to exploit this approach.

">Integrative Transcriptomic Analysis Identifies Novel Mitochondrial Gene Targets in Parkinson's Disease.</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) region of the midbrain, although the precise molecular processes driving this degeneration are still not fully understood. This research investigates the expression patterns of genes associated with mitochondrial function in the SN and DA neurons of individuals with PD, aiming to uncover new potential therapeutic targets. Two independent RNA sequencing datasets, GSE7621 and GSE8397 (GPL-96), retrieved from the GEO database, were analyzed to identify mitochondria-related genes that are differentially expressed in the SN of PD patients. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were also performed to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved. To validate our findings, we utilized an additional dataset, GSE49036. We also examined the altered expression of these mitochondrial-related genes in DA neurons using RNA-seq data from GSE169755, which includes DA neurons isolated from the SN of both PD patients and healthy controls. Finally, the proposed hypothesis was tested experimentally using an in vitro model of PD. This integrative analysis across multiple datasets reveals previously unrecognized mitochondrial gene candidates implicated in PD pathogenesis and highlights their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.

">Pharmacological potentiation of Nav1.1 channels in interneurons mitigates tau depositions and neuronal death in a mouse model of neurodegenerative dementias</a></h4>

              
                Epileptiform discharges and neuronal hyperexcitability are key pathophysiological features of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies. We previously identified selective dynfuntion of parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons (PV neurons), which regulate neural network excitability, in a tauopathy mouse model. However, the mechanistic link between PV neuron deficits, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological enhancement of phasic PV neuron activity markedly attenuates tau accumulation and neuronal loss in a tauopathy mouse model. We developed DSR-143630, a novel activator of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, selectively expressed in PV neurons. Administration of DSR-143630 alleviated febrile seizures in Nav1.1 haploinsufficient mice and suppressed high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), an electrophysiological signature of hyperexcitability associated with cognitive impairments, in rTg4510 tau transgenic mice. Longitudinal tau PET and volumetric MRI demonstrated that DSR-143630 treatment from 4 to 11 months of age profoundly reduced age-dependent tau deposition and atrophy in the neocortex and hippocampus. Postmortem analyses further revealed decreased levels of phosphorylated tau, preservation of neuronal populations, and attenuated neuroinflammatory responses, including reactive gliosis. These findings establish PV neuron dysfunctions and consequent network hyperexcitability as key drivers of tau pathogenesis and highlight pharmacological Nav1.1 activation as a promising disease-modifying strategy for neurodegenerative tauopathies.

                This study applied unsupervised machine learning to performances on a design fluency task, to identify distinct executive function (EF) profiles among 113 neurotypical Canadian children (62% female, 74% White, aged 7-13). By tracking design, repetition, and strategy production every minute for five minutes, the results revealed two profiles: Profile A generated fewer designs but exhibited a more stable production pattern across time. Profile B, initially more productive, showed a steeper increase in repetition errors and a decline in design production. These findings demonstrate how EF interindividual variability in neurotypical children can be captured through naturally emerging performance patterns, highlighting the value of temporal analysis in differentiating executive functioning profiles.

">Screening channelrhodopsins using robotic intracellularelectrophysiology and single cell sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Our ability to engineer opsins is limited by an incomplete understanding of how sequence variations influence function. The vastness of opsin sequence space makes systematic exploration difficult. New method: In recognition of the need for datasets linking opsin genetic sequence to function, we pursued a novel method for screening channelrhodopsins to obtain these datasets. In this method, we integrate advances in robotic intracellular electrophysiology (Patch) to measure optogenetic properties (Excite), harvest individual cells of interest (Pick) and subsequently sequence them (Sequence), thus tying sequence to function. Results: We used this method to sequence more than 50 cells with associated functional characterization. We further demonstrate the utility of this method with experiments on heterogeneous populations of known opsins and single point mutations of a known opsin. Of these point mutations, we found C160W ablates the response of ChrimsonR to light. Conclusion and comparison to existing methods: Compared to traditional manual patch clamp screening, which is labor-intensive and low throughput, this approach enables more efficient, standardized, and scalable characterization of large opsin libraries. This method can enable opsin engineering with large datasets to increase our understanding of opsin sequence function relationships.

">Mechanistic basis of dynamic and heterogeneous divisive normalization in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical computation emerges from the dynamic interplay of excitation and inhibition, operating in a loose balance regime where recurrent and external inputs contribute comparably to neuronal activity. Neurons display broad heterogeneity in synaptic inputs and firing rates, making it essential to explain the full distribution of responses, not just the mean, when elucidating mechanisms of dynamics and computation. We examined divisive normalization in mouse visual cortex using population calcium imaging of excitatory and parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory neurons, combined with computational models of varying complexity. We found that suppression in PV neurons was transiently reduced, driven by the dynamics of subcortical input, and that heterogeneity in suppression strength was linked to population correlations, variability in excitatory-inhibitory balance, and suppression of both subcortical and local cortical inputs. Our results link local recurrent connectivity to the diversity of normalizing responses in cortex, providing a mechanistic basis for functional heterogeneity in this computation.

">Development of an RNA Aptamer as a Therapeutic Agent for Synucleinopathies</a></h4>

              
                The aggregation of -synuclein (Syn), a 140-mer protein, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies. KTKEGV repeats (KR) of Syn are key mediators of prion-like propagation and neurodegeneration. Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments, no current therapy effectively delays disease progression. Here we report a 77-nucleotide (nt) RNA aptamer (1R6) with potent affinity and selectivity for Syn1-95 (KD = 18 nM) through in vitro selection. 1R6 significantly inhibited Syn oligomerization and {beta}-sheet-rich fibril assembly and promoted disaggregation of preformed fibrils. Additionally, 1R6 suppressed Syn seeding, as determined by FRET-based cellular biosensor cell assay. Cellular studies revealed that 1R6 cotransfection completely prevented Syn-induced cytotoxicity. To assess the protective effects of 1R6 in vivo, we used a Drosophila melanogaster model expressing human Syn in neurons. Flies fed with 1R6 showed improved locomotor defects, reduced photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased Syn levels in the head. Structural characterization through 1H-15N heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation nuclear magnetic resonance experiments demonstrated that 1R6 targets KR motifs, a finding further supported by in silico simulations. Our findings indicate that RNA aptamers, such as 1R6, may represent promising therapeutic candidates for synucleinopathies, thus opening new avenues in the treatment of these diseases.

">Activity-driven proprioceptive synaptic refinement in the developing spinal cord by complement signaling mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Proprioceptive group Ia afferents detect muscle stretch to guide effortless and purposeful movement and make monosynaptic connections with spinal -motor neurons to mediate reflexes, such as the stretch reflex. It is thought that proprioceptive Ia afferents target motor neurons of the same spinal segment; yet, how this specificity, if any, is established during early development is unknown. Using ex vivo spinal cord electrophysiology preparations from neonatal mice of both sexes, we identified a developmental period during which proprioceptive la afferents evoke both segmental and intersegmental responses at monosynaptic latencies. We provide anatomical evidence that motor neurons in the lumbar segment 4 (L4) receive direct input from proprioceptive Ia afferents in L5 during early postnatal development. Intersegmental responses (L4/L5) were prominent at postnatal days (P) 4-7 but were virtually absent by P11-13. To test the role of proprioceptor activity on segmental specification, we analyzed Nav1.6 conditional knockout mice (Nav1.6cko), in which proprioceptor signaling is impaired, and found that intersegmental responses persist up to P11-13 but were absent in age-matched floxed controls. We predict this is due to impaired activation of complement signaling pathways, as Nav1.6cko mice showed reduced C1qA expression in the ventral spinal cord at P9. Consistent with this, C1qA knockout mice also retain intersegmental responses at P11-13. Collectively, these findings identify an important postnatal window during which segmental specificity of proprioceptive circuits emerges and suggest that proprioceptor activity induces C1qA-mediated elimination of excessive intersegmental connectivity.

">Dopamine supports reward prediction to constrain reward seeking</a></h4>

              
                Reward-predictive cues trigger dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc). This signal has long been thought to mediate motivation. However, understanding of dopamine function is complicated by the fact that reward cues not only motivate reward pursuit, but also enable the reward predictions that shape how reward is pursued. Thus, here we used dopamine sensor fiber photometry, cell-type and pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition, Pavlovian cue-reward conditioning, and test of cue-induced reward-pursuit strategy in male and female rats, to ask how cue-evoked phasic dopamine release supports reward pursuit. Cues that predicted imminent reward with high probability triggered a large NAc dopamine response and checking for the expected reward in the delivery location, rather than exploratory reward seeking. Cues that predicted reward with low probability elicited less dopamine and biased towards motivation to seek, rather than check for reward. Cue-evoked dopamine inversely related to and predicted reward seeking. Correspondingly, yet surprisingly, inhibition of cue-evoked NAc dopamine increased reward-seeking motivation and decreased reward checking. Thus, cue-evoked NAc dopamine is positively modulated by high imminent reward prediction to constrain exploratory reward-seeking motivation in favor of a more focal reward-checking strategy. These data advance understanding of dopamine function by indicating dopamine does not simply promote reward-seeking motivation, but rather supports reward predictions to shape adaptive reward pursuit strategy.

">HCN channels reveal conserved and divergent physiology in supragranular pyramidal neurons in primate species</a></h4>

              
                The physiological properties of human and rodent neurons differ, yet the extent to which these differences reflect human specializations is often unclear. Compared with their rodent counterparts, human supragranular pyramidal neurons possess enriched HCN-channel-dependent intrinsic membrane properties and a related sensitivity to synaptic inputs containing delta/theta band frequencies. We tested whether other primate species possess enriched HCN-channel dependent membrane properties. We found ubiquitous HCN1 subunit gene expression in supragranular glutamatergic neurons across New World Monkeys, Old-World Monkeys, and great apes in single nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets. Using Patch-seq recordings from acute and cultured brain slices, we found robust HCN-dependent physiological properties in supragranular pyramidal neurons in a species of New-World monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and two species of Old-World Monkey (Macaca mulatta, Macaca nemestrina). In both human and macaque neocortex, HCN-related intrinsic properties increased in magnitude with increasing laminar depth, especially in one transcriptomic cell type. Within this type, HCN dependent properties were more pronounced in macaque than human neurons. These findings indicate that HCN-governed membrane properties and sensitivity to delta/theta band frequencies are roughly conserved in supragranular pyramidal neurons across at least 36 million years of primate evolution.

">An AlphaFold guided model for the evolution of the CaMKII interactome</a></h4>

              
                The neuronal functions of mammalian calcium calmodulin (Ca2+.CAM) dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) are orchestrated by an interactome of multiple CaMKII-protein interactions when Ca2+.CAM opens the kinase domain to bind Ca2+ response regulators and substrates to its regulatory helix and C-lobe, respectively. We analysed over forty 3D-atomic structures and models of CaMKII-target complexes to track the evolution of the neuronal CaMKII interactome over three model organisms and the early metazoan Trichoplax adhaerans. We report the conservation of the molecular interactome based on binding surface overlap, energy frustration and fold evolution. Transcriptome databases informed on Ca2+ CaMKII response regulation and colocalization with substrates. The activation machinery was invariant, but the co-expression of CaMKII and its substrates relative to the mammalian isoform was progressively reduced in simpler organisms. We propose CaMKII architecture for autoinhibition, Ca2+ response and substrate association was formed for neurosecretion, then specialised for synaptic signalling with the alpha-isoform.

">Treefrogs exploit temporal onset synchrony and harmonicity in forming auditory objects of vocal communication signals</a></h4>

              
                Animals frequently communicate in dense social aggregations characterized by the presence of overlapping signals from multiple individuals. Receivers have to perceptually organize these overlapping signals into distinct auditory objects, each corresponding to the perceptual representation of an individual signal. All the signal components produced by the same individual should be integrated into a unitary auditory object while those produced by distinct individuals should be segregated. The principles of auditory object formation and their importance in vocal communication are less understood in non-human animals relative to humans. Here, using American green treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, we tested the hypothesis that receivers exploit the relative timing and harmonic relatedness of multiple spectral components to integrate or segregate sounds during auditory object formation. Using phonotaxis as a behavioral assay, females were given a choice between an attractive conspecific call consisting of three spectral components and a composite call consisting of the same three conspecific spectral components to which we added three spectral components from the call of a heterospecific sister species (Hyla gratiosa). The addition of heterospecific components to conspecific calls renders them less attractive. Across treatments, we manipulated the relative onset timing and harmonic relatedness of the heterospecific components in relation to the conspecific components. We predicted that asynchronous temporal onsets and inharmonic relationships between the conspecific and heterospecific components would promote their perceptual segregation. Our findings are consistent with this prediction. We discuss these findings in the light of parallel perceptual processes across animal taxa and neuroethological theories of auditory processing.

                The extensive heterogeneity of microglia inflammatory states accompanying neurodegenerative diseases underscores the complex molecular mechanisms that regulate these cells. Here, we report on transcriptional effectors that control microglial inflammatory polarization associated with brain demyelination in mice. Using flow cytometry, microscopy and RNA-seq, we identified two dominant, functionally distinct states of Clec7a+CD229+ inflammatory microglia, discriminated from one another by CD11c expression. Epigenomic analyses implicated genome-wide nucleosome remodeling to the polarization process, driven by state-associated stimulation of transcription factors that included Pu.1, AP-1, Bhlhe40 and Egr2, as well as re-calibration of homeostatic input provided by Mef2. Loss-of-function experiments validated the physiological relevance of Trem2, Mef2a and Egr2 to the microglial inflammatory polarization process in the demyelinating brain. Therefore, distinct configurations of signaling input cooperate with epigenetic mechanisms to reprogram the transcriptional output of microglia to enable their inflammatory functions.

                Papadopoulos et al. explored spatial compartmentalization of the immune response to HIV in human lymph nodes, where the virus is known to evade treatment. Novel imaging and spatial omics uncovered mechanisms of how HIV hides in B cell follicles, shielded from CD8+ T cells by a tightly regulated immune environment.

                Weis et al. interrogated human microbiotas in colon cancer models of tumorigenesis, finding that Bacteriodes uniformis is a protective bacterium limiting tumorigenesis and enhancing immunotherapy efficacy via NK cells. Mechanistically, Lag-3 on NK cells and the B. uniformis ZPS capsular polysaccharide mediated this protection and can be harnessed therapeutically.

                Using quantitative imaging in live human cancer cells, Janovič et al. demonstrate that shelterin assembles into two distinct subcomplexes at telomeres: a stable TRF1-TIN2-TPP1-POT1 unit and a more dynamic TRF2-RAP1 complex. These findings provide important insights into telomeric architecture and the molecular basis of shelterin-mediated telomere maintenance in cancer cells.

                Pang et al. demonstrate that crossing nerve transfer restores motor function after peripheral nerve injury by enhancing interhemispheric cortical connectivity and reorganizing descending motor pathways. The contralateral motor cortex reinnervates the injured forelimb through strengthened cortico-rubro-spinal, rather than corticospinal, pathways. These findings identify therapeutic targets for nerve injury rehabilitation.

                While cortical regulation of striatal development is well established, the influence of basal ganglia output on cortical maturation remains largely unexplored. Janeček et al. show that selective ablation of dSPNs or iSPNs in the dorsomedial striatum during postnatal development induces pathway-specific, state-dependent alterations in dmPFC activity and connectivity, revealing a previously unrecognized role for basal ganglia output in shaping cortical circuit maturation.

">Tension shapes memory: Computational insights into neural plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical forces have recently emerged as critical modulators of neural communication, yet their role in high-level cognitive functions remains poorly understood. Here, we present a biologically inspired spiking neural network model that integrates mechanical tension, vesicle dynamics, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity to examine how tension influences learning, memory, and cognitive operations such as pattern completion, projection, and association. We find that increased tension enhances synaptic efficiency by accelerating vesicle clustering and recovery, resulting in a 67% improvement in memory recall speed and a 17% increase in inter-regional synchrony during projection relative to relaxed states. Conversely, a 20% reduction in tension leads to a 31% decline in memory association performance, highlighting the tension-sensitive accessibility of stored information. The model further reveals that networks with 20% inhibitory neurons achieve optimal spatial precision in memory encoding and recall. Together, these in silico findings position mechanical tension as a functional neuromodulator and suggest new directions for neuromorphic design and energy-efficient, living computing platforms.

">Social Touch Suppresses Aggression via Thalamic Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural circuitry underlying aggression is critical for both scientific insight and clinical intervention. Here, we identify the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus (PIL) as a key node in an anti-aggressive circuit activated by social touch. Using a rodent model, we demonstrate that deprivation of direct physical contact during social isolation leads to heightened aggression. Chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations reveal that PIL neurons activated by social touch inhibit aggression via excitatory projections to the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus. This PIL-to-MPOA pathway is suppressed by input from the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH). Our findings establish a novel thalamic-hypothalamic circuit that mediates social touch-induced suppression of aggression, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention in conditions marked by pathological aggression.

">Investigating motion-induced signal corruption in steady-state diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) is a diffusion imaging sequence achieving high SNR efficiency and strong diffusion-weighting. A key challenge for in vivo DW-SSFP is the sequence's severe motion sensitivity, currently limiting investigations to low or no motion regimes. Here we establish a framework to both (1) investigate and (2) correct for the impact of subject motion on the DW-SSFP signal. Theory and Methods: An extended phase graphs (EPG) representation of the DW-SSFP signal was established incorporating a motion operator describing rigid body and pulsatile motion. The representation was validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and subsequently integrated into a data fitting routine for motion estimation and correction. The fitting routine was evaluated using both simulations and experimental 2D low-resolution single-shot timeseries DW-SSFP data acquired in a human brain, with a tensor reconstructed from the motion-corrected experimental DW-SSFP data. Results: The proposed EPG-motion framework gives excellent agreement to complementary Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that diffusion coefficient estimation is robust over a range of motion and SNR regimes. Tensor estimates from the motion-corrected experimental DW-SSFP data give excellent visual agreement to complementary DW-SE data acquired in the same subject. Conclusion: Temporal information capturing the evolution of the DW-SSFP signal can be used to retrospectively (1) estimate subject motion and (2) reconstruct motion-corrected DW-SSFP data. Open-source software is provided, facilitating future investigations into the impact of subject-motion on DW-SSFP acquisitions.

">α-Synuclein driven cell susceptibility in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Early cellular events in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain elusive. While aggregation of -synuclein (Syn) into Lewy bodies marks advanced pathology, smaller Syn oligomers have been implicated in prodromal stages. Here we map Syn oligomers at single-particle resolution in post-mortem brain tissue from Braak stage 3/4 PD cases and matched controls. Quantitative imaging of 9,882 neurons across four regions captured over 112 million Syn oligomers. Mean intracellular Syn burden was unchanged between groups, but PD samples contained a higher fraction of neurons whose oligomer load exceeded a specific aggregation threshold. We term these aggregation-susceptible cells (ASCs). ASC enrichment in vulnerable regions supports a population-level model in which early pathology arises from a stochastic shift in cellular composition rather than altered Syn aggregation kinetics. This human-tissue, large-scale dataset provides a quantitative framework for detecting ASCs and for testing population-level interventions in PD and related proteinopathies.

">GPC5 expression highlights astrocytic heterogeneity and divergent hippocampal responses in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are central to central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and memory consolidation. They also display remarkably heterogeneous morphological phenotypes, functions and molecular profiles between and within distinct regions of the human brain. Yet, their role in regional vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) remains poorly understood. To elucidate this subregional heterogeneity of astrocytes in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex and its implication for neurodegeneration, we employed high-content neuropathology, integrating chromogenic immunohistochemistry (cIHC) and digital pathology, to map and quantify the expression of functional astrocytic markers (GFAP, ALDH1L1, AQP4, GPC5 and ALDH7A1) of healthy individuals, of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). We found that astrocytic markers followed distinct expression patterns in AD and PDD. In AD, GFAP was strongly reduced in specific hippocampal regions, whereas AQP4 was increased and GPC5 expression, although regionally stable, was locally associated with amyloid and tau pathology. In PDD, astrocytic responses were characterized by selective decreases in ALDH1L1 and ALDH7A1, with GFAP and GPC5 remaining largely unaffected. Notably, GFAP and GPC5 expression delineated distinct astrocytic subtypes that were differentially distributed across hippocampal subfields and showed specific responses to AD and PD pathologies. These findings provide new insights into the landscape of astrocytic heterogeneity in the human hippocampus and beyond, revealing disease- and region-specific astrocytic signatures. Importantly, they underscore the value of incorporating novel markers such as GPC5 to fully capture astrocytic diversity and to better understand astrocyte contributions to neurodegeneration.

">MCA: A Multicellular analysis Calcium Imaging toolbox for ImageJ</a></h4>

              
                Functional imaging using genetically encoded indicators, such as GCaMP, has become a foundational tool for in vivo experiments and allows for the analysis of cellular dynamics, sensory processing, and cellular communication. However, large scale or complex functional imaging experiments pose analytical challenges. Many programs have worked to create pipelines to address these challenges, however, most platforms require proprietary software, impose operational restrictions, offer limited outputs, or require significant knowledge of various programming languages, which collectively can limit utility. To address this, we designed MCA (a Multicellular Analysis toolkit) to work with ImageJ, a widely used open-source software which has been the standard image analysis platform for the last 30 years. We developed MCA to be visually intuitive, utilizing ImageJs platform to generate new images based on completed tasks so users can visually see each step in the analysis pipeline. In addition, MCA implements a user-friendly GUI providing a simple interface which resembles other native ImageJ plugins. We incorporated functionality for rigid registration to correct motion artifacts, algorithms for cell body prediction, and methods for annotating cells and exporting data. For cell prediction, we trained a custom model in Cellpose 2.0 for segmentation of nuclei expressing pan-neuronal nuclear localized GCaMP in zebrafish. We validated the accuracy of MCA output to previously published zebrafish calcium imaging data which elicited visually evoked neuronal responses. To show the versatility of MCA, we also show that our software can be utilized for multiple sensory modalities, brain regions, and multiple model organisms including Drosophila and mouse. Together these data show that MCA is viable for extracting calcium dynamics in a user-friendly environment for multiple forms of functional imaging.

">Probing the content of semantic representations in body-selective regions</a></h4>

              
                The extrastriate body area (EBA) has been known to selectively respond to human body parts, but recent work suggests it may encode richer scene semantics. However, it remains unclear what aspects of natural scenes constitute the semantic representation in the EBA. Here we address this question by analyzing the relationship between object co-occurrence in natural scene captions and EBA responses predicted by caption-based encoding models. This revealed object category pairs associated with EBA activity, leading to the hypothesis that EBA encodes the speed of human body motion implied in scenes. A subsequent behavioral experiment and correlation analyses confirmed this, showing strong correlations between EBA responses and implied motion ratings. In addition, the representation of implied body motion extends into the fusiform body area (FBA). Variance partitioning further showed that while body-related features such as the number of people and body size also contributed, implied motion uniquely explained the largest portion of EBA and FBA responses. Overall, semantic representations in body-selective regions are jointly shaped by multiple body-related features, with implied motion as the primary contributor. Our co-occurrence-based approach, combined with brain-to-model mapping methods, offers a novel, interpretable framework for understanding high-level visual representations in natural scene perception.

">Identification of molecular nociceptors in Octopus vulgaris through functional characterisation in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Nociception, a phenomenon crucial for animal survival, deploys evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms. Among invertebrate species, cephalopods are of particular interest as they possess a well-developed brain speculated to be able to encode pain-like states. This has led to their inclusion in the Directive 2010/63 EU for welfare protection. However, the molecular mechanisms of nociception in cephalopods are still poorly characterised and it is important to address this knowledge gap to better understand cephlapods capacity to express pain states. Here we describe a bioinformatic pipeline utilising conserved nociceptive genes, to identify the orthologous candidates in the Octopus vulgaris transcriptome. We identified 51 genes we predict to function in nociception. These add to the mechanosensory TRPN and the unique chemotactile receptors recently identified in octopus suckers, thus expanding the set of genes that merit further functional characterisation in cephalopods. We therefore selected 38 orthologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, a tractable experimental platform and tested loss of function mutant strains of distinct functional gene classes (e.g., osm-9, egl-3, frpr-3) in a low pH avoidance paradigm. This identified 18 nociceptive-related genes to be prioritised for further functional characterisation in O. vulgaris.

">PMAT enhances sexual dimorphism of fear behaviors and facilitates female mice's generalized contextual fear extinction</a></h4>

              
                Enhanced signaling of dopamine and/or serotonin during highly arousing situations can be reduced or terminated by monoamine transporters. One such transporter, plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT, Slc29a4), attenuates both dopamine and serotonin signaling. An absence of selective pharmacological inhibitors means genetically modified mice constitutively deficient in PMAT remain the best tool with which to study PMAT's organism-level functional effects. Fear conditioning is a high arousal process. Generalization of fear is an evolutionarily advantageous process, whereby information learned from one experience is applied to other new but similar encounters. Pathological fear generalization, in contrast, is a core feature of most anxiety disorders. Given our previous findings indicating PMAT function reduces male mice's context fear and enhances extinction of female mice's cued fear, we hypothesized that PMAT would similarly reduce generalization (i.e., enhance discrimination) of context and cued fear in male and female mice, respectively. Our context and cued fear conditioning experiments in adult PMAT wildtype (+/+) and heterozygous (+/-) male and female mice partially supported our hypotheses. We discovered PMAT functions to facilitate extinction of contextually generalized fear, plus subsequent extinction of context-specific fear, selectively in females. Moreover, when specific fear cues or contexts were temporally presented before cues or contexts that were similar enough to make generalization possible, PMAT enhanced biological sex differences. Growing evidence reports common PMAT polymorphisms elicit measurable effects when PMAT function is reduced. Thus, we suspect future experiments may reveal positive associations between PMAT polymorphisms and risk for anxiety disorder symptoms, particularly in people assigned female at birth. Inclusion of these genetic variations in pharmacogenomic analyses may prove therapeutically beneficial.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Time-dependent features are present in many sensory stimuli. In the sensory cortices, timing features of stimuli are represented by spatial and temporal code. A potential mechanism by which cortical networks may perform temporal-to-spatial conversion is “reservoir computing.” The state of a recurrently-connected network, or a reservoir, represents current and prior inputs. In this experimental study, we determined whether the state of an isolated cortical network represents temporal information in the inputs. We used patterned optogenetic stimulation of dissociated primary rat cortical cultures. We delivered input sequences of patterns where one of the patterns occurred at different times in each sequence. The state of these experimental networks contained information about input sequences for at least a second, with at least 100-ms precision. Accurate classification required many neurons, suggesting that timing information was encoded via population code. Trajectory of the network state was largely determined by spatial features of the stimulus, with temporal features having a more subtle effect. The duration of spatial information retention was &gt; 2 s, similar to duration of short-term memory in the primary visual cortex. We concluded that local reservoir computation may be a plausible mechanism for temporal-to-spatial code conversion in sensory cortices.</span>

                <p>The interface barrier between the brain surface and the adjacent meninges is important for regulating exchanges of fluid, protein, and immune cells between the CNS and periphery. However, the cell types that form this important interface are not yet fully defined. To address this limitation, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell spatial transcriptomics together with morphological lineage tracing and immunostaining to describe the cell types forming the interface barrier of the adult murine cortex. We show that the cortical interface is composed of three major cell types, leptomeningeal cells, border astrocytes, and tissue-resident macrophages. On the nonparenchymal side, the interface is composed of transcriptionally distinct PDGFR&alpha;-positive leptomeningeal cells that are intermingled with macrophages. This leptomeningeal layer is lined by a population of transcriptionally distinct border astrocytes. The interface neighborhood is rich in growth factor mRNAs, including many leptomeningeal ligands predicted to act on both the border astrocytes and macrophages. On the CNS side of the interface is the relatively cell-sparse cortical layer 1 containing interneurons, microglia, parenchymal astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and oligodendrocytes. Except for the border astrocytes, layer 1 cells are not closely associated with the interface, suggesting that secreted ligands may be the major way the brain interface communicates with the underlying cortical parenchyma. Thus, our data provide a molecular/cellular resource describing the brain interface cell types and their interactions, thereby enabling future studies investigating how this distinct cellular compartment regulates CNS:periphery interactions.</p>

                <p>Autonomic imbalance&mdash;particularly reduced activity from brainstem parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs)&mdash;is a major characteristic of many cardiorespiratory diseases. Therapeutic approaches to selectively enhance CVN activity have been limited by the lack of defined, translationally relevant targets. Previous studies have identified an important excitatory synaptic pathway from oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to brainstem CVNs, suggesting that OXT could provide a key selective excitation of CVNs. In clinical studies, intranasal OXT has been shown to increase parasympathetic cardiac activity, improve autonomic balance, and reduce obstructive event durations and oxygen desaturations in obstructive sleep apnea patients. However, the mechanisms by which activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons, or intranasal OXT, enhance brainstem parasympathetic cardiac activity remain unclear. CVNs are located in two cholinergic brainstem nuclei: nucleus ambiguus (NA) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX). In this study, we characterize the colocalization of OXT receptors (OXTRs) in both CVNs and non-CVN cholinergic neurons in the male and female mouse NA and DMNX nuclei. We found that OXT receptors are highly expressed in CVNs in the DMNX, but not in the NA. OXT increases the firing of DMNX CVN, with no effect on NA CVNs. Selective chemogenetic excitation of OXTR+ CVNs in the DMNX&mdash;achieved by a combination of Cre- and flp-dependent DREADD expression&mdash;evoked a rapid and sustained bradycardia. These findings suggest that activation of DMNX CVNs expressing OXTR with oxytocin may represent a novel translational therapeutic target for restoring autonomic balance in cardiorespiratory disorders.</p>

Mathematical theory that accounts for the stochastic character of spike sequences of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling calculates the probability distributions of the features of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> time course, their moments and correlations. Including slow feedback from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to components of the pathway poses a challenge to stochastic modelling. Here, we present a stochastic model that takes this feedback into account, allows for a non-linear dependency of the open probability of the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channel (IP<sub>3</sub>R) on the feedback variable and the inclusion of more than one feedback with different relaxation time scales. We use this novel modelling approach to describe the effect of ER depletion by non-linear rate expressions for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) and the measured non-linear IP<sub>3</sub>-dependency of the open probability as part of the dynamic feedback. Our theory can calculate spike amplitude distributions, correlation coefficients (C<sub>c</sub>) of interspike intervals (ISIs) and amplitudes, simulate ISI distributions and calculate their moments. We apply it to experiments with HEK293 cells. We find very good agreement between theoretical ISI distributions and their moments with experimental results. Many measured C<sub>c</sub>s show positive values in accordance with the ideas formulated by our theory. Surprisingly, most ISI-amplitude correlations are weak despite the decay of negative feedback during the ISI, which affects spike probability. We even find negative values of C<sub>c</sub>s, which indicate feedback that decreases the open probability of IP<sub>3</sub>R with increasing ISI. The components of the pathway causing this anticorrelation have not yet been identified. Our data suggest that they involve components that are subject to cell variability.

                <p>by Jiangang Shan, Jasper E. Hajonides, Nicholas E. Myers</p>

Recall of stimuli is biased by stimulus history, variously manifested as an attractive bias toward or repulsive bias from previous stimuli (i.e., serial dependence). It is unclear when attractive versus repulsive biases arise and if they share neural mechanisms. A recent model of attractive serial dependence proposes a two-stage process in which adaptation causes a repulsive bias during encoding that is later counteracted by an attractive bias at the decision-making stage in a Bayesian-inference-like manner. Neural evidence exists for a repulsive bias at encoding, but evidence for the attractive bias during the response period has been more elusive. We recently (Hajonides et al., J Neurosci 43:2730–40, 2023) showed in a working memory task that while different stimuli in trial history exerted different (attractive or repulsive) serial biases on behavioral reports, during encoding the neural representation of the current item was always repulsively biased. Here, we assessed whether this discrepancy between neural and behavioral effects is resolved during subsequent decision-making. Multivariate decoding of human magnetoencephalography data during working memory recall showed a neural distinction between attractive and repulsive biases that is consistent with the two-stage model: an attractive neural bias was found in recall period. And stimuli that created a repulsive bias on behavior led to an early repulsive neural bias that is likely to have already been incorporated during the encoding phase. The neural attractive bias late in the trial was replicated in an independent electroencephalogram experiment. Our results suggest that attractive (but not repulsive) serial dependence arises during decision-making, and that priors that influence post-perceptual decision-making are updated by the previous trial’s target, but not by other stimuli.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors have shown promising results in treatment of plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients, but data in adults are limited. The aim of this phase 2 study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of trametinib in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty patients with a diagnosis of generalized or mosaic neurofibromatosis type 1 and a symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibroma were treated with 2mg trametinib per day. Primary outcome measures were partial response rate on tumor volume at cycle 12 and overall partial response rate. Partial response was defined as ≥20% decrease in tumor volume compared to baseline as measured with 3-dimensional volumetric analysis on magnetic resonance imaging every sixth cycle. Secondary outcome measures were pain, pain interference, quality of life, and toxicity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Partial response rate after cycle 12 was 47% (n = 14/30). Overall partial response rate was 50% (n = 15/30). Median best response was −22% decrease of tumor volume (range: −63 to +7%), and median time until best response was 12 cycles (range: 6–42 cycles). Pain score and pain interference were significantly decreased after 12 cycles of treatment. No change in quality of life was reported. Acneiform rash and fatigue were the most reported adverse events. Overall rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 40%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We observed a positive effect of trametinib on tumor volume and significant pain reduction in adults with plexiform neurofibromas. However, adverse events are common and frequently led to early termination of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Lueg et al. discovered that deregulated MYC increases cancer cell sensitivity to N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors (NMTis). Mitochondrial dysfunction upon NMTi occurs selectively in high-MYC contexts through impaired complex I via effects on the NMT substrate and complex I assembly factor NDUFAF4. An approach for targeting MYC-driven cancers is revealed.

                Hahn et al. use male rhesus macaques as a model to characterize the immunological consequences of cross-sex estrogen therapy in primates. 17β-estradiol suppresses endogenous testosterone production, induces female physical traits, and following mRNA vaccination, leads to increased T cell activation and modulation of immune gene expression.

                Gancedo-Verdejo et al. reveal age-associated molecular changes in mouse hippocampus and an age-dependent effect of environmental enrichment, focusing on 3D chromatin structure and gene expression. Environmental enrichment promotes aging-like changes in young mice, likely related to brain maturation; conversely, it reverts age-related alterations in old mice, suggesting neuronal rejuvenation.

                Ablation of lysosomal polyamine transporter ATP13A2 causes lysosome dysfunction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Samaddar et al. demonstrate that ATP13A2 loss causes lysosomal accumulation of polyamines, which, in turn, disrupts Parkinson’s disease-linked lipid hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase via lysosome deacidification and reduced enzyme-membrane electrostatic interactions in lysosomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97860">The gut contractile organoid for studying the gut motility regulated by coordinating signals between interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscles</a></h4>

              
                The gut undergoes peristaltic movements regulated by intricate cellular interactions. How these interactions emerge in the developing gut remains poorly explored due to a lack of model system. We here developed a novel contractile organoid that is derived from the muscle layer of chicken embryonic hindgut. The organoid contained smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs; pacemaker) with few enteric neurons and underwent periodic contractions. The organoid was formed by self-organization with morphological arrangements of ICCs (internal) and SMCs (peripheral), allowing identification of these cells in live. GCaMP-Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients between ICC-ICC, SMC-SMC, or SMC-ICC were markedly coordinated. Pharmacological studies further suggested a role of gap junctions in ICC-to-SMC signaling, and also possible mechanical feedback from SMC’s contraction to ICC’s pace-making activities. In addition, two organoids with different rhythms became synchronized when mediated by SMCs, unveiling a novel contribution of SMCs to ICC’s pace-making. The gut contractile organoid developed in this study offers a useful model to understand how the rhythm coordination between/among ICCs and SMCs is regulated and maintained during gut development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107093">Risk-taking incentives predict aggression heuristics in female gorillas</a></h4>

              
                Competition is commonly reflected in aggressive interactions among groupmates as individuals try to attain or maintain higher social ranks that can offer them better access to critical resources. In this study, we investigate the factors that can shift competitive incentives against higher- or lower-ranking groupmates, that is, more or less powerful individuals. We use a long-term behavioural data set on five wild groups of the two gorilla species starting in 1998, and we show that most aggression is directed from higher- to lower-ranking adult females close in rank, highlighting rank-reinforcement incentives. Yet, females directed 42% of aggression to higher-ranking females than themselves. Females targeted groupmates of higher rank with increasing number of males in the group, suggesting that males might buffer female–female aggression risk. Contrarily, they targeted females of lower rank with increasing number of females in the group, potentially because this is a low-risk option that females prefer when they have access to a larger pool of competitors to choose from. Lactating and pregnant females, especially those in the latest stage of pregnancy, targeted groupmates of higher rank than the groupmates that cycling females targeted, suggesting that energetic needs may motivate females to risk confrontation with more powerful rivals. Our study provides critical insights into the evolution of competitive behaviour, showing that aggression heuristics, the simple rules that animals use to guide their aggressive interactions, are not merely species-specific but also dependent on the conditions that populations and individuals experience.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The strength of neural reinstatement, a correlate of episodic memory retrieval, reportedly reflects the amount and fidelity of mnemonic content and is weaker in older than younger adults, especially for scene memoranda. Based on evidence that age-related declines in cortical thickness and volume contribute to age-related cognitive decline, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from healthy young and older adults to examine relationships between cortical thickness, cortical volume, age, and scene-related reinstatement in 3 cortical regions implicated in scene processing: the parahippocampal place area, medial place area, and occipital place area. A “reinstatement index” was estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected during tests of source memory for scene images, and multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the effects of the variables of interest on scene reinstatement. There were robust age differences in reinstatement, cortical thickness, and cortical volume. In the parahippocampal place area and medial place area, cortical volume fully mediated the effects of age on reinstatement. Additionally, parahippocampal place area reinstatement strength predicted source memory performance independently of cortical volume or age. These findings suggest that age differences in scene reinstatement are mediated by cortical volume and that memory performance and cortical volume are associated with unique components of variance in reinstatement strength.</span>

                <p>Adolescent nicotine use is particularly concerning due to increased susceptibility to long-term effects and dependence during this critical developmental period. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of thiamine on nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety, anhedonia, and depression in rats. Adolescent rats received nicotine (2&nbsp;mg/kg, s.c.) for 21&nbsp;d, followed by 21&nbsp;d of withdrawal. Thiamine (25 or 50&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) was administered during exposure and withdrawal. Behavioral assessments were used to evaluate anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms, and biochemical analyses measured oxidative stress markers, serotonin levels, MAO activity, BDNF, and GFAP as indicators of neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex. Nicotine withdrawal significantly elevated anxiety-, depression-, and anhedonia-like behaviors, increased oxidative stress, and upregulated MAO-A activity and GFAP expression, indicating neuroinflammatory effects. Notably, thiamine administration during both nicotine exposure and withdrawal effectively alleviated these behavioral impairments, restored serotonin levels, reduced oxidative stress markers, and mitigated the increase in GFAP expression. Additionally, thiamine alone has been shown to alleviate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. This study highlights thiamine's potential as a promising intervention for managing psychological distress associated with nicotine withdrawal. Given the high prevalence of adolescent nicotine use and its associated mental health challenges, further research on thiamine's mechanisms and therapeutic potential is warranted to improve treatment strategies during this critical developmental stage.</p>

                <p>Every neuron contains the same genomic information, but its complement of proteins is the product of countless neuron-specific steps including pre-mRNA splicing. Despite advances in RNA sequencing techniques, pre-mRNA splicing biases that favor one isoform over another are largely inscrutable in live neurons in situ. Here, in <I>Drosophila</I>, we developed bichromatic fluorescent reporters to investigate alternative splicing of <I>cacophony</I> (<I>cac</I>)&mdash;a gene that codes the pore-forming &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB> subunit of the primary neuronal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VGCC). These reporters revealed a neuron-specific pattern of exon biases, highly consistent from one animal to the next, suggesting that each neuron splices a unique and consistent portfolio of VGCC isoforms. Stereotypical patterns were observed within motor neurons and multidendritic sensory neurons of female larvae and also within mushroom body Kenyon cells of female adults. In a validation step, we demonstrated that exon splice bias reporting was not dependent on the choice of fluorophores. Additionally, functional properties of the female larval motor neuron terminals could be generally reconciled with the functional properties predicted for the reported exon bias. The application of this technology to a large gene such as <I>cac</I> provides a precedence for effective exon-reporter design for other <I>Drosophila</I> genes.</p>

                <p>by Haoran Chen, Yangyuan Zhang, Robert F. Murphy</p>

Recent advances in multiplexed fluorescence imaging have provided new opportunities for deciphering the complex spatial relationships among various cell types across diverse tissues. We introduce CytoSpatio, open-source software that constructs generative, multirange, and multitype point process models that capture interactions among multiple cell types at various distances simultaneously. On analyzing five cell types across five tissues, our software showed consistent spatial relationships within the same tissue type, with certain cell types like proliferating T cells consistently clustering across tissue types. It also revealed that the attraction-repulsion relationships between cell types like B cells and CD4-positive T cells vary with tissue type. Models for a published dataset demonstrated consistency with prior findings. CytoSpatio can also generate synthetic tissue patterns from learned models, a capability not provided by previous descriptive, motif-based approaches. This potentially allows spatially realistic simulations of how cell relationships affect tissue biochemistry.

                <p>by Amirmahdi Mostofinejad, David A. Romero, Dana Brinson, Thomas K. Waddell, Golnaz Karoubi, Cristina H. Amon</p>

Differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into endoderm derivatives, including thyroid, thymus, lungs, liver, and pancreas, has broad implications for disease modeling and therapy. We utilize and expand a model development approach previously outlined by the authors to construct a model for the directed differentiation of iPSCs into definitive endoderm (DE). Assuming discrete intermediate stages in the differentiation process with a homogeneous population in each stage, three lineage models with two, three, and four populations and three growth models are constructed. Additionally, three models for error distribution are defined, resulting in a total of 27 models. Experimental data obtained <i>in vitro</i> are used for model calibration, model selection, and final validation. Model selection suggests that no transitory state during differentiation expresses the DE biomarkers CD117 and CD184, a finding corroborated by existing literature. Additionally, space-limited growth models, such as logistic and Gompertz growth, outperform exponential growth. Validation of the inferred model with leave-out data results in prediction errors of 26.4%. Using the inferred model, it is predicted that the optimal differentiation period is between 1.9 and 2.4 days, plating populations closer to 300 000 cells per well result in the highest yield efficiency, and that iPSC differentiation outpaces the DE proliferation as the main driver of the population dynamics. We also demonstrate that the model can predict the effect of growth modulators on cell population dynamics. Our model serves as a valuable tool for optimizing differentiation protocols, providing insights into developmental biology.

                <p>by John Robertson, Shorya Consul, Haris Vikalo</p>

Motivation: Oncoviruses, pathogens known to cause or increase the risk of cancer, include both common viruses such as human papillomaviruses and rarer pathogens such as human T-lymphotropic viruses. Computational methods for detecting viral DNA from data acquired by modern DNA sequencing technologies have enabled studies of the association between oncoviruses and cancers. Those studies are rendered particularly challenging when multiple species of oncovirus are present in a tumor sample. In such scenarios, merely detecting the presence of a sequencing read of viral origin is insufficiently informative—instead, a more precise characterization of the viral content in the sample is required.
Results: We address this need with NextVir, to our knowledge the first multi-class viral classification framework that adapts genomic foundation models to detecting and classifying sequencing reads of oncoviral origin. Specifically, NextVir explores several foundation models—DNABERT-S, Nucelotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA—and efficiently fine-tunes them to enable accurate identification of the sequencing reads’ origin. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework over existing deep learning methods and suggest downstream potential for foundational models in genomics.

                <p>by Lin Huang, Xiaofei Liu, Fangfang Zhu, Wenwen Min</p>

Accurate determination of cell-type composition in disease-relevant tissues is essential for identifying potential disease targets and understanding tissue heterogeneity. Most current spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies lack single-cell resolution, which makes precise cell-type composition identification challenging. Several deconvolution methods have been developed to address this limitation by relying on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to estimate the cell type composition in ST data spots. However, these methods often overlook the inherent differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Domain-Adversarial Masked Autoencoder (SpaDAMA) method. SpaDAMA leverages Domain-Adversarial Learning (DAL) to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the source domain (pseudo-ST data generated from scRNA-seq) to the target domain (real ST data). Through adversarial training, SpaDAMA harmonizes the distributions of both datasets and maps them onto a unified latent representation, thereby reducing discrepancies in data modalities. Furthermore, to strengthen the model’s capability in extracting reliable features from real ST data, SpaDAMA employs masking strategies that effectively minimize noise and mitigate spatial artifacts. We validated SpaDAMA on 32 simulated datasets and 4 real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in cell-type deconvolution and providing a promising tool for spatial transcriptomic analyses.

Single-cell studies of signal transduction have revealed complex temporal dynamics that determine downstream biological function. For example, the stimulus-specific dynamics of the transcription factor NFκB specify stimulus-specific gene expression programs, and loss of specificity leads to disease. Thus, it is intriguing to consider drugs that may restore signaling specificity in disease contexts, or reduce activity but maintain signaling specificity to avoid unwanted side effects. However, while steady-state dose-response relationships have been the focus of pharmacological studies, there are no established methods for quantifying drug impact on stimulus-response signaling dynamics. Here we evaluated how drug treatments affect the stimulus-specificity of NFκB activation dynamics and its ability to accurately code ligand identity and dose. Specifically, we simulated the dynamic NFκB trajectories in response to 15 stimuli representing various immune threats under treatment of 10 representative drugs across 20 dosage levels. To quantify the effects on coding capacity, we introduced a Stimulus Response Specificity (SRS) score and a stimulus confusion score. We constructed stimulus confusion maps by employing epsilon network clustering in the trajectory space and in various dimensionally reduced spaces: canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and NFκB signaling codons (i.e., established, informative dynamic features). Our results indicated that the SRS score and the stimulus confusion map based on signaling codons are best-suited to quantify stimulus-specific NFκB dynamics confusion under pharmacological perturbations. Using these tools we found that temporal coding capacity of the NFκB signaling network is generally robust to a variety of pharmacological perturbations, thereby enabling the targeting of stimulus-specific dynamics without causing broad side-effects.

                <p>by Yuhang Zhang, Tao Sun, Boyang Zang, Sen Wan</p>

Decoding animal decision-making behavior from neural spike data emerges as a particularly challenging problem in neuroscience. To address this, we have devised a decision-making decoding model, incorporating a channel attention bi-directional long short-term memory network (CA-BiLSTM), with the aim of effectively parsing sparse neural spike data across multiple brain regions. Notably, the attention mechanism embedded within this model serves the crucial purpose of adeptly localizing neurons integral to decision-making stability within the task at hand. Specifically, when applied to the reproducible electrophysiology dataset from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), our proposed model has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for accurately forecasting decision-making behavior in mice. Consequently, this investigation furnishes a novel perspective for unraveling the intricacies of neural decision-making mechanisms.

                <p>by Clara L. Shaw, David A. Kennedy</p>

Spillover of viruses into novel host species occurs frequently. Often, spillover results in dead-end infections in novel hosts, sometimes, in stuttering transmission chains that die out, and rarely, in large epidemics with sustained transmission. If we could identify early which outcome will occur following a spillover event, we could more appropriately invest in efforts to surveil, respond to, or prevent disease emergence. Our goal was to identify early epidemiological characteristics that correlate with these outcomes, including those predictive of population-level virus persistence in novel hosts. To identify these characteristics, we experimentally induced spillover in the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> nematode-Orsay virus system and measured infection prevalence in exposed populations and virus shedding and infection intensity from infected hosts in replicate populations of eight strains belonging to seven non-native host species. We then passaged 20 adult nematodes from exposed populations to virus-free plates where they reproduced, initiating new populations to which they had the potential to transmit virus. We used quantitative PCR to track virus presence in passaged host populations for 10 passages or until virus was undetectable, indicating its loss. We then used a correlative modeling and a mechanistic modeling approach to understand which epidemiological characteristics were associated with population-level viral persistence. In our correlative models, we found that the number of passages until virus loss was associated with early epidemiological characteristics in the spillover host populations, including infection prevalence in the initially exposed population, the ability of hosts to detectably shed the virus, and the relative susceptibility of the host species, but not infection intensity. When all these characteristics were included simultaneously in a correlative model, only infection prevalence and shedding were significantly associated with virus maintenance, and the model explained over half of the variation in the data. We then developed a mechanistic model that attempts to explain virus passage success by using our epidemiological characteristics data to calculate the probability that at least one worm infectious enough to infect a conspecific is transferred during passage. This mechanistic model explained 38% of the variation in the data on its own. With the goal of understanding how our mechanistic model falls short, we used model selection to test a suite of larger models that included or excluded each epidemiological characteristic and included random effects of strain, experimental line, passage number, and block while the mechanistic prediction was included as an offset. We found that 66% of the variation in our data could be explained by a model that included our mechanistic prediction in addition to infection prevalence, infection intensity, and random effects. Altogether, our study demonstrates that early epidemiological characteristics can play a substantial role in explaining the ultimate outcome of a spillover event.

<p>Monosynaptic rabies tracing shows that the ventral subiculum and thalamic paraventricular nucleus are sources of input to a nucleus accumbens shell- ventral pallidum pathway involved in modulating dopamine neuron activity.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh) regulates motivation and reward via its dense projection to the ventral pallidum (VP). This ventral striatopallidal system has also been shown to regulate the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons and the release of dopamine in the NAcSh. The present study applied monosynaptic rabies tracing in the rat to quantify the brain-wide sources of synaptic input to neurons in the medial NAcSh that project to the ventromedial VP. The ventral subiculum of the hippocampus (vSub) was the largest source of input cells to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons. Anterograde tracing of vSub-NAcSh projection neurons demonstrated that their fibers terminated densely in the NAcSh largely avoiding other regions of the striatum. Another relatively strong source of input cells included the anterior part of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT). The CA1, lateral septal nucleus, VP, paratenial thalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral preoptic area and dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were moderately strong sources of input neurons. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala were found to be relatively weak sources of input. A lack of sex differences for all the sources of input identified indicates that there is no apparent sexual dimorphism in the afferents to the striatopallidal system. In summary, the vSub and the aPVT are the major sources of cortical and thalamic monosynaptic inputs to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons where these inputs converge to regulate behavior and dopamine release in the NAcSh.</p>

                Guo et al. perform a systematic assessment of genetic dependencies and cell surface targets in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, identifying biomarkers, mapping interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity, and nominating combination strategies. Experimental validation of dependencies associated with mesenchymal/EMT gene expression signatures identified the CDS2 enzyme as a mesenchymal state selective dependency.

                Ren et al. demonstrate that TCF25 enhances lysosomal acidification via V-ATPase during glucose starvation, promoting autophagy to maintain energy balance. However, prolonged starvation makes TCF25-mediated lysosomal-autophagic activity crucial for ferritinophagy, ultimately causing lysosome-dependent cell death.

                Kim et al. develop a consensus definition for layer 6b (L6b) excitatory neurons in adult mouse neocortex, enabling comparisons of their synaptic organization and function across studies. These neurons project to layer 1; express CTGF, Cplx3, and Nxph4; and project locally and between ipsilateral cortical areas but not to the thalamus.

                Huang et al. show that spatial exploration activates astrocytes in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MECII). Visual inputs contribute to this process. They further demonstrate that in vivo suppression of MECII astrocytic activities is sufficient to suppress spatial exploration and MECII neuronal activities.
