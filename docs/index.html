              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09520">How attention simplifies mental representations for planning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human planning is efficient -- it frugally deploys limited cognitive resources to accomplish difficult tasks -- and flexible -- adapting to novel problems and environments. Computational approaches suggest that people construct simplified mental representations of their environment, balancing the complexity of a task representation with its utility. These models imply a nested optimisation in which planning shapes perception, and perception shapes planning -- but the perceptual and attentional mechanisms governing how this interaction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to characterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task representation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We find that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for planning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised) contours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful maze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across individuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and behaviour. Inspired by the 'spotlight of attention' analogy, we incorporate the effects of visuospatial attention into existing computational accounts of value-guided construal. Together, our work bridges computational perspectives on perception and decision-making to better understand how individuals represent their environments in aid of planning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09087">Spiking Neural Models for Decision-Making Tasks with Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence. In the same vein, the Poisson counter model describes the accumulation of evidence as discrete events whose counts over time are modeled as Poisson processes, and has a spiking neurons interpretation as these processes are used to model neuronal activities. However, these models lack a learning mechanism and are limited to tasks where participants have prior knowledge of the categories. To bridge the gap between cognitive and biological models, we propose a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for decision-making that incorporates a learning mechanism and whose neurons activities are modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process. First, we show a coupling result between the DDM and the Poisson counter model, establishing that these two models provide similar categorizations and reaction times and that the DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons. To go further, we show that a particular DDM with correlated noise can be derived from a Hawkes network of spiking neurons governed by a local learning rule. In addition, we designed an online categorization task to evaluate the model predictions. This work provides a significant step toward integrating biologically relevant neural mechanisms into cognitive models, fostering a deeper understanding of the relationship between neural activity and behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14186">On the Arrow of Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.14186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Just as the arrow of time structures physics, the arrow of inference organizes cognition, directing the flow of information in perception, action, and memory. The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) formalizes this asymmetry, between high-entropy context and low-entropy content, and frames inference as a cycle that aligns the two through selective, bidirectional interaction. Cycle formation resolves the Information Bottleneck (IB) in Optimal Transport (OT) by coordinating bottom-up contextual disambiguation with top-down content reconstruction, a process neurobiologically mirrored in the cyclical interplay between dorsal (context) and ventral (content) streams. Local inference cycles extend into memory chains that simulate goals, support counterfactual reasoning, and scaffold internal model refinement across time. By operating on delta-seeded goal manifolds, each level of the hierarchy circumvents the curse of dimensionality through structured diffusion guided by priors and context. This mechanism generalizes across timescales, from perception-action loops to the sleep-wake cycle-and scales socially through language, which externalizes inference by transmitting latent content across minds. Thus, CCUP provides a unifying framework for understanding cognition as cycle-consistent inference, anchoring both individual thought and collective intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05794">Markov Blanket Density and Free Energy Minimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.05794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics (including the minimization of variational and expected free energy) naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the definability and coherence of the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06366">AI Agent Behavioral Science</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.06366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of AI agents that exhibit increasingly human-like behaviors, including planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios. These behaviors are not solely the product of the internal architectures of the underlying models, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems operating within specific contexts, where environmental factors, social cues, and interaction feedbacks shape behavior over time. This evolution necessitates a new scientific perspective: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this perspective emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual agent, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional model-centric approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12066">Dataset Properties Shape the Success of Neuroimaging-Based Patient Stratification: A Benchmarking Analysis Across Clustering Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.12066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Data driven stratification of patients into biologically informed subtypes holds promise for precision neuropsychiatry, yet neuroimaging-based clustering methods often fail to generalize across cohorts. While algorithmic innovations have focused on model complexity, the role of underlying dataset characteristics remains underexplored. We hypothesized that cluster separation, size imbalance, noise, and the direction and magnitude of disease-related effects in the input data critically determine both within-algorithm accuracy and reproducibility. Methods: We evaluated 4 widely used stratification algorithms, HYDRA, SuStaIn, SmileGAN, and SurrealGAN, on a suite of synthetic brain-morphometry cohorts derived from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Three global transformation patterns were applied to 600 pseudo-patients against 508 controls, followed by 4 within-dataset variations varying cluster count (k=2-6), overlap, and effect magnitude. Algorithm performance was quantified by accuracy in recovering the known ground-truth clusters. Results: Across 122 synthetic scenarios, data complexity consistently outweighed algorithm choice in predicting stratification success. Well-separated clusters yielded high accuracy for all methods, whereas overlapping, unequal-sized, or subtle effects reduced accuracy by up to 50%. SuStaIn could not scale beyond 17 features, HYDRA's accuracy varied unpredictably with data heterogeneity. SmileGAN and SurrealGAN maintained robust pattern detection but did not assign discrete cluster labels to individuals. Conclusions: The study results demonstrate the impact of statistical properties of input data across algorithms and highlight the need for using realistic dataset distributions when new algorithms are being developed and suggest greater focus on data-centric strategies that actively shape and standardize the input distributions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01604">SpikeSift: A Computationally Efficient and Drift-Resilient Spike Sorting Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.01604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Spike sorting is a fundamental step in analysing extracellular recordings, enabling the isolation of single-neuron activity. However, it remains a challenging problem because extracellular traces mix overlapping spikes from neighbouring cells and are marred by recording instabilities such as electrode drift. Numerous algorithms have been proposed, yet many struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, limiting their practicality for todays large-scale datasets. Approach: In response, we introduce SpikeSift, a spike-sorting algorithm expressly designed to mitigate drift while running on standard CPUs. SpikeSift (i) partitions long recordings into shorter, relatively stationary segments, (ii) carries out spike detection and clustering simultaneously through an iterative detect-and-subtract scheme within each segment, and (iii) preserves neuronal identity across segments via a fast template alignment stage that dispenses with continuous trajectory estimation. Main results: Extensive validation on paired intracellularly validated datasets and on biophysically realistic MEArec simulations covering elevated noise, diverse drift profiles, ultra short recordings and bursting activity, demonstrates that SpikeSift matches or exceeds the accuracy of state of the art methods while completing sorting an order of magnitude faster on a single desktop core. Significance: The combination of high fidelity, drift resilience, and modest computational demand renders SpikeSift broadly accessible while preserving data quality for downstream neurophysiological analysis

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184">Unable to Forget: Proactive lnterference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Resting-state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) represents spontaneous neural activity and is increasingly analyzed using nonlinear measures to assess brain complexity. The Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) is a widely used metric for quantifying the fractal properties of EEG signals, yet its developmental trajectory remains largely unexplored. In this study, we examined age-related changes in HFD across childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. We analyzed eyes-closed rs-EEG from 128 channels in 83 neurotypical participants (8 to 30 yr) from the MIPDB database. To assess developmental patterns, we applied a Gaussian Linear Mixed Model with age, electrode location, and their interaction as predictors, alongside non-parametric cluster-based permutation analysis to evaluate topographical differences. We observed a significant increase in HFD with age (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> = 0.001), most pronounced between childhood and adolescence, followed by stabilization in early adulthood. HFD also varied across electrode locations, with higher values in frontal, central, and temporal regions and lower values in parietal and occipital areas. These findings provide new insights into the maturation of neural complexity in rs-EEG, aligning with known structural and functional changes in brain development. This study contributes to the growing body of research on nonlinear EEG dynamics and their relevance to neurodevelopment.</span>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/24/e0022252025?rss=1">Striatal Dopamine Actions and Movement: Inferences from Parkinson Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nature of motor deficits in Parkinson disease (PD) and aspects of their improvements with &#x029F;-DOPA replacement therapy (LDRT) offer potential insights into striatal dopamine actions. The defining and most LDRT responsive feature of PD, bradykinesia, is a complex phenomenon exhibiting impairments of both simple and complex limb movements. LDRT significantly remediates the former but not the latter. LDRT pharmacodynamics has two major components, the Short Duration Response (SDR), with a time course of seconds to minutes, and the Long Duration Response (LDR), with a time course of days to weeks. LDRT pharmacodynamics suggests different striatal dopamine actions on different time scales. While many studies used PD subjects to investigate striatal dopamine actions, few take LDRT pharmacodynamics into account. Correlating bradykinesia features and LDRT pharmacodynamics with our present understanding of striatal dopamine actions suggests that LDRT failure to improve complex movement performance reflects loss of phasic dopaminergic signaling. The SDR is likely a result of partially restored tonic/volume striatal dopamine neurotransmission. There is no existing explanation for the LDR. Recent experiments isolating the LDR cast doubt on prior accounts of how LDRT remediates bradykinesia. Interactions between the SDR and LDR may give rise to novel properties. Longer duration effects of striatal dopaminergic signaling need to be incorporated into studies of striatal dopamine actions in both preclinical and clinical experiments. Careful studies of PD bradykinesia and LDRT pharmacodynamics offer potential avenues for future explorations of striatal dopamine actions. Systematic preclinical experiments are needed to optimize design of clinical experiments.</p>

                <p>Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus pesticide used extensively in agricultural and residential settings for nearly 60 years. Gestational, subacute exposure to chlorpyrifos is linked to increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal studies have modeled these neurobehavioral detriments; however, the functional alterations in the brain induced by this exposure remain largely unknown. To address this, we used a rat model of gestational chlorpyrifos exposure to interrogate the alterations in the developing somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Rat dams were exposed to chlorpyrifos (5&nbsp;mg/kg) or vehicle on gestational days 18&ndash;21 via subcutaneous injection, with no overt acute toxicity. Acetylcholinesterase was modestly inhibited but returned to baseline levels by postnatal day 12. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on postnatal days 12&ndash;20 in both male and female progeny of the treated dams. A spike timing-dependent plasticity protocol revealed changes to the normal development of use-dependent plasticity, including interference in long-term synaptic depression. Recording inhibitory synaptic activity revealed an increase in the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents and in paired-pulse ratios, in conjunction with a significant decrease in miniature postsynaptic currents. These findings suggest a presynaptic mechanism of inhibited GABA release, with potential disinhibition of inhibitory neurons. Evaluation of barrel cortex development displayed disruptions to normal barrel field patterning, with increases in both the septal area and total barrel field. We provide evidence for functional and structural alterations during brain development induced by in utero exposure to the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos that may account for the well-established behavioral outcomes.</p>

                <p>How does our brain transform when we encounter a new task? To fully answer this question, comparing brain states before and after learning may not be enough, but rather an ongoing, continuous monitoring of brain changes during learning is required. While such continuous examinations of functional learning-induced changes are widely available using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a continuous investigation of diffusion-detected brain modifications during learning is yet to be reported. Here, we continuously acquire diffusion MRI images during task performance. We then compute the mean diffusivity (MD) using a sliding-window approach, resulting in a continuous measure of diffusivity changes throughout learning. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a motor sequence learning (finger tapping) task (<I>n</I> = 58, 30 females). MD decrease was detected in task-related brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), hippocampus, inferior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. Analysis of the temporal patterns of decrease revealed a rapid MD reduction in the right temporal gyrus after 11&nbsp;min of training, with additional decrease in the right PHG and left cerebellum after 22&nbsp;min. We further computed "neuroplasticity networks" of brain areas showing similar change patterns and detected similarities between these networks and canonical functional connectivity networks. Our findings offer novel insights on the spatiotemporal dynamics of diffusion-detected neuroplasticity by demonstrating continuous modifications during the encoding phase of learning itself rather than comparing pre- and postlearning states.</p>

                <p>Over the course of development, functional sensory representations emerge in the visual cortex. Prior to eye opening, modular patterns of spontaneous activity form long-range networks that may serve as a precursor for mature network organization. Although the spatial structure of these networks has been well studied, their temporal features, which may contribute to their continued plasticity and development, remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we imaged hours of spontaneous network activity in the visual cortex of developing ferrets of both sexes utilizing a fast calcium indicator (GCaMP8m) and wide-field imaging at high temporal resolution (50&nbsp;Hz). The spatial structure of this activity was highly modular, exhibiting distributed and spatially segregated active domains and long-range correlated networks on the timescale of tens of milliseconds. We found that the majority of events showed a clear dynamic component in which the patterns of active modules shifted over the course of events lasting a few hundred milliseconds. Although only a minority of events were well fit with a linear traveling wave, more complex spatiotemporal patterns occurred in repeated and stereotyped motifs across hours of imaging. Finally, we found that the most frequently occurring single-frame spatial activity patterns were predictive of future activity and separable spatiotemporal trajectories extending over many hundreds of milliseconds. Together, our results demonstrate that spontaneous activity in the early developing cortex exhibits a stereotyped spatiotemporal structure on fast timescales, suggesting a potential role in the maturation and refinement of future functional representations.</p>

                <p>Feelings of cognitive fatigue emerge through repeated mental exertion and are ubiquitous in our daily lives. However, there is a limited understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the influence of cognitive fatigue on decisions to exert. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants (18 females, 10 males) chose to exert effort for reward, before and after bouts of fatiguing cognitive exertion. We found that when participants became cognitively fatigued, they were more likely to choose to forgo higher levels of reward for more effort. We describe a mechanism by which signals related to cognitive exertion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex influence effort value computations, instantiated by the insula, thereby influencing an individual's decisions to exert while fatigued. Our results suggest that cognitive fatigue plays a critical role in decisions to exert effort and provides a mechanistic link through which information about cognitive state shapes effort-based choice.</p>

                <p>The human ability to track overlapping and asynchronous time intervals is crucial for a myriad of tasks, from engaging in conversation to driving a car. Additionally, unexpected events can trigger rapid, on-the-fly adjustments, necessitating quick updating of both timing intervals and action planning. Such events require immediate recalibration of decision variables to allow the system to promptly adapt to new stimuli and update the timing mechanisms accordingly. In this study, we assessed human male and female participants&rsquo; ability to track two simultaneous and asynchronous beep trains and determine which one ended first. Due to the stochastic nature of the beeps, participants frequently had to reorient their intended actions in order to identify which train was more likely to have ended. We found that they were able to do this accurately, demonstrating timing performance that was comparable with that of a single train. At the neural level, we recorded slowly evolving EEG potentials that encoded a single interval, the one associated with the currently intended action. Upon an intention switch, when participants had to reorient to a previously unintended action, the EEG response amplitude was reset to reflect the new intended interval. In contrast, when participants were instructed to disregard one of the beep trains, EEG responses solely reflected the intervals of the sequence they attended to. This flexibility in response highlights the brain's ability to dynamically reconfigure cognitive processes in real time, ensuring that actions remain contextually appropriate despite sudden changes in the environment.</p>

                <p>The ability to form decisions is a foundational cognitive function which is impaired across many psychiatric and neurological conditions. Understanding the neural processes underpinning clinical deficits may provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of decision-making. The N2c has been identified as an EEG signal indexing the efficiency of early target selection, which subsequently influences the timing of perceptual reports through modulating neural evidence accumulation rates. Evidence for the contribution of the N2c to human decision-making however has thus far come from correlational research in neurologically healthy individuals. Here, we capitalized on the superior temporal resolution of EEG to show that unilateral brain lesions in male and female humans were associated with specific deficits in both the timing and strength of the N2c in the damaged hemisphere, with corresponding deficits in the timing of perceptual reports contralaterally. The extent to which the N2c influenced clinical deficits in perceptual reporting speed depended on neural rates of evidence accumulation. This work provides causal evidence that the N2c indexes an early, hemisphere-specific process supporting human decision-making. This noninvasive EEG marker could be used to monitor novel approaches for remediating clinical deficits in perceptual decision-making across a range of brain disorders.</p>

                <p>Previous studies have found that several neurochemicals are involved in formation of pair bonding. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying pair bonding, especially how these chemicals interact in this circuit to regulate pair bonding, remain unclear. Using male mandarin voles, the present study shows that cohabitation with a partner increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) oxytocin (OT) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. Optogenetic activation of PVN OT neurons projecting to the NAc shell reduced the activity of D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) but increased the activity of D1 MSNs in the NAc shell. Bath application of OT caused a long-term depression (LTD) of evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) in NAc shell D1/D2 MSNs in the noncohabitated male voles. This OT-induced LTD in the NAc shell D1/D2 MSNs was suppressed by 7&nbsp;d of cohabitation. NAc shell oxytocin receptor (OTR) MSNs projecting to the ventral pallidum (VP) were D1R/D2R positive. Chemogenetic activation or inhibition of OTR MSNs in the NAc shell projecting to the VP facilitated or disrupted the pair bond formation, respectively. The facilitatory effects of OTR MSN activation on pair bond formation could be blocked by D2 antagonist, but not D1 antagonist. These results suggest that OT and OTR neurons in the PVN&ndash;NAc shell&ndash;VP circuit regulate pair bonding via different activities of D1/D2 MSNs.</p>

                <p>Research on feature-based attention has shown that selecting a specific visual feature (e.g., the color red) results in enhanced processing in early visual cortex, providing the neural basis for the efficient identification of relevant features in many everyday tasks. However, many situations require the selection of entire feature ranges instead of just a single feature value, and recent accounts have proposed that broadly tuned attentional templates are often critical for guiding selection in cluttered visual scenes. To assess the neural implementation of such broad tuning of feature-based attention, we here recorded frequency-tagged potentials in human observers (male and female) while participants attended to narrow or broad ranges of colors of spatially intermingled dot fields. Our results show clear increases in the signal strength for the attended colors relative to unattended colors for both narrow and broad color ranges, though this increase was reduced for the broad-range condition, suggesting that limits in the breadth of attentional tuning arise at early processing stages. Overall, the present findings indicate that feature-selective attention can amplify multiple contiguous color values in early visual cortex, shedding light onto the neural mechanisms underlying broad search templates. More generally, they illustrate how feature-based attention can dynamically "zoom in" and "zoom out" in feature space, mirroring models of spatial attention.</p>

                <p>Dopamine modulation of the basal ganglia differs in males and females and is implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric conditions, including some, like Tourette syndrome (TS) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), that have marked sex differences in prevalence. Genetic studies in TS and subsequent work in animals suggest that a loss of histamine may contribute to dysregulation of dopamine. Motivated by this, we characterized the modulation of striatal dopamine by histamine, using microdialysis, targeted pharmacology, and shRNA knockdown of histamine receptors. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) histamine reduced striatal dopamine in male mice, replicating previous work. In contrast, and unexpectedly, ICV histamine increased striatal dopamine in females. ICV or targeted infusion of agonists revealed that the effect in males depends on H2R receptors in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Knockdown of H2R in SNc GABAergic neurons abrogated the effect, identifying these cells as a key locus of histamine's regulation of dopamine in males. In females, however, H2R had no discernible role; instead, H3R agonists in the striatum increased striatal dopamine. Strikingly, the effect of histamine on dopamine in females was modulated by the estrous cycle, appearing only in proestrus, when estrogen levels are high, and estrus. These findings confirm the regulation of striatal dopamine by histamine but identify marked sex differences in and estrous modulation of this effect. These findings may shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of sex differences in the striatal circuitry and in several neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>

                <p>The chemokine CXCL12 is a highly conserved peptide that regulates homeostatic processes in the brain throughout life. Recent work shows that CXCL12 increases dendritic spine density in cortical neurons, which requires activation of CXCL12's receptor CXCR4. This same pathway reverses cortical dendritic spine deficits and cognitive impairment in an animal model of neuroHIV. However, it remained unclear if CXCL12 simply preserved existing spines or also engaged spine plasticity processes that drove network-level adaptations. We therefore tested if CXCL12 could regulate dendritic spine turnover, maturation, clustering, and neuronal network activity in primary rat cortical neurons of either sex using live-cell imaging, confocal microscopy, and multielectrode arrays. Intriguingly, CXCL12-treated neurons formed significantly more new spines than controls, and this outcome was blocked by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. CXCL12 also increased the density of thin spines expressing postsynaptic markers, including postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), phospho-PSD-95<sup>Ser295</sup>, and GluA1, and allowed neurons to better maintain synaptic PSD-95 puncta size. Thin spines were modestly closer together after CXCL12 treatment, suggesting a possible effect on anatomical spine clustering. These effects translated to structured network activity, as CXCL12 increased spike frequency within network bursts in multielectrode array cultures. Finally, a targeted knockdown of CXCR4 in inhibitory neurons, which mostly lack dendritic spines, prevented CXCL12 from increasing spine density on excitatory neurons. Overall, our findings suggest CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling engages inhibitory neurons along with multiple aspects of spine dynamics and remodeling to shape how broader neuronal networks function.</p>

                <p>In humans, mutations or deletions of atypical FAT cadherin genes are linked to autism spectrum disorder and cerebellar ataxia. However, their large genomic size and the enormous size of their encoded proteins have hampered functional studies, leaving the roles of FAT cadherins poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated FAT2&mdash;an atypical cadherin selectively expressed in cerebellar granule cells&mdash;in murine cerebellar function. We demonstrate that FAT2 directly binds Cbln1, a secreted molecule essential for synapse formation and plasticity at Purkinje cell synapses. Furthermore, <I>Fat2</I> deletion mice of both sexes selectively weakened the synaptic strength of parallel fiber synapses in the cerebellum and impaired motor behaviors. These findings reveal that FAT2 is indispensable for motor behaviors, likely through regulating Cbln1-dependent synaptic integrity.</p>

                <p>Recognition of a familiar object in a novel location requires retrieval of the former object&ndash;place association and encoding of novel information. Such object-in-place (OiP) memory recruits a neural network including the hippocampus (HPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (NRe); however, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not understood. Locus ceruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons signal novelty; thus here we focused on the contribution of LC&ndash;forebrain projections and noradrenaline (NA) receptor subtypes to OiP encoding compared with retrieval, using an arena-based OiP task in male rats. The NRe was found to receive a catecholaminergic input from LC, with the strongest innervation directed to rostral NRe. Interestingly optogenetic inactivation of the LC-&gt;NRe pathway impaired OiP retrieval but was without effect on encoding, while inactivation of the LC-&gt;HPC selectively impaired encoding. Consistent with this double dissociation, pharmacological blockade of NRe &alpha;1-adrenoreceptors selectively impaired memory retrieval, while blockade of HPC &beta;-adrenoreceptors impaired encoding. Finally, pharmacological attenuation of noradrenergic signaling in the NRe and HPC through the infusion of the &alpha;2-adrenergic receptor agonist UK 14,304 impaired retrieval and encoding, respectively. Surprisingly, antagonism or agonism of adrenoreceptor subtypes in the mPFC had no effect on memory performance. Together these results reveal the importance of NA within the HPC and NRe for OiP, whereby selectivity of function is achieved via spatially distinct LC output projections and NA receptor subtypes consistent with a modular view of NA function. These results are also important in demonstrating the distinct neuronal mechanisms by which encoding and retrieval are achieved.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/24/e2425242025?rss=1">Specializations in Amygdalar and Hippocampal Innervation of the Primate Nucleus Accumbens Shell</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical to goal-directed behaviors as the main input structure for limbic pathways to the basal ganglia. The NAc shell is composed of inhibitory projection neurons that receive robust glutamatergic innervation from both the hippocampus and amygdala. In view of primate-specific changes in the neural composition of the NAc, it is still unclear how its circuits are organized in primates. We used a system-to-synapse approach to characterize amygdalar and hippocampal pathway distribution, innervation patterns, and synaptic characteristics in the NAc shell of rhesus monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) of both sexes. Key findings showed that both the amygdalar and hippocampal pathways disproportionately innervated NAc shell interneurons relative to their population sizes, assessed via confocal systems&rsquo; analysis and at the synaptic level with electron microscopy. The synaptic features associated with the two pathways were distinct. The amygdalar projection was denser, with larger boutons that more often contained mitochondria than the hippocampal projection. The hippocampal pathway had larger postsynaptic densities and more frequently formed perforated synapses, which are features associated with high synaptic efficacy. In addition, hippocampal boutons more frequently formed multiple synapses, often with one projection neuron and one interneuron. These interactions with the NAc shell suggest distinct mechanisms for the processing of affective signaling from the amygdala and contextual information from the hippocampus.</p>

                <p>Imitation plays a key role in the acquisition of speech and cultural behaviors. Studies suggest that social interaction facilitates imitative learning, indicating that neural circuits involved in social behaviors can also influence the process of imitation. Vocal imitation in juvenile songbirds serves as a valuable model to investigate this idea. Here, we explore the mechanisms of tutor&ndash;pupil social interaction and selective song learning in male zebra finches, with a particular focus on the amygdala, which can regulate social behaviors via its processing of values and emotions in mammals. When sequentially exposed to two tutors, normal pupils selectively learned song from the tutor who sang longer but less frequently. When hearing songs, pupils preferentially approached the selected tutor. Excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala increased pupils&rsquo; social motivation toward tutors yet diminished their song-responsive approach, especially to the selected tutor. Whereas the pupils with amygdala lesions retained their ability to imitate song, the tutor selection became more unpredictable with diminished preference for a specific tutor. Neuronal tracing confirmed that the zebra finch amygdala is connected to the circuits involved in social functions but lacks direct connections to those critical for song control and learning. These results suggest that the amygdala regulates social motivation and tutor selection in juvenile zebra finches, highlighting its role in imitative learning.</p>

                <p>Models of experience-dependent neuroplasticity predict that the acquisition and extensive use of a new skill trigger a nonlinear trajectory of neurostructural modifications, where initial expansion of relevant brain areas subsequently (once the skill is acquired) gives way to volumetric renormalization. Such predictions also apply in the domain of language during learning and/or simultaneous management of two (or more) linguistic systems. In a sample of 69 young adult Russian&ndash;English bilinguals, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in bilingual engagement nonlinearly correlate with normalized volume of the hippocampus&mdash;a key learning-related brain region particularly amenable to experience-dependent plasticity. Results revealed an inverted U-shape association between second language engagement and left hippocampal gray matter volume. The present results replicate and expand the findings from aging populations, showing a nonlinear pattern of structural hippocampal plasticity in healthy young adults. These findings support the role of bilingualism as a promoter of experience-dependent neuroplasticity.</p>

                <p>Neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) integrate visceral and limbic inputs and project to multiple brain regions to bias behavior toward aversive or defensive states. This study examines MOR signaling in anterior PVT neurons in brain slices from untreated and morphine-treated animals. Imaging in a MOR-Cre reporter rat revealed extensive expression in aPVT cells, and the application of [Met]<sup>5&ndash;</sup> enkephalin (ME) induced outward currents which were abolished by the MOR-selective antagonist CTAP. A saturating concentration of ME resulted in desensitization that was blocked by compound 101, indicating a phosphorylation-dependent process. The opioid sensitivity of amygdala-, nucleus accumbens-, and prefrontal cortex-projecting neurons was then examined. Neurons that projected to the amygdala were more sensitive to ME than cortical- and accumbal-projecting cells. Following chronic treatment, tolerance to morphine was found in neurons projecting to the amygdala and nucleus accumbens with a trend toward tolerance observed in neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex. The results reveal that adaptations to chronic opioid exposure are in the aPVT circuits contribute to affective pain processing and may provide specific insights into the etiology of withdrawal following the cessation of opioid use.</p>

                Background Due to occupational exposure, healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) infection than the general population. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may increase the risk of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs, potentially reducing the available health workforce. We examined the association between NCDs and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality among infected HCWs. Methods This cohort study used data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) database. HCWs hospitalized between January 2020 and January 2023 due to clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. Variables collected included demographic data, comorbidities, and hospitalization outcomes. Descriptive statistics were reported using mean/standard deviation (SD), median/interquartile range (IQR), or frequencies and proportions. For each NCD, the relative risk of death, adjusted for age and sex, was calculated using log-binomial regression as well as the population-attributable fraction. Results There were 17,502 HCWs, 95.7% of whom had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority were female (66.5%) and the mean age (SD) was 49.8 (14.3) years. Roughly, half (51.42%) of HCWs had no comorbidities, 29.28% had one comorbidity, 14.68% had 2 comorbidities and <5% had ≥3 comorbidities. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (49.40%) and cardiovascular disease (36.90%). Approximately one-fifth of the HCWs had severe COVID-19 (16.95%) and 10.68% of the HCWs with COVID-19 died. Being ≥45 years old, male gender, smoking, obesity, and certain NCDs increased the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Obesity and diabetes mellitus were the leading risk factors in terms of the population-attributable risk for COVID-19 severity (6.89%) and mortality (36.00%) respectively. Conclusions Many HCWs with COVID-19 had one or more NCDs. Obesity and diabetes mellitus increased COVID-19 severity and mortality risk. Reducing the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus would yield the biggest reduction in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs.

                Hepatic tuberculosis is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. It can clinically and radiologically mimic primary hepatic malignancies, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease. Herein, we report the case of an 81-year-old man with a history of compensated advanced chronic liver disease secondary to hepatitis B virus infection, treated with Entecavir, who presented with rapid clinical decline, weight loss, and a newly discovered hepatic mass. Imaging revealed a heterogeneous, necrotic lesion in segment IV, classified LR-M on LI-RADS, highly suggestive of malignancy. However, histopathology from a liver biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation with caseating necrosis, confirming the diagnosis of hepatic tuberculosis. No evidence of extrahepatic tuberculosis $ was found. The patient received a full 9-month course of anti-tuberculous therapy with complete clinical and radiological resolution. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of hepatic tuberculosis in cirrhotic patients, especially when mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma. Liver biopsy remains essential in atypical instances to avoid unnecessary interventions.

                Background Behaviors regarding child-bearing are among the most consequential ones within families, as child-rearing necessitates the active involvement of both partners. This dynamic suggests that individuals may seek partners with similar fertility preferences, leading to assortative mating based on these shared preferences. Data and Methods This study investigates second-child fertility outcomes using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies and applies the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Furthermore, it examines assortative matching based on fertility preferences, utilizing the 2020 provincial-level sex ratio for individuals aged 20–39 as a proxy for women’s bargaining power in the marriage market. Results The results, based on a sample of 2,351 household-level observations, indicate that spouses’ preferences are complementary. When a husband (or wife) desires a second child, their own preference has a stronger impact on the actual outcome to have of having a second child if their partner also expresses the same desire. Additionally, the findings reveal evidence of assortative mating in terms of preferences for the desired number of children. Moreover, in provinces with higher male-to-female sex ratios—indicating stronger bargaining power for women—a wife’s preference is more strongly aligned with her husband’s preference. For men, however, a husband’s preference aligns with his wife’s preference regardless of the sex ratio, suggesting that men’s bargaining power in the marriage market is relatively weak. Conclusions The findings have two key implications. First, shared fertility preferences between spouses show a complementary effect, increasing the likelihood of having a second child. Second, marriage matching is not random, as individuals are more likely to partner with those who share similar fertility preferences. Additionally, women with greater bargaining power are positively associated with their husbands’ desired family size.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network topology can contribute to explaining fundamental properties of genes, from expression levels to evolutionary constraints. Genes central to a network are more likely to be both conserved and highly expressed, whereas genes that are able to evolve in response to selective pressures but expressed at lower levels are located on the periphery of the network. The stress response is likewise thought to be conserved and its associated genes highly expressed, however, experimental evidence for these patterns is limited. Therefore, we examined here whether the transcriptomic response to two environmental stressors (heat, UV, and their combination) is related to PPI architecture in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio)</i> embryos. We show that stress response genes are situated more centrally in the PPI network. The transcriptomic response to heat was located in both central and peripheral positions, whereas UV response transcripts occupied central to intermediate positions. Network position was further linked to the magnitude of fold changes of genes and types and number of their associated phenotype GO terms. Across treatments, differentially expressed genes in different parts of the network affected identical phenotypes. Our results indicate that the zebrafish stress response is considered conserved but also have stressor-specific aspects. These properties can aid in better understanding the organismal response to diverse and co-occurring stressors. Given the speed of contemporary changes in aquatic ecosystems, our approach can aid in identifying novel key regulators of the systemic response to specific stressors.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013081">Balanced state of networks of winner-take-all units</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rich Pang</p>

Irregularly timed action potentials, or spikes, are pervasively observed in the brain activity of awake mammals. However, the role of this temporal irregularity in neural computation is still not well understood. In canonical network models irregular spiking emerges via balanced, fluctuating input currents, leading to collective responses that track inputs linearly. How networks characterized by irregular spiking could support flexible nonlinear dynamics needed for general-purpose computation remains under ongoing debate. Here we characterize the dynamics of networks whose elementary unit is not a single neuron but a small group of neurons, with distinct tunings, that compete at each timestep via a winner-take-all (WTA) interaction. While WTA has long been proposed as an elementary functional motif in the brain and represents a powerful computational primitive, how large networks of such units behave has received less investigation. We show that these networks, like classic excitatory-inhibitory balanced networks, exhibit a chaotic fluctuation-driven regime characterized by sustained irregular activity resembling realistic cortical spiking, which we interpret as a multidimensional balance spread over several competing neural populations with different tunings. We develop a mean-field theory for the network, which shows how irregular spiking sustained by time-varying input fluctuations can support flexible nonlinear collective dynamics. Using the theory we predict and verify network regimes in which input fluctuations alone yield multistability, stable sequence generation, or complex heterogeneous firing rate dynamics—three core dynamical primitives thought to underlie memory-dependent neural computation—via consistent Poisson-like spiking produced through chaos. Thus, networks of WTA units support a chaotic fluctuation-driven regime characterized by irregular spiking that can power complex nonlinear collective dynamics. This represents a new model of brain activity capable of simultaneously reproducing realistic spike trains and diverse nonlinear firing rate patterns well posed for flexible computation, and which can be trained or fit to data.

                <p>by Jingming Xue, Robert C. Wilson, Mary A. Peterson</p>

Research shows that semantics, activated by words, impacts object detection. Skocypec & Peterson (2022) indexed object detection via correct reports of where figures lie in bipartite displays depicting familiar objects on one side of a border. They reported 2 studies with intermixed Valid and Invalid labels shown before test displays and a third, control, study. Valid labels denoted display objects. Invalid labels denoted unrelated objects in a different or the same superordinate-level category in studies 1 & 2, respectively. We used drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to elucidate the mechanisms of their results. DDM revealed that, following Valid labels, drift rate toward the correct decision increased, i.e., SNR increased. Invalid labels do not affect drift rate directly, but they create a context that diminishes the facilitative effect of valid labels on evidence accumulation. Threshold was higher in study 2 than control, but not in study 1. That more evidence must be accumulated from displays that follow labels denoting objects in the same-superordinate category as the object in the display indicates that more evidence from the display is needed to resolve semantic uncertainty regarding which object is present. These results support the view that semantic networks are engaged in object detection.

A new study in PLOS Biology shows that Liprin-α and RIM form condensates which not only scaffold presynaptic protein architectures but also fine-tune vesicle priming and release dynamics.

Liprin-α and RIM form liquid phase-separated condensates that organize presynaptic architecture and fine-tune neurotransmitter release. This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology analysing how these dynamic assemblies shape synaptic fidelity and what their disruption might mean in neurodevelopmental disease.

Migraine aura – manifesting as transient, neurological disturbances – presents a complex and unresolved relationship with migraine headache. Cortical spreading depolarization (SD), recognized as the mechanism underlying aura symptoms, has been shown to trigger head pain through activation of trigeminal nociceptors in animal models. However, recent clinical data challenge the notion that aura causes migraine headache in patients. In this Essay, we critically examine the pathophysiology of migraine aura and migraine headache, exploring evidence from clinical observations, (genetic) mouse models, and pharmacological studies. We also discuss the role of SD, the trigeminovascular system, and the impact of pharmacological agents that both trigger and treat migraine attacks. Our essay highlights the complexities and conflicting data surrounding the interplay between aura and headache, emphasizing the need for further research to unravel this mystery and improve therapeutic strategies for individuals with migraine.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent condition. Recent research on people with KOA has addressed kinetic chain and core muscle contribution in disease progression. Objective This study aims to assess the efficacy of including the CARE -KOA© regimen and evaluate its effect on pain, patient-reported functional outcomes, physical function tests, knee strength, and core endurance. Methods/Design 15 patients above 45 were recruited and underwent a 4-week CARE -KOA© program with 12 supervised sessions over four weeks. Pre- and Post-exercise assessment included evaluating the primary outcome pain using the VAS scale and the patient-reported outcome using the KOOS scale. The secondary outcomes, knee muscle strength, core endurance, and the physical function tests, i.e., the stair climb test, the sit-to-stand test, the 40m fast-paced walking test, and the timed up-and-go test, were also evaluated. The data collected in the study was analyzed using the statistical software JAMOVI. p < 0.05 was significant. Results Notably, all the parameters examined exhibited a statistically significant difference between their pre-intervention and post-intervention values, except the knee muscle strength in the flexors of the affected knee and extensors of the unaffected knee. Conclusion Patients who completed a 4-week supervised CARE -KOA© program alongside routine rehabilitation experienced reduced pain and improved outcomes. This approach aims to address biomechanical issues and positively impacts pain mechanisms.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by repetitive upper airway obstruction, leads to chronic intermittent hypoxia (cIH) and induces cognitive and neuronal network disruptions similar to those observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These pathologies are often presented together in the elderly and share some pathophysiological mechanisms. The presence of amyloid beta (Aβ), observed both in AD and OSA patients, can alter brain function, cholinergic modulation and memory either independently or in addition with cIH. To explore these possibilities, we studied the pathological effects of Aβ, cIH, and their combination on cognition and hippocampal activity, and its modulations by the cholinomimetics carbachol, muscarine, and nicotine, along with evaluations of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression in the septum and the hippocampus. We found that cIH and Aβ similarly affect spatial memory and additively impact aversive memory (sparing recognition memory). Although cIH and Aβ share some pathological effects on hippocampal activity and its modulation by cholinomimetics, when combined, they produce an additive inhibition at the population and single-cell levels more evident in the presence of nicotine. No change in ChAT expression was observed. Remarkably, the departure from normal firing as well as the disruption of carbachol-induced response correlates with the reduction of aversive memory in our experimental groups. In summary, cIH and Aβ share pathological effects, but their combination exacerbates functional pathology, contributing to our understanding of AD/OSA pathophysiology and co-morbidity.</p>

                Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a hallmark of many neurological diseases. It is known that proinflammatory cytokines can disrupt tight junctions between endothelial cells of the BBB, allowing larger molecules to penetrate the brain. Along with BBB disruption, these diseases also feature increased numbers of CD8 T cells as components of the immune cell population in the brain. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of CD8 T cell-mediated BBB disruption, including the roles of antigen presentation through MHC class I molecules, which emerge as an important determining feature of BBB disruption and immune cell infiltration into the brain.

                Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates not only the well-known β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides but also APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). Recent evidence from studies in murine- or human-derived (neuronal) models suggests that APP-CTFs may independently contribute to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology by disrupting cellular homeostasis. This review highlights pathological effects unique to APP-CTFs that are independent of Aβ, shedding light on their distinct role in disease progression. We explore the mechanisms underlying APP-CTF-induced toxicity, with a focus on their contribution to endolysosomal dysfunction. APP-CTFs impair lysosomal function and disrupt calcium signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, compounding organelle dysfunction. Understanding these mechanisms will aid the design of preventive therapeutic strategies that take into account the impact of APP-CTFs on AD pathology.

                Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common complication of pregnancy, posing significant health risks for both women and their children. Unlike other subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD), PPD is thought to be biologically relatively homogenous, as it is precipitated by a specific biological trigger – the profound hormonal shifts associated with pregnancy and delivery. However, the underlying pathophysiology of PPD is still unclear, with a variety of biological factors likely at play. In this review, we examine recent biological findings related to neuroimaging, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neuroactive steroids (NAS), epigenetics, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) and explore processes that may be unique to PPD versus those shared with MDD, along with avenues of future research aimed at PPD prevention and treatment.

                Roy et al. identify VDAC1 as a target for pharmacologically induced insulin hypersecretion in β cells. Hypersecretory stress causes a distinct transcriptomic signature that implicates ER-associated degradation (ERAD) as an adaptive response. The relative abundance of ERAD components is altered in pancreatic islets of type 2 diabetic humans.

                Du et al. show that VTA astrocyte activation in response to stress disinhibits dopaminergic neurons through presynaptic adenosine A1 receptors on GABAergic interneurons, thereby mitigating the development of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors.

                Harris et al. show that absence of the APP family in excitatory neurons is associated with suppression and silencing of cortico-hippocampal circuits and behavioral deficits that are linked to impaired NMDAR function. These findings indicate an essential role for the APP family in maintaining normal neuronal circuit function in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100204">Single cell transcriptomes of zebrafish germline reveal progenitor types and feminization by Foxl2l</a></h4>

              
                Zebrafish is an important organism for genetic studies, but its early germ cell types and the mechanism of sex differentiation have not been fully characterized. Here, we profiled single-cell transcriptomes and charted a developmental trajectory going from germline stem cells, through early, committed, and late progenitors, to pre-meiotic and meiotic cells. We showed that transcription factor Foxl2l expressed in the progenitor directed progenitor differentiation toward oocytes. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutation of <i>foxl2l</i> produced 100% male fish with normal fertility. Another single-cell profiling of <i>foxl2l<sup>-/-</sup> </i>germ cells revealed the arrest of germ cell development at the stage of progenitor commitment. Concomitantly, <i>nanos2 </i>transcript (germline stem cell marker) was elevated together with an increase of <i>nanos2<sup>+</sup> </i>germ cells in <i>foxl2l </i>mutants, indicating the acquisition of a novel stem cell state. Thus, we have identified developmental stages of germ cells in juvenile zebrafish and demonstrated that zebrafish Foxl2l drives progenitor germ cells toward feminization and prevents them from expressing <i>nanos2</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103648">Kinesin-2 autoinhibition requires elbow phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Kinesin motor proteins facilitate microtubule-based transport by converting chemical energy into mechanical forces, but this activity is autoinhibited until cargo is loaded. Regulatory mechanisms underlying this autoinhibitory conformation are not well understood. Here, we show that a NEver in mitosis Kinase NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates a flexible elbow region between two coiled-coil domains connecting the motor head and tail of an intraflagellar transport kinesin, OSM-3. The phosphor-dead (PD) mutation, but not phosphor-mimic (PM) mutation, induces constitutive motility of OSM-3 in vitro. Using knock-in animals, we discovered that both PD and PM mutations shorten the <i>C. elegans</i> sensory cilia. The constitutively active OSM-3PD fails to enter cilia and abnormally accumulates in neurites, mimicking another hyperactive mutation, OSM-3G444E. Conversely, OSM-3PM enters cilia but moves at a reduced speed, indicating an inhibitory role of elbow phosphorylation in kinesin motility. These findings highlight the crucial role of elbow phosphorylation in regulating kinesin autoinhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101757">Caffeic acid phenethyl ester protects Clostridioides difficile infection by toxin inhibition and microbiota modulation</a></h4>

              
                <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI) is the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea that seriously threatens public health. The disruption of normal gut microbiota by the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents enables <i>C. difficile</i> to proliferate in the colon. The emergence and prevalence of hypervirulent <i>C. difficile</i> strains result in increased morbidity, mortality, and high recurrence rates of CDI, thus creating a pressing need for novel therapeutics. The multi-domain toxins TcdA and TcdB are the primary determinants of CDI pathogenesis, rendering them ideal drug targets in the anti-virulence paradigm. In this study, we identified caffeic acid and its derivatives from natural compounds library as active inhibitors of TcdB via a cell-based high-throughput phenotypic screening. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) could directly bind to TcdB, thus suppressing InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis and inhibiting glucosyltransferase activity. CAPE treatment remarkably reduces the pathology of CDI in a murine infection model in terms of alleviated diarrhea symptoms, decreased bacterial colonization, and relieved histopathological lesions. Moreover, CAPE treatment of <i>C. difficile</i>-challenged mice induces a remarkable increase in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota and alterations of gut metabolites (e.g., adenosine, D-proline, and melatonin), which might partially contribute to the therapeutic outcomes of CAPE against CDI. Our results reveal the potential of CAPE as a therapeutic for the management of CDI, or CAPE might serve as a lead compound for the development of antivirulence drugs targeting TcdB.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95243">Embedding stochastic dynamics of the environment in spontaneous activity by prediction-based plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The brain learns an internal model of the environment through sensory experiences, which is essential for high-level cognitive processes. Recent studies show that spontaneous activity reflects such a learned internal model. Although computational studies have proposed that Hebbian plasticity can learn the switching dynamics of replayed activities, it is still challenging to learn dynamic spontaneous activity that obeys the statistical properties of sensory experience. Here, we propose a pair of biologically plausible plasticity rules for excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a recurrent spiking neural network model to embed stochastic dynamics in spontaneous activity. The proposed synaptic plasticity rule for excitatory synapses seeks to minimize the discrepancy between stimulus-evoked and internally predicted activity, while inhibitory plasticity maintains the excitatory-inhibitory balance. We show that the spontaneous reactivation of cell assemblies follows the transition statistics of the model’s evoked dynamics. We also demonstrate that simulations of our model can replicate recent experimental results of spontaneous activity in songbirds, suggesting that the proposed plasticity rule might underlie the mechanism by which animals learn internal models of the environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99940">Mapping vascular network architecture in primate brain using ferumoxytol-weighted laminar MRI</a></h4>

              
                Mapping the vascular organization of the brain is of great importance across various domains of basic neuroimaging research, diagnostic radiology, and neurology. However, the intricate task of precisely mapping vasculature across brain regions and cortical layers presents formidable challenges, resulting in a limited understanding of neurometabolic factors influencing the brain’s microvasculature. Addressing this gap, our study investigates whole-brain vascular volume using ferumoxytol-weighted laminar-resolution multi-echo gradient-echo imaging in macaque monkeys. We validate the results with published data for vascular densities and compare them with cytoarchitecture, neuron and synaptic densities. The ferumoxytol-induced change in transverse relaxation rate (ΔR<sub>2</sub>*), an indirect proxy measure of cerebral blood volume (CBV), was mapped onto 12 equivolumetric laminar cortical surfaces. Our findings reveal that CBV varies threefold across the brain, with the highest vascular volume observed in the inferior colliculus and lowest in the corpus callosum. In the cerebral cortex, CBV is notably high in early primary sensory areas and low in association areas responsible for higher cognitive functions. Classification of CBV into distinct groups unveils extensive replication of translaminar vascular network motifs, suggesting distinct computational energy supply requirements in areas with varying cytoarchitecture types. Regionally, baseline R<sub>2</sub>* and CBV exhibit positive correlations with neuron density and negative correlations with receptor densities. Adjusting image resolution based on the critical sampling frequency of penetrating cortical vessels allows us to delineate approximately 30% of the arterial–venous vessels. Collectively, these results mark significant methodological and conceptual advancements, contributing to the refinement of cerebrovascular MRI. Furthermore, our study establishes a linkage between neurometabolic factors and the vascular network architecture in the primate brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92092">A mathematical model that predicts human biological age from physiological traits identifies environmental and genetic factors that influence aging</a></h4>

              
                Why people age at different rates is a fundamental, unsolved problem in biology. We created a model that predicts an individual’s age from physiological traits that change with age in the large UK Biobank dataset, such as blood pressure, lung function, strength, and stimulus-reaction time. The model predicted a person’s age with best accuracy when it heavily weighted traits that together query multiple organ systems, arguing that most or all physiological systems (lung, heart, brain, etc.) contribute to the global phenotype of chronological age. Differences between calculated ‘biological’ age and chronological age (∆Age) appear to reflect an individual’s relative youthfulness, as people predicted to be young for their age had a lower subsequent mortality rate and a higher parental age at death, even though no mortality data were used to calculate ∆Age. Remarkably, the effect of each year of physiological ∆Age on Gompertz mortality risk was equivalent to that of one chronological year. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ∆Age and analysis of environmental factors associated with ∆Age identified known as well as new factors that may influence human aging, including genes involved in synapse biology and a tendency to play computer games. We identify a small number of readily measured physiological traits that together assess a person’s biological age and may be used clinically to evaluate therapeutics designed to slow aging and extend healthy life.

                Ferroptosis is a distinct iron-dependent programmed cell death and plays important roles in tumor suppression. However, the regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis need further exploration. RUNT-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a transcription factor, is essential for osteogenesis. <i>RUNX2</i> has two types of transcripts produced by two alternative promoters. In the present study, we surprisingly find that RUNX2 isoform II is a novel ferroptosis and apoptosis suppressor. RUNX2 isoform II can bind to the promoter of peroxiredoxin-2 (<i>PRDX2</i>), a ferroptosis inhibitor, and activate its expression. Knockdown of RUNX2 isoform II suppresses cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Interestingly, homeobox A10 (HOXA10), an upstream positive regulator of RUNX2 isoform II, is required for the inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis through the RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway. Consistently, RUNX2 isoform II is overexpressed in OSCC, and associated with OSCC progression and poor prognosis. Collectively, OSCC cancer cells can upregulate RUNX2 isoform II to inhibit ferroptosis and apoptosis and facilitate tumorigenesis through the novel HOXA10/RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway.

">Nucleus Basalis of Meynert as a DBS target</a></h4>

              
                Several clinical attempts to use deep brain stimulation applied to nucleus basalis of Meynert to reduce cognitive decline in different types of dementia report inconclusive effects. At the same time, experiments in rodents have largely demonstrated cognitive improvement. The hypothesised basis for this difference was the application of different patterns of stimulation - tonic continuous over multiple sleep-wake cycles in human clinical trials vs intermittent bursts over shorter intervals in animal studies. However, since no systematic testing of the effects of different stimulation patterns applied in different states of vigilance was conducted, it remains unclear what specific attributes of cortical responses are associated with these patterns, and the effect of vigilance state on pattern response. We hypothesised that communication between nucleus basalis and its cortical targets involves frequencies in both low and high ranges, making burst-type intermittent patterns potentially more effective. Therefore we studied preferred frequencies of neuronal synchronization within nucleus basalis as well as between nucleus basalis and its cortical targets in B6 mouse strain (N=9, age 4-6 month) by recording neuronal spiking and local field potentials (LFP) from 2 sites of the nucleus basalis and 4 cortical sites simultaneously across multiple sleep-wake cycles. Spike-field coherence (SFC) analysis revealed natural synchronization tendencies of nucleus basalis - all animals demonstrated significant SFC at delta-theta range and gamma coherence peaking between 57 and 88 Hz (SFC > 95% Jackknife confidence interval at frequency range > 2*bandwidth). SFC between cortical cells and local field potentials of nucleus basalis, which reflects cortical feedback, peaked at delta-theta frequencies. Based on these results we constructed "nested" patterns of stimulation that included both delta-theta and individually assessed gamma peak for each animal (N=8). The effects of nested stimulation were compared to the ones of random and tonic (20Hz) stimulation patterns. These patterns of stimulation were applied across multiple sleep-wake cycles to freely behaving animals, and spectral power density in response to stimulation compared between patterns for different states of vigilance. We report significant reduction of delta power during slow wave sleep and theta power in REM for all three patterns. Slow wave suppression was also present during wakefulness. This indicates all patterns may improve levels of alertness but highlights strong likelihood of sleep disturbances in response to stimulation during sleep. Thus, deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis may be counterproductive during sleep. The nested pattern of stimulation alone demonstrated preservation or even enhancement of gamma activity in the cortex while suppressing low frequencies. Broad-band suppression of cortical activity was shown in response to tonic stimulation, and to some extent to the random pattern as well, suggesting that tonic stimulation may be unsuitable for deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert.

">Functional connectivity in infants' visual cortex: Links to motion processing and autism</a></h4>

              
                In a previously published study, we found atypical visual cortical laterality patterns during global motion perception in 5-month-old infants who showed high levels of autistic symptoms in toddlerhood. Here, using data from a separate experiment, we examined whether these results could reflect altered visual cortical functional connectivity in theta, alpha, and gamma rhythms. We assessed this in a sample of 5-month- old infants (n = 59; 39 elevated familial likelihood of autism) by means of electroencephalography (EEG) when they were watching videos showing social and non-social scenes. Gamma connectivity between midline and far-lateral visual cortex when viewing social scenes was linked to both later autism symptoms and global motion visual cortical laterality we reported in the previous study. This may indicate a shared integrative mechanism underlying social perception and global motion processing. Further, we found that higher midline-to-lateral theta connectivity in the visual cortex when perceiving non-social scenes in infancy was strongly associated with having more autistic symptoms at follow up, but uncorrelated with concurrent motion perception. Our study points to atypical functional connectivity in the visual cortex as a potential early marker of autistic symptoms and highlights a probable link between motion processing and social perception.

">Disentangling Prediction and Feedback in Social Brain Networks: A Predictive Processing Approach</a></h4>

              
                While much research in social cognitive neuroscience has focused on which brain regions are engaged when processing social content, it remains unclear what these areas are doing in terms of underlying mechanisms. Here, we approached this question using predictive processing theory, which suggests that the brain instantiates a generative model of its sensory environment. Using a novel animated shapes fMRI task, we observed a functional double dissociation between brain regions that were engaged when forming a prediction for agentic movement - which involved the premotor cortex and the lateral parietal cortex, previously implicated in action observation and mirroring - from those associated with processing feedback for updating abstract priors to guide predictions - which involved the dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the temporoparietal area, and the lateral temporal cortex, previously associated with mentalizing/theory of mind. We observed parallel functional dissociations in the cerebellar areas affiliated with these networks. These findings suggest new insights into how brain regions associated with action observation/mirroring and mentalizing/theory of mind play complementary roles in supporting facets of a predictive processing architecture underlying social cognition.

">Multiple-level organizational logic of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system in structure and function</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) regulates various neural processes through a limited number of norepinephrine (NE)-releasing neurons with widespread axon projections. However, how the LC is organized to exert brain-wide regulatory functions remain elusive. Utilizing larval zebrafish as a whole-brain-scale model, we reveal that morphologically heterogenous but physiologically comparable LC-NE neurons assemble complementarily to implement region-specific regulation of brain-wide neural dynamics. Individual LC-NE neurons exhibit diverse axon projections with ipsilateral bias and region preference, but share comparable electrophysiological properties, sensory responses and neural function-related genes' expression. Moreover, population LC-NE neurons display bilaterally symmetrical yet regionally different axon projections and fire synchronously, causing regionally patterned NE release. Along with the regional comparability of NE receptor expression, these enable the LC to tune brain-wide neural dynamics in an inverted-U manner with region difference. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the organizational logic of the LC system.

                Identifying individual differences in brain activity that reflect variation in domains of mental health - including those in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework - remains a core challenge in neuropsychiatry. Here, we cross-analyzed mental health and brain function profiles in hundreds of individuals using factor analysis of 87 neurocognitive/psychiatric assessments and tensor independent component analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during task and movie-watching paradigms with putative mental health relevance. Across 77 brain network variants evoked across five paradigms, univariate and multivariate network activity differences predominantly reflected and predicted cognition, weakly indexing other mental health domains despite their similar reliability and interindividual variability. Normative mental health variation was not reflected in comparatively homogeneous evoked brain activity, and clustering subjects by brain function versus mental health produced discordant subtypes. Brain activity evoked by common fMRI paradigms may contain insufficient non-cognitive information to differentiate mental health in the general population.

                Homotopic functional connectivity (HoFC)--the synchronous activity between homologous regions of the left and right hemispheres--is a hallmark of inter-hemispheric brain architecture, yet its biological underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here, we characterize spatial variation in resting-state HoFC and its relation to dominant natural axes of anatomical, functional, and transcriptomic organization across the human cerebral cortex. We show that the regional distribution of HoFC, from the lowest in association areas (especially limbic) to the highest in primary sensorimotor regions, is preserved across neuropsychiatric disorders in a separate neuroimaging cohort (including schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) despite disease-associated perturbations in magnitude. Regional variation in HoFC is not fully explained by properties of physical embedding or vascular innervation in the brain, suggesting involvement of alternative physiological processes. Furthermore, we find that regions with stronger HoFC are more functionally connected within and across hemispheres at rest, suggesting that homotopic functional coupling is positively associated with brain-wide functional synchrony. Our results collectively suggest that HoFC is inherently aligned with a fundamental natural axis of macroscopic cortical organization and shared global signal--advancing our understanding of the biological correlates of cortical homotopy and suggesting potential mechanisms to investigate in the future.

">Hippocampal Commissural Circuitry Shows Asymmetric cAMP-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Hemispheric asymmetries in NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity have been described in hippocampal area CA1, but it remains unclear whether similar lateralized mechanisms exist for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent plasticity. Here, we investigated whether cAMP-mediated potentiation of synaptic transmission in mouse CA1 exhibits hemisphere-specific properties. In recordings with electrical stimulation of CA1 inputs, a subset of recordings in the left, but not in the right hemisphere CA1, exhibited a pronounced cAMP-induced potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). To isolate input specific contributions, we expressed the optogenetic actuator ChrimsonR unilaterally in the CA3/CA2 region of wild-type mice. Light-evoked glutamate release from ipsilateral Schaffer collaterals showed no cAMP sensitivity in either hemisphere, while commissures originating from the right (COR) exhibited cAMP-mediated potentiation of transmission in a subset of experiments. Notably, this effect was absent at commissures originating from the left (COL). The selective presence of the effect prompted us to further investigate the underlying cell population using CA3-specific (G32-4 Cre) and CA2-specific (Amigo2-Cre) driver lines. Recordings from synapses of CA3 COR recapitulated the cAMP-induced potentiation of transmitter release observed in wild-type animals. However, the effect was again restricted to a subset of experiments and was absent in recordings with specific stimulation of CA2 COR. Our results demonstrate a variable cAMP-sensitivity of transmitter release at COR synapses in the left CA1. Altogether, we reveal a hemisphere-specific cAMP-mediated synaptic plasticity at CA3 COR onto CA1, underscoring hidden heterogeneity and lateralization in hippocampal circuit function.

">A cortical code emerges in Layer5a of S1 through temporal integration of thalamic inputs</a></h4>

              
                Tactile representations in the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex of rodents (wS1) receive inputs from two distinct thalamic nuclei, the ventro-posterior-medial nucleus (VPM) and the posterior medial complex (POm). Previous work has revealed a sweep-stick code in rat wS1 by using a novel whisker velocity-white noise stimulus. Sticks refer to high velocity single whisker bumps, while sweeps correspond to large multiwhisker displacements with extended temporal profiles. We hypothesized that barrel cortex neurons inherit "stick" responses from the VPM and "sweep" responses from the POm. Here we test this hypothesis by studying the coding strategy of both thalamic nuclei and wS1 in mice. We found a stratified wS1 representation of both sweep and stick functional classes, whereas VPM and POm contained mainly stick encoding neurons. Cortical layer 4 "stick" responses are a delayed version from VPM, while layer 5b "sweep" responses come from POm. Notably, layer 5a "sweep" responses result from a temporal integration of "stick" information from VPM and POm. Our results put forward a circuit scheme in which fast encoding stick events from VPM allow a fine-tuned texture processing in the cortex, modulated by sweep-responding cells that integrate multi-whisker information.

">Atypical weighting of sensory evidence and priors in causality perception along the autism-schizotypy continuum</a></h4>

              
                The brain constructs a perceptual interpretation of the world by integrating sensory input with prior knowledge and expectations. Causality perception, a core example of this inferential process, enables observers to infer cause-effect relationships, such as whether a moving object causes another to move. Traditionally considered a low-level visual computation, causality perception is increasingly recognized as shaped by top-down dynamics, perceptual history, and individual predictive processing styles. Here, we examined how prior experience and cognitive-perceptual traits shape causal inference in 150 neurotypical individuals, using data-driven clustering to stratify participants along the autism-schizotypy (ASD-SSD) spectrum. Participants viewed dynamic collision events in which a moving circle contacted a stationary one, followed by variable temporal lags before the second object motion, and judged whether the interaction appeared causal or non-causal. Causality judgments were influenced by both physical timing (sensory-driven) and serial dependence on previous perceptual decisions (prior-driven). Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling (HDDM) revealed that SSD-like individuals showed a strong prior bias toward causality, greater serial dependence, and lower decision thresholds, reflecting a prior-dominated perceptual style. Conversely, ASD-like individuals exhibited reduced influence of perceptual history and higher decision thresholds, reflecting a conservative, data-driven style. Crucially, prior bias, serial dependence, and decision-making dynamics were strongly interrelated, revealing a hierarchical structure to perceptual inference across neurocognitive profiles. These findings demonstrate that causality perception emerges from predictive processes operating at multiple timescales and shaped by individual differences in neurocognitive style and perceptual flexibility.

">Cross-species comparative connectomics reveals the evolution of an olfactory circuit</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavioural diversity ultimately stems from variation in neural circuitry, yet how central neural circuits evolve remains poorly understood. Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.

">Toward Granular Brain Intrinsic Connectivity Networks and Insights into Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Spatial group independent component analysis (sgr-ICA) has become a crucial method to understand brain function in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, especially in resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) studies. Early studies identified large-scale brain networks using sgr-ICA with lower order (e.g., 20 - 45 components); however, more recent studies have employed higher model orders (e.g., 200 components) to reveal more refined intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), offering a more detailed representation of functional brain architecture. This increased granularity has encouraged researchers to explore even higher model orders to better capture the brain's function. Although previous studies explored higher model orders, small datasets often limited them. In this study, we addressed this gap by assessing an sgr-ICA model with 500 components using a large rsfMRI dataset of over 100,000 subjects. This extensive data set allowed us to provide a robust estimation of fine-grained ICNs. We further assessed diagnostic effects and cognitive performance using whole-brain functional network connectivity (FNC) of 502 individuals with schizophrenia and 640 typical controls from these ICNs. We also compared the results with ICNs obtained using a lower-order, multi-spatial-scale template. Results demonstrate that our approach yields a large set of reliable and fine grained ICNs, enhancing characterization of schizophrenia related dysconnectivity patterns. Specifically, we observed a relatively large number of ICNs within the cerebellar and paralimbic area. We detected significant hypoconnectivity between the cerebellar and subcortical domains, including the basal ganglia and thalamic regions. We also found hyperconnectivity between the cerebellar domain and the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognitive domains, as well as between the sensorimotor and subcortical domains. Our finding revealed that granular ICNs can detect significant FNC differences between cohorts which are missed in larger scale ICNs. This work highlights the capability of higher model order ICA to capture distinct, fine-grained ICNs, enriching our understanding of FNC and serving as a valuable addition to current multiscale ICN templates. The ICNs derived from this study may serve as valuable references for future research, with the potential to improve the clinical utility of rsfMRI and advance the study of psychiatric disorders.

">Multimodal Evidence for Hippocampal Engagement and Modulation by Functional Connectivity-Guided Parietal TMS</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal activity supports memory and many other brain functions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) guided by hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) shows promise in improving memory, but direct neural evidence of its capacity to engage and modulate hippocampal activity is lacking. Here we combined TMS with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in 8 neurosurgical patients and with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 79 neurologically healthy participants. We identified that (1) single-pulse TMS to individualized parietal cortex guided by hippocampal-FC preferentially evoked distinct temporal and spectral activity patterns in the hippocampus, (2) variability in TMS-evoked hippocampal responses related to individual differences in parietal-hippocampus FC strength, and (3) repetitive TMS to hippocampal-FC-guided parietal cortex selectively suppressed hippocampal theta oscillations. These findings provide multimodal causal neural evidence and important mechanistic insights supporting the development of personalized neuromodulation strategies aimed at improving hippocampus-dependent functions.

">A Numerical Alternative to MR Thermometry for Safety Validation of Multi-Channel RF Transmit Coils</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: This study proposes an alternative approach to MR thermometry (MRT) for the safety validation of multi-channel RF transmit coils and demonstrates its use to enable human studies at 10.5T. Methods: To ensure patient safety, specific absorption rate (SAR) limits established under international guidelines must not be exceeded. Predicting SAR on state-of-the-art parallel transmit systems relies on electromagnetic simulations, which require extensive experimental validation. Despite a well-established validation workflow, SAR prediction errors are unavoidable and must be quantified as a safety margin. While MRT tests are commonly used for this purpose, their technical challenges necessitate an alternative. The proposed technique propagates the error between experimentally and numerically acquired B_1^+ distributions to the uncertainty in simulated peak local SAR using Monte-Carlo simulations without the need for MRT. This method was validated using a 16-channel transceiver coil for imaging the human torso (henceforth referred to as a "body" coil) at 10.5T with two excitation scenarios, as well as an 8-channel 10.5T head coil with four excitation scenarios. Results: The proposed numerical technique proved more conservative than existing MRT-based SAR error quantification methods across all tested scenarios. Its application to validate three state-of-the-art head coils (16Tx/32Rx, 16Tx/80Rx, and 16Tx/128Rx) led to regulatory approval for human head imaging and high-quality functional as well as diffusion MRI results at 10.5T. Conclusion: A numerical alternative to MRT requires only the experimental acquisition of B_1^+ maps for comparison with simulations, enabling the quantification of uncertainty in SAR prediction. This technique was applied to three 16-channel transmit arrays, each used in conjunction with high-channel-count receive arrays for in vivo imaging.

">Geometric Quantum Coherence Protection inFibonacci-Structured Microtubules: A Quantum Solution tothe Cognitive Paradox of Acute HIV-associatedNeuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) presents a fundamental paradox: patients maintain cognitive function during acute infection despite cytokine storms that meet sepsis criteria. Through computational modeling of quantum coherence in neural microtubules during HIV-induced neuroinflammation, we discovered that Fibonacci scaled microtubular architectures maintain quantum coherence up to 104-fold longer than regular structures through geometric optimization. This protection mechanism operates through resonant coupling at the golden ratio ({varphi} = 1.618), achieving 74.4% efficiency in preserving quantum information. Using five complementary computational models validated against recent experimental quantum data, we demonstrate: (1) power law decay (exponent  = -1.015) in Fibonacci structures versus near-exponential collapse ( = -10.102) in regular grids; (2) quantum sanctuary formation at t = 0.6 time units creating coherence-preserving boundaries; (3) precise mathematical optimization at {varphi} = 1.618033988749895; (4) temperature resilience maintaining function during HIV-associated fever; (5) strong correlations with clinical neuroimaging (r = 0.74 - 0.82, p < 0.001). Monte Carlo analysis (n = 50) confirmed the probability 100% of sanctuary formation during acute inflammation above 38.5 C. These findings resolve the cognitive paradox of HAND by revealing how geometric structure enables preservation of quantum information despite extreme perturbation, suggesting novel therapeutic targets and establishing new principles for quantum biology and bioinspired quantum technologies.

">Test-retest reliability of multi-metabolite edited MRS at 3T using PRESS and sLASER</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Spectral editing is the most common MRS approach for noninvasive in vivo measurement of low-concentration, strongly overlapped metabolites in the brain, such as {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutathione (GSH). Multi-metabolite editing methods, including HERMES and HERCULES, have recently been introduced, where multiple J-coupled metabolites can be edited in a single acquisition without increasing total scan time. Yet little is known regarding the reliability of these methods. This study assessed the test-retest reliability of HERMES and HERCULES, where volume localization was achieved using either PRESS or sLASER. Methods: Sixteen healthy adult volunteers were scanned twice in two separate sessions. Single-voxel edited MRS data were acquired in the medial parietal lobe using the following sequences: (1) HERMES-PRESS; (2) HERMES-sLASER; (3) HERCULES-PRESS; (4) HERCULES-sLASER. Spectra were processed and metabolites were quantified using the Osprey software. Data quality metrics and reliability statistics were estimated for all four acquisitions. Results: HERMES-sLASER demonstrated lower within-subjects coefficients of variation (CVws) for GSH, glutamine (Gln), and glutamate (Glu) + Gln (Glx), suggesting improved reliability compared to HERMES-PRESS. However, GABA + co-edited macromolecules (GABA+) and Glu showed higher CVws for HERMES-sLASER. HERCULES-sLASER produced better reliability than HERCULES-PRESS for GABA+, GSH, Glu, Gln, Glx, aspartate (Asp), and lactate (Lac). N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) showed higher CVws for HERCULES-sLASER. These findings suggest that sLASER may be more advantageous than PRESS for volume localization in simultaneous multi-metabolite editing. Conclusion: Using sLASER yielded better test-retest reliability for most metabolites than using PRESS for volume localization for HERMES and HERCULES.

">Increased basal ganglia volume in older adults with tinnitus</a></h4>

              
                Tinnitus is the perception of sounds without external stimuli, affecting 10%-15% of the general population and up to 25% of individuals over 70 years of age. While traditionally viewed as an auditory phenomenon, growing evidence highlights the role of the central nervous system in its pathophysiology. One of the proposed mechanisms, the "gating hypothesis" of tinnitus, suggests an alteration in the modulation of sensory activity by the frontostriatal network. Although structural changes in frontal areas support this idea, gray matter differences in subcortical regions -such as the auditory pathway and basal ganglia- remain poorly understood. Here, we examined subcortical structures and auditory function in older adults with mild presbycusis from the ANDES cohort, including 51 tinnitus patients and 40 age-matched controls. We analyzed brain volume via structural magnetic resonance imaging and subcortical auditory functionality via auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). We found non-significant differences in age, hearing loss, cognitive performance, and ABR amplitudes between the groups. Notably, tinnitus patients presented a significant increase in the volume of basal ganglia structures (striatum and pallidum) but not in auditory areas. These findings reinforce the role of the basal ganglia in age-related tinnitus pathophysiology.

">On the relationship between neuronal heterogeneity and entropy</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal size has often been used to explain the "superiority" of the human brain. By deriving the Shannon entropy of different statistical distributions, we show that the entropy of different distributions is solely accounted for by the variance of the distribution. We use total dendritic length (TDL) of neurons from different species as an example to show that entropy computed from TDL distributions has nothing to do with the absolute size of neurons, but the increased variance seen in the larger neurons.

">Changes in Ocular Fixation Characteristics Over Time during Reading</a></h4>

              
                In this report, we evaluate eye-movements during reading. There is a huge literature on this topic, but our report is not focused on the typical questions raised in this literature and our task design is very atypical for an eye-movement/reading study. While most reading studies evaluate mental processes during reading, the only mental process we evaluate is fatigue. While most reading studies use stimuli presented in the middle of the screen, our poem sections are presented in 24 lines of text that span the top to the bottom of the display. While most multi-line reading studies use a very large interline spacing, our interline spacing is more typical of text reading in newspapers, magazines and books. We report on changes in the characteristics of fixations as a function of time-on-task (TOT).  We determine the start and end of reading for each subject/session and divide this reading time into 10 equal length (number of samples) periods (referred to as epochs). We looked for changes in fixation characteristics across epochs. We emphasize our results for horizontal position because these changes were monotonic and interpretable. For horizontal position signals, we found that the mean intersample distances in fixations increases, the rate of changes of fixation position decreases and the total fixation width increases as a function of epoch. We interpret our results to mean that, as reading progresses, it becomes more difficult to hold the eye still. Early in reading, the total fixation width is lower, the mean intersample distance is lower and there are frequent adjustments (i.e., changes in direction) to keep the eye well focused on the target word. As time progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to hold the eye perfectly steady, so fixations become wider and mean intersample distance increases.

">Adaptive suppression of threat-history stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The present study investigated whether adaptive suppression mechanisms can be applied to stimuli with a history of threat association. In the experiment, a threat-conditioning task was first used to associate one of two colors (green or cyan) with an electric shock, thereby establishing conditions of threat-history and no-threat-history. Subsequently, in a visual search task, 30 participants reported the orientation of the line inside the target diamond while occasionally being either undistracted or distracted by threat-history or no-threat-history distractors, which appeared across various spatial locations. The results showed that distractors appearing at high-probability locations were effectively suppressed, with suppression being stronger for threat-history distractors than for no-threat-history distractors. These findings indicate that threat history may facilitate visual search through an adaptive attentional suppression mechanism.

">Motor Neurons Decode Cholinergic Inputs via Spatially Distinct nAChR Subunits to Drive Locomotion in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits consist of neurons that differ not only in their neurotransmitter identities but also in the types and subcellular localization of neurotransmitter receptors (NRs) they express. This receptor diversity enables distinct responses to the same neurotransmitter, highlighting the need to understand NR distribution and function to fully interpret circuit logic. Here, we focus on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), the primary mediators of fast excitatory transmission in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). Functional nAChRs are pentamers assembled from a pool of 10 subunits (alpha1-alpha7 and beta1-beta3), yet their in vivo expression and function remain poorly defined. We used T2A-Gal4 lines and endogenous protein tagging to examine nAChR expression in larval motor neurons (MNs) and identified eight subunits expressed in these cells. MN-specific knockdown of individual subunits caused distinct locomotor defects, indicating their functional importance. Co-localization analysis revealed some subunit pairs are frequently co-expressed at the same synapses, while others localize to distinct subcellular domains. Supporting this, double knockdown of co-localized subunits did not worsen locomotor phenotypes compared to single knockdowns, whereas knockdown of non-co-localized subunit pairs produced additive defects. These results suggest that different nAChR subtypes are strategically positioned in discrete synaptic domains within single MNs, where they serve non-redundant roles. Our findings provide new insight into the spatial organization and functional diversity of nAChRs in motor circuits that drive locomotion.

">Connectivity Is All You Need: Inferring Neuronal Types with NTAC</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in electron microscopy and computer vision have enabled the mapping of complete wiring diagrams--called connectomes--of brain regions and even entire brains. The emergence of these increasingly large-scale connectomic datasets have intensified the need for efficient and accurate neuronal cell type identification. Traditional approaches rely on labor-intensive analyses of molecular, anatomical, and physiological features. As a step toward fully automated neuronal cell type classification, we present NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity) -- a method for grouping neurons into cell types based solely on synaptic connectivity. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that synaptic connectivity is key to determining neuronal cell types (Seung 2012), and our results provide the strongest evidence to date supporting its validity. NTAC comes in two flavors: a semi-supervised variant that requires some of the neurons to be labeled, and an unsupervised variant that requires no labels at all. The first can be naturally formalized as a learning problem on graphs: given labels for a subset of neurons, use connectivity to label the rest. We present a simple and fast algorithm that achieves over 95% accuracy on the fly's visual system starting with just 2% of neurons labeled, within minutes on a standard PC. In contrast, morphology based parallel achieves lower accuracy even on smaller datasets and with significantly more labels. Formalizing the problem as a fully unsupervised learning task is more challenging. To address this, we introduce a novel computational problem, approximate equitable partitioning, and design an efficient heuristic for it, using the semi-supervised algorithm as a subroutine. Remarkably, the unsupervised method achieves ~70% accuracy on the fly's visual system, drastically outperforming its morphology based parallel and providing concrete evidence that synaptic connectivity alone can reveal cell types. Both variants of NTAC are evaluated on multiple state of the art connectomes including optic lobes, central brain and nerve cord of adult fruit flies.

">Neural and behavioral consequences of bilateral maps in primary somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mice rely heavily on their sophisticated whisker somatosensory system to explore and navigate their surroundings. The primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) receives sensory input through the lemniscal pathway, which exclusively carries signals from the contralateral side of the face due to a complete crossover of axonal projections from the brainstem to the thalamus. This contralateral whisker input organization is disrupted in mice with a conditional knockout of the Robo3 gene (Robo3cKO mice), leading to abnormal bilateral representations of the whiskers in wS1. We investigated the behavioral and neural consequences of these bilateral whisker representations in Robo3cKO mice. Performance on a discrimination task in which mice reported whether a left-side or a right-side whisker was deflected was on par with that of wild-type littermates. Unilateral optogenetic inhibition of wS1 showed that activity in the wS1 contralateral to a stimulated whisker was required for mice to report its side correctly, despite a representation of that whisker in the uninhibited hemisphere. Single-unit recordings in wS1 and the whisker primary motor cortex (wM1), a major downstream target of wS1, showed abnormal bilateral whisker responses in wS1 but largely normal responses in wM1, suggesting that the bilateral responses in wS1 were filtered out along the sensorimotor processing stream. Our results demonstrate that the brain can adapt to fundamental alterations in tactile input to construct accurate sensorimotor representations.

">Melanopsin-mediated signals in natural and human-made environments</a></h4>

              
                Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) play a critical role in regulating physiological and behavioral responses to light. However, little is known about how melanopsin and ipRGC signals are shaped by the statistical properties of real-world environments. Here, we analyzed statistics of melanopsin, ipRGC codification of extrinsic and intrinsic photoresponses, and luminance using hyperspectral images of natural and human-made scenes under daylight illumination. The statistics were obtained simulating receptive fields from current knowledge about ipRGCs anatomy and physiology. Our findings reveal that human-made environments exhibit significantly higher melanopsin, luminance, and ipRGC excitations compared to natural environments. In natural scenes, luminance contrasts were higher than melanopsin and ipRGC contrasts across most of the range. Melanopsin contrast was largely independent of excitation, and was significantly reduced for larger receptive fields. Differences between ipRGC codification models suggest an interaction between input weighting and environmental structure. These results indicate that modifications of natural regularities by human-made environments could affect ipRGC-driven physiology in everyday life.
