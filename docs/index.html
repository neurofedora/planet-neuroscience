              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17206">Energy Consumption Optimization, Response Time Differences and Indicators in Cortical Working Memory Revealed by Nonequilibrium</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neocortex, a complex system driving multi-region interactions, remains a core puzzle in neuroscience. Despite quantitative insights across brain scales, understanding the mechanisms underlying neural activities is challenging. Advances from Hopfield networks to large-scale cortical models have deepened neural network theory, yet these models often fall short of capturing global brain functions. In large-scale cortical networks, an intriguing hierarchy of timescales reflects diverse information processing speeds across spatial regions. As a non-equilibrium system, the brain incurs significant energy costs, with long-distance connectivity suggesting an evolutionary spatial organization. To explore these complexities, we introduce a nonequilibrium landscape flux approach to analyze cortical networks. This allows us to quantify potential landscapes and principal transition paths, uncovering dynamical characteristics across timescales. We examine whether temporal hierarchies correlate with stimuli distribution and how hierarchical networks exhibit differential responses. Furthermore, our analysis quantifies the thermodynamic cost of sustaining cognition, highlighting a link to network connectivity. These findings provide insights into energy consumption during cognitive processes and emphasize the spatial benefits for working memory tasks. Experimental validation is challenging due to evolutionary variability, making our theoretical approach valuable for quantifying complex dynamics. By assessing time irreversibility and critical slowdown, we gain predictive insights into network bifurcations and state transitions, offering practical tools for identifying cortical state changes. These results advance our understanding of cortical dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17692">Quantifying information stored in synaptic connections rather than in firing patterns of neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cornerstone of our understanding of both biological and artificial neural networks is that they store information in the strengths of connections among the constituent neurons. However, in contrast to the well-established theory for quantifying information encoded by the firing patterns of neural networks, little is known about quantifying information encoded by its synaptic connections. Here, we develop a theoretical framework using continuous Hopfield networks as an exemplar for associative neural networks, and data that follow mixtures of broadly applicable multivariate log-normal distributions. Specifically, we analytically derive the Shannon mutual information between the data and singletons, pairs, triplets, quadruplets, and arbitrary n-tuples of synaptic connections within the network. Our framework corroborates well-established insights about storage capacity of, and distributed coding by, neural firing patterns. Strikingly, it discovers synergistic interactions among synapses, revealing that the information encoded jointly by all the synapses exceeds the 'sum of its parts'. Taken together, this study introduces an interpretable framework for quantitatively understanding information storage in neural networks, one that illustrates the duality of synaptic connectivity and neural population activity in learning and memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09614">Exploring Behavior-Relevant and Disentangled Neural Dynamics with Generative Diffusion Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.09614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.

Abstract: In 2023, Lubineau et al. published an article [1] detailing several experiments carried out with dyslexic readers. These authors attempted to measure the change in reading performance under different reading conditions using flickering devices. Beyond the low-frequency systems which have nevertheless shown their interest for some cases, we restrict here our response to the high-frequency systems, i.e. electronically controlled glasses (Lexilens) and lamps, designed and built upon recent work by Le Floch and Ropars [2]. Lubineau et al. found no significant change in reading performance at either low or high frequencies and concluded that these devices provide no or minor benefits. Unfortunately, experimental misunderstandings and some methodological issues invalidate namely the main conclusion concerning the high frequency systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17485">Storing overlapping associative memories on latent manifolds in low-rank spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associative memory architectures such as the Hopfield network have long been important conceptual and theoretical models for neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, translating these abstract models into spiking neural networks has been surprisingly difficult. Indeed, much previous work has been restricted to storing a small number of primarily non-overlapping memories in large networks, thereby limiting their scalability. Here, we revisit the associative memory problem in light of recent advances in understanding spike-based computation. Using a recently-established geometric framework, we show that the spiking activity for a large class of all-inhibitory networks is situated on a low-dimensional, convex, and piecewise-linear manifold, with dynamics that move along the manifold. We then map the associative memory problem onto these dynamics, and demonstrate how the vertices of a hypercubic manifold can be used to store stable, overlapping activity patterns with a direct correspondence to the original Hopfield model. We propose several learning rules, and demonstrate a linear scaling of the storage capacity with the number of neurons, as well as robust pattern completion abilities. Overall, this work serves as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a geometrical perspective to design dynamics on neural manifolds, with implications for neuroscience and machine learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13018">Getting aligned on representational alignment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.13018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological and artificial information processing systems form representations of the world that they can use to categorize, reason, plan, navigate, and make decisions. How can we measure the similarity between the representations formed by these diverse systems? Do similarities in representations then translate into similar behavior? If so, then how can a system's representations be modified to better match those of another system? These questions pertaining to the study of representational alignment are at the heart of some of the most promising research areas in contemporary cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. In this Perspective, we survey the exciting recent developments in representational alignment research in the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. Despite their overlapping interests, there is limited knowledge transfer between these fields, so work in one field ends up duplicated in another, and useful innovations are not shared effectively. To improve communication, we propose a unifying framework that can serve as a common language for research on representational alignment, and map several streams of existing work across fields within our framework. We also lay out open problems in representational alignment where progress can benefit all three of these fields. We hope that this paper will catalyze cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress for all communities studying and developing information processing systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16695">Recurrent Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with Recurrent Forward Propagation Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional computer vision models rely on very deep, feedforward networks processing whole images and trained offline with extensive labeled data. In contrast, biological vision relies on comparatively shallow, recurrent networks that analyze sequences of fixated image patches, learning continuously in real-time without explicit supervision. This work introduces a vision network inspired by these biological principles. Specifically, it leverages a joint embedding predictive architecture incorporating recurrent gated circuits. The network learns by predicting the representation of the next image patch (fixation) based on the sequence of past fixations, a form of self-supervised learning. We show mathematical and empirically that the training algorithm avoids the problem of representational collapse. We also introduce \emph{Recurrent-Forward Propagation}, a learning algorithm that avoids biologically unrealistic backpropagation through time or memory-inefficient real-time recurrent learning. We show mathematically that the algorithm implements exact gradient descent for a large class of recurrent architectures, and confirm empirically that it learns efficiently. This paper focuses on these theoretical innovations and leaves empirical evaluation of performance in downstream tasks, and analysis of representational similarity with biological vision for future work.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16711">TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their bio-inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons inherently capture temporal information. This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.

                arXiv:2411.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness,the impartial treatment towards individuals or groups regardless of their inherent or acquired characteristics [20], is a critical challenge for the successful implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in multiple fields like finances, human capital, and housing. A major struggle for the development of fair AI models lies in the bias implicit in the data available to train such models. Filtering or sampling the dataset before training can help ameliorate model bias but can also reduce model performance and the bias impact can be opaque. In this paper, we propose a method for visualizing the biases inherent in a dataset and understanding the potential trade-offs between fairness and accuracy. Our method builds on quality-diversity optimization, in particular Covariance Matrix Adaptation Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites). Our method provides a visual representation of bias in models, allows users to identify models within a minimal threshold of fairness, and determines the trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17339">Knowledge-aware Evolutionary Graph Neural Architecture Search</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural architecture search (GNAS) can customize high-performance graph neural network architectures for specific graph tasks or datasets. However, existing GNAS methods begin searching for architectures from a zero-knowledge state, ignoring the prior knowledge that may improve the search efficiency. The available knowledge base (e.g. NAS-Bench-Graph) contains many rich architectures and their multiple performance metrics, such as the accuracy (#Acc) and number of parameters (#Params). This study proposes exploiting such prior knowledge to accelerate the multi-objective evolutionary search on a new graph dataset, named knowledge-aware evolutionary GNAS (KEGNAS). KEGNAS employs the knowledge base to train a knowledge model and a deep multi-output Gaussian process (DMOGP) in one go, which generates and evaluates transfer architectures in only a few GPU seconds. The knowledge model first establishes a dataset-to-architecture mapping, which can quickly generate candidate transfer architectures for a new dataset. Subsequently, the DMOGP with architecture and dataset encodings is designed to predict multiple performance metrics for candidate transfer architectures on the new dataset. According to the predicted metrics, non-dominated candidate transfer architectures are selected to warm-start the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for optimizing the #Acc and #Params on a new dataset. Empirical studies on NAS-Bench-Graph and five real-world datasets show that KEGNAS swiftly generates top-performance architectures, achieving 4.27% higher accuracy than advanced evolutionary baselines and 11.54% higher accuracy than advanced differentiable baselines. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate that the use of prior knowledge significantly improves the search performance.

                arXiv:2411.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Noise Adaptor, a novel method for constructing competitive low-latency spiking neural networks (SNNs) by converting noise-injected, low-bit artificial neural networks (ANNs). This approach builds on existing ANN-to-SNN conversion techniques but offers several key improvements: (1) By injecting noise during quantized ANN training, Noise Adaptor better accounts for the dynamic differences between ANNs and SNNs, significantly enhancing SNN accuracy. (2) Unlike previous methods, Noise Adaptor does not require the application of run-time noise correction techniques in SNNs, thereby avoiding modifications to the spiking neuron model and control flow during inference. (3) Our method extends the capability of handling deeper architectures, achieving successful conversions of activation-quantized ResNet-101 and ResNet-152 to SNNs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, achieving competitive performance. The code will be made available as open-source.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired alternative to conventional artificial neural networks, with potential advantages in power efficiency due to their event-driven computation. Despite their promise, SNNs have yet to achieve competitive performance on complex visual tasks, such as image classification. This study introduces a novel SNN architecture designed to enhance computational efficacy and task accuracy. The architecture features optimized pulse modules that facilitate the processing of spatio-temporal patterns in visual data, aiming to reconcile the computational demands of high-level vision tasks with the energy-efficient processing of SNNs. Our evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate that the proposed architecture narrows the performance gap with traditional neural networks, providing insights into the design of more efficient and capable neuromorphic computing systems.

                arXiv:2411.16737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach that has gained attention for its potential to enable collaborative model training across clients while protecting data privacy, making it an attractive solution for the chemical industry. This work aims to provide the chemical engineering community with an accessible introduction to the discipline. Supported by a hands-on tutorial and a comprehensive collection of examples, it explores the application of FL in tasks such as manufacturing optimization, multimodal data integration, and drug discovery while addressing the unique challenges of protecting proprietary information and managing distributed datasets. The tutorial was built using key frameworks such as $\texttt{Flower}$ and $\texttt{TensorFlow Federated}$ and was designed to provide chemical engineers with the right tools to adopt FL in their specific needs. We compare the performance of FL against centralized learning across three different datasets relevant to chemical engineering applications, demonstrating that FL will often maintain or improve classification performance, particularly for complex and heterogeneous data. We conclude with an outlook on the open challenges in federated learning to be tackled and current approaches designed to remediate and improve this framework.

                arXiv:2411.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.

                arXiv:2411.17567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward gradient descent (FGD) has been proposed as a biologically more plausible alternative of gradient descent as it can be computed without backward pass. Considering the linear model with $d$ parameters, previous work has found that the prediction error of FGD is, however, by a factor $d$ slower than the prediction error of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this paper we show that by computing $\ell$ FGD steps based on each training sample, this suboptimality factor becomes $d/(\ell \wedge d)$ and thus the suboptimality of the rate disappears if $\ell \gtrsim d.$ We also show that FGD with repeated sampling can adapt to low-dimensional structure in the input distribution. The main mathematical challenge lies in controlling the dependencies arising from the repeated sampling process.

                arXiv:2409.19764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spike-based Transformer presents a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Transformers, achieving impressive results through sparse binary computations. However, existing spike-based transformers predominantly focus on spatial attention while neglecting crucial temporal dependencies inherent in spike-based processing, leading to suboptimal feature representation and limited performance. To address this limitation, we propose Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture that efficiently integrates both spatial and temporal information in the self-attention mechanism. STAtten introduces a block-wise computation strategy that processes information in spatial-temporal chunks, enabling comprehensive feature capture while maintaining the same computational complexity as previous spatial-only approaches. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing spike-based transformers without architectural overhaul. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAtten significantly improves the performance of existing spike-based transformers across both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101.

                <p>The growing field of social neuroscience is reliant on the development of robust, ecologically valid paradigms for simulating social interaction and measuring social cognition in highly controlled laboratory settings. Perspective taking is a key component of social cognition, and accordingly several paradigms aimed at measuring perspective taking exist. A relatively novel paradigm is the ball detection task, in which participants and a virtual agent form independent beliefs about the presence of a target stimulus behind an occluder. Previous studies have shown that incongruent trials (in which the participant's and the agent's beliefs differ) affect participant reaction times and elicit increased neural activity in the so-called mentalizing network. This paradigm has important advantages over previous ones, in that experimental conditions can be fully randomized, and ceiling effects are not found even for adult populations. Here, we combined this paradigm with a stress induction and a nonstressful control task. In an online study, we found no evidence of perspective taking at the behavioral level. Combining the task with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found no evidence of perspective taking at the behavioral or neural level, even for the control condition. While this paradigm is reliable on its own, implementing it in the context of a task-switching paradigm appears to reduce participants&rsquo; focus on task-irrelevant perspective taking elements. Our findings highlight the fragility of existing social cognition paradigms and the need for reliable, simple, and ecologically valid measures of perspective taking.</p>

                <p>Fear generalization is a hallmark of anxiety disorders. Experimentally, fear generalization can be difficult to dissociate from its counterpart, fear discrimination. Here, we use minimal threat learning procedures to reveal such a dissociation. We show that in Long&ndash;Evans rats, an auditory threat cue predicting footshock on 10% of trials produces a discriminated fear response that does not generalize to a neutral auditory cue. In contrast, even slightly higher footshock probabilities (30 and 20%) produce fear generalization. AAV-mediated, caspase-3 deletion of ventral pallidum neurons abolishes fear generalization and reduces threat cue responding during extinction. The ventral pallidum's contribution to fear generalization and extinction threat responding does not depend on inputs from the nucleus accumbens. The results demonstrate a minimal threat learning approach to dissociate fear discrimination from fear generalization and a novel role for the ventral pallidum in generalizing and expressing fear.</p>

                <p>The cortico-basal ganglia loop has traditionally been conceptualized as consisting of three distinct information networks: motor, limbic, and associative. However, this three-loop concept is insufficient to comprehensively explain the diverse functions of the cortico-basal ganglia system, as emerging evidence suggests its involvement in sensory processing, including the auditory systems. In the present study, we demonstrate the auditory cortico-basal ganglia loop by using transgenic mice and viral-assisted labelings. The caudal part of the external globus pallidus (GPe) emerged as a major output nucleus of the auditory cortico-basal ganglia loop with the cortico-striato-pallidal projections as its input pathway and pallido-cortical and pallido&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical projections as its output pathway. GABAergic neurons in the caudal GPe dominantly innervated the nonlemniscal auditory pathway. They also projected to various regions, including the substantia nigra pars lateralis, cuneiform nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. Considering the functions associated with these GPe-projecting regions, auditory cortico-basal ganglia circuits may play a pivotal role in eliciting defensive behaviors against acoustic stimuli.</p>

                <p>Aggression and mating of male mice are strongly associated with Esr1-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTpr) and hypothalamus in the vomeronasal pathway. By projecting to the downstream hypothalamus, the upstream BNSTpr<sup>Esr1</sup> gates mating and aggression of male mice and maternal behavior of female mice. The medial preoptic area (MPOA) and ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) are two subdivisions of the hypothalamus downstream. In addition to receiving projections from upstream BNSTpr, there is also a mutual projection between MPOA and VMHvl. In the process of transforming sex information into mating and aggression, Esr1-expressing neurons in BNSTpr, MPOA, and VMHvl act as messengers of information, finally producing inhibitory or excitatory projection. These projections are different in direction, but they all work together to control the behavior selection that is most conducive to defense and reproduction when male mice encounter female or male mice. Here, we summarized the property and the function of connections between these Esr1-expressing neurons in BNSTpr, MPOA, and VMHvl that encode mating and aggression and highlight the importance and benefits of inhibitory projection of Esr1-expressing cells in mating and aggression.</p>

Chronic inhibition of estrogen synthesis is used in adjuvant breast cancer therapy for estrogen receptor-positive tumors and may have been associated with cognitive and affective side effects. Here, we have developed a model of adjuvant therapy in female ovariectomized mice in which the E2 biosynthetic enzyme aromatase is inhibited by letrozole (1&nbsp;mg/kg/day, i.p., for up to 3&nbsp;weeks), Using two-photon longitudinal in vivo imaging in Thy1-GFP-M mice, we found that spine density in the apical dendrites of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal cells was unaffected by letrozole treatment but spine turnover was reduced. LTP in layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapses in the somatosensory cortex was also reduced in slices from letrozole-treated mice, showing deficits in structural and functional plasticity resulting from aromatase inhibition. Ovariectomized mice performed worse than intact control mice in the novel object recognition test but, surprisingly, letrozole treatment rescued this deficit.</p>

                <p>Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is marked by enlarged cerebral ventricles with normal intracranial pressure, plus three stereotypical symptoms: gait impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary frequency with urge incontinence. The neural circuit dysfunction responsible for each of these symptoms remains unknown, and an adult mouse model would expand opportunities to explore these mechanisms in preclinical experiments. Here, we describe the first mouse model of chronic, communicating hydrocephalus with normal intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalic male and female mice had unsteady gait and reduced maximum velocity. Despite performing well on a variety of behavioral tests, they exhibited subtle learning impairments. Hydrocephalic mice also developed urinary frequency, and many became incontinent. This mouse model, with symptoms resembling human NPH, can be combined with molecular-genetic tools in any mouse strain to explore the neural circuit mechanisms of these symptoms. Preclinical work using this hydrocephalus model will lead to the development of new treatments for NPH symptoms.</p>

                <p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method that modulates brain activity by inducing electric fields in the brain. Real-time, state-dependent stimulation with TMS has shown that neural oscillation phase modulates corticospinal excitability. However, such motor evoked potentials (MEPs) only indirectly reflect motor cortex activation and are unavailable at other brain regions of interest. The direct and secondary cortical effects of phase-dependent brain stimulation remain an open question. In this study, we recorded the cortical responses during single-pulse TMS using electroencephalography (EEG) concurrently with the MEP measurements in 20 healthy human volunteers (11 female). TMS was delivered at peak, rising, trough, and falling phases of mu (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) and beta (14&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) oscillations in the motor cortex. The cortical responses were quantified through TMS evoked potential components N15, P50, and N100 as peak-to-peak amplitudes (P50-N15 and P50-N100). We further analyzed whether the prestimulus frequency band power was predictive of the cortical responses. We demonstrated that phase-specific targeting modulates cortical responses. The phase relationship between cortical responses was different for early and late responses. In addition, pre-TMS mu oscillatory power and phase significantly predicted both early and late cortical EEG responses in mu-specific targeting, indicating the independent causal effects of phase and power. However, only pre-TMS beta power significantly predicted the early and late TEP components during beta-specific targeting. Further analyses indicated distinct roles of mu and beta power on cortical responses. These findings provide insight to mechanistic understanding of neural oscillation states in cortical and corticospinal activation in humans.</p>

                Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant global health challenge particularly in developing countries and regions. Gezira State, Sudan where prevalence and disease burden are high is an example of such regions. This study aimed to quantify HBV viral load among patients in Gezira State and assess the distribution of viral loads across demographic groups, including gender and age. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2022 and January 2023. Randomly selected 100 chronic HBV patients were enrolled from major healthcare facilities in Wad Medani, Gezira’s capital. Viral loads were measured using real-time PCR, and statistical analyses were performed to identify predictors of high viral load. Results The results revealed that the mean HBV viral load was 886,363 IU/ml (SD± 421,295), with a significantly higher mean in males (1,122,899 IU/ml) compared to females (531,559 IU/ml) (p< 0.0001). Viral loads ranged from 15 IU/ml to 35,474,488 IU/ml, with 37% of patients exceeding the WHO-recommended treatment threshold of 2,000 IU/ml. However, no significant association was found between viral load and age (p=0.939). Conclusion The study highlighted the need for gender-specific management strategies and the importance of HBV viral load quantification for effective public health intervention in Gezira State. Further research is recommended to explore HBV epidemiology in Sudan more comprehensively.

                Background Removal of the microbial deposits (plaque and calculus) by performing effective scaling and root planing (SRP) is the fundamental step for managing periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). Various adjuncts in the form of mouthwash, gels, and toothpaste are also being used as adjuncts to SRP for managing periodontitis. Recently, Lycium barbarum (L. barbarum), commonly known as goji berry or wolfberry, has gained popularity for managing chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, its efficacy in managing periodontitis has never been explored. Hence the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of goji berry mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash for managing periodontitis. Methods 60 adult participants were divided randomly using computer-generated random sequences into two groups (case group: L. barbarum mouthwash (Males: 16; Female: 14); control group: 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (Males: 14; Females: 16)). The changes in the gingival index (Gi), plaque index (Pi), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), microbial load, and antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were noted at the baseline, at 15 days and one month. Results A significant reduction in the mean PPD, Pi, BOP, and Gi was seen from baseline to one month in both the control (P-value=0.006, 0.027, 0.000, and 0.036 respectively) and test groups (P-value=0.035, 0.000, 0.034, and 0.000 respectively). However, the antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were significantly increased only in the test group. Conclusion Goji berry mouthwash along with SRP reduced the Gi, Pi, BOP, and PPD in patients with periodontitis. However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the use of goji berry and chlorhexidine mouthwash. Goji berry mouthwash was more effective than chlorhexidine in increasing the antioxidant levels in saliva.

                Background The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the prevalence of heavy metal contamination in fish, fruits, and vegetables in Southwest Nigeria. The review focused on studies published over a ten-year period, between 2014 and 2024. Methods Articles used for the study were obtained by conducting a comprehensive literature search using several databases, including ResearchGate, Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PubMed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). To identify relevant studies, a plethora of keywords were utilized to search for articles in the selected databases, including. Articles reporting heavy metal contamination in specified food products within the last decade were included. Results Of the 10,212 initially identified articles, 64 met the inclusion criteria after thorough screening. The selected studies were predominantly conducted in Lagos (30), Ondo (8), and Ogun (7) states, with few studies in Oyo, Ekiti, and Osun states. The majority of the research focused on fish (40 studies), followed by vegetables (20) and fruits (4). The commonly studied fish species were observed to be Tilapia zilli, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, Clarias gariepinus, and Oreochromis niloticus, with heavy metal concentrations frequently exceeded WHO limits. Conclusions Therefore, this review highlights the significant risks posed by the presence of heavy metals in food products and underscores the importance of stringent environmental monitoring and the adoption of appropriate regulatory mechanisms for health and environmental risk mitigation. This could help in the formulation of appropriate policy implementation strategies geared towards mitigating heavy metal contamination in the region’s food supply.

                The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE, emerged a little over 10 years ago as a way to represent individuals working in the research community but focusing on software development. The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of foundational competencies as well as values that outline the general profile of an RSE. Further research and training can build upon this foundation of skills and focus on various aspects in greater detail. We expect that graduates and practitioners will have a larger and more diverse set of skills than outlined here. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions. We look at specific types of RSE roles, propose recommendations for organisations, give examples of future specialisations, and detail how existing curricula fit into this framework.

                This study aims to evaluate the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP) by examining both overall efficiency improvements and identifying critical success factors for effective implementation. Through a systematic literature review, the research investigates how BDA enhances real-time decision-making within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the key enablers required for successful BDA adoption. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs’ efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

                Abstract Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods A comprehensive scoping review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies from 2017 to 2024. Primary, English-language clinical trial involving pediatric patients were included without restrictions on surgical procedure, or outcomes. Data extraction was focused on sample sizes, PCL types, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 10 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies indicated metabolic benefits, with 7 out of 11 showing stabilized blood glucose and reduced hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, 5 studies associated PCL with reduced preoperative anxiety, agitation, and discomfort, including thirst and hunger. For stomach content, 5 studies showed PCL reduced gastric residual volume and improved pH. Postoperative findings were mixed: 4 studies found no significant difference in nausea and vomiting, while 2 suggested benefits. Length of hospital stay from 3 studies showed no clinical difference results. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery shows potential to stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and improve recovery. However, the evidence regarding outcomes such as length of hospital stay and postoperative complications remains inconsistent, indicating the need for further investigation.

                Background Algeria has made significant progress in addressing childhood undernutrition. Despite improvements, nearly 12% of Algerian children under five years of age suffered from stunting in 2022. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of three indicators of undernutrition (stunting, wasting, and underweight) and their associated variables in children aged 0–23 months in Algeria between 2013 and 2019. Methods Pooled data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) (2012-13 and 2018-19) covering 14,498 children were used. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to test the associations. Results Stunting decreased significantly, but wasting and being underweight showed no significant reductions from 2013 to 2019. Stunting, wasting, and underweight decreased by 2.2%, 1.3%, and 0.3%, respectively, with an overall prevalence of 10.1%, 5.4%, and 3.6%, respectively. Factors associated with undernutrition included child age and small size at birth, whereas stunting was linked to the poorest households, male children, higher maternal body mass index (BMI), and low antenatal care (ANC) visits. Wasting was associated with younger age and paternal age, fewer maternal ANC visits, underweight male sex, low maternal education, high maternal BMI, and delayed breastfeeding initiation. Conclusion Public health experts and stakeholders must adopt a comprehensive community-centered approach to achieve long-term improvements in child nutrition in Algeria. This strategy should focus on key factors including high maternal BMI, low maternal education, male children, and infrequent ANC visits. This action can help Algeria progress towards achieving the UN’s goal of eradicating malnutrition.

Plant-associated microbiota affect pant growth and development by regulating plant hormones homeostasis. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a well-known plant hormone, can be produced by various plant-associated bacteria. However, the prevalence of bacteria with the capacity to degrade IAA in the rhizosphere has not been systematically studied. In this study, we analyzed the IAA degradation capabilities of bacterial isolates from the roots of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice. Using genomics analysis and in vitro assays, we found that 21 out of 183 taxonomically diverse bacterial isolates possess the ability to degrade IAA. Through comparative genomics and transcriptomic assays, we identified iac-like or iad-like operon in the genomes of these IAA degraders. Additionally, the putative regulator of the operon was found to be highly conserved among these strains through protein structure similarity analysis. Some of the IAA degraders could utilize IAA as their carbon and energy source. In planta, most of the IAA degrading strains mitigated <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice seedling root growth inhibition (RGI) triggered by exogenous IAA. Moreover, RGI caused by complex synthetic bacterial community can be alleviated by introducing IAA degraders. Importantly, we observed increased colonization preference of IAA degraders from soil to root according to the frequency of the biomarker genes in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) collected from different habitats, suggesting that there is a close association between IAA degraders and IAA producers. In summary, our findings further the understanding of the functional diversity and potential biological roles of plant-associated bacteria in host plant root morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002892">Cilia structure and intraflagellar transport differentially regulate sensory response dynamics within and between C. elegans chemosensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alison Philbrook, Michael P. O’Donnell, Laura Grunenkovaite, Piali Sengupta</p>

Sensory neurons contain morphologically diverse primary cilia that are built by intraflagellar transport (IFT) and house sensory signaling molecules. Since both ciliary structural and signaling proteins are trafficked via IFT, it has been challenging to decouple the contributions of IFT and cilia structure to neuronal responses. By acutely inhibiting IFT without altering cilia structure and vice versa, here we describe the differential roles of ciliary trafficking and sensory ending morphology in shaping chemosensory responses in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that a minimum cilium length but not continuous IFT is necessary for a subset of responses in the ASH nociceptive neurons. In contrast, neither cilia nor continuous IFT are necessary for odorant responses in the AWA olfactory neurons. Instead, continuous IFT differentially modulates response dynamics in AWA. Upon acute inhibition of IFT, cilia-destined odorant receptors are shunted to ectopic branches emanating from the AWA cilia base. Spatial segregation of receptors in these branches from a cilia-restricted regulatory kinase results in odorant desensitization defects, highlighting the importance of precise organization of signaling molecules at sensory endings in regulating response dynamics. We also find that adaptation of AWA responses upon repeated exposure to an odorant is mediated by IFT-driven removal of its cognate receptor, whereas adaptation to a second odorant is regulated via IFT-independent mechanisms. Our results reveal unexpected complexity in the contribution of IFT and cilia organization to the regulation of responses even within a single chemosensory neuron type and establish a critical role for these processes in the precise modulation of olfactory behaviors.

                <p>by Timo Ullrich, Olga Klimenkova, Christoph Pollmann, Asma Lasram, Valeriia Hatskovska, Kateryna Maksymenko, Matej Milijaš-Jotić, Lukas Schenk, Claudia Lengerke, Marcus D. Hartmann, Jacob Piehler, Julia Skokowa, Mohammad ElGamacy</p>

Excessive cytokine signaling resulting from dysregulation of a cytokine or its receptor can be a main driver of cancer, autoimmune, or hematopoietic disorders. Here, we leverage protein design to create tailored cytokine receptor blockers with idealized properties. Specifically, we aimed to tackle the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), a mediator of different types of leukemia and autoinflammatory diseases. By modifying designed G-CSFR binders, we engineered hyper-stable proteins that function as nanomolar signaling antagonists. X-ray crystallography showed atomic-level agreement with the experimental structure of an exemplary design. Furthermore, the most potent design blocks G-CSFR in acute myeloid leukemia cells and primary human hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, the resulting designs can be used for inhibiting or homing to G-CSFR-expressing cells. Our results also demonstrate that similarly designed cytokine mimics can be used to derive antagonists to tackle other type I cytokine receptors.

                <p>by Vanessa A. D. Wilson, Sebastian Sauppe, Sarah Brocard, Erik Ringen, Moritz M. Daum, Stephanie Wermelinger, Nianlong Gu, Caroline Andrews, Arrate Isasi-Isasmendi, Balthasar Bickel, Klaus Zuberbühler</p>

Human language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, however, decomposing events into causally linked agent–patient roles, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent–patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent–patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent–patient relations and attended mostly to background information. These findings raise the possibility that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, has evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1427/v1?src=rss">The Hidden Toll: Investigating the influence of Corruption on Persistent Suicide in the Americas [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Corruption, a multifaceted governance issue, impacts public well-being globally. The recent trends reveal a rise in suicide rates across the Americas, while all other regions show declines over twenty years of time. This study investigates corruption’s effect on suicide in 26 American countries, considering moderating factors of unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Methods This study analysed latest two decades of available data, using stepwise panel regression method to investigate the effects of corruption and economic variables on suicide across income levels. Data were sourced from Transparency International, World Bank and the World Health Organization. Initially, unit root tests and CUSUM plots were used to ensure the stability and stationarity of the dataset, and model specification were validated through F test, LM test and Hausman test to select the ideal econometric model - POLS, REM, or FEM for the study. Results A strong suicide rate persistence revealed, particularly in high-income countries, where the lagged suicide variable showed a coefficient of 0.8063 (p < 0.001). Corruption significantly impacted suicide rates in upper-middle-income countries (coefficient = -0.0268, p < 0.05), with higher corruption perceptions scores correlating with lower suicide rates. Additionally, unemployment acted as a significant moderator, intensifying the corruption’s adverse impact on suicide with a coefficient of 0.0022 (p < 0.001) in upper-middle income nations. Economic growth demonstrated a minor protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, with an interaction coefficient of -0.0005 (p < 0.1), suggesting slight suicide reduction linked to economic stability. Conclusion This study found that corruption, unemployment, and economic growth significantly influence suicide rates across the Americas. Corruption exacerbates suicide risks in upper-middle-income countries, while unemployment amplifies this effect. Economic growth offers a slight protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, suggesting that economic stability may help mitigate suicide rates.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1426/v1?src=rss">The effects of teaching strategies on learning to think critically in primary and secondary schools: an overview of systematic reviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background We conducted an overview of systematic reviews about the effects of teaching strategies that can be used to teach primary and secondary school students to think critically. Our objective was to inform decisions about what teaching strategies to use in resources that we developed to teach critical thinking about health in secondary schools. Methods We mapped characteristics of systematic reviews of teaching strategies and summarised findings from the most relevant reviews to teaching students to think critically about health. We included reviews that assessed the effects of teaching strategies that could potentially be used in primary or secondary schools to teach students to think critically, had a Methods section with explicit selection criteria, reported at least one outcome measure of the ability to undertake one of four basic types of cognitive tasks (memory, procedural, comprehension, or opinion), and were published after 1999. Results We included 326 systematic reviews. The reviews evaluated a wide range of teaching strategies for a variety of purposes. Important limitations of the reviews included not considering adverse effects (99% of the reviews), not assessing the risk of bias for included studies (93% of the reviews), and not assessing the credibility of subgroup effects (100% of the reviews). We summarised the findings for 37 teaching strategies that we considered most relevant. The certainty of the evidence of the effects varied from very low to moderate. We used 12 of the strategies in resources that we developed to teach secondary students to think critically about health. Conclusions A tremendous amount of work has gone into evaluating the effects of a wide range of teaching strategies. The results of this research can inform decisions about how to teach critical thinking and future research. However, well-designed, up-to-date systematic reviews are still needed for many teaching strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88024">ARID1A governs the silencing of sex-linked transcription during male meiosis in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                We present evidence implicating the BAF (BRG1/BRM Associated Factor) chromatin remodeler in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). By immunofluorescence (IF), the putative BAF DNA binding subunit, ARID1A (AT-rich Interaction Domain 1 a), appeared enriched on the male sex chromosomes during diplonema of meiosis I. Germ cells showing a Cre-induced loss of ARID1A arrested in pachynema and failed to repress sex-linked genes, indicating a defective MSCI. Mutant sex chromosomes displayed an abnormal presence of elongating RNA polymerase II coupled with an overall increase in chromatin accessibility detectable by ATAC-seq. We identified a role for ARID1A in promoting the preferential enrichment of the histone variant, H3.3, on the sex chromosomes, a known hallmark of MSCI. Without ARID1A, the sex chromosomes appeared depleted of H3.3 at levels resembling autosomes. Higher resolution analyses by CUT&RUN revealed shifts in sex-linked H3.3 associations from discrete intergenic sites and broader gene-body domains to promoters in response to the loss of ARID1A. Several sex-linked sites displayed ectopic H3.3 occupancy that did not co-localize with DMC1 (DNA meiotic recombinase 1). This observation suggests a requirement for ARID1A in DMC1 localization to the asynapsed sex chromatids. We conclude that ARID1A-directed H3.3 localization influences meiotic sex chromosome gene regulation and DNA repair.

                Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases (i.e. lysins) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five <span class="underline">p</span>eptidoglycan <span class="underline">h</span>ydrolases from the <i><span class="underline">A</span>cinetobacter <span class="underline">b</span>aumannii</i> proteome (PHAb7-PHAb11) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs.

                The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key site where fear learning takes place through synaptic plasticity. Rodent research shows prominent low theta (~3–6 Hz), high theta (~6–12 Hz), and gamma (&gt;30 Hz) rhythms in the BLA local field potential recordings. However, it is not understood what role these rhythms play in supporting the plasticity. Here, we create a biophysically detailed model of the BLA circuit to show that several classes of interneurons (PV, SOM, and VIP) in the BLA can be critically involved in producing the rhythms; these rhythms promote the formation of a dedicated fear circuit shaped through spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Each class of interneurons is necessary for the plasticity. We find that the low theta rhythm is a biomarker of successful fear conditioning. The model makes use of interneurons commonly found in the cortex and, hence, may apply to a wide variety of associative learning situations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94587">Heterozygote advantage can explain the extraordinary diversity of immune genes</a></h4>

              
                The majority of highly polymorphic genes are related to immune functions and with over 100 alleles within a population, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most polymorphic loci in vertebrates. How such extraordinary polymorphism arose and is maintained is controversial. One possibility is heterozygote advantage (HA), which can in principle maintain any number of alleles, but biologically explicit models based on this mechanism have so far failed to reliably predict the coexistence of significantly more than ten alleles. We here present an eco-evolutionary model showing that evolution can result in the emergence and maintenance of more than 100 alleles under HA if the following two assumptions are fulfilled: first, pathogens are lethal in the absence of an appropriate immune defence; second, the effect of pathogens depends on host condition, with hosts in poorer condition being affected more strongly. Thus, our results show that HA can be a more potent force in explaining the extraordinary polymorphism found at MHC loci than currently recognized.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96025">High-throughput expansion microscopy enables scalable super-resolution imaging</a></h4>

              
                Expansion microscopy (ExM) enables nanoscale imaging using a standard confocal microscope through the physical, isotropic expansion of fixed immunolabeled specimens. ExM is widely employed to image proteins, nucleic acids, and lipid membranes in single cells; however, current methods limit the number of samples that can be processed simultaneously. We developed High-throughput Expansion Microscopy (HiExM), a robust platform that enables expansion microscopy of cells cultured in a standard 96-well plate. Our method enables ~4.2 x expansion of cells within individual wells, across multiple wells, and between plates. We also demonstrate that HiExM can be combined with high-throughput confocal imaging platforms to greatly improve the ease and scalability of image acquisition. As an example, we analyzed the effects of doxorubicin, a known cardiotoxic agent, on human cardiomyocytes (CMs) as measured by the Hoechst signal across the nucleus. We show a dose-dependent effect on nuclear DNA that is not observed in unexpanded CMs, suggesting that HiExM improves the detection of cellular phenotypes in response to drug treatment. Our method broadens the application of ExM as a tool for scalable super-resolution imaging in biological research applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101069">Introducing µGUIDE for quantitative imaging via generalized uncertainty-driven inference using deep learning</a></h4>

              
                This work proposes µGUIDE: a general Bayesian framework to estimate posterior distributions of tissue microstructure parameters from any given biophysical model or signal representation, with exemplar demonstration in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Harnessing a new deep learning architecture for automatic signal feature selection combined with simulation-based inference and efficient sampling of the posterior distributions, µGUIDE bypasses the high computational and time cost of conventional Bayesian approaches and does not rely on acquisition constraints to define model-specific summary statistics. The obtained posterior distributions allow to highlight degeneracies present in the model definition and quantify the uncertainty and ambiguity of the estimated parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99162">Adipocyte microRNA-802 promotes adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by modulating macrophages in obesity</a></h4>

              
                Adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to be a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals. However, it remains unclear how adipose inflammation is initiated and maintained or the mechanism by which inflammation develops. We found that <i>microRNA-802</i> (<i>Mir802</i>) expression in adipose tissue is progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity in obese mice and humans. The increasing trend of <i>Mir802</i> preceded the accumulation of macrophages. Adipose tissue-specific knockout of <i>Mir802</i> lowered macrophage infiltration and ameliorated systemic insulin resistance. Conversely, the specific overexpression of <i>Mir802</i> in adipose tissue aggravated adipose inflammation in mice fed a high-fat diet. Mechanistically, <i>Mir802</i> activates noncanonical and canonical NF-κB pathways by targeting its negative regulator, TRAF3. Next, NF-κB orchestrated the expression of chemokines and SREBP1, leading to strong recruitment and M1-like polarization of macrophages. Our findings indicate that <i>Mir802</i> endows adipose tissue with the ability to recruit and polarize macrophages, which underscores <i>Mir802</i> as an innovative and attractive candidate for miRNA-based immune therapy for adipose inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/72177">Estimating dispersal rates and locating genetic ancestors with genome-wide genealogies</a></h4>

              
                Spatial patterns in genetic diversity are shaped by individuals dispersing from their parents and larger-scale population movements. It has long been appreciated that these patterns of movement shape the underlying genealogies along the genome leading to geographic patterns of isolation by distance in contemporary population genetic data. However, extracting the enormous amount of information contained in genealogies along recombining sequences has, until recently, not been computationally feasible. Here we capitalize on important recent advances in genome-wide gene-genealogy reconstruction and develop methods to use thousands of trees to estimate per-generation dispersal rates and to locate the genetic ancestors of a sample back through time. We take a likelihood approach in continuous space using a simple approximate model (branching Brownian motion) as our prior distribution of spatial genealogies. After testing our method with simulations we apply it to Arabidopsis thaliana. We estimate a dispersal rate of roughly 60km2 per generation, slightly higher across latitude than across longitude, potentially reflecting a northward post-glacial expansion. Locating ancestors allows us to visualize major geographic movements, alternative geographic histories, and admixture. Our method highlights the huge amount of information about past dispersal events and population movements contained in genome-wide genealogies.

                In growing cell populations such as tumours, mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples. The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours. However, little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Here, we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. Using spatial metrics of evolution, we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface. We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology.

">Polarized ATP synthase in synaptic mitochondria induced by learning and plasticity signals</a></h4>

              
                MINFLUX represents a state-of-the-art single-molecule localization microscopy technology that surpasses the conventional diffraction limit, enabling the visualization and analysis of nanostructures with exceptional precision. Despite its potential, the utilization of MINFLUX has been primarily confined to in vitro cultured cell environments. In this research, we have refined the sample preparation protocols to facilitate 3D MINFLUX imaging in fixed brain tissue sections, focusing on the mitochondrial distribution within dendritic spines and engram cells of the dentate gyrus. Probing single molecules in vivo reveals an interesting finding: the reorganization of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins during synaptic plasticity within dendritic spines of engram cells. Utilizing 3D MINFLUX nanoscopy, we identified a significant redistribution of -F1-ATP synthase, which correlates with learning related activities. This redistribution implies a pivotal function for polarized ATP synthesis in the vicinity of the postsynaptic zone, which may modulate both short-term and long-term synaptic modifications, thereby influencing synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Furthermore, dual-color 3D MINFLUX imaging has uncovered distinct patterns of mitochondrial reorganization involving both the inner and outer membranes within dendritic spines. These patterns, induced by plasticity signals, persist for up to 12 hours in neuronal cultures. This distinction highlights the presence of distinct regulatory mechanisms governing mitochondrial proteins during synaptic plasticity. These results offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and underscore the transformative potential of 3D MINFLUX imaging for studying neuronal processes in the brain.

">Uncovering the electrical synapse proteome in retinal neurons via in vivo proximity labeling</a></h4>

              
                Through decades of research, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of the protein complexes underlying function and regulation of chemical synapses in the nervous system. Despite the identification of key molecules such as ZO-1 or CaMKII, we currently lack a similar level of insight into the electrical synapse proteome. With the advancement of BioID as a tool for in vivo proteomics, it has become possible to identify complex interactomes of a given protein of interest by combining enzymatic biotinylation with subsequent streptavidin affinity capture. In the present study, we applied different BioID strategies to screen the interactomes of Connexin 36 (mouse) the major neuronal connexin and its zebrafish orthologue Cx35b in retinal neurons. For in vivo proximity labeling in mice, we took advantage of the Cx36-EGFP strain and expressed a GFP-nanobody-TurboID fusion construct selectively in AII amacrine cells. For in vivo BioID in zebrafish, we generated a transgenic line expressing a Cx35b-TurboID fusion under control of the Cx35b promoter. Both two strategies allowed us to capture a plethora of molecules that were associated with electrical synapses and showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation in the proteomes of both species. Besides known interactors of Cx36 such as ZO-1 and ZO-2 we have identified more than 50 new proteins, such as scaffold proteins, adhesion molecules and regulators of the cytoskeleton. We further determined the subcellular localization of these proteins in AII amacrine and tested potential binding interactions with Cx36. Of note, we identified signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 3 (SIPA1L3), a protein that has been implicated in cell junction formation and cell polarity as a new scaffold of electrical synapses. Interestingly, SIPA1L3 was able to interact with ZO-1, ZO-2 and Cx36, suggesting a pivotal role in electrical synapse function. In summary, our study provides a first detailed view of the electrical synapse proteome in retinal neurons.

">Selective Inhibition of Cytosolic PARylation via PARG99: A Targeted Approach for Mitigating FUS-associated Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterized by complex etiologies, often involving disruptions in functions of RNA/DNA binding proteins (RDBPs) such as FUS and TDP-43. The cytosolic mislocalization and aggregation of these proteins are linked to accumulation of unresolved stress granules (SGs), which exacerbate the disease progression. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-mediated PARylation plays a critical role in this pathological cascade, making it a potential target for intervention. However, conventional PARP inhibitors are limited by their detrimental effects on DNA repair pathways, which are already compromised in ALS. To address this limitation, we investigated a strategy focused on targeting the cytosolic compartment by expressing the cytosol-specific, natural PAR-glycohydrolase (PARG) isoform, PARG99. Using ALS patient derived FUS mutant induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) and differentiated neurons, we observed elevated levels of FUS in insoluble fractions in mutant cells compared to mutation-corrected isogenic lines. The insoluble FUS as well as TDP-43 levels increased further in sodium arsenite-treated or oxidatively stressed cells, correlating with accumulation of unresolved SGs. Notably, both PARG99 and PARP inhibitors reduced SG formation and insoluble FUS levels, however, PARG99 treated cells exhibited significantly lower DNA damage markers and improved viability under oxidative and arsenite stress. This study highlights the potential of PARG99 as a cytosol-specific intervention to mitigate FUS-associated toxicity while preserving critical nuclear DNA repair mechanisms, offering a promising strategy for addressing the underlying pathology of ALS and potentially other SG-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

">Processing negative words in pun-humor: dynamic representation of mixed feelings blending amusement and negativity</a></h4>

              
                This study aims to investigate whether amusement and negativity counteract each other or are jointly intensified during the online processing of negative keywords in pun-humor sentences, and how mixed feelings blending these two emotional states are dynamically experienced over time. Participants read three types of sentences that included the same negative words as keywords: pun-humor (negative words can generate humorous effects by resonating with the context), non-humor (negative words seamlessly align with the context), and nonsensical (negative words cannot be integrated with the context) sentences. The behavioral ratings revealed that compared with non-humor and nonsensical sentences, pun-humor sentences evoked stronger amusement and intensified negative feelings, indicating that pun-humor sentences containing negative keywords can effectively elicit mixed feelings that encompass conflicting emotional states. The ERP results showed that the N400 (300-500 ms) elicited by negative words in pun-humor sentences was comparable to that in non-humor sentences, suggesting that negative words were connected contextually in both sentence types. Besides, negative words elicited greater LPC (600-800 ms) in pun-humor sentences than in non-humor and nonsensical sentences, suggesting that pun-humor sentences require additional semantic processing and more elaborate emotional processing. Moreover, the representational similarity analysis (RSA) results revealed that in pun-humor sentences, the representation of negativity persisted for a longer duration, and it occurred and peaked earlier than that of amusement. This implies that within the dynamic representation of mixed feelings, negativity was experienced first, whereas amusement was subsequently felt within a brief period, during which negativity was not offset but rather continued to be represented over a longer time span, resulting in the simultaneous presence of both amused and negative feelings. Taken together, these findings show that mixed feelings elicited during the online processing of negative keywords in pun-humor sentences can be dynamically experienced in a way that aligns with the highly simultaneous pattern and that negativity can be experienced before amusement during the dynamic representation of mixed feelings.

                Mood disorders are associated with complex disruptions in brain networks, including those associated with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). The functional contribution of the caudal OFC (cOFC) has remained largely unexplored. We investigated the functions of the cOFC and pACC in macaques performing an approach-avoidance task by the combination of multimodal recordings and electrical microstimulation (EMS) of the cOFC. We assessed neural, autonomic and behavioral responses. We found the cOFC to be sensitive to both positive and negative stimuli, whereas the pACC was singificantly more active during aversive outcomes. EMS of the cOFC increased avoidance behavior, suggesting a causal role for the OFC subdivision in cost-benefit decision-making. Physiological measurements were positively correlated with behavioral patterns, emphasizing body-brain synchronization during emotionally significant decision-making. We suggest that the cOFC contributes to inducing pessimistic states, thereby making its dysfunction a potential contributor to the etiology of mood disorders.

">A domain-general process for theta-rhythmic sampling of either environmental information or internally stored information</a></h4>

              
                Many everyday tasks, such as shopping for groceries, require the sampling of both environmental information and internally stored information. Selective attention involves the preferential processing and sampling of behaviorally important information from the external environment, while working memory involves the preferential processing and sampling of behaviorally important, internally stored information. These essential cognitive processes share neural resources within a large-scale network that includes frontal, parietal, and sensory cortices, and these shared neural resources can lead to between-domain interactions. Previous research has linked external sampling during selective attention and internal sampling during working memory to theta-rhythmic (3-8 Hz) neural activity in higher-order (e.g., frontal cortices) and sensory regions (e.g., visual cortices). Such theta-rhythmic neural activity might help to resolve the competition for shared neural resources by isolating neural activity associated with different functions over time. Here, we used EEG and a dual-task design (i.e., a task that required both external and internal sampling) to directly compare (i) theta-dependent fluctuations in behavioral performance during external sampling with (ii) theta-dependent fluctuations in behavioral performance during internal sampling. Our findings are consistent with a domain-general, theta-rhythmic process for sampling either external information or internal information. We further demonstrate that interactions between external and internal information (specifically, when to-be-detected information matches to-be-remembered information) are not dependent on theta-band activity (i.e., theta phase). Given that these theta-independent "match effects" occur during early processing stages (peaking at 75 ms), we propose that theta-rhythmic sampling modulates external and internal information during later processing stages.

">Microglia promote neurodegeneration and hyperkatifeia during withdrawal and prolonged abstinence from chronic binge alcohol</a></h4>

              
                Proinflammatory microglial activation and hyperkatifeia during withdrawal are key features or Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) as well as in rodent models of binge alcohol. However, it is unclear the role microglia play in the development of AUD behavioral phenotypes, particularly negative affect or hyperkatifeia. We hypothesized proinflammatory microglia promote neuronal death and hyperkatifeia during withdrawal and prolonged abstinence. METHODS: Inflammatory and affective responses were measured in adult mice 24h or 4 weeks after 4 or 10 daily binge ethanol exposures (5g/kg/d, i.g.). RT-PCR was used to measure expression of pro-inflammatory genes. FosB immunohistochemistry was measured in stress circuitry central amygdala (CeA), BNST, and infralimbic cortex (IL) as a proxy for neuronal activity. Behavioral testing was performed in additional cohorts to measure anxiety-like behavior (center time in the open field), hyperarousal (acoustic startle), and inflexible negative affect (conditioned fear memory with extinction). To determine the role of proinflammatory microglia, Gi DREADDs were activated in microglia (CX3CR1.CreERT2.hm4di+/-EtOH +/- CNO). RESULTS: Binge ethanol increased pro-inflammatory gene activation both 24h after EtOH and lasting weeks into withdrawal (type I IFNs). Ten ethanol binges increased FosB in stress circuitry during withdrawal while simultaneously reducing BDNF persistently in the dBNST and CeA. Ethanol-treated mice spent less time in the center of the open field (anxiety-like behavior), had increased magnitude of acoustic startle reflex (hyperarousal) during withdrawal with reduced extinction of conditioned fear memory (PTSD phenotype) 4-5 weeks into abstinence. Gi-DREADD inhibition of microglia during alcohol treatment blocked persistent increases in proinflammatory cytokines, prevented ethanol-induced neuronal death (TUNEL), and prevented ethanol-induced hyperkatifeia including anxiety-like behavior and persistent conditioned fear memory. CONCLUSION: These data find a causative role for microglia in the development of negative affect behaviors during alcohol withdrawal. The prevention of these pro-inflammatory effects and behaviors by microglial inhibition reveals the integral role microglia play in the acute and lasting effects of ethanol on behavior in AUD pathogenesis.

">Cortical neural activity during responses to mechanical perturbation: Effects of hand preference and hand used</a></h4>

              
                Handedness, as measured by self-reported hand preference, is an important feature of human behavioral lateralization that has often been associated with hemispheric specialization. We examined the extent to which hand preference and whether the dominant hand is used or not influence the motor and neural response during voluntary unimanual corrective actions. The experimental task involved controlling a robotic manipulandum to move a cursor from a center start point to a target presented above or below the start. In some trials, a mechanical perturbation of the hand was randomly applied by the robot either consistent or against the target direction, while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Twelve left-handers and ten right-handers completed the experiment. Left-handed individuals had a greater negative peak in the frontal event-related potential (ERP) than right-handed participants during the initial response phase (N150) than right-handed individuals. Furthermore, left-handed individuals showed more symmetrical ERP distributions between two hemispheres than right-handed individuals in the frontal and parietal regions during the late voluntary response phase (P390). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that demonstrates the differences in the cortical control of voluntary corrective actions between left-handers and right-handers.

">Impaired spatial coding and neuronal hyperactivity in the medial entorhinal cortex of APP NL-G-F mice</a></h4>

              
                The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) pathology in the brain has been associated with aberrant neuronal network activity and poor cognitive performance in preclinical mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presently, our understanding of the mechanisms driving pathology-associated neuronal dysfunction and impaired information processing in the brain remains incomplete. Here, we assessed the impact of advanced A{beta} pathology on spatial information processing in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of 18-month App NL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in (APP KI) mice as they explored contextually novel and familiar open field arenas in a two-day, four-session recording paradigm. We tracked single unit firing activity across all sessions and found that spatial information scores were decreased in MEC neurons from APP KI mice versus those in age-matched C57BL/6J controls. MEC single unit spatial representations were also impacted in APP KI mice. Border cell firing preferences were unstable across sessions and spatial periodicity in putative grid cells was disrupted. In contrast, MEC border cells and grid cells in Control mice were intact and stable across sessions. We then quantified the stability of MEC spatial maps across sessions by utilizing a metric based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). We found evidence for increased instability in spatially-tuned APP KI MEC neurons versus Controls when mice were re-exposed to familiar environments and exposed to a novel environment. Additionally, spatial decoding analysis of MEC single units revealed deficits in position and speed coding in APP KI mice in all session comparisons. Finally, MEC single unit analysis revealed a mild hyperactive phenotype in APP KI mice that appeared to be driven by narrow-spiking units (putative interneurons). These findings tie A{beta}-associated dysregulation in neuronal firing to disruptions in spatial information processing that may underlie certain cognitive deficits associated with AD.

">A comparative study of rigid-body registration algorithms for the alignment of longitudinal structural MRI of the brain</a></h4>

              
                Longitudinal structural MRI (sMRI) may be used to characterize brain morphological changes over time. A key requirement for this approach is accurate rigid-body alignment of longitudinal sMRI. We have recently developed the automatic temporal registration algorithm (ATRA) for this purpose. ATRA is a landmark-based approach capable of registering dozens of serial sMRI simultaneously in an unbiased manner. The aim of the research presented in this paper was to evaluate the accuracy and inverse-consistency of ATRA in comparison to three commonly used sMRI alignment methods: FSL, FreeSurfer, and ANTS. In the absence of a ground truth, it is only possible to quantitatively determine the degree of discrepancy between two algorithms. We propose that if the discrepancy exceeds a certain threshold, the relative accuracy of the two algorithms could be determined visually. We computed the discrepancy between ATRA and each of the three other methods for the alignment of 150 pairs of sMRI taken roughly one year apart. We visually rated the accuracy of alignments in cases where the discrepancy was greater than .5 mm while the rater was agnostic to the registration method. In those instances, ATRA was considered more accurate than FSL in 46 out of 48 cases, more accurate than FreeSurfer in 6 out of 7 cases, and more accurate than ANTS in all 6 cases. ATRA was also the most inverse-consistent method. In addition to being capable of performing unbiased group-wise registration, ATRA is the most accurate algorithm in comparison to several commonly used rigid-body alignment methods.

">Procrustes Alignment in Individual-level Analyses of Functional Gradients</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) gradients provide valuable insights into individual differences in brain organization, yet aligning these gradients across individuals poses challenges. Procrustes alignment is often employed to standardize gradients across multiple subjects, but the choice of the number of gradients used in alignment introduces complexities that may impact individual-level analyses. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of varying gradient counts in Procrustes alignment on the principal FC gradient, using data from four resting state fMRI datasets, including the Human Connectome Project (HCP-YA), Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) PIOP1 and PIOP2, and Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN). We find that increasing the number of gradients used in alignment enhances identification accuracy but can reduce differential identifiability, as additional gradients risk introducing nuisance signals such as motion back into the principal gradient. To further probe these effects, machine learning to predict fluid intelligence and age, and a motion prediction analysis, revealing that higher alignment gradient counts may leak information from lower gradients into the principal gradient for individual-level analyses. These findings highlight the trade-off between alignment precision and the potential reintroduction of noise.

">Neural Mechanisms of Intersensory Switching: Evidence for Delayed Sensory Processing and Increased Cognitive Effort</a></h4>

              
                Intersensory switching (IS), the ability to shift attention between different sensory systems, is essential for cognitive flexibility, yet leads to slower responses compared to repeating the same sensory modality. The underlying neural mechanisms of IS remain largely unknown. In this study, high-density EEG was used to investigate these mechanisms in healthy adults (n=53) performing a speeded reaction time (RT) task involving visual and auditory stimuli. Trials were categorized as Repeat (same preceding modality) or Switch (different preceding modality). Switch trials showed slower RTs and delayed sensory responses (N1 and P2 components). Furthermore, across both Repeat and Switch trials, RT correlated with the latency of these neural responses. Additionally, lower alpha-band inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) in primary sensory regions was noted for Switch compared to Repeat trials, suggesting reduced efficiency of sensory processing. Greater induced theta activity over fronto-central scalp regions in Switch trials suggested increased cognitive control demands, potentially involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These findings reveal that IS is characterized by delayed sensory processing and heightened cognitive load, supporting a model where prior stimulus primes the sensory cortex for faster processing in Repeat trials, while Switch trials demand more cognitive resources for adjustment. The similarity of effects across both auditory and visual sensory modalities suggests that IS effects represent core features of sensory processing, potentially reflecting a fundamental, modality-independent mechanism of attentional switching across sensory domains.

">Neurogenetic evidence for oscillatory behavior of Lgr3-positive growth control interneurons in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The ability of animals to achieve a species-specific size and proportion even in the face of developmental or environmental perturbations is termed developmental stability. In Drosophila, the relaxin/insulin-like peptide 8 (Dilp8) mediates interorgan growth coordination during larval development acting upstream of the neuronal relaxin-like Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor (Lgr3). Previous reports have led to a model where Dilp8-dependent Lgr3 activation in two bilateral brain interneurons termed pars intercerebralis Lgr3-positive/growth-coordinating Lgr3 (PIL/GCL) neurons leads to their depolarization, which then triggers a neuroendocrine cascade that promotes developmental stability by delaying the larval-to-pupal transition and reducing organ growth concomitantly. However, many fundamental aspects of this model remained to be experimentally proven, most notably the specific requirement of Lgr3 and depolarization in PIL/GCL neurons for developmental stability. Here, we confirm the first part of the model regarding the specific requirement of Lgr3 in PIL/GCL neurons using improved genetic drivers, but, in contrast to the model predictions, we find that both hyper- and depolarized states of these neurons are required for their developmental delay-promoting activity in response to Dilp8. The simplest explanation for this finding is that Lgr3 activation by Dilp8 triggers oscillatory activity of PIL/GCL neurons, and that this is required for the Dilp8-dependent developmental delay. Whether or not such oscillatory behavior would arise from intrinsically pacemaker activity or from network connectivity properties such as feedback inhibition remains to be defined, although we present evidence that both could be involved. Namely, PIL/GCL neurons are positive for Cyclin A, which has been linked with sleep time coordination in adult postmitotic neurons. On the other hand, the neuroanatomy of PIL/GCL neurons is consistent with reciprocally-innervating loop-forming neurons, a common architecture in oscillating circuits and central pattern generators. Finally, we demonstrate through clonal analyses that PIL/GCL neurons represent two distinct neuronal types--a local and a projection neuron--instead of a homogeneous neuronal population as previously thought, revealing a new complexity layer in the developmental stability circuit. Our findings highlight the importance of cell-type specific neurogenetic manipulation, detailed neuroanatomical characterization, and reveal a critical and unanticipatedly complex role for PIL/GCL neurons in the Dilp8-dependent developmental stability pathway.

">How sturdy is your memory palace? Reliable room representations predict subsequent reinstatement of placed objects</a></h4>

              
                Our autobiographical experiences typically occur within the context of familiar spatial locations. When we encode these experiences into memory, we can use our spatial map of the world to help organize these memories and later retrieve their episodic details. However, it is still not well understood what psychological and neural factors make spatial contexts an effective scaffold for storing and accessing memories. We hypothesized that spatial locations with distinctive and stable neural representations would best support the encoding and robust reinstatement of new episodic memories. We developed a novel paradigm that allowed us to quantify the within-participant reliability of a spatial context ("room reliability") prior to memory encoding, which could then be used to predict the degree of successful re-activation of item memories. To do this, we constructed a virtual reality (VR) "memory palace", a custom-built environment made up of 23 distinct rooms that participants explored using a head-mounted VR display. The day after learning the layout of the environment, participants underwent whole-brain fMRI while being presented with videos of the rooms in the memory palace, allowing us to measure the reliability of the neural activity pattern associated with each room. Participants were taken back to VR and asked to memorize the locations of 23 distinct objects randomly placed within each of the 23 rooms, and then returned to the scanner as they recalled the objects and the rooms in which they appeared. We found that our room reliability measure was predictive of object reinstatement across cortex, and further showed that this was driven not only by the group-level reliability of a room across participants, but also the idiosyncratic reliability of rooms within each participant. Together, these results showcase how the quality of the neural representation of a spatial context can be quantified and used to 'audit' its utility as a memory scaffold for future experiences.

">Anatomy, histology and ultrastructure of the adult human olfactory peduncle: blood vessel and corpora amylacea assessment</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian olfactory system is responsible for processing volatile chemical stimuli and is composed of several structures including the olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb, olfactory peduncle (OP), and olfactory cortices. Despite the critical role played by the OP in the transport of olfactory information it has remained understudied. In this work, optical, confocal, and electron microscopy were employed to examine the anatomy, histology, and ultrastructure of six human OP specimens (ages 37,84 years). Three concentric layers were identified in coronal sections: the external layer (EL), the axonal layer (AL), and the internal layer (IL). Immunohistochemistry revealed the distribution of neurons and glial cells throughout the OP. Two neuronal morphologies were observed: granule cells and larger pyramidal cells, the latter associated with projection neurons of the anterior olfactory nucleus. Astrocytes were uniformly distributed with a more radial morphology in the EL. Oligodendrocytes were mainly located in the AL. Blood vessels (BVs) were evenly distributed along the OP, with a mean luminal area of 82.9 um2 and a density of 1.26 %, with a significant increase in the IL. Corpora amylacea were abundant, with an average size of 49.3 um2 and a density of 3.23 %. CA clustered near BVs, particularly at tissue edges, with both size and density increasing with age. Notably, CA showed strong associations with astrocytes. This study provides the first detailed qualitative and quantitative data on the internal organization of the human OP, which may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of some neuropathological disorders.

">Behaviorally-relevant features of observed actions dominate cortical representational geometry in natural vision</a></h4>

              
                We effortlessly extract behaviorally relevant information from dynamic visual input in order to understand the actions of others. In the current study, we develop and test a number of models to better understand the neural representational geometries supporting action understanding. Using fMRI, we measured brain activity as participants viewed a diverse set of 90 different video clips depicting social and nonsocial actions in real-world contexts. We developed five behavioral models using arrangement tasks: two models reflecting behavioral judgments of the purpose (transitivity) and the social content (sociality) of the actions depicted in the video stimuli; and three models reflecting behavioral judgments of the visual content (people, objects, and scene) depicted in still frames of the stimuli. We evaluated how well these models predict neural representational geometry and tested them against semantic models based on verb and nonverb embeddings and visual models based on gaze and motion energy. Our results revealed that behavioral judgments of similarity better reflect neural representational geometry than semantic or visual models throughout much of cortex. The sociality and transitivity models in particular captured a large portion of unique variance throughout the action observation network, extending into regions not typically associated with action perception, like ventral temporal cortex. Overall, our findings expand the action observation network and indicate that the social content and purpose of observed actions are predominant in cortical representation.

">Metacognitive Introspection Alters the Dynamics of Pre-Decisional Neural Evidence Accumulation</a></h4>

              
                Metacognitive introspection refers to the capacity to monitor and evaluate one's own performance, such as when expressing confidence in one's choice. In the context of perceptual decision making, current computational models of confidence typically assume that confidence is computed after the evidence collection process underlying the initial choice has unfolded. This account predicts that the act of introspection required in order to provide a confidence judgment about one's decision should have little impact on the dynamics of evidence accumulation leading up to that decision. We tested this by examining whether a neural proxy for perceptual evidence accumulation (the central-parietal positivity; CPP) exhibits different dynamics when participants do or do not rate confidence in their perceptual decisions. Behavioral results showed that confidence introspection increased decision accuracy and response time. Importantly, confidence introspection also resulted in a steeper CPP slope beginning shortly after (~250 ms) decision evidence was available. We further observed an effector-specific neural signal of confidence evidence which both built up prior to the perceptual choice and which was predictive of the amount of confidence subsequently expressed by the participants. Our results indicate that introspection can alter the dynamics of perceptual evidence accumulation, possibly by acting on the gain of evidence accumulation, and that motor-related confidence signals emerge in tandem with pre-decisional evidence accumulation signals rather than post-choice.

">Cortical assembloids support the development of fast-spiking human PVALB+ cortical interneurons and uncover schizophrenia-associated defects</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of fast-spiking, parvalbumin positive (PVALB+) cortical interneurons is implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, how and when these defects emerge during development is not well understood. The protracted maturation of these cells during postnatal development has made their derivation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) extremely difficult, precluding studies on their role in neuropsychiatric diseases using hPSC-based disease models. Furthermore, the complex genetics of schizophrenia makes genetic background a confounding variable for studies using patient-specific hiPSC lines. Here we present a cortical assembloid system that supports the development of fast-spiking cortical interneurons which co-express LHX6 and PVALB, match the molecular profiles of primary PVALB+ interneurons by scRNAseq and display their distinctive electrophysiological features. The presence of PVALB+ interneurons in assembloids was correlated with gamma-band oscillatory rhythms at the network-level. We next characterized cortical interneuron development in a series of CRISPR-generated isogenic structural variants strongly associated with schizophrenia risk and identified variant-specific phenotypes both in cortical interneuron migration and in the molecular profile of PVALB+ cortical interneurons. These findings reveal plausible mechanisms on how disruption of cortical interneuron development may impact schizophrenia risk and provides an exciting human experimental platform to facilitate the study of authentic, fast-spiking cortical interneurons.

">Shaping the developing homunculus: the roles of deprivation and compensatory behaviour in sensory remapping</a></h4>

              
                Some of the most dramatic examples of neuroplasticity in the human brain follow congenital sensory deprivation, though we have limited understanding of the plasticity mechanisms driving such large-scale remapping. Hand loss due to congenital limb differences (CLD) offers a unique temporal dissociation of developmental neuroplasticity mechanisms: While sensory deprivation is congenital, compensatory motor behaviours develop progressively across childhood. Using paediatric neuroimaging and semi-ecological behavioural analysis in children (5-7 years old) and adults (>25 years old) with unilateral upper-limb CLD, we studied deprivation- and use-dependent plasticity in the deprived primary somatosensory cortex and beyond. We reveal that global remapping, encompassing the entire sensory homunculus, is established early and maintained in adulthood. We demonstrate that deprivation-driven homeostatic plasticity can drive this global remapping, with Hebbian-based compensatory learning further contributing to inter-individual differences both in childhood and adulthood. Our findings emphasise the early establishment and stability of cortical maps, despite extensive daily-life behavioural adaptation.

">Behavioral and Neural Correlates of Temperament Traits: Insights from Temperament and Character Inventory and fMRI-Based Choice Tasks</a></h4>

              
                A cognitive conflict that is negatively arousing and results in a divergence in preference attitudes toward the chosen and rejected alternatives occurs when individuals are compelled to choose between alternatives that are similarly preferable. This phenomenon, which is frequently referred to as cognitive dissonance, is of interest in the fields of decision neuroscience and psychology. This study examines the behavioral and neural underpinnings of Cloninger's temperament traits Novelty Seeking (NS), Harm Avoidance (HA), Reward Dependence (RD), and Persistence (PS) in a decision-making context. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a modified free-choice paradigm were used to formalize the effect of Cloninger temperaments on cognitive conflict induced by choice. Behavioral analysis revealed significant individual differences across the four TCI dimensions, highlighting distinct variability in participants' responses. Imaging data showed that participants with the highest and lowest scores in each temperament trait exhibited unique brain activation patterns during difficult and easy decision tasks. Notably, novelty-seeking was linked to heightened activation in brain regions associated with exploration and cognitive flexibility, while harm avoidance was associated with emotional processing and conflict detection. These findings provide deeper insights into how personality traits influence both behavior and neural responses during cognitive dissonance and decision-making tasks, offering implications for understanding individual differences in decision-related behaviors. The results of this study confirm the effect of temperaments on the degree of perceived dissonance of people, which can be used in many areas such as consumer behavior in marketing. The reason for this is the hesitancy of customers after purchasing the products.

">Modeling speech adaptation to altered sensory feedback through continuous learning of internal sensory predictions</a></h4>

              
                The paper presents a version of an optimization-based model of speech production that reproduces key acoustic and articulatory features of motorsensory adaptation to altered sensory feedback. In the presented approach, the mechanism of motorsensory adaptation is based on regular updates, based on the sensory feedback perceived by the speaker, of two of the speakers' internal models used for computing (near)-optimal articulation. These internal models, modeled as separate Artificial Neural Networks, are 1) a model that predicts the acoustic consequences of motor (articulatory commands) and 2) a model that predicts the somatosensory sensations from given motor commands. The paper presents simulations of adaptation experiments that successfully reproduce key acoustic and articulatory features of motorsensory adaptation of speech to altered sensory feedback. These include gradual and incomplete motorsensory adaptation when the auditory (or the somatosensory) feedback is suddenly altered (F1-shifted for the altered auditory feedback, forced jaw movement for altered somatosensory feedback). The presented simulations also show that the rate and magnitude of adaptation behavior depend on a small number of parameters. Variation in the values of these parameters can potentially explain inter-speaker differences in terms of adaptation behavior, including sensory preference.

">Quantifying information stored in synaptic connections rather than in firing patterns of neural networks</a></h4>

              
                A cornerstone of our understanding of both biological and artificial neural networks is that they store information in the strengths of connections among the constituent neurons. However, in contrast to the well-established theory for quantifying information encoded by the firing patterns of neural networks, little is known about quantifying information encoded by its synaptic connections. Here, we develop a theoretical framework using continuous Hopfield networks as an exemplar for associative neural networks, and data that follow mixtures of broadly applicable multivariate log-normal distributions. Specifically, we analytically derive the Shannon mutual information between the data and singletons, pairs, triplets, quadruplets, and arbitrary n-tuples of synaptic connections within the network. Our framework corroborates well-established insights about storage capacity of, and distributed coding by, neural firing patterns. Strikingly, it discovers synergistic interactions among synapses, revealing that the information encoded jointly by all the synapses exceeds the 'sum of its parts'. Taken together, this study introduces an interpretable framework for quantitatively understanding information storage in neural networks, one that illustrates the duality of synaptic connectivity and neural population activity in learning and memory.

                Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are pivotal for unlocking the complexities of human cognition, yet traditional cognitive studies remain constrained to specialized laboratories. To revolutionize this paradigm, we present CalliCog: an open-source, scalable in-cage platform tailored for freely behaving experiments in small primate species such as the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). CalliCog includes modular operant chambers that operate autonomously and integrate seamlessly with home cages, eliminating human intervention. Our results showcase the power of CalliCog to train experimentally naive marmosets in touchscreen-based cognitive tasks. Remarkably, across two independent facilities, marmosets achieved touchscreen proficiency within two weeks and successfully completed tasks probing behavioral flexibility and working memory. Moreover, CalliCog enabled precise synchronization of behavioral data with electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from freely moving animals, opening new frontiers for neurobehavioral research. By making CalliCog openly accessible, we aim to democratize cognitive experimentation with small NHPs, narrowing the translational gap between preclinical models and human cognition.

">Variation in the geometry of concept manifolds acrosshuman visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Brain activity patterns in high-level visual cortex support accurate linear classification of visual concepts (e.g., objects or scenes). It has long been appreciated that the accuracy of linear classification in any brain area depends on the geometry of its concept manifolds---sets of brain activity patterns that encode images of a concept. However, it is unclear how the geometry of concept manifolds differs between regions of visual cortex that support accurate classification and those that don't, or how it differs between visual cortex and deep neural networks (DNNs). We estimated geometric properties of concept manifolds that, per a recent theory, directly determine the accuracy of simple "few-shot" linear classifiers. Using a large fMRI dataset, we show that variation in classification accuracy across human visual cortex is driven by a variation in a single geometric property: the distance between manifold centers ("geometric Signal"). In contrast, variation in classification accuracy across most DNN layers is driven by an increase in the effective number of manifold dimensions ("Dimensionality"). Despite this difference in the geometric properties that affect few-shot classification performance in the brain and DNNs, we find that Signal and Dimensionality are strongly, negatively correlated: when Signal increases across brain regions or DNN layers, Dimensionality decreases, and vice versa. We conclude that visual cortex and DNNs deploy different geometric strategies for accurate linear classification of concepts, even though both are subject to the same constraint.

                Preterm birth is a leading risk factor for atypicalities in cognitive and sensory processing, but it is unclear how prematurity impacts circuits that support these functions. To address this, we trained adult mice born a day early (preterm mice) on a visual discrimination task and found that they commit more errors and fail to achieve high levels of performance. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we found that the neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the V1-projecting prefrontal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are hyper-responsive to the reward, reminiscent of cue processing in adolescence. Moreover, the non-rewarded cue fails to robustly activate the V1 and V1-projecting ACC neurons during error trials, in contrast to prefrontal fast-spiking (FS) interneurons which show elevated error-related activity, suggesting that preterm birth impairs the function of prefrontal circuits for error monitoring. Finally, environmental enrichment, a well-established paradigm that promotes sensory maturation, failed to improve the performance of preterm mice, suggesting limited capacity of early interventions for reducing the risk of cognitive deficits after preterm birth. Altogether, our study for the first time identifies potential circuit mechanisms of cognitive atypicalities in the preterm population and highlights the vulnerability of prefrontal circuits to advanced onset of extrauterine experience.

">Reading Acquisition Drives Linguistic Cross-Modal Convergence in The Left Ventral Occipitotemporal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Reading acquisition requires linking visual symbols with speech sounds, leading to the development of neural sensitivity to print. While prior studies have shown the importance of cross-modal integration in spoken language areas, the higher-level visual area (lvOT) processing printed words remained more context-dependent. This longitudinal study investigated whether the lvOT undergoes cross-modal reorganization to facilitate print-speech integration during reading development and how these changes relate to reading skills. We followed children over two years, beginning at the onset of formal reading instruction. We examine lvOT responses to print-specific, speech-specific, and its convergence at whole-brain, region of interest and voxel-based levels. Results showed that with reading experience, the Initial print-specific responses in the lvOT are transformed into responses to both print and speech input. This transformation positively correlates with reading skills, especially in early acquisition stages. These findings suggest that reading acquisition drives cross-modal reorganization within the lvOT, enabling the area to integrate print and speech. They shed light on the broader neural mechanisms supporting reading development.

">Frontopolar cortex stimulation induces prolonged disruption to counterfactual processing: insights from altered local field potentials</a></h4>

              
                Frontopolar cortex (FPC) is a large, anterior sub-region of prefrontal cortex found in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) and is thought to support monitoring the value of switching between alternative goals. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this function are unclear. Here we used multielectrode arrays to record the local field potentials (LFPs) in the FPC of two macaques performing a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analogue and found that bursts of gamma and beta in FPC tracked counterfactual not current rule value. Moreover, we show that brief high-frequency microstimulation to a single trial causally affects both LFP activity in FPC, as well as rule-guided decision-making across successive trials. Following stimulation of FPC we observed reduced exploration of the counterfactual rule pre-rule-change, as well as a delayed adaptation to the newly relevant following post-rule-change. A similar, multi-trial time-course disturbance to beta and gamma activity within FPC was also induced following single-trial microstimulation. These findings conclusively link neuronal activity in FPC with behavioural monitoring of the value of counterfactual rules and provide neural mechanistic insights into how FPC supports rule-based decision-making.

">Multisensory integration across reference frames with additive feed-forward networks</a></h4>

              
                The integration of multiple sensory inputs is essential for human perception and action in uncertain environments. This process includes reference frame transformations as different sensory signals are encoded in different coordinate systems. Studies have shown multisensory integration in humans is consistent with Bayesian optimal inference. However, neural mechanisms underlying this process are still debated. Different population coding models have been proposed to implement probabilistic inference. This includes a recent suggestion that explicit divisive normalization accounts for empirical principles of multisensory integration. However, whether and how divisive operations are implemented in the brain is not well understood. Indeed, all existing models suffer from the curse of dimensionality and thus fail to scale to real-world problems. Here, we propose an alternative model for multisensory integration that approximates Bayesian inference: a multilayer-feedforward neural network of multisensory integration (MSI) across different reference frames trained on the analytical Bayesian solution. This model displays all empirical principles of multisensory integration and produces similar behavior to that reported in Ventral intraparietal (VIP) neurons in the brain. The model achieved this without a neatly organized and regular connectivity structure between contributing neurons, such as required by explicit divisive normalization. Overall, we show that simple feedforward networks of purely additive units can approximate optimal inference across different reference frames through parallel computing principles. This suggests that it is not necessary for the brain to use explicit divisive normalization to achieve multisensory integration.

">Coupled aging of cyto- and myeloarchitectonic atlas-informed gray and white matter structural properties</a></h4>

              
                A key aspect of brain aging that remains poorly understood is its high regional heterogeneity and heterochronicity. A better understanding of how the structural organization of the brain shapes aging trajectories is needed. Neuroimaging tissue types are often collected and analyzed as separate acquisitions, an approach that cannot provide a holistic view of age-related change of the related portions of the neurons (cell bodies and axons). Because neuroimaging can only assess indirect features at the gross macrostructural level, incorporating post-mortem histological information may aid in better understanding of structural aging gradients. Longitudinal design, coupling of gray and white matter (GM, WM) properties, and a biologically informed approach to organizing neural properties are needed. Thus, we tested aging of the regional coupling between GM (cortical thickness, surface area, volume) and WM (fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivities) structural metrics using linear mixed effects modeling in 102 healthy adults aged 20-94 years old, scanned on two occasions over a four-year period. The association between age-related within-person change in GM morphometry and the diffusion properties of the directly neighboring portion of white matter were assessed, capturing both aspects of neuronal health in one model. Additionally, we parcellated the brain utilizing the histological-staining informed von Economo-Koskinas atlas to consider regional cyto- and myelo-architecture. Results demonstrate several gradients of coupled association in the age-related decline of neighboring white and gray matter. Most notably, gradients of coupling along the heteromodal association to sensory axis were found for several areas (e.g., anterior frontal and lateral temporal cortices, vs pre- and post-central gyrus, occipital, and limbic areas), in line with heterochronicity and retrogenesis theories of aging. Further effort to bridge across data and measurement scales will enhance understanding of the mechanisms of the aging brain.

">Enhanced Notch dependent gliogenesis and delayed physiological maturation underlie neurodevelopmental defects in Lowe syndrome</a></h4>

              
                The activity of signaling pathways is required for coordinated cellular and physiological processes leading to normal development of brain structure and function. Mutations in OCRL, a phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate [PIP2] 5-phosphatase leads to the neurodevelopmental disorder, Lowe Syndrome (LS). However, the mechanism by which mutations in OCRL leads to the brain phenotypes of LS is not understood. We find that on differentiation of LS patient derived iPSC, developing neural cultures show reduced excitability along with enhanced P levels of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein. Multiomic single-nucleus RNA and ATAC seq analysis of neural stem cells generated from LS patient iPSC revealed an enhanced number of cells with a gliogenic cell state. RNA seq analysis also revealed increased levels of DLK1, a non-canonical Notch ligand in LS patient NSC associated increased levels of cleaved Notch protein and elevation of its transcriptional target HES5, indicating upregulated Notch signaling. Treatment of iPSC derived brain organoids with an inhibitor of PIP5K, the lipid kinase that synthesizes PIP2, was able to restore neuronal excitability and rescue Notch signaling defects in LS patient derived organoid cultures. Overall, our results demonstrate a role for PIP2 dependent regulation of Notch signaling, cell fate specification and development of neuronal excitability regulated by OCRL activity.

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly type of brain cancer in adults. Dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), contributes to therapeutic resistance. Drugs that inhibit tyrosine kinase activity and monoclonal antibodies against EGFR are strategies used in clinical trials. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a tumor treatment that involves the administration of a photosensitizing drug, followed by its activation with visible light, which causes cell death due to oxidative stress. Although PDT helps prolong median survival in patients with GBM, complete remission has not been achieved. Populations of GBM cells have been obtained from the T98G line resistant to PDT with methyl-5-aminolevulinic acid (Me-ALA) for characterization, comparing them with the original parental population. Objective: The objective of this work was to evaluate the general response of T98G GBM cells resistant to PDT when EGFR activity is inhibited with the drug erlotinib. Methods and results: It has been observed that the administration of the EGFR inhibitor drug in combination with PDT reduced viability (MTT) in resistant populations compared to PDT alone. Furthermore, the PpIX content (flow cytometry) was increased in the resistant population when cells were incubated with Me-ALA and erlotinib. Erlotinib prevented cell proliferation of parental and resistant spheroids. Wound closure was reduced in both parental and PDT-resistant populations. Conclusion: Our results indicate that EGFR activation would be relevant in the resistance of GBM cells to PDT.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Diabetes mellitus (DM), a widespread endocrine disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, can cause nerve damage and increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Effective blood glucose management is essential, and sitagliptin (SITG), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, may offer neuroprotective benefits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: T2DM was induced in rats using nicotinamide (NICO) and streptozotocin (STZ), and biomarkers of AD and DM-linked enzymes, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were evaluated in the brain. Computational studies supported the in vivo findings. Results: SITG significantly reduced the brain enzyme levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1), DPP-4, and glycogen synthase kinase-3&amp;amp;beta; (GSK-3&amp;amp;beta;) in T2DM-induced rats. It also reduced inflammation by lowering cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-&amp;amp;alpha; (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), and nuclear factor-&amp;amp;kappa;B (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B). Additionally, SITG improved oxidative stress markers by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhancing glutathione (GSH). It increased anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) while reducing pro-apoptotic markers such as Bcl-2-associated X (BAX) and Caspace-3. SITG also lowered blood glucose levels and improved plasma insulin levels. To explore potential molecular level mechanisms, docking was performed on AChE, COX-2, GSK-3&amp;amp;beta;, BACE-1, and Caspace-3. The potential binding affinity of SITG for the above-mentioned target enzymes were 10.8, 8.0, 9.7, 7.7, and 7.9 kcal/mol, respectively, comparable to co-crystallized ligands. Further binding mode analysis of the lowest energy conformation revealed interactions with the critical residues. Conclusions: These findings highlight SITG&amp;amp;rsquo;s neuroprotective molecular targets in T2DM-associated neurodegeneration and its potential as a therapeutic approach for AD, warranting further clinical investigations.</p>

	<p>Background: Concentric vessel-wall contrast enhancement (VW-CE) of the terminal carotid artery and its proximal branches may be linked to ischemic strokes, disease activity and progression in Moyamoya disease (MMD). The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to analyze the association between VW-CE and perioperative acute ischemic stroke (PAIS) occurring within 24 h after revascularization. Methods: All previously untreated MMD patients who required revascularization and who had undergone preoperative MRI with VW-CE-sequences were included. PAIS was detected by CT and/or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences within 24 h postoperatively. Results: Of the 110 patients included (female-to-male ratio: 2.7:1, median age: 45.1 (16.6&amp;amp;ndash;69.2); n = 247 revascularizations), a priori VW-CE was present in 67.3% (mean time from MRI to first surgery: 86 days &amp;amp;plusmn; 82 days). PAIS occurred in five patients undergoing primary revascularization (PAIS rate per revascularization: 2.1%), all of whom had a preoperative pathological VW-CE in the vascular segment corresponding to the stroke area. Two (40%) incidents of PAIS occurred in revascularized territory, while three (60%) occurred in non-revascularized vascular territory. In each case, the supplying artery exhibited VW-CE, indicating disease activity. No additional PAIS occurred during subsequent revascularizations in cases of multistage procedures (n = 38), such as ACA or PCA revascularization as a second step. Conclusion: Preoperative VW-CE in one or more vascular segments may be a marker for postoperative stroke in the respective vascular territory at the time of revascularization. VW-CE imaging should be routinely performed when planning revascularization in MMD. If VW-CE is found, strict perioperative monitoring of these high-risk patients should be performed to achieve the best results possible.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Narcolepsy is a chronic neurologic disorder associated with substantial challenges that affect the social, emotional, and financial quality-of-life domains. A social listening analysis and structured survey were conducted to better understand the candid perspective of people with narcolepsy (PWN) and their experience with twice-nightly sodium oxybate (SXB). Methods: To characterize conversations and experiences in narcolepsy communities where SXB was mentioned, a social media analysis was conducted from August 2011 to October 2022. A structured survey was administered to PWN taking oxybate therapy from October 2022 to November 2022. Results: From the social media analysis, the largest topic was related to &amp;amp;ldquo;cataplexy&amp;amp;rdquo;, with 537 posts/comments. The most frequent term was &amp;amp;ldquo;xyrem&amp;amp;rdquo;, with 22,200 mentions. Of the 87 survey respondents, 85 respondents had narcolepsy, 75.3% (64/85) reported missing their second dose of immediate-release SXB or mixed-salt oxybates, and 58.8% (50/85) of respondents reported that they took their second dose of oxybate &amp;amp;gt; 4 h after the first dose. Respondents reported poor sleep quality as the greatest effect or issue experienced after missing their second oxybate dose. When respondents were asked whether they had ever been injured after waking to take their second oxybate dose, 31.8% (27/85) of respondents reported an injury. Conclusions: PWN taking twice-nightly oxybates often report inconsistent adherence to the prescribed dosing, which results in negative consequences in their lives. This research provided an anonymized forum for PWN to voice challenges with middle-of-the-night awakenings that they may be reluctant to explain to their clinician.</p>

	<p>Background: There is currently increasing interest in the implication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a potential risk factor for long-term neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). In this context, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between TBI and the risk of dementia. Methods: A systematic search was performed across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, to identify relevant meta-analyses and cohort studies. Studies were included if they reported effect sizes (odds ratios [ORs] or relative risks [RRs]) for the association between TBI, its severity, and the risk of dementia or AD. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: A total of six studies were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed that TBI significantly increases the risk of dementia, with an overall odds ratio of 1.81 (95% CI: 1.53&amp;amp;ndash;2.14). Mild TBI was associated with a modest increase in dementia risk (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.70&amp;amp;ndash;2.26), while moderate-to-severe TBI showed a stronger association (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.55&amp;amp;ndash;2.45). In contrast, the association between TBI and AD was less consistent, with the pooled OR for AD being 1.18 (at 95% CI: 1.11&amp;amp;ndash;1.25) for mild TBI; however, in several studies, no significant association was observed (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.91&amp;amp;ndash;1.15). The results also indicated substantial heterogeneity across studies, particularly in relation to AD outcomes. Conclusions: The findings from this umbrella meta-analysis confirm that TBI is a significant risk factor for dementia, with more severe TBIs conferring a higher risk. While mild TBIs also increase the risk of dementia, the effect is more pronounced in moderate-to-severe injuries. The evidence linking TBI to AD is less robust, with inconsistent findings across studies. Clinicians should consider long-term cognitive screening and management for individuals with a history of TBI, particularly those with moderate-to-severe injuries.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the onset time to habitual psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) in adults referred to Guy&amp;amp;rsquo;s and St Thomas&amp;amp;rsquo; Neurophysiology Department for home video telemetry (HVT) with a clinical question of PNES. The primary objective was to determine the optimal time window for HVT recording for patients with suspected PNES to try to improve the allocation of clinical resources. The secondary objective was to explore any potential association between time to habitual PN ES onset and demographic indexes and other clinical, neuro-radiological and semiological findings. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of our XLTEK database between 2019 and 2020. A multifactorial analysis of PNES semiologic subtypes, patient demographics, psychiatric comorbidities and neuroimaging was conducted to explore their impact on time to PNES within an HVT study. People who had at least one typical PNES during their recording were included. The exclusion criteria included people who had the test performed without video recording. The total number of participants was 37. The data were extracted from our local XLTEK database. Statistical analyses using Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U and Fischer exact tests were carried out. Results: The mean time to first habitual PNES onset was seven hours, with a mean recording duration of 46 h. The most commonly occurring event type was blank spells (12, 32%), with the least common presentation being d&amp;amp;eacute;j&amp;amp;agrave; vu (1, 3%). There was a significant association between time to PNES onset and male sex (p = 0.04). There was a significant association between time to PNES onset and abnormal MRI findings (p = 0.02). Particular PNES semiologic subtypes were not significantly linked with PNES onset time. Conclusions: Our study highlights that on average, patients with PNES will rapidly have their first habitual event within an HVT study (mean time to event onset of seven hours), consistent with the current literature. This raises the question of whether HVT study duration could be reduced to release study resources and aid departmental efficiencies. We also observe the novel finding that men presented significantly earlier with their habitual PNES event than women, and that abnormal imaging findings were also significantly associated with an earlier time to event onset, although the reason for this association is yet to be determined.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The biological basis for behavioral manifestations of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease remains unclear. Emotional and behavioral alterations of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease can result in substantial caregiver burden and lack effective management. This study expands upon previous work investigating behavioral alterations in mice with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and a potential treatment of increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Methods: A total of 47 3xTg-AD (Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s) and 53 B6 (wildtype) mice were administered with ANA12 (an antagonist of TrkB receptor) or Vehicle (saline) and then rTMS or Sham treatment daily. After 14 days of treatments and injections, mouse behavior was assessed under various behavioral cognitive tests. Mice were then perfused, and brain samples were processed for histology and protein assays. Brain homogenates were analyzed for BDNF and its downstream signaling molecules. Results: Open field testing demonstrated that 3xTg-AD mice spent more time in the center than B6 mice. 3xTg-AD-Sham mice injected with ANA12 were the only group to travel significantly less distance than B6-ANA12-Sham or B6-Vehicle-Sham mice (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while 3xTg-AD-rTMS mice (irrespective of injection) were not significantly different from B6 mice. 3xTg-AD mice had significantly greater measured levels of BDNF and TrkB than the wild-type mice. Conclusions: Treatment of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease using rTMS positively affects elements of hypoactivity, but not all behavioral abnormalities. rTMS shifted 3xTg-AD open field behavioral test measures, generating significant differences between untreated 3xTg-AD and B6 genotypes. Despite its benefit, further investigation of rTMS as a treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease as well as its biological underpinnings are needed.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The impact of stroke location and volume on the development of post-stroke dysphagia is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between acute ischemic lesions and the severity of dysphagia. Methods: Brain MRIs were obtained with a 1.5 Tesla MRI system (Magnetom Avanto B13, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The brain MRI protocol included axial echo planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The acute ischemic volume was obtained using DWI by drawing regions of interest (ROIs). The diagnosis and assessment of the severity of dysphagia was carried out by a multidisciplinary team and included the Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS), the Penetration&amp;amp;ndash;Aspiration Scale (PAS), and the Pooling score (P-score). The threshold for statistical significance was set at 5%. Results: Among all the patients enrolled (n = 64), 28 (43.8%) were males and 36 (56.2%) were females, with a mean age of 78.8 years. Thirty-three (51.6%) of them had mild dysphagia and thirty-one (48.4%) had moderate&amp;amp;ndash;severe dysphagia. The total ischemic volume was negatively correlated with the DOSS (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.441, p = 0.0003) and positively with the P-score (rs = 0.3054, p = 0.0328). Conclusions: There are significant associations between the severity of dysphagia and the quantitative DWI-based data of the acute ischemic volume and anatomical location.</p>

	<p>Background: Transferring learned manipulations to new manipulation tasks has enabled humans to realize thousands of dexterous object manipulations in daily life. Two-digit grasp and three-digit grasp manipulations require different fingertip forces, and our brain can switch grasp types to ensure good performance according to motor memory. We hypothesized that several brain areas contribute to the execution of the new type of motor according to the motor memory. However, the motor memory mechanisms during this transfer period are still unclear. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we aimed to investigate the cortical mechanisms involved in motor memory during the transfer phase of learned manipulation tasks. Methods: Using a custom-built T-shaped object with an adjustable weight distribution, the participants performed grasp and lift manipulation tasks under different conditions to simulate the learning and transfer phases. The learning phase consisted of four grasp-and-lift repetitions with one motor type, followed by a transfer phase with four repetitions involving different motors (adding or removing a digit). Results: By comparing brain activity in the learning and transfer phases, we identified three regions (the superior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus) associated with motor memory during the transfer of learned manipulations. Conclusions: Our findings improve the understanding of the role of the posterior parietal cortex in motor memory, highlighting how sensory information from memory and real-time input is integrated to generate novel motor control signals that guide the precise reapplication of control strategies. Furthermore, we believe that these areas contribute to motor learning from motor memory and may serve as key regions of interest for investigating neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: Response&amp;amp;ndash;response (RR) binding, involving the integration of independently planned and executed responses, presents a novel perspective on action control. While behavioral evidence on RR binding has been extensively examined, corresponding electrophysiological evidence remains scarce. This study aims to contribute novel insights into RR binding by event-related potentials (ERP) techniques to provide new evidence for RR binding. Methods: An adapted prime-probe paradigm was employed, in which the required responses could either involve repetition or change conditions from the prime to the probe phase. EEG data were collected from thirty-six participants, and ERP analysis focused on the peak amplitude and latency of the P1 and P3 components. Results: Notably shorter RTs were observed in the response&amp;amp;ndash;repetition conditions compared to others, consistent with previous findings on RR binding. Furthermore, the response&amp;amp;ndash;repetition conditions exhibited larger P3 amplitudes and shorter P1 and P3 latencies relative to other conditions. Conclusions: In summary, this study strengthens the evidence base for RR binding by bridging both behavioral and electrophysiological perspectives.</p>

	<p>Introduction: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool for enhancing stroke diagnosis, aiding treatment decision making, and improving overall patient care. Leading AI-driven platforms such as RapidAI, Brainomix&amp;amp;reg;, and Viz.ai have been developed to assist healthcare professionals in the swift and accurate assessment of stroke patients. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. Characteristic descriptive measures were gathered as appropriate from all included studies, including the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and comparison of the available tools. Results: A total of 31 studies were included, of which 29 studies focused on detecting acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or large vessel occlusions (LVOs), and 2 studies focused on hemorrhagic strokes. The four main tools used were Viz.ai, RapidAI, Brainomix&amp;amp;reg;, and deep learning modules. Conclusions: AI tools in the treatment of stroke have demonstrated usefulness for diagnosing different stroke types, providing high levels of accuracy and helping to make quicker and more precise clinical judgments.</p>

	<p>Background: In the last decade, empirical studies on the beneficial effects of meditation on prosocial capacities have accumulated, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Buddhist sources state that liberating oneself from a fixed view of the self by gaining access to its transitory and malleable nature leads to increased compassion and other prosocial traits. These, however, have not yet been empirically tested. Methods: The current study aims at filling this gap by first examining whether 44 long term meditators differ from 53 controls in prosocial capacities on different levels of the socio-cognitive hierarchy, and second by examining whether these are associated with meditation-induced &amp;amp;lsquo;selfless&amp;amp;rsquo; states, operationalized here as the sense of boundary (SB) flexibility. We capitalize on our previous work on the neurophenomenology of mindfulness-induced SB dissolution, which yielded a neural index of SB-flexibility, solely for the meditators, and examine its correlations with a battery of validated behavioral prosociality tasks. Results: Our findings reveal enhanced low-level prosocial processes in meditators, including enhanced emotion recognition and reduced outgroup bias. We show the stability of SB flexibility over a year, demonstrating consistent high beta deactivation. The neural index of SB flexibility negatively correlates with recognizing negative emotions, suggesting a link to reduced social threat perception. Conclusions: These results connect the neural correlates of SB flexibility to prosociality, supported by stable high beta deactivations. We expect the results to raise awareness regarding the prosocial potential of flexing one&amp;amp;rsquo;s self-boundaries through meditation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1423/v1?src=rss">Factors affecting the knowledge and attitudes of pastoralist women toward long-acting reversible contraceptives utilization in Southern Ethiopia, 2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Many Ethiopian women, especially those who live in rural and pastoral areas, have little knowledge and a negative attitude toward long-acting reversible family planning. Therefore, this study investigated the factors that affect the knowledge and attitudes of women toward long-acting reversible contraceptives among pastoral women in southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 376 women of reproductive age who were randomly selected from three pastoral districts in the West Guji Zone. The data were collected by using a pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Ordinary logistic regression analyses with a p value < 0.05 were used to determine statistical significance. Results Less than half, 118 (31.40%), of the study participants had good knowledge, and 88 (23.40%) had a positive attitude toward long-acting reversible contraceptives. The negative predictors of good knowledge and positive attitudes were never attending school (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.96), not having a job (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.79), having an unplanned pregnancy (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.63) and not having a history of abortion (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.78). Conclusions Having maternal education, being employed, having a planned pregnancy, having partner support for family planning and having a history of abortion were predictors for good knowledge and positive attitudes. Thus, this study recommends collaborative efforts between the health sector and other stakeholders to support women’s employment and education, as well as developing a program to spread family planning-related messaging to enhance women’s attitudes and understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-858/v2?src=rss">Protocol for the systematic review of age and sex in preclinical models of age-correlated diseases [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The translation of animal-based biomedical research into clinical research is often inadequate. Maximizing translation should be central to animal research on human diseases, guiding researchers in study design and animal model selection. However, practical considerations often drive the choice of animal model, which may not always reflect key patient characteristics, such as sex and age, impacting the disease's course. Despite diseases affecting both sexes, researchers frequently use male mice. To address this imbalance, journals and funding agencies have begun questioning the sex of animals used in studies and issued new guidelines. Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade. By systematically assessing the age and sex of the mice, we aim to initiate a discussion on the appropriate choice of animal model to improve the translatability of research results.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1421/v1?src=rss">Comparison of Scapulohumeral rhythm in individuals with and without Forward Shoulder Posture [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Forward Shoulder Posture (FSP) is one of the most common postural deviations of the upper back, which may affect the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR). This study aimed to investigate changes in scapulohumeral rhythm during scapular plane shoulder abduction between individuals with and without FSP. Methods A cross sectional study with two group comparison. Young adults with FSP (N=39) with a forward shoulder angle ≥ 52°and without FSP(N=40) with a forward shoulder angle < 52° were recruited for the study. Scapular upward rotation was measured with the help of two inclinometers during scapular plane shoulder abduction, at resting shoulder abduction, at 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, and at full range of shoulder abduction, and SHR was calculated. The scapulohumeral rhythm was compared between the two groups using an independent t test. Results Data analysis showed a statistically significant difference in scapulohumeral rhythm at 30°(p=0.004), 60°(p=0.013), and 90°(p=0.009) shoulder abduction between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the other ranges of shoulder abduction between the two groups. Conclusion Forward shoulder posture alters the scapulohumeral rhythm between 30 ° and 90°shoulder abduction. Clinicians, trainers, and sports therapists should be aware of this change to intervene at an early stage and prevent the development of pathological conditions around the shoulder.

                Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) is widely used as a reporter gene, aiding in protein recovery and transduction studies. In this study, EGFP was tagged with eleven arginine residues (PolyR) and six histidine residues (His-tag) for purification. The aim was to enhance the synthesis of EGFP-PolyR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and evaluate the effects of polyarginine modification on protein stability and expression levels. The expression of EGFP and EGFP-PolyR in S. cerevisiae was assessed through fluorescence measurements and protein levels. Structural analyses were conducted using in silico tools to investigate changes in beta strands and helices, which were validated through Western blots. Results showed that EGFP-PolyR maintained similar fluorescence levels to EGFP, but with notable structural changes. EGFP-PolyR's final beta strand terminates at Ala228, compared to Gly229 in EGFP, affecting the beta sheet's stability. Structural modifications also included altered helix lengths, with a longer helix 10 and shorter helix 9 in EGFP-PolyR. These alterations, along with shifts in helix-helix interactions, contribute to destabilization. Additionally, EGFP-PolyR exhibited unique gamma coils absent in EGFP, further differentiating its structure. The structural changes led to decreased protein expression and solubility, as indicated by Western blot analysis, with EGFP-PolyR showing significantly lower expression levels. The findings suggest that EGFP-PolyR is prone to aggregation and misfolding, characteristics often associated with aggregation-prone proteins.In conclusion, the polyarginine modification significantly impacts the structural integrity, stability, and solubility of EGFP. While fluorescence is retained, these changes hinder protein detectability and purification, highlighting the importance of considering structural alterations when modifying reporter proteins for experimental use.

                Background “Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)” is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders involving collagen type I with a 10–30% incidence of bleeding diathesis placing these individuals at an increased risk of bleeding. Our study aims to ascertain the risk factors that increase the propensity of perioperative blood transfusions in pediatric population. Methods A single center retrospective observational study of patients aged <18 years undergoing orthopedic surgeries at our tertiary care hospital from January 2016 to August 2024 were included and each surgery was analyzed as a discrete event. Age, type of OI, number of osteotomies, and number of bones operated simultaneously were recorded. The fall in hemoglobin, requirement for blood transfusions and associated factors were analyzed. Results Amongst 53 individuals who underwent surgery, 141 procedures were analyzed. The mean age was 11.07± 5.29 years, majority (n=33;62.2%) were phenotypically type III OI, and 42/53 (79%) patients underwent multiple osteotomies. Significant hemoglobin fall was observed after surgery (p<0.001) and was considerable in patients undergoing various osteotomies (p=0.002). Older children showed a smaller drop in hemoglobin level. Patients with type III OI showed significant hemoglobin fall (1.82 ± 0.86 g/dL). The transfusion requirement was seen in 23 (16.3%) surgeries besides it was significant in those undergoing multiple osteotomies (p= <0.05). Conclusion Our study inferred that the fall in hemoglobin was significant postoperatively in OI patients and was associated with younger age, type III OI, and multiple osteotomies. Before performing orthopedic surgeries on patients with OI, surgeons might consider the latter risk factors to explore therapeutic options aimed at reducing hemorrhage and improving outcomes.

                Background Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is considered the most suitable approach for relative performance efficiency calculation for banks as it is believed to be superior to traditional ratio-based analysis and other conventional performance evaluations. This study provides statistical evidence on the sampling error that can creep into performance evaluation studies using the DEA methodology. Inferences are drawn based on samples, and various preventive measures must be taken to eliminate or avoid sampling errors and misleading results. This study demonstrates the possibility of sampling error in DEA with the secondary data available in financial statements and reports from a sample set of banks. Methods The samples included 15 public sectors and five leading private sector banks in India based on their market share, and the data for calculating efficiencies were retrieved from the published audited reports. The sample data was collected from 2014 to 2017 because the banking sector in India witnessed a series of mergers of public sector banks post-2017, and the data after that would be skewed and not comparable due to the demonetization policy implementation and merger process-related consolidation implemented by the Government of India. The efficiency measures thus computed are further analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results We found statistically significant discrepancies in the efficiency score calculations using DEA approach when specific outlier values. Evidence is provided on statistically significant differences in the efficiencies due to the inclusion and exclusion of particular samples in the DEA. Conclusion The study offers a novel contribution along with statistical evidence on the possible sampling error that can creep into the performance evaluation of organizations while applying the DEA methodology.

Research on cell differentiation facilitates a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes of life, elucidates the intrinsic mechanisms underlying diseases such as cancer, and advances the development of therapeutics and precision medicine. Existing methods for inferring cell differentiation trajectories from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data primarily rely on static gene expression data to measure distances between cells and subsequently infer pseudotime trajectories. In this work, we introduce a novel method, scGRN-Entropy, for inferring cell differentiation trajectories and pseudotime from scRNA-seq data. Unlike existing approaches, scGRN-Entropy improves inference accuracy by incorporating dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks (GRN). In scGRN-Entropy, an undirected graph representing state transitions between cells is constructed by integrating both static relationships in gene expression space and dynamic relationships in the GRN space. The edges of the undirected graph are then refined using pseudotime inferred based on cell entropy in the GRN space. Finally, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm is applied to derive the cell differentiation trajectory. We validate the accuracy of scGRN-Entropy on eight different real scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in inferring cell differentiation trajectories through comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methods.

                <p>by Maurizio Porfiri, Nicole Abaid, Simon Garnier</p>

Despite almost a century of research on energetics in biological systems, we still cannot explain energy regulation in social groups, like ant colonies. How do individuals regulate their collective activity without a centralized control system? What is the role of social interactions in distributing the workload amongst group members? And how does the group save energy by avoiding being constantly active? We offer new insight into these questions by studying an intuitive compartmental model, calibrated with and compared to data on ant colonies. The model describes a previously unexplored balance between positive and negative social feedback driven by individual activity: when activity levels are low, the presence of active individuals stimulates inactive individuals to start working; when activity levels are high, however, active individuals inhibit each other, effectively capping the proportion of active individuals at any one time. Through the analysis of the system stability, we demonstrate that this balance results in energetic spending at the group level growing proportionally slower than the group size. Our finding is reminiscent of Kleiber’s law of metabolic scaling in unitary organisms and highlights the critical role of social interactions in driving the collective energetic efficiency of group-living organisms.

                <p>by Noa L. Hedrich, Eric Schulz, Sam Hall-McMaster, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions. Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.

                <p>by Vitaly V. Ganusov, Afsal Kolloli, Selvakumar Subbian</p>

Tuberculosis (TB), the disease caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), remains a major health problem with 10.6 million cases of the disease and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown. We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv (the segregation coefficient being <i>s</i> = 0.10 in HN878 vs. <i>s</i> = 0.18 in H37Rv). Interestingly, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several (at least 2) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics: one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated, while another, a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Importantly, a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically. Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas, our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas. Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time. Taken together, our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that “rabbits are not mice”.

                <p>by Jojo A. Prentice, Sandhya Kasivisweswaran, Robert van de Weerd, Andrew A. Bridges</p>

Bacteria frequently colonize niches by forming multicellular communities called biofilms. To explore new territories, cells exit biofilms through an active process called dispersal. Biofilm dispersal is essential for bacteria to spread between infection sites, yet how the process is executed at the single-cell level remains mysterious due to the limitations of traditional fluorescent proteins, which lose functionality in large, oxygen-deprived biofilms. To overcome this challenge, we developed a cell-labeling strategy utilizing fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs) and cognate far-red dyes, which remain functional throughout biofilm development, enabling long-term imaging. Using this approach, we characterize dispersal at unprecedented resolution for the global pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. We reveal that dispersal initiates at the biofilm periphery and approximately 25% of cells never disperse. We define novel micro-scale patterns that occur during dispersal, including biofilm compression during cell departure and regional heterogeneity in cell motions. These patterns are attenuated in mutants that reduce overall dispersal or that increase dispersal at the cost of homogenizing local mechanical properties. Collectively, our findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of biofilm dispersal, advancing our understanding of how pathogens disseminate. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of FAPs as a powerful tool for high-resolution studies of microbial dynamics in complex environments.

Understanding the origin of eukaryotic cells is one of the most difficult problems in all of biology. A key challenge relevant to the question of eukaryogenesis is reconstructing the gene repertoire of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). As data sets grow, sketching an accurate genomics-informed picture of early eukaryotic cellular complexity requires provision of analytical resources and a commitment to data sharing. Here, we summarise progress towards understanding the biology of LECA and outline a community approach to inferring its wider gene repertoire. Once assembled, a robust LECA gene set will be a useful tool for evaluating alternative hypotheses about the origin of eukaryotes and understanding the evolution of traits in all descendant lineages, with relevance in diverse fields such as cell biology, microbial ecology, biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine. In this Consensus View, we put forth the status quo and an agreed path forward to reconstruct LECA’s gene content.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1416/v1?src=rss">Autonomizing Public Universities in Ethiopia: Exploring the Potential Challenges [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the challenges faced by Ethiopian public universities in achieving institutional, administrative, academic, and financial autonomy. Institutional autonomy refers to a university’s ability to self-govern, set its mission, and establish policies without external interference. Administrative autonomy concerns decision-making in operations, academic autonomy relates to academic freedom and quality assurance, and financial autonomy involves control over resources and revenue generation. In Ethiopia, centralized governance, political interference, and limited financial strategies create significant barriers to autonomy. Method A qualitative research approach was employed, utilizing semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and direct observations. Data were collected from 59 participants across three public universities. Tools included consent forms, interview guides, focus group discussion guides, and observation checklists. Thematic analysis was used to identify key patterns in the autonomy challenges. The study is grounded in Institutional Theory, Principal-Agent Theory, and Resource Dependency Theory. Result The findings indicate that institutional autonomy is constrained by centralized governance and political interference, limiting universities’ ability to make independent decisions, as explained by Institutional Theory. Administrative autonomy faces similar restrictions, with decision-making influenced by external entities, as highlighted by Principal-Agent Theory. Academic autonomy is challenged by the tension between standardization and institutional diversity, particularly in quality assurance and accreditation. Financial autonomy is limited by restricted revenue sources, economic instability, and a lack of innovative funding strategies, as discussed through Resource Dependency Theory. Conclusion The study concludes that Ethiopian public universities face significant barriers to autonomy. Addressing these challenges requires reducing strict governmental control, improving governance structures, and promoting independent decision-making and sources of incomes. Recommendations The study recommends implementing governance reforms, providing leadership training for university administrators, enhancing academic freedom with flexible quality assurance systems, and diversifying revenue streams through partnerships and expanded university enterprises to ensure financial sustainability.

                Background Home care services are an extension of hospital services provided by hospital staff. The hospital must conduct evaluation, coordination, and education for home care patients to ensure proper care and expedite their recovery. This service also introduces a new concept to the community, as it can help save on costs and equipment. The purpose of this study has been added to the background, namely to determine what factors can influence patient satisfaction with home care services from previously published literature. A systematic review examined the factors influencing patient satisfaction using home care services by following the PRISMA guidelines. PROSPERO submitted and approved the study protocol with the following numbers: CRD42023482315. Researchers have searched articles through the ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The researcher chose the three databases that are open access providers. Including Scopus and ScienceDirect are article search databases that can be accessed directly in the electronic resources of the University of Indonesia Library. The 10-year time span is considered as a source of literature that is still relevant to be used as a reference in evaluating home care service satisfaction. Result Two hundred eighty-eight articles were selected, but 10 met the inclusion criteria. It was found that factors influenced patient satisfaction with home care services and two things that did not affect them: financial aspects and working time. Conclusion Fifteen aspects influence patient satisfaction and two aspects that do not influence patient satisfaction. It is expected that the results of this literature review can be used as a reference for hospitals that provide home care services to pay attention to aspects that can affect satisfaction. The author realizes that the varying methods in the articles reviewed are deficiencies in the results of this study.

                Background Studies have this reported the presence of death anxiety, ranging from near-death experiences to physically ill people, to a simple thought about death, as well as when it is associated with states of loneliness. The Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), based on Eysenk’s incubation theory, has been adapted and validated in different contexts and is still insufficient in countries such as Peru. This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the DAS, its internal structure, and factorial invariance. Methods An online scale was used in 1248 Peruvians aged between 18 and 70 years (M= 27.37, SD= 11.29) from all regions. DAS was validated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), convergent validity, measurement invariance, and internal consistency (reliability). Results Psychometric properties were found with adequate values in its structure and validity based on the internal structure through exploratory factor analysis, where it was found that the components of the scale are interrelated and the data matrix is factorizable. model of three specific factors and a general factor is presented, which is consistent with the theory and has practical utility, revealing adequate statistical values that reflect acceptable levels of reliability. Finally, there was fairness according to sex and age group of the scale by means of factorial invariance analysis. Conclusions Our results indicate adequate psychometric properties and facilitate a better data collection process for future research.

                Background RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific sites on RNA molecules. Identifying these binding sites is crucial for understanding the many functions of RBPs in cellular function, development and disease. Current experimental methods for identifying RBP binding sites, such as ultra-violet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and especially the enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) protocol, were developed to identify authentic RBP binding sites experimentally. Methods To make this data more accessible to the scientific community, we have developed RBP-Tar (https://ncbr.muni.cz/RBP-Tar ), a web server and database that utilises eCLIP data for 167 RBPs mapped on the human genome. The web server allows researchers to easily search and retrieve binding site information by genomic location and RBP name. Use case Researchers can produce lists of all known RBP binding sites on a gene of interest, or produce lists of binding sites for one RBP on different genomic loci. Conclusions Our future goal is to continue to populate the web server with additional experimental datasets from CLIP experiments as they become available and processed, making it an increasingly valuable resource for the scientific community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1252/v3?src=rss">Reporting of angiographic studies in patients diagnosed with a cerebral arteriovenous malformation: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cAVM) is an abnormal tangle of cerebral blood vessels. The consensus document by the Joint Writing Group (JWG) highlighted which cAVM features should be recorded. Subsequent publications have reported cAVM angioarchitecture, but it is unknown if all followed the JWG recommendations. The aim of this systematic review was to describe use of the JWG guidelines. A database search, using the PRISMA checklist, was performed. We describe the proportion of publications that used JWG reporting standards, which standards were used, whether the definitions used differed from the JWG, or if any additional angiographic features were reported. Out of 4306 articles identified, 105 were selected, and a further 114 from other sources. Thirty-three studies (33/219; 15%) specifically referred to using JWG standards. Since the JWG publication, few studies have used their standards to report cAVMs. This implies that the angioarchitecture of cAVMs are not routinely fully described.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>B-cell–depletion via CD20 antibodies is a safe and effective treatment for active relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Both ocrelizumab (OCR) and ofatumumab (OFA) have demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials and are approved for treatment of RMS, yet nothing is known on their comparative effectiveness, especially in the real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study includes patients that were started on either OCR or OFA between September 2021 and December 2023. Patients were followed until June 2024 and recruited at 3 large tertiary centers in Germany (Duesseldorf, Essen, and Giessen). Propensity-score-matching was used to address baseline imbalances among patients. Clinical relapses, presence of new or enlarging MRI lesions and 6-month confirmed disability worsening were evaluated. Non-inferiority of OFA compared to OCR was evaluated through comparison of Kaplan–Meier-estimates.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,138 patients were initially enrolled in the cohort. Following patient selection and propensity-score-matching, 544 OCR and 417 OFA patients were included in the final analysis. In our primary analysis, OFA was non-inferior to OCR in terms of relapses, disability progression, and accrual of MRI lesions. Subgroup analyses confirmed findings in previously naïve and platform-treated patients. Potential differences between OFA and OCR were seen in patients switching from S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We here provide comparative data on the effectiveness of OCR and OFA in patients with active RMS. OFA was non-inferior to OCR in the overall cohort. Potential differences observed in patients switching from S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab require further validation. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is a condition with serious mortality and morbidity rate, resistant to benzodiazepine and second-line antiepileptic drugs. This study aimed to electrophysiologically investigate the combination of NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine and GABAergic agent propofol in an RSE model induced by lithium-pilocarpine in male Sprague–Dawley rats. Seventy-two male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into nine groups. The RSE model was induced by subcutaneous injection of lithium-CI (5 mEq/kg) and intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine-HCl (320 mg/kg), after implanting tripolar EEG electrode. Ketamine (30, 60, and 90 mg/kg), propofol (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg), and combinations of both drugs (15 + 20 and 30 + 40 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to animals with RSE. Video-EEG recordings were taken after inducing model and 48 h later. The efficacy of drugs was statistically evaluated based on spike frequencies (spikes/min) and amplitudes (mV). Compared to RSE group, it was determined that 30 and 60 mg/kg doses of ketamine provided effective seizure control and prevented mortality (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while the 90 mg/kg showed toxic effects in all animals and caused mortality. The 80 mg/kg dose of propofol provided seizure control and reduced the mortality rate to 16.7% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas the 20 mg/kg resulted in a 100% mortality rate. The low-dose ketamine+propofol (15 + 20 mg/kg) combination provided early onset seizure control and were as effective as 80 mg/kg propofol (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The study concluded that in the experimental RSE model, seizure control could be achieved with low-dose combination of ketamine and propofol without the need for high doses as in monotherapy, thus preventing dose-related adverse effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92438">Key determinants of the dual clamp/activator function of Complexin</a></h4>

              
                Complexin determines magnitude and kinetics of synchronized secretion, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Here, we show that the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix at the C-terminus of Complexin II (CpxII, amino acids 115–134) binds to fusion-promoting SNARE proteins, prevents premature secretion, and allows vesicles to accumulate in a release-ready state in mouse chromaffin cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that an unrelated amphipathic helix functionally substitutes for the C-terminal domain (CTD) of CpxII and that amino acid substitutions on the hydrophobic side compromise the arrest of the pre-fusion intermediate. To facilitate synchronous vesicle fusion, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CpxII (amino acids 1–27) specifically cooperates with synaptotagmin I (SytI), but not with synaptotagmin VII. Expression of CpxII rescues the slow release kinetics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding mutant Syt I R233Q, whereas the N-terminally truncated variant of CpxII further delays it. These results indicate that the CpxII NTD regulates mechanisms which are governed by the forward rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Syt I. Overall, our results shed new light on key molecular properties of CpxII that hinder premature exocytosis and accelerate synchronous exocytosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98747">The Jag2/Notch1 signaling axis promotes sebaceous gland differentiation and controls progenitor proliferation</a></h4>

              
                The sebaceous gland (SG) is a vital appendage of the epidermis, and its normal homeostasis and function is crucial for effective maintenance of the skin barrier. Notch signaling is a well-known regulator of epidermal differentiation, and has also been shown to be involved in postnatal maintenance of SGs. However, the precise role of Notch signaling in regulating SG differentiation in the adult homeostatic skin remains unclear. While there is evidence to suggest that Notch1 is the primary Notch receptor involved in regulating the differentiation process, the ligand remains unknown. Using monoclonal therapeutic antibodies designed to specifically inhibit of each of the Notch ligands or receptors, we have identified the Jag2/Notch1 signaling axis as the primary regulator of sebocyte differentiation in mouse homeostatic skin. Mature sebocytes are lost upon specific inhibition of the Jag2 ligand or Notch1 receptor, resulting in the accumulation of proliferative stem/progenitor cells in the SG. Strikingly, this phenotype is reversible, as these stem/progenitor cells re-enter differentiation when the inhibition of Notch activity is lifted. Thus, Notch activity promotes correct sebocyte differentiation, and is required to restrict progenitor proliferation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92775">Brain-derived and in vitro-seeded alpha-synuclein fibrils exhibit distinct biophysical profiles</a></h4>

              
                The alpha-synuclein (αSyn) seeding ampliﬁcation assay (SAA) that allows the generation of disease-speciﬁc in vitro seeded ﬁbrils (SAA ﬁbrils) is used as a research tool to study the connection between the structure of αSyn fibrils, cellular seeding/spreading, and the clinicopathological manifestations of different synucleinopathies. However, structural differences between human brain-derived and SAA αSyn ﬁbrils have been recently highlighted. Here, we characterize the biophysical properties of the human brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils from the brains of patients with Parkinson’s disease with and without dementia (PD, PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and compare them to the ‘model’ SAA ﬁbrils. We report that the brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils show distinct biochemical proﬁles, which were not replicated in the corresponding SAA ﬁbrils. Furthermore, the brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils from all synucleinopathies displayed a mixture of ‘straight’ and ‘twisted’ microscopic structures. However, the PD, PDD, and DLB SAA ﬁbrils had a ’straight’ structure, whereas MSA SAA ﬁbrils showed a ‘twisted’ structure. Finally, the brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils from all four synucleinopathies were phosphorylated (S129). Interestingly, phosphorylated αSyn were carried over to the PDD and DLB SAA fibrils. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the limitation of the SAA ﬁbrils modeling the brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils and pay attention to the necessity of deepening the understanding of the SAA fibrillation methodology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97598">Noisy neuronal populations effectively encode sound localization in the dorsal inferior colliculus of awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Sound location coding has been extensively studied at the central nucleus of the mammalian inferior colliculus (CNIC), supporting a population code. However, this population code has not been extensively characterized on the single-trial level with simultaneous recordings or at other anatomical regions like the dorsal cortex of inferior colliculus (DCIC), which is relevant for learning-induced experience dependent plasticity. To address these knowledge gaps, here we made in two complementary ways large-scale recordings of DCIC populations from awake mice in response to sounds delivered from 13 different frontal horizontal locations (azimuths): volumetric two-photon calcium imaging with ~700 cells simultaneously recorded at a relatively low temporal resolution, and high-density single-unit extracellular recordings with ~20 cells simultaneously recorded at a high temporal resolution. Independent of the method, the recorded DCIC population responses revealed substantial trial-to-trial variation (neuronal noise) which was significantly correlated across pairs of neurons (noise correlations) in the passively listening condition. Nevertheless, decoding analysis supported that these noisy response patterns encode sound location on the single-trial basis, reaching errors that match the discrimination ability of mice. The detected noise correlations contributed to minimize the error of the DCIC population code of sound azimuth. Altogether these findings point out that DCIC can encode sound location in a similar format to what has been proposed for CNIC, opening exciting questions about how noise correlations could shape this code in the context of cortico-collicular input and experience-dependent plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87301">Cancers adapt to their mutational load by buffering protein misfolding stress</a></h4>

              
                In asexual populations that don’t undergo recombination, such as cancer, deleterious mutations are expected to accrue readily due to genome-wide linkage between mutations. Despite this mutational load of often thousands of deleterious mutations, many tumors thrive. How tumors survive the damaging consequences of this mutational load is not well understood. Here, we investigate the functional consequences of mutational load in 10,295 human tumors by quantifying their phenotypic response through changes in gene expression. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), we find that high mutational load tumors up-regulate proteostasis machinery related to the mitigation and prevention of protein misfolding. We replicate these expression responses in cancer cell lines and show that the viability in high mutational load cancer cells is strongly dependent on complexes that degrade and refold proteins. This indicates that the upregulation of proteostasis machinery is causally important for high mutational burden tumors and uncovers new therapeutic vulnerabilities.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92940">Cortical neuroprosthesis-mediated functional ipsilateral control of locomotion in rats with spinal cord hemisection</a></h4>

              
                Control of voluntary limb movement is predominantly attributed to the contralateral motor cortex. However, increasing evidence suggests the involvement of ipsilateral cortical networks in this process, especially in motor tasks requiring bilateral coordination, such as locomotion. In this study, we combined a unilateral thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) with a cortical neuroprosthetic approach to investigate the functional role of the ipsilateral motor cortex in rat movement through spared contralesional pathways. Our findings reveal that in all SCI rats, stimulation of the ipsilesional motor cortex promoted a bilateral synergy. This synergy involved the elevation of the contralateral foot along with ipsilateral hindlimb extension. Additionally, in two out of seven animals, stimulation of a sub-region of the hindlimb motor cortex modulated ipsilateral hindlimb flexion. Importantly, ipsilateral cortical stimulation delivered after SCI immediately alleviated multiple locomotor and postural deficits, and this effect persisted after ablation of the homologous motor cortex. These results provide strong evidence of a causal link between cortical activation and precise ipsilateral control of hindlimb movement. This study has significant implications for the development of future neuroprosthetic technology and our understanding of motor control in the context of SCI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92404">The exocyst complex controls multiple events in the pathway of regulated exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic cells depend on exocytosis to direct intracellularly synthesized material toward the extracellular space or the plasma membrane, so exocytosis constitutes a basic function for cellular homeostasis and communication between cells. The secretory pathway includes biogenesis of secretory granules (SGs), their maturation and fusion with the plasma membrane (exocytosis), resulting in release of SG content to the extracellular space. The larval salivary gland of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is an excellent model for studying exocytosis. This gland synthesizes mucins that are packaged in SGs that sprout from the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network and then undergo a maturation process that involves homotypic fusion, condensation, and acidification. Finally, mature SGs are directed to the apical domain of the plasma membrane with which they fuse, releasing their content into the gland lumen. The exocyst is a hetero-octameric complex that participates in tethering of vesicles to the plasma membrane during constitutive exocytosis. By precise temperature-dependent gradual activation of the Gal4-UAS expression system, we have induced different levels of silencing of exocyst complex subunits, and identified three temporarily distinctive steps of the regulated exocytic pathway where the exocyst is critically required: SG biogenesis, SG maturation, and SG exocytosis. Our results shed light on previously unidentified functions of the exocyst along the exocytic pathway. We propose that the exocyst acts as a general tethering factor in various steps of this cellular process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88224">Water and chloride as allosteric inhibitors in WNK kinase osmosensing</a></h4>

              
                Osmotic stress and chloride regulate the autophosphorylation and activity of the WNK1 and WNK3 kinase domains. The kinase domain of unphosphorylated WNK1 (uWNK1) is an asymmetric dimer possessing water molecules conserved in multiple uWNK1 crystal structures. Conserved waters are present in two networks, referred to here as conserved water networks 1 and 2 (CWN1 and CWN2). Here, we show that PEG400 applied to crystals of dimeric uWNK1 induces de-dimerization. Both the WNK1 the water networks and the chloride-binding site are disrupted by PEG400. CWN1 is surrounded by a cluster of pan-WNK-conserved charged residues. Here, we mutagenized these charges in WNK3, a highly active WNK isoform kinase domain, and WNK1, the isoform best studied crystallographically. Mutation of E314 in the Activation Loop of WNK3 (WNK3/E314Q and WNK3/E314A, and the homologous WNK1/E388A) enhanced the rate of autophosphorylation, and reduced chloride sensitivity. Other WNK3 mutants reduced the rate of autophosphorylation activity coupled with greater chloride sensitivity than wild-type. The water and chloride regulation thus appear linked. The lower activity of some mutants may reflect effects on catalysis. Crystallography showed that activating mutants introduced conformational changes in similar parts of the structure to those induced by PEG400. WNK activating mutations and crystallography support a role for CWN1 in WNK inhibition consistent with water functioning as an allosteric ligand.

	<p>Accurate identification and functional annotation of splicing isoforms and non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), alongside full-length protein-encoding transcripts, are critical for understanding gene (mis)regulation and metabolic reprogramming in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). This study aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate transcriptome resource to improve existing AD transcript databases. Background/Objectives: Gene mis-regulation and metabolic reprogramming play a key role in AD, yet existing transcript databases lack accurate and comprehensive identification of splicing isoforms and lncRNAs. This study aims to generate a refined transcriptome dataset, expanding the understanding of AD onset and progression. Methods: Publicly available RNA-seq data from pre-AD and AD tissues were utilized. Advanced bioinformatics tools were applied to assemble and annotate full-length transcripts, including splicing isoforms and lncRNAs, with an emphasis on correcting errors and enhancing annotation accuracy. Results: A significantly improved transcriptome dataset was generated, which includes detailed annotations of splicing isoforms and lncRNAs. This dataset expands the scope of existing AD transcript databases and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. The findings demonstrate that the refined dataset captures more relevant details about AD progression compared to publicly available data. Conclusions: The newly developed transcriptome resource and the associated analysis tools offer a valuable contribution to AD research, providing deeper insights into the disease&#039;s molecular mechanisms. This work supports future research into gene regulation and metabolic reprogramming in AD and serves as a foundation for exploring novel therapeutic targets.</p>

	<p>Context: Spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) is a condition characterized by muscle stiffness and involuntary movements, which greatly affect movement abilities and overall well-being. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has emerged as a treatment option for managing spasticity, though the current evidence varies. Objective: This systematic review seeks to assess the efficacy of LLLT on spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. We hope it will pinpoint areas where more research is needed and suggest directions for future studies. Method: A search of the literature was performed across databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Elicit. The search utilized keywords and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Only studies conducted in English that focused on children with cerebral palsy (CP) and explored the effects of LLLT on spasticity were considered. The quality of the selected studies was evaluated using assessment tools. Results: The search identified 534 references, out of which eight studies met the screening criteria for inclusion. All cited papers indicated reductions in spasticity with further mention of reduced pain and greater muscle strength by some authors. Conclusions: This review indicates that LLLT shows promise in decreasing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Nevertheless, a lack of treatment parameters, heterogeneity in research methods, and a lack of objective outcome measures weaken the results. This review underscores the importance of standardized procedures and carefully planned randomized controlled trials to establish conclusive findings on the effectiveness of LLLT in this population.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in brain tumor diagnosis by providing clear visualization of soft tissues without the use of ionizing radiation. Given the increasing incidence of brain tumors, there is an urgent need for reliable diagnostic tools, as misdiagnoses can lead to harmful treatment decisions and poor outcomes. While machine learning has significantly advanced medical diagnostics, achieving both high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. Methods: This study proposes a hybrid model that integrates MobileNetV2 for feature extraction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for the classification of brain tumors. The model was trained and validated using the Kaggle MRI brain tumor dataset, which includes 7023 images categorized into four types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. MobileNetV2&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficient architecture was leveraged for feature extraction, and SVM was used to enhance classification accuracy. Results: The proposed hybrid model showed excellent results, achieving Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.99 for glioma, 0.97 for meningioma, and 1.0 for both pituitary tumors and the no tumor class. These findings highlight that the MobileNetV2-SVM hybrid not only improves classification accuracy but also reduces computational overhead, making it suitable for broader clinical use. Conclusions: The MobileNetV2-SVM hybrid model demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing brain tumor diagnostics by offering a balance of precision and computational efficiency. Its ability to maintain high accuracy while operating efficiently could lead to better outcomes in medical practice, particularly in resource limited settings.</p>

	<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is among the most prevalent chronic autoimmune disorders affecting the central nervous system. In Poland, the MS incidence rate is 6.3 per 100,000 patients. The results of studies indicate that people suffering from MS are less involved in sexual life in both the physical and emotional aspects, they assess that sex is less important to them than to healthy people, and their sexual motivation is limited, especially its physical dimension. Methods: A total of 121 people participated in the study. It used four questionnaires: authors&amp;amp;rsquo; survey on sociodemographic and biomedical data, Short Sexual Well-Being Scale, Guy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Neurological Disability Scale, and Expanded Disability Status Scale. Results: A positive and moderate relationship was found between neurological disability and physical disability. Also, the correlation between neurological disability and the number of sexual dysfunctions was significant. Problems in the neurological sphere were also negatively associated with sexual well-being. Physical disability was not significantly associated with the level of sexual well-being or the number of declared sexual dysfunctions. The number of dysfunctions was moderately associated with the levels of sexual well-being. The polynomial regression analyses did not find any non-linear relationships between the severity of disability and sexual well-being. Conclusions: This study suggests that the occurrence of sexual dysfunctions can be an important subject in MS patients&amp;amp;rsquo; sexual well-being. It underlines the fact that the subject of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s sexuality cannot be omitted while providing medical and psychological support for individuals with MS.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study explores whether sex differences in reactive aggression (RA) and proactive aggression (PA) are attributable to sex, gender role orientation, or their interaction and explores the neuroanatomical characteristics of these sex differences. Methods: In a sample of 108 males and 126 females, we examined the sex-by-gender role orientation interaction on RA, PA, and brain gray matter volume (GMV). Then, we explored the relationship between aggression and regional GMV. Results: When the effects of sex and gender role orientation on aggression were disentangled, there were no sex differences in RA, regardless of gender role orientation. However, sex differences (male &amp;amp;gt; female) in PA were observed within the masculine group but not within the feminine group. Brain imaging results revealed sex differences (male &amp;amp;gt; female) on the right inferior frontal gyrus GMV, a region involved in cognitive control, within the masculine group. Moreover, a negative association between PA and the right inferior frontal gyrus GMV was observed in masculine females rather than masculine males. Conclusions: These findings indicate that gender role orientation has a more significant effect on aggression than sex, particularly with regard to PA, and hint that the goal of cognitive control involved in displaying PA differs in masculine males and masculine females.</p>

                Murakawa et al. demonstrate that pressure overload to the heart induces Bcl2-L-13-mediated mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Furthermore, its activation by phosphorylation is essential for maintaining cardiac function. The kinase library screening revealed that AMPKα2 is the responsible kinase. These findings elucidate the cardioprotective role of Bcl2-L-13.

                Fonseca et al. show that TRIM65 is a positive regulator of the innate immune response upon virus infection. Mechanistically, TRIM65 activation releases its BBCC domain, facilitating IRF3 binding and K6-linked ubiquitination. This results in enhanced IRF3 chromatin recruitment and activation of the IFNβ promoter leading to a robust antiviral response.

	<p>Objectives: Cerebral edema, a prevalent consequence of brain injury, is associated with significant mortality and disability. Timely diagnosis and monitoring are crucial for patient prognosis. There is a pressing clinical demand for a real-time, non-invasive cerebral edema monitoring method. Ultrasound methods are prime candidates for such investigations due to their non-invasive nature. Methods: Acute cerebral edema was introduced in rats by permanently occluding the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Ultrasonic echo signals were collected at nine time points over a 24 h period to extract features from both the time and frequency domains. Concurrently, histomorphological changes were examined. We utilized support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LogR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) algorithms for classifying cerebral edema types, and SVM, RF, linear regression (LR), and feedforward neural network (FNNs) for predicting the cerebral infarction volume ratio. Results: The integration of 16 ultrasonic features associated with cerebral edema development with the RF model enabled effective classification of cerebral edema types, with a high accuracy rate of 97.9%. Additionally, it provided an accurate prediction of the cerebral infarction volume ratio, with an R2 value of 0.8814. Conclusions: Our proposed strategy classifies cerebral edema and predicts the cerebral infarction volume ratio with satisfactory precision. The fusion of ultrasound echo features with machine learning presents a promising non-invasive approach for the monitoring of cerebral edema.</p>

	<p>Background: The role of non-linguistic factors, such as executive functions, in the reading comprehension process has been analyzed. The present research sought to investigate the relationship between executive functions and reading comprehension. Methods: In an exploratory cross-sectional study, a group of 89 fourth-grade students were evaluated, considering a balanced number of children with and without reading comprehension difficulties. Results: The results indicate that students with reading comprehension difficulties present a lowered profile with respect to both executive functions and reading variables. The path analysis indicates the presence of differences in the variables that explain reading comprehension for both groups. While in the case of students without reading comprehension difficulties, working memory has both a direct and an indirect effect, i.e., through vocabulary, on reading comprehension; in the case of children with reading comprehension difficulties, only cognitive flexibility has a direct impact. In both cases, inhibition has an indirect impact through vocabulary. Conclusions: We reflect on the differentiated role of executive functions according to the level of development of reading skills, highlighting the possibility that some skills may act in a compensatory manner in the presence of general difficulties. The role of vocabulary in the relationship between executive skills and reading is highlighted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-25/v3?src=rss">Household resilience of women migrant worker sellers of Jamu Gendong [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The selling of Jamu Gendong (an Indonesian traditional herbal medicine), is closely associated with the informal work of women who migrate to different regions. In Sukoharjo Regency and Wonogiri Regency, Central Java Province, the pressing need to meet household necessities in their places of origin compels women to assume the role of breadwinners. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the livelihood capital and resilience of migrant women selling jamu gendong. Methods The study was conducted in Ciamis Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia, in November 2022, using quantitative and qualitative methods. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample comprised 51 women selected through snowball sampling and actively involved in selling Jamu Gendong, along with six key individuals from relevant agencies. Results The research findings indicate that the households of migrant women who sell jamu gendong can survive and adapt during their migration to prevent poverty by implementing diverse livelihood strategies. They are the only ones who move without their family members renting a place to live with them. This research has identified various capital sources, including productive age and skills in preparing jamu gendong; physical capital, including road infrastructure, markets, and access to health and education facilities; and natural, social, and financial capital. This research provides an in-depth understanding of women’s roles in family economic resilience, diversification of life strategies, the importance of social capital in migrant networks, economic empowerment through migration, and the influence of cultural values on livelihood strategies. Conclusions The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the resilience demonstrated by migrant women selling jamu gendong. However, further research should be conducted in areas beyond the city center to obtain a holistic view of their resilience.

                Low-stakes assessments (LSAs) are widely used in medical education to promote continuous learning by providing formative feedback and minimizing the high-stress environment associated with high-stakes assessments. While LSAs are recognized for their role in supporting student learning, questions remain about their reliability and validity. This scoping review aims to systematically identify and synthesize existing literature on the reliability and validity of LSAs within medical education contexts. This study aims to map the methodologies used to establish psychometric parameters, identify problems, and offer best practices. The review will use the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, encompassing a comprehensive search across six academic databases and grey literature to identify relevant studies published from 2000 onward. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract data, using the Covidence tool for systematic screening and data extraction. Data will be analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide an overview of reliability and validity evidence for LSAs in medical education. Insights into motivational and psychometric theories, such as Self-Determination Theory, Classical Test Theory, and Generalizability Theory, that inform LSA design and implementation will be used to analyse the findings in this review. Expected outcomes include a detailed map of the literature on LSA reliability and validity, identification of key challenges, theoretical underpinnings and recommended strategies for improving LSA practices in medical education. Findings will inform future research and provide guidelines for optimizing the use of LSAs to enhance student learning outcomes, assessment integrity, and the educational experience in medical training.

                <p>Social status and dominance are critical factors influencing well-being and survival across multiple species. However, dominance behaviors vary widely across species, from elaborate feather displays in birds to aggression in chimps. To effectively study dominance, it is essential to clearly define and reliably measure dominance behaviors. In laboratory settings, C57BL/6 mice are commonly used to study dominance due to their stable and linear social hierarchies. However, other mouse strains are also used for laboratory research. Despite substantial evidence for strain effects on behavioral repertoires, the impact of strain on dominance in mice remains largely unstudied. To address this gap, we compared dominance behaviors between CD1 and C57BL/6 male mice across four assays: observation of agonistic behaviors, urine marking, tube test, and a reward competition. We found that CD1 mice demonstrate increased fighting, increased territorial marking through urination, and increased pushing and resisting in the tube test. We used unsupervised machine learning and pose estimation data from the reward competitions to uncover behavioral differences across strains and across rank differences between competing pairs. Of the four assays, urine marking and agonistic behaviors showed the strongest correlation with dominance in both strains. Most notably, we found that CD1 dominance rankings based on the tube test negatively correlated with rankings from all three other assays, suggesting that the tube test may measure a different behavior in CD1 mice. Our results highlight that behaviors can be strain-specific in mice and studies that measure social rank should consider assays carefully to promote reproducibility.</p>

                The co-infection of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) and hydatid disease is rare. Diagnosis and treatment of this co-infection may be challenging as both diseases present with overlapping clinical manifestations, especially in war zones where the health system is destroyed. We are reporting a 45-year-old female police officer transferred to Sinnar Sudan due to ongoing conflict. She was admitted with chronic cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. The preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary TB was made based on chest X-ray examination and sputum analysis. Further imaging showed cystic lesions in both the liver and the lungs, and thus a diagnosis of Echinococcosis was made. Surgical intervention was done successfully followed by the courses of Albendazole and anti-TB medication. The clinical condition of the patient improved, with the disappearance of all symptoms. This case represents the diagnostic dilemma of dual infections in the areas of their endemicity because of the symptomatology overlap that might occur and result in an erroneous diagnosis. It does demand an appropriate diagnostic approach, thus, with advanced imaging applications, and once more, emphasizes the interdisciplinary attitude in its treatment for the best possible result.

                Nigeria is located south of the Sahara and is confronted with rapid desertification, with severe impacts in northern Nigeria with signs of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southward of Nigeria. Therefore, this study assessed the rate of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southwards in Nigeria. The climate of Imo State was studied using Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET)data. The climatic variables studied were annual rainfall, maximum and minimum annual temperatures. The mean temperature was computed from the temperature data. Data from the 30-year period from 1987 to 2016 were used. The annual rainfall and temperature data were divided into three decades, from 1987 to 1996, 1997 to 2006, and 2007 to 2016, to study the variation in decades. Mean monthly variations were also studied. Land features were also assessed. Desert encroachment was assessed in the study area using the criteria for the evaluation of desertification status proposed by the FAO/UNEP (1984). The results revealed that annual rainfall in Owerri was highest in the first decade, with a mean of 2,526.2 mm and the lowest in the third decade, with a mean of 2,278.66 mm. This shows a drop in annual rainfall as the years progressed. The results also reveal that the annual rainfall totals in Imo State are reducing by 13.50 mm annually, indicating desert encroachment as evidenced in loss of vegetation and erosion menace. According to the FAO/UNEP (1984) rating of desertification, desert encroachment in the study area is rated as ‘moderate.’ The maximum temperature shows a mean of 32 °C for the first decade, 32.5 °C for the second decade, and 32.5 °C for the third decade. The mean annual temperature of Owerri was found to increase by 0.02 ° °C per annum. This shows the atmospheric warming of Imo State.

                Background Given the high prevalence of tobacco use, India presents a significant challenge in tobacco control. Yet, the support received for tobacco cessation is suboptimal. Hence, the aim of this narrative review was to identify and heuristically evaluate ‘high-quality’ and ‘engaging’ tobacco cessation mobile apps using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Also, to categorize and analyse their features with respect to engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. Methods A systematic search of tobacco cessation apps was done within app stores of prominent smartphone platforms developed by Apple and Android. The following search terms: ‘quit smoking,’ ‘smoking cessation, ‘stop smoking,’ ‘smoking therapy,’ ‘quit tobacco,’ ‘cigarette cessation,’ ‘cold turkey,’ and ‘quit cigarette.’ Pearson’s correlations were used to analyse correlations between app scores (Total score app-quality/mean score) and downloads/ratings and number of downloads with the overall MARS score. A Chi-square test was performed to analyse any association between app focus and app release dates. Results Total MARS scores ranged from 3.1 to 4.9. Quitsure app (4.9), Craving to Quit! app (4.8) and Stop Tobacco Mobile Trainer: Quit Smoking App (4.74) were ranked the highest according to the MARS overall mean score. Older apps focussed more on mere goal setting or substance use, as compared to behaviour change; whereas, recently developed apps are now focussing more on behaviour change. Conclusions The content and functionality of behaviour change-focused apps were of higher quality than those of other app categories. These recently developed mHealth apps can effectively supersede the traditional smoking cessation methods.

                This article explores the determinants of the consumption of geographical indication agricultural products through a ten-year systematic review. In recent years, the demand for healthier and safer products from consumers has been continuously increasing owing to the influence of the geographical indication of agricultural products. Geographical indication products, a type of label that associates food with specific regions, occupy a certain position in the global food market. This article aims to answer research questions about the determinants of the consumption of geographical indication agricultural products and provide a comparative analysis of five literature reviews related to this topic. We collected and processed relevant research data through a systematic literature review and provided transparent, complete, and accurate explanations using the PRISMA criterion. The research results reveal the consumer response to the geographical indication of agricultural products and the determining factors of different responses. The research in this article is of great significance for understanding the consumption trends and important information of geographical indication of agricultural products, helping enterprises better understand consumer behavior, and improving the income of farmers, producers, and enterprises.

                Background A novel modality of cancer treatment based on exposure to non-contact electric fields has been developed to reduce cancer incidence. However, the safety of the electric field exposure was not fully investigated. Therefore, This study aimed to observe the safety of electric field exposure on kidney and liver structures. Methods Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into one control group and three treatment groups. Animals were treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene for mammary tumour induction and exposed to non-contact electric fields individually for 10 hours a day for three weeks. Fresh samples of the kidney and liver were collected for observation of structural damage in both organs. Both organs were prepared for histopathological cross-sectioning using the paraffin method and Hematoxylin and Eosin staining followed by histological scoring using the post-examination masking method. Results Damages found in the kidney were as follows: thickening of the Bowman capsule, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, cloudy swelling, epithelial sloughing, inflammation, haemorrhage, and congestion. In addition, the number of inflammation and haemorrhage in the kidney structure of healthy rats that were exposed to electric fields was significantly lower than that in the control group. All damages to the kidneys were also found in the liver, but each showed a different degree of damage. Exposure to this electric field can cause haemorrhagic damage to the livers of healthy rats, but not to rats with breast cancer. Conclusions Exposure to non-contact electric fields can cause haemorrhagic damage to the livers of healthy rats, however, in other liver tissues and the kidneys, exposure to this electric field was safe. It can even decrease the number of inflammations and haemorrhages in the kidneys.

                Background There have been significant changes in the lifestyles of individuals in the past few decades, which has led to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Both smoking and chewing forms of tobacco are highly prevalent, especially in India, and are implicated as causes of diseases, including oropharyngeal carcinomas. Effective tobacco cessation techniques and sources can help overcome addiction and reduce the disease burden in society. The aim was to evaluate the quality and readability of contents of various sources on an internet website about tobacco cessation. Objectives i) To evaluate the readability of internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests and the quality of internet content (Google) by using the JAMA benchmark, HONcode and DISCERN questionnaire. Methods A content review was employed to screen the content of the Google search engine for educational tobacco cessation websites, and the top 50 websites were selected according to criteria and reviewed by two reviewers. The readability of the internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation was evaluated using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. The quality of the screened sites was evaluated by using the JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) benchmark, HONcode (The Health on the Net Code of Conduct) and DISCERN (Discerning the Quality of Information for Choosing Treatments) questionnaire, and the readability and quality of the screened websites were correlated using the above instruments. Results FK readability ease was found to be 49% standard and 30% easy. The FK grade test found that 33% of the content could be easily understood by < 5th grade. All 4 JAMA benchmarks were met by 23% of websites, and authorship was the least fulfilled criterion. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between FK ease score and FK grade score. Conclusions The Read-ability Ease and Read-ability Grade Levels of the websites related to tobacco cessation were not standard, and few websites fulfilled the JAMA benchmarks and had HONcode certification.

                <p>by Shuanger Li, Davorka Gulisija, Oana Carja</p>

Coexistence of multiple strains of a pathogen in a host population can present significant challenges to vaccine development or treatment efficacy. Here we discuss a novel mechanism that can increase rates of long-lived strain polymorphism, rooted in the presence of social structure in a host population. We show that social preference of interaction, in conjunction with differences in immunity between host subgroups, can exert varying selection pressure on pathogen strains, creating a balancing mechanism that supports stable viral coexistence, independent of other known mechanisms. We use population genetic models to study rates of pathogen heterozygosity as a function of population size, host population composition, mutant strain fitness differences and host social preferences of interaction. We also show that even small periodic epochs of host population stratification can lead to elevated strain coexistence. These results are robust to varying social preferences of interaction, overall differences in strain fitnesses, and spatial heterogeneity in host population composition. Our results highlight the role of host population social stratification in increasing rates of pathogen strain diversity, with effects that should be considered when designing policies or treatments with a long-term view of curbing pathogen evolution.

                <p>by Anush Devadhasan, Oren Kolodny, Oana Carja</p>

Many evolving ecosystems have spatial structures that can be conceptualized as networks, with nodes representing individuals or homogeneous subpopulations and links the patterns of spread between them. Prior models of evolution on networks do not take ecological niche differences and eco-evolutionary interplay into account. Here, we combine a resource competition model with evolutionary graph theory to study how heterogeneous topological structure shapes evolutionary dynamics under global frequency-dependent ecological interactions. We find that the addition of ecological competition for resources can produce a reversal of roles between amplifier and suppressor networks for deleterious mutants entering the population. We show that this effect is a nonlinear function of ecological niche overlap and discuss intuition for the observed dynamics using simulations and analytical approximations. We use these theoretical results together with spatial representations from imaging data to show that, for ductal carcinoma, where tumor growth is highly spatially constrained, with cells confined to a tree-like network of ducts, the topological structure can lead to higher rates of deleterious mutant hitchhiking with metabolic driver mutations, compared to tumors characterized by different spatial topologies.

                <p>by Bianca Pellegrino, Keren David, Stav Rabani, Bar Lampert, Thuy Tran, Edward Doherty, Marta Piecychna, Roberto Meza-Romero, Lin Leng, Dov Hershkovitz, Arthur A. Vandenbark, Richard Bucala, Shirly Becker-Herman, Idit Shachar</p>

CD74 is a cell-surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF binding to CD74 induces a signaling cascade resulting in the release of its cytosolic intracellular domain (CD74-ICD), which regulates transcription in naïve B and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of CD74 in the regulation of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and is characterized by massive infiltration of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment, making this tumor a good candidate for immunotherapy. The tumor and immune cells in TNBC express high levels of CD74; however, the function of this receptor in the tumor environment has not been extensively characterized. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) and tolerogenic dendritic cells) tol-DCs (were previously shown to attenuate the antitumor immune response in TNBC. Here, we demonstrate that CD74 enhances tumor growth by inducing the expansion of tumor-infiltrating tol-DCs and Bregs. Utilizing CD74-KO mice, Cre-flox mice lacking CD74 in CD23<sup>+</sup> mature B cells, mice lacking CD74 in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> population, and a CD74 inhibitor (DRQ), we elucidate the mechanism by which CD74 inhibits antitumor immunity. MIF secreted from the tumor cells activates CD74 expressed on DCs. This activation induces the binding of CD74-ICD to the SP1 promotor, resulting in the up-regulation of SP1 expression. SP1 binds the IL-1β promotor, leading to the down-regulation of its transcription. The reduced levels of IL-1β lead to decreased antitumor activity by allowing expansion of the tol-DC, which induces the expansion of the Breg population, supporting the cross-talk between these 2 populations. Taken together, these results suggest that CD74<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs are the dominant cell type involved in the regulation of TNBC progression. These findings indicate that CD74 might serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC.

<p>BLA-projecting NBM cholinergic neurons contribute to the encoding of fundamental and life-threatening experiences in both rodents and primates. What is not known is the extent to which the physiology and morphology of these neurons have also been conserved. We found that rhesus macaque BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons were both more intrinsically excitable and less morphologically compact than their mouse homologs. Clusters of the two cell types were easily distinguishable on both unsupervised (UMAP) and supervised (LDA) representations of their electromorphic profiles. Given the shared purpose of the circuits in which these neurons participate, this finding raises questions about (and offers constraints on) how these distinct types result in similar behavior.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cholinergic projection neurons of the nucleus basalis and substantia innominata (NBM/SI) densely innervate the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and have been shown to contribute to the encoding of fundamental and life-threatening experiences. Given the vital importance of these circuits in the acquisition and retention of memories that are essential for survival in a changing environment, it is not surprising that the basic anatomical organization of the NBM/SI is well conserved across animal classes as diverse as teleost and mammal. What is not known is the extent to which the physiology and morphology of NBM/SI neurons have also been conserved. To address this issue, we made patch-clamp recordings from NBM/SI neurons in ex vivo slices of two widely divergent mammalian species, mouse and rhesus macaque, focusing our efforts on cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA. We then reconstructed most of these recorded neurons post hoc to characterize neuronal morphology. We found that rhesus macaque BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons were both more intrinsically excitable and less morphologically compact than their mouse homologs. Combining measurements of 18 physiological features and 13 morphological features, we illustrate the extent of the separation. Although macaque and mouse neurons both exhibited considerable within-group diversity and overlapped with each other on multiple individual metrics, a combined morphoelectric analysis demonstrates that they form two distinct neuronal classes. Given the shared purpose of the circuits in which these neurons participate, this finding raises questions about (and offers constraints on) how these distinct classes result in similar behavior.</p>

                Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished in intensity, the virus continues to circulate globally. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a key enzyme in the life cycle of the virus, making it important for the development of treatments against future variants of the virus. In this work, Peruvian natural compounds were evaluated against different mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Methods In silico techniques such as virtual screening, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and energy estimation analysis were applied. Results Of the tested compounds by virtual screening, rutin was identified as the best binding agent against the different proposed Mpro mutations. In addition, computational simulations and energy estimation analysis demonstrated the high structural and energetic stability between the Mpro-rutin systems. Conclusions Overall, our study identified rutin as the most promising compound with a strong affinity for various Mpro mutations, potentially playing a key role in the development of new treatments for emerging viral variants.

                Background The provision of effective musculoskeletal physiotherapy and treatment outcomes are challenged by the shortage of resources, limitations in adherence to clinical guidelines, and client unacceptability. This study aims to evaluate the process quality of musculoskeletal physiotherapy service in the physiotherapy department of Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Mekelle, Ethiopia, 2020. Method This is a health facility-based single-embedded case study design that involves both quantitative and qualitative methods to describe the service using a three dimensions assessment for quality service evaluation (compliance of the unit, technical compliance, and service acceptability). The quantitative data was collected through document review and observation of the musculoskeletal physiotherapy unit, direct observations of 20 client-physiotherapist interactions, and chart review on systematically selected 172 client charts. For qualitative data; in-depth interviews with five Key informants and 21 clients were conducted. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS v.25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was done and data were presented using frequency and percentage. The calculated outputs were used to judge the overall service against the predetermined criteria (i.e. Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor). Results The compliance of the musculoskeletal physiotherapy unit, service providers’ technical compliance, and service acceptability by the users were judged poor (56.1%), fair (60.1%), and good (73.1%) respectively. The compliance of physiotherapists in recording patient information was concerningly poor (30.2%). The majority of clients were satisfied with the service and adhered to their treatment. Conclusion & recommendation The overall service process quality of physiotherapy service was judged as fair (62.55%). However, the assessed dimensions were not as per the expected standard. Therefore, the relevant stakeholders are recommended to improve the service provision gaps.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) in post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients across the adult lifespan.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional study of the first consecutive 200 PNP and 1,100 NNP patients evaluated at a Neuro-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinic between May 2020 and March 2023. Patients were divided into younger (18–44 years), middle-age (45–64 years), and older (65+ years) age groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals accounted for 142 of 200 (71%) of PNP and 995 of 1100 (90.5%) of NNP patients. Significant age-related differences in the frequencies of comorbidities and abnormal neurologic findings demonstrated higher prevalence in older patients. Conversely, 10 months from COVID-19 onset, we found significant age-related differences in Neuro-PASC symptoms indicating lower prevalence, and therefore, symptom burden, in older individuals. Moreover, there were significant age-related differences in subjective impression of fatigue (median [interquartile range (IQR)] patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] score: younger 64 [57–69], middle-age 63 [57–68], older 60.5 [50.8–68.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (median [IQR] PROMIS score: younger 57 [51–63], middle-age 56 [53–63], older 54 [46.8–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.002) in the NNP group, commensurate with higher impairment in quality of life (QoL) among younger patients. Finally, there were significant age-related differences in objective executive function (median [IQR] National Institutes of Health [NIH] toolbox score: younger 48 [35–63], middle-age 49 [38–63], older 54.5 [45–66.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.01), and working memory (median [IQR] NIH toolbox score: younger 47 [40–53], middle-age 50 [44–57], older 48 [43–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.0002) in NNP patients, with the worst performance coming from the younger group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals are disproportionally affected by Neuro-PASC regardless of acute COVID-19 severity. Although older people more frequently have abnormal neurologic findings and comorbidities, younger and middle-age patients suffer from a higher burden of Neuro-PASC symptoms and cognitive dysfunction contributing to decreased QoL. Neuro-PASC principally affects adults in their prime, contributing to profound public health and socioeconomic impacts warranting dedicated resources for prevention, diagnosis and interventions.
