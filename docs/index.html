              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterizing gene expression in an in vitro biomechanical strain model of joint health [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Both genetic and environmental factors appear to contribute to joint health and disease. For example, pathological levels of biomechanical stress on joints play a notable role in initiation and progression of osteoarthritis (OA), a common chronic degenerative joint disease affecting articular cartilage and underlying bone. Population-level gene expression studies of cartilage cells experiencing biomechanical stress may uncover gene-by-environment interactions relevant to human joint health. Methods: To build a foundation for population-level gene expression studies in cartilage, we applied differentiation protocols to develop an in vitro system of chondrogenic cell lines (iPSC-chondrocytes). We characterized gene regulatory responses of three human iPSC-chondrocyte lines to cyclic tensile strain treatment. We measured the contribution of biological and technical factors to gene expression variation in this system. Results: We identified patterns of gene regulation that differ between strain-treated and control iPSC-chondrocytes. Differentially expressed genes between strain and control conditions are enriched for gene sets relevant to joint health and OA. Furthermore, even in this small sample, we found several genes that exhibit inter-individual expression differences in response to mechanical strain, including genes previously implicated in OA. Conclusions: Expanding this system to include iPSC-chondrocytes from a larger number of individuals will allow us to characterize and better understand gene-by-environment interactions related to joint health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling time-varying volatility using GARCH models: evidence from the Indian stock market [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this study, we examined the volatility of the Indian stock market from 2008 to 2021. Owing to the financial crisis, volatility forecasting of the Indian stock market has become crucial for economic and financial analysts. An empirical study of the returns of the NSE indices revealed an autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic trend in the Indian stock market. Methods: Using GARCH 1, 1 (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) and FIGARCH (fractionally integrated GARCH), we examine investor behaviour and the persistence of long-term volatility. Results: The empirical findings of the estimated models suggest that shocks persist for a long time in NSE returns. Furthermore, bad news has a greater impact on stock volatility than good news. The return on assets is stable but highly volatile, even though the Indian economy has experienced the global crash to some extent. Conclusions: Models of volatility derived from the GARCH equation provide accurate forecasts and are useful for portfolio allocation, performance measurement, and option valuation.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), diagnosed at a mean age of 32 years. CNS glia are crucial players in the onset of MS, primarily involving astrocytes and microglia that can cause/allow massive oligodendroglial cells death, without immune cell infiltration. Current therapeutic approaches are aimed at modulating inflammatory reactions during relapsing episodes, but lack the ability to induce very significant repair mechanisms. In this review article, different experimental approaches based mainly on the application of different cell types as therapeutic strategies applied for the induction of myelin repair and/or the amelioration of the disease are discussed. Regarding this issue, different cell sources were applied in various experimental models of MS, with different results, both in significant improvements in remyelination and the reduction of neuroinflammation and glial activation, or in neuroprotection. All cell types tested have advantages and disadvantages, which makes it difficult to choose a better option for therapeutic application in MS. New strategies combining cell-based treatment with other applications would result in further improvements and would be good candidates for MS cell therapy and myelin repair.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative MRI reveals differences in striatal myelin in children with DLD</a></h4>

              
                Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by receptive or expressive language difficulties or both. While theoretical frameworks and empirical studies support the idea that there may be neural correlates of DLD in frontostriatal loops, findings are inconsistent across studies. Here, we use a novel semiquantitative imaging protocol – multi-parameter mapping (MPM) – to investigate microstructural neural differences in children with DLD. The MPM protocol allows us to reproducibly map specific indices of tissue microstructure. In 56 typically developing children and 33 children with DLD, we derived maps of (1) longitudinal relaxation rate R1 (1/T1), (2) transverse relaxation rate R2* (1/T2*), and (3) Magnetization Transfer saturation (MTsat). R1 and MTsat predominantly index myelin, while R2* is sensitive to iron content. Children with DLD showed reductions in MTsat values in the caudate nucleus bilaterally, as well as in the left ventral sensorimotor cortex and Heschl’s gyrus. They also had globally lower R1 values. No group differences were noted in R2* maps. Differences in MTsat and R1 were coincident in the caudate nucleus bilaterally. These findings support our hypothesis of corticostriatal abnormalities in DLD and indicate abnormal levels of myelin in the dorsal striatum in children with DLD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bumblebees retrieve only the ordinal ranking of foraging options when comparing memories obtained in distinct settings</a></h4>

              
                Are animals’ preferences determined by absolute memories for options (e.g. reward sizes) or by their remembered ranking (better/worse)? The only studies examining this question suggest humans and starlings utilise memories for both absolute and relative information. We show that bumblebees’ learned preferences are based only on memories of ordinal comparisons. A series of experiments showed that after learning to discriminate pairs of different flowers by sucrose concentration, bumblebees preferred flowers (in novel pairings) with (1) higher ranking over equal absolute reward, (2) higher ranking over higher absolute reward, and (3) identical qualitative ranking but different quantitative ranking equally. Bumblebees used absolute information in order to rank different flowers. However, additional experiments revealed that, even when ranking information was absent (i.e. bees learned one flower at a time), memories for absolute information were lost or could no longer be retrieved after at most 1 hr. Our results illuminate a divergent mechanism for bees (compared to starlings and humans) of learned preferences that may have arisen from different adaptations to their natural environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Loss of full-length dystrophin expression results in major cell-autonomous abnormalities in proliferating myoblasts</a></h4>

              
                Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects myofibers and muscle stem cells, causing progressive muscle degeneration and repair defects. It was unknown whether dystrophic myoblasts—the effector cells of muscle growth and regeneration—are affected. Using transcriptomic, genome-scale metabolic modelling and functional analyses, we demonstrate, for the first time, convergent abnormalities in primary mouse and human dystrophic myoblasts. In <i>Dmd</i><sup>mdx</sup> myoblasts lacking full-length dystrophin, the expression of 170 genes was significantly altered. <i>Myod1</i> and key genes controlled by MyoD (<i>Myog, Mymk, Mymx</i>, epigenetic regulators, ECM interactors, calcium signalling and fibrosis genes) were significantly downregulated. Gene ontology analysis indicated enrichment in genes involved in muscle development and function. Functionally, we found increased myoblast proliferation, reduced chemotaxis and accelerated differentiation, which are all essential for myoregeneration. The defects were caused by the loss of expression of full-length dystrophin, as similar and not exacerbated alterations were observed in dystrophin-null <i>Dmd</i><sup>mdx-βgeo</sup> myoblasts. Corresponding abnormalities were identified in human DMD primary myoblasts and a dystrophic mouse muscle cell line, confirming the cross-species and cell-autonomous nature of these defects. The genome-scale metabolic analysis in human DMD myoblasts showed alterations in the rate of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, leukotriene metabolism, and mitochondrial beta-oxidation of various fatty acids. These results reveal the disease continuum: DMD defects in satellite cells, the myoblast dysfunction affecting muscle regeneration, which is insufficient to counteract muscle loss due to myofiber instability. Contrary to the established belief, our data demonstrate that DMD abnormalities occur in myoblasts, making these cells a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of this lethal disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clonally related, Notch-differentiated spinal neurons integrate into distinct circuits</a></h4>

              
                Shared lineage has diverse effects on patterns of neuronal connectivity. In mammalian cortex, excitatory sister neurons assemble into shared microcircuits, whereas throughout the Drosophila nervous system, Notch-differentiated sister neurons diverge into distinct circuits. Notch-differentiated sister neurons have been observed in vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but whether they integrate into shared or distinct circuits remains unknown. Here we evaluate the connectivity between sister V2a/b neurons in the zebrafish spinal cord. Using an in vivo labeling approach, we identified pairs of sister V2a/b neurons born from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and observed that they have similar axonal trajectories and proximal somata. However, paired whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics revealed that sister V2a/b neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. These results resemble the divergent connectivity in Drosophila and represent the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitf is a Schwann Cell Sensor of Axonal Integrity that Drives Nerve Repair</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells respond to acute axon damage by transiently transdifferentiating into specialized repair cells that restore sensorimotor function. However, the molecular systems controlling repair cell formation and function are not well defined and consequently it is unclear whether this form of cellular plasticity has a role in peripheral neuropathies. Here we identify Mitf as a transcriptional sensor of axon damage under the control of Nrg-ErbB-PI3K-PI5K-mTorc2 signaling. Mitf regulates a core transcriptional program for generating functional repair Schwann cells following injury and during peripheral neuropathies caused by CMT4J and CMT4D. In the absence of Mitf, core genes for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metabolism and dedifferentiation are misexpressed and nerve repair is disrupted. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Schwann cells monitor axonal health using a phosphoinositide signaling system that controls Mitf, which is critical for activating cellular plasticity and counteracting neural disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human-like Modulation SensitivityEmerging through Optimization to Natural Sound Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Natural sounds contain rich patterns of amplitude modulation (AM), which is one of the essential sound dimensions for hearing perception. The sensitivity of human hearing to AM measured by psychophysics takes diverse forms, from low-pass to high-pass, depending on the experimental conditions. Here, we address with a single framework the questions of why such patterns of AM sensitivity have emerged in the human auditory system and how they are realized by our neural mechanisms. Assuming that optimization for natural sound recognition has taken place during human evolution and development, we examined its effect on the formation of AM sensitivity by optimizing a computational model, specifically, a multi-layer (or deep) neural network, for natural sound recognition and simulating psychophysical experiments in which the model's AM sensitivity was measured. Relatively higher layers in the optimized model exhibited qualitatively and quantitatively similar AM sensitivity to that of humans, even though the model was not designed to reproduce human-like AM sensitivity. The similarity of the model's AM sensitivity to humans' correlated with its sound recognition accuracy. Optimization of the model to degraded sounds revealed the necessity of natural AM patterns for the emergence of human-like AM sensitivity. Consistent results were observed from optimizations to two different types of natural sound. Moreover, simulated neurophysiological experiments on the same model revealed a correspondence between the model layers and the auditory brain regions that is based on the similarity of their neural AM tunings. The layers in which human-like psychophysical AM sensitivity emerged exhibited substantial neurophysiological similarity with the auditory midbrain and higher regions. These results suggest that the behavioral AM sensitivity of human hearing has emerged as a result of optimization for natural-sound recognition in the course of our evolution and/or development and that it is based on a stimulus representation encoded in the neural firing rates in the auditory midbrain and higher regions.

                Traditionally considered a homogeneous cell type, hippocampal pyramidal cells have been recently shown to be highly diverse. However, how this cellular diversity relates to the different hippocampal network computations that support memory-guided behavior is not yet known. We discovered that the anatomical identity of pyramidal cells is a major organizing principle of CA1 assembly dynamics, the emergence of memory replay, and cortical projection patterns. Segregated pyramidal cell subpopulations encoded trajectory and choice-specific information or tracked changes in reward configuration respectively, and selectively routed these representations to different cortical targets. Furthermore, distinct hippocampo-cortical assemblies coordinated the reactivation of complementary memory representations. These findings reveal the existence of specialized hippocampo-cortical subcircuits and provide a cellular mechanism that supports the computational flexibility and memory capacities of these structures.

                Background: Although people can pay attention to targets while ignoring distractors, previous research suggests that target enhancement and distractor suppression work separately and independently. Here, we sought to replicate previous findings and re-establish their independence. Methods: We employed an internet-based psychological experiment. We presented participants with a visual search task in which they searched for a specified shape with or without a singleton. We replicated the singleton-presence benefit in search performance, but this effect was limited to cases where the target color was fixed across all trials. In a randomly intermixed probe task (30% of all trials), the participants searched for a letter among colored probes; we used this task to assess how far attention was separately allocated toward the target or distractor dimensions. Results: We found a negative correlation between target enhancement and distractor suppression, indicating that the participants who paid closer attention to target features ignored distractor features less effectively and vice versa. Averaged data showed no benefit from target color or cost from distractor color, possibly because of the substantial differences in strategy across participants. Conclusions: These results suggest that target enhancement and distractor suppression guide attention in mutually dependent ways and that the relative contribution of these components depends on the participants’ search strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching data to uncover filament dynamics</a></h4>

Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) has been extensively used to understand molecular dynamics in cells. This technique when applied to soluble, globular molecules driven by diffusion is easily interpreted and well understood. However, the classical methods of analysis cannot be applied to anisotropic structures subjected to directed transport, such as cytoskeletal filaments or elongated organelles transported along microtubule tracks. A new mathematical approach is needed to analyze FRAP data in this context and determine what information can be obtain from such experiments. To address these questions, we analyze fluorescence intensity profile curves after photobleaching of fluorescently labelled intermediate filaments anterogradely transported along microtubules. We apply the analysis to intermediate filament data to determine information about the filament motion. Our analysis consists of deriving equations for fluorescence intensity profiles and developing a mathematical model for the motion of filaments and simulating the model. Two closed forms for profile curves were derived, one for filaments of constant length and one for filaments with constant velocity, and three types of simulation were carried out. In the first type of simulation, the filaments have random velocities which are constant for the duration of the simulation. In the second type, filaments have random velocities which instantaneously change at random times. In the third type, filaments have random velocities and exhibit pausing between velocity changes. Our analysis shows: the most important distribution governing the shape of the intensity profile curves obtained from filaments is the distribution of the filament velocity. Furthermore, filament length which is constant during the experiment, had little impact on intensity profile curves. Finally, gamma distributions for the filament velocity with pauses give the best fit to asymmetric fluorescence intensity profiles of intermediate filaments observed in FRAP experiments performed in polarized migrating astrocytes. Our analysis also shows that the majority of filaments are stationary. Overall, our data give new insight into the regulation of intermediate filament dynamics during cell migration.

                <p>by Eric Wang, Arup K. Chakraborty</p>

The rise of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the history of outbreaks caused by zoonotic coronaviruses point to the need for next-generation vaccines that confer protection against variant strains. Here, we combined analyses of diverse sequences and structures of coronavirus spikes with data from deep mutational scanning to design SARS-CoV-2 variant antigens containing the most significant mutations that may emerge. We trained a neural network to predict RBD expression and ACE2 binding from sequence, which allowed us to determine that these antigens are stable and bind to ACE2. Thus, they represent viable variants. We then used a computational model of affinity maturation (AM) to study the antibody response to immunization with different combinations of the designed antigens. The results suggest that immunization with a cocktail of the antigens is likely to promote evolution of higher titers of antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 variants than immunization or infection with the wildtype virus alone. Finally, our analysis of 12 coronaviruses from different genera identified the S2’ cleavage site and fusion peptide as potential pan-coronavirus vaccine targets.

                <p>by Nastassia Gobet, Maxime Jan, Paul Franken, Ioannis Xenarios</p>

Genetic variations affect behavior and cause disease but understanding how these variants drive complex traits is still an open question. A common approach is to link the genetic variants to intermediate molecular phenotypes such as the transcriptome using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Paradoxically, these variants between the samples are usually ignored at the beginning of RNA-seq analyses of many model organisms. This can skew the transcriptome estimates that are used later for downstream analyses, such as expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) detection. Here, we assessed the impact of reference-based analysis on the transcriptome and eQTLs in a widely-used mouse genetic population: the BXD panel of recombinant inbred lines. We highlight existing reference bias in the transcriptome data analysis and propose practical solutions which combine available genetic variants, genotypes, and genome reference sequence. The use of custom BXD line references improved downstream analysis compared to classical genome reference. These insights would likely benefit genetic studies with a transcriptomic component and demonstrate that genome references need to be reassessed and improved.

                <p>by Daniel Janini, Chris Hamblin, Arturo Deza, Talia Konkle</p>

After years of experience, humans become experts at perceiving letters. Is this visual capacity attained by learning specialized letter features, or by reusing general visual features previously learned in service of object categorization? To explore this question, we first measured the perceptual similarity of letters in two behavioral tasks, visual search and letter categorization. Then, we trained deep convolutional neural networks on either 26-way letter categorization or 1000-way object categorization, as a way to operationalize possible specialized letter features and general object-based features, respectively. We found that the general object-based features more robustly correlated with the perceptual similarity of letters. We then operationalized additional forms of experience-dependent letter specialization by altering object-trained networks with varied forms of letter training; however, none of these forms of letter specialization improved the match to human behavior. Thus, our findings reveal that it is not necessary to appeal to specialized letter representations to account for perceptual similarity of letters. Instead, we argue that it is more likely that the perception of letters depends on domain-general visual features.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-GWAS coherence test at the gene and pathway level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Krefl, Sven Bergmann</p>

Proximal genetic variants are frequently correlated, implying that the corresponding effect sizes detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are also not independent. Methods already exist to account for this when aggregating effects from a single GWAS across genes or pathways. Here we present a rigorous yet fast method for detecting genes with coherent association signals for two traits, facilitating cross-GWAS analyses. To this end, we devised a new significance test for the covariance of datapoints not drawn independently but with a known inter-sample covariance structure. We show that the distribution of its test statistic is a linear combination of <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> distributions with positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding cumulative distribution function can be efficiently calculated with Davies’ algorithm at high precision. We apply this general framework to test for dependence between SNP-wise effect sizes of two GWAS at the gene level. We extend this test to detect also gene-wise causal links. We demonstrate the utility of our method by uncovering potential shared genetic links between the severity of COVID-19 and (1) being prescribed class M05B medication (drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization), (2) rheumatoid arthritis, (3) vitamin D (25OHD), and (4) serum calcium concentrations. Our method detects a potential role played by chemokine receptor genes linked to <i>T</i><sub>H</sub>1 versus <i>T</i><sub>H</sub>2 immune response, a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression, and other genes potentially impacting the severity of COVID-19. Our approach will be useful for similar analyses involving datapoints with known auto-correlation structures.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systems-level identification of key transcription factors in immune cell specification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cong Liu, Kyla Omilusik, Clara Toma, Nadia S. Kurd, John T. Chang, Ananda W. Goldrath, Wei Wang</p>

Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial for regulating cell differentiation during the development of the immune system. However, the key TFs for orchestrating the specification of distinct immune cells are not fully understood. Here, we integrated the transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements in 73 mouse and 61 human primary cell types, respectively, that span the immune cell differentiation pathways. We constructed the cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory network and assessed the global importance of TFs based on the Taiji framework, which is a method we have previously developed that can infer the global impact of TFs using integrated transcriptomic and epigenetic data. Integrative analysis across cell types revealed putative driver TFs in cell lineage-specific differentiation in both mouse and human systems. We have also identified TF combinations that play important roles in specific developmental stages. Furthermore, we validated the functions of predicted novel TFs in murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation and showed the importance of Elf1 and Prdm9 in the effector versus memory T cell fate specification and Kdm2b and Tet3 in promoting differentiation of CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue resident memory (Trm) cells, validating the approach. Thus, we have developed a bioinformatic approach that provides a global picture of the regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular differentiation in the immune system and aids the discovery of novel mechanisms in cell fate decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A Deep Survival EWAS approach estimating risk profile based on pre-diagnostic DNA methylation: An application to breast cancer time to diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michela Carlotta Massi, Lorenzo Dominoni, Francesca Ieva, Giovanni Fiorito</p>

Previous studies for cancer biomarker discovery based on pre-diagnostic blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, either ignore the explicit modeling of the Time To Diagnosis (TTD), or provide inconsistent results. This lack of consistency is likely due to the limitations of standard EWAS approaches, that model the effect of DNAm at CpG sites on TTD independently. In this work, we aim to identify blood DNAm profiles associated with TTD, with the aim to improve the reliability of the results, as well as their biological meaningfulness. We argue that a global approach to estimate CpG sites effect profile should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. To prove our concept, we develop a new Deep Learning-based approach assessing the relevance of individual CpG Islands (i.e., assigning a weight to each site) in determining TTD while modeling their combined effect in a survival analysis scenario. The algorithm combines a tailored sampling procedure with DNAm sites agglomeration, deep non-linear survival modeling and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values estimation to aid robustness of the derived effects profile. The proposed approach deals with the common complexities arising from epidemiological studies, such as small sample size, noise, and low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-derived DNAm. We apply our approach to a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort and we perform weighted gene-set enrichment analyses to demonstrate the biological meaningfulness of the obtained results. We compared the results of Deep Survival EWAS with those of a traditional EWAS approach, demonstrating that our method performs better than the standard approach in identifying biologically relevant pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interactions between attributions and beliefs at trial-by-trial level: Evidence from a novel computer game task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elena Zamfir, Peter Dayan</p>

Inferring causes of the good and bad events that we experience is part of the process of building models of our own capabilities and of the world around us. Making such inferences can be difficult because of complex reciprocal relationships between attributions of the causes of particular events, and beliefs about the capabilities and skills that influence our role in bringing them about. Abnormal causal attributions have long been studied in connection with psychiatric disorders, notably depression and paranoia; however, the mechanisms behind attributional inferences and the way they can go awry are not fully understood. We administered a novel, challenging, game of skill to a substantial population of healthy online participants, and collected trial-by-trial time series of both their beliefs about skill and attributions about the causes of the success and failure of real experienced outcomes. We found reciprocal relationships that provide empirical confirmation of the attribution-self representation cycle theory. This highlights the dynamic nature of the processes involved in attribution, and validates a framework for developing and testing computational accounts of attribution-belief interactions.

                Background: Chimarrogale leander is a species of the family Soricidae and is mainly distributed in southern China. Methods: Here, a complete mitochondrial genome for C. leander was assembled via high-throughput sequencing technology. Results The results showed that the complete mitogenome of C. leander is 17,357 bp and includes 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and one control region. The nucleotide composition is A: 33.1%, T: 31.5%, C: 22.5% and G: 12.9%. Through the phylogenetic analysis of complete mitochondrial genome, it is found that C. leander has a close genetic relationship with Nectogale elegans. Conclusions: The new mitogenome will hopefully prove useful for systematic analyses of genus Chimarrogale.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Awareness of asthma and its management in primary school teachers in Baghdad, Iraq [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Asthma is a major global health issue characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is linked to a high disease burden and disproportionately high healthcare utilization in severe, uncontrolled cases compared to non-severe asthma. We aimed to conduct this survey among primary school teachers in Baghdad, Iraq, to assess their level of knowledge about asthma and confidence in managing school children with asthma. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Baghdad. The study adopted a questionnaire for assessing the asthma knowledge and confidence scores regarding the management of asthmatic children. This questionnaire contained 29-multiple true-false questions based on different aspects, including facts about asthma and the management of asthma by teachers. The questionnaire for testing teachers’ knowledge of asthma and confidence scores regarding the management of asthmatic children was distributed to 150 teachers. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 103 teachers.. Approximately 71% of teachers answered the question ‘What are the three main symptoms of asthma?’ correctly i.e., answering either one symptom (35.9%) or two symptoms (35.9%) correctly. A relatively smaller number of teachers (16.5%) mentioned all three symptoms correctly. Across the 29-multiple true-false questions, more than 75% of teachers answered 11 questions correctly, 50-74% of teachers answered the rest of eight questions appropriately, and <50% of teachers answered the remaining 10 questions properly. The statistical evaluation indicated that the mean total knowledge score about asthma for all the teachers was 20.27 ± 2.97 and the mean total confidence score regarding the management of asthmatic children was 72.44 ± 13.61. Conclusions: This study suggests that teachers from the schools in Baghdad appear to be self-confident in their ability and knowledge to help and manage children with asthma.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lungfish are the fish related most closely to tetrapods. The olfactory organ of lungfish contains two distinct sensory epithelia: the lamellar olfactory epithelium (OE) and the recess epithelium (RecE). Based on their ultrastructural and histological characteristics, the lamellar OE and the RecE are considered to correspond respectively to the teleost OE and a primitive vomeronasal organ (VNO). In tetrapods, the OE and VNO have been shown to express different families of olfactory receptors; for example, in mammals, the OE expresses odorant receptors and trace amine-associated receptors, while the VNO expresses type 1 (V1Rs) and type 2 (V2Rs) vomeronasal receptors. In the present study, we examined the expression of V1Rs in the olfactory organs of two African lungfish, <i>Protopterus annectens</i> and <i>Protopterus amphibius</i>. RNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses identified 29 V1R genes in <i>P. annectens</i> and 50 V1R genes in <i>P. amphibius</i>. Most V1Rs identified in these lungfish were classified as the tetrapod-type V1Rs initially found in tetrapods and distinct from fish-type V1Rs. In teleost, which all lack a VNO, all olfactory receptors are expressed in the OE, while in <i>Xenopus</i> V1Rs are expressed exclusively in the OE, and not in the VNO. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that lungfish V1Rs were expressed mainly in the lamellar OE and rarely in the RecE. These results imply that V1R expression in lungfish represents an intermediate step toward the complete segregation of V1R expression between the OE and VNO, reflecting the phylogenetic position of lungfish between teleosts and amphibians.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Disentangling the roles of circadian rhythms and sleep drive in experimental pain sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Differentiating between circadian rhythm and sleep’s effect on pain is challenging, as these two systems can be tightly coupled. A recent study by Daguet et al. found that circadian rhythm, rather than sleep drive, significantly contributed to the variability of experimental heat pain sensitivity in humans. These results support chrono-pharmacological approaches to pain management.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fat2 polarizes the WAVE complex in trans to align cell protrusions for collective migration</a></h4>

              
                For a group of cells to migrate together, each cell must couple the polarity of its migratory machinery with that of the other cells in the cohort. Although collective cell migrations are common in animal development, little is known about how protrusions are coherently polarized among groups of migrating epithelial cells. We address this problem in the collective migration of the follicular epithelial cells in Drosophila melanogaster. In this epithelium, the cadherin Fat2 localizes to the trailing edge of each cell and promotes the formation of F-actin-rich protrusions at the leading edge of the cell behind. We show that Fat2 performs this function by acting in trans to concentrate the activity of the WASP family verprolin homolog regulatory complex (WAVE complex) at one long-lived region along each cell's leading edge. Without Fat2, the WAVE complex distribution expands around the cell perimeter and fluctuates over time, and protrusive activity is reduced and unpolarized. We further show that Fat2's influence is very local, with sub-micron-scale puncta of Fat2 enriching the WAVE complex in corresponding puncta just across the leading-trailing cell-cell interface. These findings demonstrate that a trans interaction between Fat2 and the WAVE complex creates stable regions of protrusive activity in each cell and aligns the cells' protrusions across the epithelium for directionally persistent collective migration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Post-phagocytosis activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by two novel T6SS effectors</a></h4>

              
                The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is used by bacteria to deliver toxic effectors directly into target cells. Most T6SSs mediate antibacterial activities, whereas the potential anti-eukaryotic role of T6SS remains understudied. Here, we found a <i>Vibrio</i> T6SS that delivers two novel effectors into mammalian host immune cells. We showed that these effectors induce a pyroptotic cell death in a phagocytosis-dependent manner; we identified the NLRP3 inflammasome as being the underlying mechanism leading to the T6SS-induced pyroptosis. Moreover, we identified a compensatory T6SS-induced pathway that is activated upon inhibition of the canonical pyroptosis pathway. Genetic analyses revealed possible horizontal spread of this T6SS and its anti-eukaryotic effectors into emerging pathogens in the marine environment. Our findings reveal novel T6SS effectors that activate the host inflammasome and possibly contribute to virulence and to the emergence of bacterial pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">c-Myc plays a key role in IFN-γ-induced persistence of Chlamydia trachomatis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr)</i> can persist over extended times within their host cell and thereby establish chronic infections. One of the major inducers of chlamydial persistence is interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) released by immune cells as a mechanism of immune defence. IFN-γ activates the catabolic depletion of L-tryptophan (Trp) via indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), resulting in persistent <i>Ctr</i>. Here, we show that IFN-γ induces the downregulation of c-Myc, the key regulator of host cell metabolism, in a STAT1-dependent manner. Expression of c-Myc rescued <i>Ctr</i> from IFN-γ-induced persistence in cell lines and human fallopian tube organoids. Trp concentrations control c-Myc levels most likely via the PI3K-GSK3β axis. Unbiased metabolic analysis revealed that <i>Ctr</i> infection reprograms the host cell tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to support pyrimidine biosynthesis. Addition of TCA cycle intermediates or pyrimidine/purine nucleosides to infected cells rescued <i>Ctr</i> from IFN-γ-induced persistence. Thus, our results challenge the longstanding hypothesis of Trp depletion through IDO as the major mechanism of IFN-γ-induced metabolic immune defence and significantly extends the understanding of the role of IFN-γ as a broad modulator of host cell metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early anteroposterior regionalisation of human neural crest is shaped by a pro-mesodermal factor</a></h4>

              
                The neural crest (NC) is an important multipotent embryonic cell population and its impaired specification leads to various developmental defects, often in an anteroposterior (A-P) axial level-specific manner. The mechanisms underlying the correct A-P regionalisation of human NC cells remain elusive. Recent studies have indicated that trunk NC cells, the presumed precursors of the childhood tumour neuroblastoma, are derived from neuromesodermal-potent progenitors of the postcranial body (NMPs). Here we employ human embryonic stem cell differentiation to define how NMP-derived NC cells acquire a posterior axial identity. We show that TBXT, a pro-mesodermal transcription factor, mediates early posterior NC/spinal cord regionalisation together with WNT signalling effectors. This occurs by TBXT-driven chromatin remodelling via its binding in key enhancers within <i>HOX</i> gene clusters and other posterior regulator-associated loci. This initial posteriorisation event is succeeded by a second phase of trunk <i>HOX</i> gene control that marks the differentiation of NMPs toward their TBXT-negative NC/spinal cord derivatives and relies predominantly on FGF signalling. Our work reveals a previously unknown role of TBXT in influencing posterior NC fate and points to the existence of temporally discrete, cell type-dependent modes of posterior axial identity control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differential requirements for mitochondrial electron transport chain components in the adult murine liver</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction due to mutations in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome is a common cause of metabolic disease in humans and displays striking tissue specificity depending on the affected gene. The mechanisms underlying tissue specific phenotypes are not understood. Complex I (cI) is classically considered the entry point for electrons into the ETC, and <i>in vitro</i> experiments indicate that cI is required for basal respiration and maintenance of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, an indicator of cellular redox status. This finding has largely not been tested <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we report that mitochondrial complex I is dispensable for homeostasis of the adult mouse liver; animals with hepatocyte-specific loss of cI function display no overt phenotypes or signs of liver damage, and maintain liver function, redox and oxygen status. Further analysis of cI-deficient livers did not reveal significant proteomic or metabolic changes, indicating little to no compensation is required in the setting of complex I loss. In contrast, complex IV (cIV) dysfunction in adult hepatocytes results in decreased liver function, impaired oxygen handling, steatosis, and liver damage, accompanied by significant metabolomic and proteomic perturbations. Our results support a model whereby complex I loss is tolerated in the mouse liver because hepatocytes use alternative electron donors to fuel the mitochondrial ETC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Polygenic adaptation after a sudden change in environment</a></h4>

              
                Polygenic adaptation is thought to be ubiquitous, yet remains poorly understood. Here, we model this process analytically, in the plausible setting of a highly polygenic, quantitative trait that experiences a sudden shift in the fitness optimum. We show how the mean phenotype changes over time, depending on the effect sizes of loci that contribute to variance in the trait, and characterize the allele dynamics at these loci. Notably, we describe the two phases of the allele dynamics: The first is a rapid phase, in which directional selection introduces small frequency differences between alleles whose effects are aligned with or opposed to the shift, ultimately leading to small differences in their probability of fixation during a second, longer phase, governed by stabilizing selection. As we discuss, key results should hold in more general settings, and have important implications for efforts to identify the genetic basis of adaptation in humans and other species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fibroblast-derived Hgf controls recruitment and expansion of muscle during morphogenesis of the mammalian diaphragm</a></h4>

              
                The diaphragm is a domed muscle between the thorax and abdomen essential for breathing in mammals. Diaphragm development requires the coordinated development of muscle, connective tissue, and nerve, which are derived from different embryonic sources. Defects in diaphragm development cause the common and often lethal birth defect, congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH). HGF/MET signaling is required for diaphragm muscularization, but the source of HGF and the specific functions of this pathway in muscle progenitors and effects on phrenic nerve have not been explicitly tested. Using conditional mutagenesis in mice and pharmacological inhibition of MET, we demonstrate that the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs), transient embryonic structures that give rise to the connective tissue in the diaphragm, are the source of HGF critical for diaphragm muscularization. PPF-derived HGF is directly required for recruitment of MET+ muscle progenitors to the diaphragm and indirectly (via its effect on muscle development) required for phrenic nerve primary branching. In addition, HGF is continuously required for maintenance and motility of the pool of progenitors to enable full muscularization. Localization of HGF at the diaphragm’s leading edges directs dorsal and ventral expansion of muscle and regulates its overall size and shape. Surprisingly, large muscleless regions in <i>HGF</i> and <i>Met</i> mutants do not lead to hernias. While these regions are likely more susceptible to CDH, muscle loss is not sufficient to cause CDH.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hepatic AMPK signaling activation in response to dynamic REDOX balance is a biomarker of exercise to improve blood glucose control</a></h4>

              
                Antioxidant intervention is considered to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates hyperglycemia. Paradoxically, moderate exercise can produce ROS to improve diabetes. The exact redox mechanism of these two different approaches remains largely unclear. Here, by comparing exercise and antioxidants intervention on type 2 diabetic rats, we found moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of redox balance in the liver. In contrast, antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both of these two interventions could promote glucose catabolism and inhibit gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMPK signaling, therefore ameliorating diabetes. During exercise, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promoted hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation. However, excessive exercise increased oxidative damage and inhibited the activity and expression of AMPK. Overall, our results illustrate that both exercise and antioxidant intervention improve blood glucose in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox balance. These results indicate that the AMPK signaling activation, combined with oxidative damage markers, could act as a sensitive biomarker, reflecting the threshold of redox balance defining effective treatment in diabetes. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise treatment of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-organized canals enable long range directed material transport in bacterial communities</a></h4>

              
                Long-range material transport is essential to maintain the physiological functions of multicellular organisms such as animals and plants. By contrast, material transport in bacteria is often short-ranged and limited by diffusion. Here we report a unique form of actively regulated long-range directed material transport in structured bacterial communities. Using <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> colonies as a model system, we discover that a large-scale and temporally evolving open channel system spontaneously develops in the colony via shear-induced banding. Fluid flows in the open channels support high-speed (up to 450 µm/s) transport of cells and outer membrane vesicles over centimeters, and help to eradicate colonies of a competing species <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The open channels are reminiscent of human-made canals for cargo transport, and the channel flows are driven by interfacial tension mediated by cell-secreted biosurfactants. The spatial-temporal dynamics of fluid flows in the open channels are qualitatively described by flow profile measurement and mathematical modeling. Our findings demonstrate that mechanochemical coupling between interfacial force and biosurfactant kinetics can coordinate large-scale material transport in primitive life forms, suggesting a new principle to engineer self-organized microbial communities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulatory mechanisms of TARP γ8-selective AMPA receptor therapeutics</a></h4>

              
                AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory neurotransmission throughout the brain. Their signalling is uniquely diversified by brain region-specific auxiliary subunits, providing an opportunity for the development of selective therapeutics. AMPARs associated with TARP {gamma}8 are enriched in the hippocampus, and are targets of emerging anti-epileptic drugs. To understand their therapeutic activity, we determined cryo-EM structures of the GluA1/2-{gamma}8 receptor associated with three potent, chemically diverse drugs. We find that despite sharing a lipid-exposed and water-accessible binding pocket, drug action is differentially affected by binding-site mutants. Together with patch-clamp recordings and MD simulations we demonstrate that ligand-triggered reorganisation of the AMPAR-TARP interface contributes to modulation. Unexpectedly, one ligand (JNJ-61432059) acts bifunctionally, negatively affecting GluA1 but exerting positive modulatory action on GluA2-containing AMPARs, in a TARP stoichiometry-dependent manner. These results further illuminate the action of TARPs, demonstrate the sensitive balance between positive and negative modulatory action, and provide a mechanistic platform for development of both positive and negative selective AMPAR modulators.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal activity-related transcription is blunted in immature compared to mature dentate granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Immature dentate granule cells (DGCs) generated in the hippocampus during adulthood are believed to play a unique role in dentate gyrus function. Although immature DGCs have hyperexcitable membrane properties in vitro, the consequences of this hyperexcitability in vivo remain unclear. In particular, the relationship between experiences that activate the dentate gyrus, such as exploration of a novel environment (NE), and downstream molecular processes that modify dentate gyrus circuitry in response to cellular activation are unknown in this cell population. We first performed quantification of immediate early gene proteins in immature (5-week-old) and mature (13-week-old) DGCs from mice exposed to a NE. Paradoxically, we observed lower immediate early gene protein expression in hyperexcitable immature DGCs. We then isolated nuclei from active and inactive immature DGCs and performed single nuclei RNA-Sequencing. Compared to mature nuclei collected from the same animal, immature DGC nuclei showed less activity-induced transcriptional change, even though they were classified as active based on expression of ARC protein. These results demonstrate that the coupling of spatial exploration, cellular activation, and transcriptional change differs between immature and mature DGCs, with blunted activity-induced changes in immature cells.

                The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus of the vertebrate brain is the central pacemaker regulating circadian rhythmicity throughout the body. The SCN receives photic information through melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGC) to synchronize the body with environmental light cycles. Determining how these inputs fit into the network of synaptic connections on and between SCN neurons is key to impelling our understanding of the regulation of the circadian clock by light and unraveling the relevant local circuits within the SCN. To map these connections, we used a newly-developed Cre-dependant electron microscopy reporter, APEX2, to label mitochondria of mRGC axons, and serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to resolve the fine structure of mRGC in 3D volumes of the SCN. The maps thus created provide a first draft of the patterns of connectomic organization of SCN in the core and the shell, composed of different neuronal subtypes, and here shown to differ with regard to the patterning of their mRGC input as the shell receives denser mRGCs synaptic inputs compared to the core. This challenges the presently held view that photic information coming directly from the retina is mainly integrated by the core region of the SCN.

                Object detection is an essential function of the visual system. Although the visual cortex plays an important role in object detection, the superior colliculus can support detection when the visual cortex is ablated or silenced. Moreover, it has been shown that superficial layers of mouse SC (sSC) encode visual features of complex objects, and that this code is not inherited from the primary visual cortex. This suggests that mouse sSC may provide a significant contribution to complex object vision. Here, we use optogenetics to show that mouse sSC is causally involved in figure detection based on differences in figure contrast, orientation and phase. Additionally, our neural recordings show that in mouse sSC, image elements that belong to a figure elicit stronger activity than those same elements when they are part of the background. The discriminability of this neural code is higher for correct trials than incorrect trials. Our results provide new insight into the behavioral relevance of the visual processing that takes place in sSC.

                MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that have been implicated in a plethora of neuronal processes. Nevertheless, their role in regulating brain activity in the context of sleep has so far received little attention. To test their involvement, we deleted mature miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons at two developmental ages, i.e., in early adulthood using conditional Dicer knockout (cKO) mice and in adult mice using an inducible conditional Dicer cKO (icKO) line. In both models, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was affected and the response to sleep deprivation (SD), altered; while rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) rebound was compromised in both, EEG delta (1-4 Hz) power during non-REM sleep (NREMS) was reduced in cKO mice and increased in icKO mice. We subsequently investigated the effects of SD on the miRNA transcriptome and found that the expression of 48 forebrain miRNAs was affected, in particular, the activity-dependent miRNA miR-709. In vivo inhibition of miR-709 in the brain increased EEG power during NREMS in the slow-delta (0.75-1.75 Hz) range, particularly after periods of prolonged wakefulness. Transcriptome analysis of primary cortical neurons in vitro revealed that miR-709 regulates endosomal trafficking and glutamatergic receptor activity. A subset of the genes involved in glutamatergic transmission was affected also in the cortices of sleep-deprived, miR-709-inhibited mice. Our data implicate miRNAs in the regulation of EEG activity and indicate that miR-709 links neuronal excitability during wakefulness to brain synchrony during sleep, likely through the regulation of endosomal trafficking and glutamatergic signaling.

                Traumatic Brain injury-induced disturbances in mitochondrial fission-and-fusion dynamics have been linked to the onset and propagation of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. However, cell-type-specific contributions and crosstalk between neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in mitochondria-driven neurodegeneration after brain injury remain undefined. We developed a human three-dimensional in vitro triculture tissue model of a contusion injury, composed of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, and examined the contributions of mitochondrial dysregulation to neuroinflammation and progression of injury-induced neurodegeneration. Pharmacological studies presented here suggest that fragmented mitochondria released by microglia are a key contributor to secondary neuronal damage progression after contusion injury, a pathway that requires astrocyte-microglia crosstalk. Controlling mitochondrial dysfunction thus offers an exciting option for the development of therapies for TBI patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A texture statistics encoding model reveals hierarchical feature selectivity across human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mid-level visual features, such as contour and texture, provide a computational link between low- and high-level visual representations. While the detailed nature of mid-level representations in the brain is not yet fully understood, past work has suggested that a texture statistics model (P-S model; Portilla & Simoncelli, 2000) is a candidate for predicting neural responses in areas V1-V4 as well as human behavioral data. However, it is not currently known how well this model accounts for the responses of higher visual cortex regions to natural scene images. To examine this, we constructed single voxel encoding models based on P-S statistics and fit the models to human fMRI data from the Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2021). We demonstrate that the texture statistics encoding model can predict the held-out responses of individual voxels in early retinotopic areas as well as higher-level category-selective areas. The ability of the model to reliably predict signal in higher visual cortex voxels suggests that the representation of texture statistics features is widespread throughout the brain, potentially playing a role in higher-order processes like object recognition. Furthermore, we use variance partitioning analyses to identify which features are most uniquely predictive of brain responses, and show that the contributions of higher-order texture features to model accuracy increases from early areas to higher areas on the ventral and lateral surface of the brain. These results provide a key step forward in characterizing how mid-level feature representations emerge hierarchically across the visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced Thalamic Excitation to Motor Cortical Pyramidal Tract Neurons in a Mouse Model of Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons causes a reduced motor output from the primary motor cortex (M1), underlying the motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD). However, cellular and circuitry mechanisms of M1 dysfunction in PD remain undefined. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we found that DA degeneration induces cell-subtype- and inputs-specific reduction of thalamic excitation to M1 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Physiological and anatomical analyses suggest that DA degeneration induces a loss of thalamocortical synapses to M1 PT neurons, resulting in an impaired thalamic driving of their activities. Moreover, we showed that the decreased thalamocortical connectivity are mediated by an excessive activation of NMDA receptors of M1 PT neurons. Further, the decreased thalamocortical transmission in parkinsonism can be rescued by chemogenetically suppressing basal ganglia outputs. Together, our data suggest that the reduced motor cortical outputs in parkinsonism are not only an immediate consequence of basal ganglia inhibition but also involves specific local circuitry adaptations within M1. This study reveals novel insight in the pathophysiology of parkinsonian motor deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The impact of Mmu17 non-Hsa21 orthologous genes in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome: the "gold standard" revisited</a></h4>

              
                Despite many successful preclinical treatment studies to improve neurocognition in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome (DS), translation to humans has failed. This raises critical questions about the appropriateness of the Ts65Dn mouse as the gold standard for DS research given that it carries, in addition to Mmu16 orthologous genes, triplication of 50 Mmu17 non-orthologous genes that might contribute to the observed brain and behavioral phenotypes. We used the novel Ts66Yah mouse that carries both an extra mini chromosome and the identical segmental Mmu16 trisomy as Ts65Dn, but in which the Mmu17 non-orthologous region was removed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We demonstrate that the Ts65Dn exhibits a more severe phenotype throughout the lifespan compared to the Ts66Yah mouse. Several Mmu17 non-orthologous genes were uniquely overexpressed in Ts65Dn embryonic forebrain; this produced major differences in dysregulated genes and pathways. Despite these genome-wide differences, the primary Mmu16 trisomic effects were highly conserved in both models, resulting in several commonly dysregulated disomic genes and pathways. During the neonatal period, delays in motor development, communication and olfactory spatial memory were observed in both Ts66Yah and Ts65Dn pups but were more pronounced in Ts65Dn. Adult Ts66Yah mice showed working memory deficits and sex-specific effects in exploratory behavior and spatial hippocampal memory, while long-term memory was preserved. Like the neonates, adult Ts66Yah mice exhibited fewer and milder behavioral deficits when compared to Ts65Dn mice. Our findings suggest that trisomy of the non-orthologous Mmu17 genes significantly contributes to the phenotype of the Ts65Dn mouse and may be one major reason why preclinical trials that used this model have unsuccessfully translated to human therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tug-of-peace: Visual Rivalry and Atypical Visual Motion Processing in MECP2 Duplication Syndrome of Autism</a></h4>

              
                Extracting common patterns of neural circuit computations in autism spectrum and pinning them as a cause of specific core traits of autism is the first step towards identifying cell- and circuit-level targets for effective clinical intervention. Studies in human subjects with autism have identified functional links and common anatomical substrates between core restricted behavioral repertoire, cognitive rigidity, and over-stability of visual percepts during visual rivalry. To be able to study these processes with single-cell precision and exhaustive neuronal population coverage, we developed the visual bi-stable perception task for mice. Our task is based on plaid patterns consisting of two transparent gratings drifting at an angle of 120 degrees relative to each other. This results in spontaneous reversals of the perception between local component motion (motion of the plaid perceived as two separate moving grating components) and integrated global pattern motion (motion of the plaid perceived as a fused moving texture). This robust paradigm does not depend on the explicit report of the mouse, as the direction of the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN, rapid eye movements driven by either pattern or component motion) is used to infer the dominant percept. Using this paradigm, we found that the rate of perceptual reversals between global and local motion interpretations of the stimulus is reduced in MECP2 duplication mouse model of autism. Moreover, the stability of local motion percepts is greatly increased in MECP2 duplication mice at the expense of global motion percepts. Thus, our model reproduces a subclass of core features in human autism (reduced rate of visual rivalry and atypical perception of visual motion). This further offers a well-controlled approach for dissecting neuronal circuits underlying these core features if combined with mesoscale 2-photon imaging and optogenetic manipulation of neuronal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Small-molecule ketone esters treat brain network abnormalities in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Altered brain network activity and the resulting hypersynchrony are important for the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. Treatments that reduce epileptiform discharges (EDs) or network hyperactivity improve cognition in AD models and humans. We first show that ketogenic diet, but not fasting, rapidly and persistently reduced EDs in the hAPPJ20 Alzheimer's mouse model over timescales of hours to months. Then, to identify the specific mechanism of the pleiotropic ketogenic diet, we developed small molecule ketone esters to deliver ketone bodies pharmacologically. Two ketone esters recapitulate ED suppression without other dietary manipulation, over time scales of minutes to one week. This small molecule rescue was associated with reduced low-frequency oscillatory activity similar to the recently reported mechanism of an NMDA receptor modulator molecule in this model. Long-term KD resulted in cognitive improvement and in a sex-stratified analysis also improved survival in the more severely affected hAPPJ20 males. Agents that deliver ketone bodies via small molecules or act on downstream targets may hold therapeutic promise in AD through the mechanism of improved network function and reduced epileptiform activity.

                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, heterogenous, and potentially serious psychiatric illness. Diverse brain cell types have been implicated in MDD etiology. Significant sexual differences exist in MDD clinical presentation and outcome, and recent evidence suggests different molecular bases for male and female MDD. We evaluated over 160,000 nuclei from 71 female and male donors, leveraging new and pre-existing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cell type specific transcriptome-wide threshold-free MDD-associated gene expression patterns were similar between the sexes, but significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) diverged. Among 7 broad cell types and 41 clusters evaluated, microglia and parvalbumin interneurons contributed the most DEGs in females, while deep layer excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursors were the major contributors in males. Further, the Mic1 cluster with 38% of female DEGs and the ExN10_L46 cluster with 53% of male DEGs, stood out in the meta-analysis of both sexes.

                Although itch and pain have many similarities, they are completely different in perceptual experience and behavioral response. In recent years, we have a deep understanding of the neural pathways of itch sensation transmission. However, there are few reports on the role of non-neuronal cells in itch. Microglia are known to play a key role in chronic neuropathic pain and acute inflammatory pain. It is still unknown whether microglia are also involved in regulating the transmission of itch sensation. In the present study, we used several kinds of transgenic mice to specifically deplete CX3CR1+ central microglia and peripheral macrophages together (whole depletion), or selectively deplete central microglia only (central depletion). We observed that the acute itch responses to histamine, compound 48/80 and chloroquine were all significantly reduced in mice with either whole or central depletion. Spinal c-fos mRNA assay and further studies revealed that the histamine dependent primary itch signal transmission from DRG to spinal npr1- and sst-positive neurons relied on microglia activation through CX3CL1-CX3CR1 pathway, but CQ elicited itch transmission did not require this pathway. Our results indicated that central microglia were involved in multiple types of acute chemical itch transmission, while the underlying mechanisms for histamine dependent and non-dependent itch transmission were different that the former required the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signal pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overlapping Neural Representations for Dynamic Visual Imagery and Stationary Storage in Spatial Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Representations in working memory need to be flexibly transformed to adapt to our dynamic environment and variable task demands. Recent work has demonstrated that activity in the alpha frequency band enables precise decoding of visual information during both perception and sustained storage in working memory. Extant work, however, has focused exclusively on the representation of static visual images. Here we used EEG recordings to examine whether alpha-band activity supports the dynamic transformation of representations in spatial working memory using an imagery task that required the active shifting of a stored position to a new position. In line with recent findings, a common format of alpha-band activity precisely tracked both the initial position stored in working memory as well as the transformed position, with the latter emerging approximately 800-1200 ms following an auditory cue to rotate to a new position. Moreover, the time course of this transformation of alpha activity predicted between-subject differences in manual reaction time to indicate the new position (Experiment 1), as well as within-subject variations in saccade latency in a speeded version of the task (Experiment 2). Finally, cross-training analyses revealed robust generalization of alpha-band reconstruction of working memory contents before and after mental transformation. These findings demonstrate that alpha activity tracks dynamic transformations of representations in spatial working memory, and that the format of this activity is preserved across the initial and transformed memory representations. These findings highlight a new approach for measuring voluntary shifts in online memory representations and show common representational formats during dynamic mental imagery and the maintenance of static representations in working memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurophysiological basis of hemodynamic responses in the developing human brain before the time of normal birth</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling that links neural activity to localized increases in blood flow is essential both for brain function and to prevent tissue injury. In the healthy human brain, this underlies an association between the duration of EEG microstates, which represent coordinated and metastable activation of neuronal ensembles, and increases in hemodynamic activity. However, in early human life it is not clear whether neurovascular coupling is functional as the underlying physiological mechanisms may be too immature to effectively support it. Here, we combined MRI compatible robotics with simultaneous EEG and fMRI data acquisition in 13 preterm infants to assess whether the relationship between neural activity and hemodynamic responses is present in this critical period of early life. Passive sensorimotor stimulation elicited both a distinct sequence of four EEG microstates and a significant rise in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in the left primary sensorimotor cortex. Furthermore, EEG microstate duration was significantly related to BOLD response amplitude. These results suggest that effective neurovascular coupling is present in the human brain even before the normal time of birth and reveal a complex relationship between EEG and fMRI signals underpinned by patterns of activity across distinct neural ensembles.

                To adapt to their environments, animals learn associations between sensory stimuli and unconditioned stimuli. In invertebrates, olfactory associative learning primarily occurs in the mushroom body, which is segregated into separate compartments. Within each compartment, Kenyon cells (KCs) encoding sparse odor representations project onto mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) whose outputs guide behavior. Associated with each compartment is a dopamine neuron (DAN) that modulates plasticity of the KC-MBON synapses within the compartment. Interestingly, DAN-induced plasticity of the KC-MBON synapse is imbalanced in the sense that it only weakens the synapse and is temporally sparse. We propose a normative mechanistic model of the MBON as a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier that predicts the presence of an unconditioned stimulus (class identity) given a KC odor representation (feature vector). Starting from a principled LDA objective function and under the assumption of temporally sparse DAN activity, we derive an online algorithm which maps onto the mushroom body compartment. Our model accounts for the imbalanced learning at the KC-MBON synapse and makes testable predictions that provide clear contrasts with existing models.

                The human amygdala paralaminar nucleus (PL) contains immature excitatory neurons that exhibit protracted maturation into adolescence; however, whether a similar population exists in mice is unknown. We discovered a previously undescribed region with immature doublecortin (Dcx)+ excitatory neurons adjacent to the mouse basolateral amygdala, and similar to humans, these neurons mature during adolescence and are distinct from adjacent intercalated cells. Despite their immature features, these neurons are born during embryogenesis, populate the mouse PL prior to birth, and remain in an immature stage of development until adolescence. In the postnatal brain, a subpopulation of these excitatory neurons surprisingly migrate into the neighboring endopiriform cortex, peaking between P21-P28. In humans, cells with the molecular identity of mouse PL neurons populate the PL as early as 18 gestational weeks, and also exhibit migratory morphology into adolescence (13 years). The finding of a similar region in both mice and humans suggests a potentially conserved cellular mechanism for neuron recruitment and migration during adolescence, a key time period for amygdala circuit maturation and behavioral changes.

                For its size, the brain is the most metabolically active organ in the body. Most of its energy demand is used to maintain stable homeostatic physiological conditions. Altered homeostasis and active states are hallmarks of many diseases and disorders. Yet there is currently no reliable method to assess homeostasis and absolute basal activity or activity-dependent changes noninvasively. We propose a novel, high temporal resolution low-field, high-gradient diffusion exchange NMR method capable of directly measuring cellular metabolic activity via the rate constant for water exchange across cell membranes. Using viable ex vivo neonatal mouse spinal cords, we measure a component of the water exchange rate which is active, i.e., coupled to metabolic activity. We show that this water exchange rate is sensitive primarily to tissue homeostasis and viability and provides distinct functional information in contrast to the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), which is sensitive primarily to tissue microstructure but not activity.

                Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Current PD therapies offer only symptomatic relief, and the research on novel ways to stop or slow down the degeneration of dopamine neurons in PD attracts considerable efforts. A characteristic feature of PD is the abnormal accumulation and spread of misfolded -synuclein (-syn) protein leading to the formation of Lewy neurites and bodies in different neuronal populations, including dopamine neurons. The process of Lewy body formation compromises neuronal functions and contributes to the progression of the disease and neurodegeneration in PD patients. Treatments preventing -syn misfolding, aggregation and/or spread may therefore provide much-needed disease-modifying therapies for PD. We and others have demonstrated that -syn aggregation and Lewy body formation can be modelled in primary neuronal cultures treated with -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs). Using this approach, we have identified several factors preventing the accumulation of phosphorylated -syn in dopamine neurons in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we and others have demonstrated a prominent role of PKB/AKT pathway activation in promoting the survival of dopamine neurons. Here, we utilize lentiviral vectors (LVs) to express constitutively active myristoylated serine-threonine protein kinase AKT1 (mAKT1) in primary dopamine neurons. We show that lentivirally-delivered mAKT1 promoted survival of dopamine neurons after thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and prevented fibril-induced accumulation of phosphorylated -syn. Furthermore, using pharmacological tools, we demonstrate that this activity of mAKT1 is dependent on the functional Cathepsins B and D. These proof-of-principle results demonstrate the critical importance of lysosomal enzymes for processing misfolded -syn and establish a basis for the use of LVs to develop neuroprotective gene therapy strategies for dopamine neurons in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">AAV-delivered gene editing for latent genital or orofacial herpes simplex virus infection reduces ganglionic viral load and minimizes subsequent viral shedding in mice</a></h4>

              
                Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency in ganglionic neurons of the peripheral nervous system, from which it can reactivate, causing recurrent disease and possible transmission to a new host. Current anti-HSV therapy does not eliminate latent HSV, and thus is only suppressive rather than curative. We developed a potentially curative approach to latent HSV infection and pathogenesis, based on gene editing using HSV-specific meganucleases delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Our results demonstrated that a dual meganuclease therapy, composed of two anti-HSV-1 meganucleases delivered by a triple AAV serotype combination (AAV9, AAV-Dj/8, AAV-Rh10), can eliminate up to 97% of latent HSV DNA from ganglia in both ocular and vaginal mouse models of latent HSV infection. Using a novel pharmacological approach to reactivate latent HSV-1 in mice with the bromodomain inhibitor JQ-1, we demonstrated that this reduction in ganglionic viral load leads to a significant reduction of viral shedding from treated vs. control mice, with many treated mice showing no detectable virus shedding. In general, therapy was well tolerated, although dose-ranging studies showed hepatotoxicity at high AAV doses, consistent with previous observations in animals and humans. Also in agreement with previous literature, we observed subtle histological evidence of neuronal injury in some experimental mice, although none of the mice demonstrated observable neurological signs or deficits. These results reinforce the curative potential of gene editing for latent orofacial and genital HSV disease, and provide a framework for additional safety studies before human trials can begin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Leveraging vision to understand curiosity</a></h4>

              
                Humans are immensely curious and motivated to reduce uncertainty. Inspired by studies of sensory uncertainty, we hypothesized that visual areas provide multivariate representations of uncertainty, which are read out by higher-order areas that encode confidence and, ultimately, translated into curiosity. During fMRI, participants rated their confidence in identifying distorted images of animals and objects and their curiosity to see the clear image. We found that curiosity peaked at low confidence. To link sensory certainty and curiosity, we estimated 'OTC Certainty' as the product of absolute and relative evidence for animals vs. object categories in occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) while participants viewed the distorted image. OTC Certainty negatively correlated with curiosity, while univariate activity in two frontal regions, vmPFC and ACC, positively correlated with confidence. The relationship between OTC certainty and curiosity was mediated by the vmPFC but not ACC. The results reveal neural mechanisms that generate curiosity from representations of uncertainty

	<p>Introduction: The aim of the study was to analyze risk factors for hematoma expansion (HE) in patients undergoing decompressive hemicraniectomy (DC) in patients with elevated intracranial pressure due to spontaneous intracerebral hematoma (ICH). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 72 patients with spontaneous ICH who underwent DC at our institution. We compared the pre- and postoperative volumes of ICH and divided the patients into two groups: first, patients with postoperative HE &amp;amp;gt; 6 cm3 (group 1), and second, patients without HE (group 2). Additionally, we screened the medical history for anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication (AC/AP), bleeding-related comorbidities, age, admission Glasgow coma scale and laboratory parameters. Results: The rate of AC/AP medication was higher in group 1 versus group 2 (15/16 vs. 5/38, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001), and patients were significantly older in group 1 versus group 2 (65.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.2 years vs. 54.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.3 years, p = 0.02). Furthermore, preoperative laboratory tests showed lower rates of hematocrit (34.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.4% vs. 38.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.1%, p = 0.01) and hemoglobin (11.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.6 g/dL vs. 13.13 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.8 g/dL, p = 0.0028) in group 1 versus group 2. In multivariate analysis, the history of AC/AP medication was the only independent predictor of HE (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, OR 0.015, CI 95% 0.001&amp;amp;ndash;0.153). Conclusion: We presented a comprehensive evaluation of risk factors for hematoma epansion by patients undergoing DC due to ICH.</p>

	<p>Glucocorticoids are the most potent anti-inflammatory agents known. Limited in vivo data are available to characterize the mechanism underlying their cognitive side effects and transient occurrence of steroid psychosis. Cholesterol is important for proper neurotransmission and brain plasticity, and disruption of its homeostasis in the brain has been closely associated with memory decline during aging and in age-related neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we assessed the direct effects of dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, on the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), major enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis, metabolism, and excretion, respectively. The effects of the dexamethasone were examined during aging, in the cortex and hippocampus of 6-, 12- and 18-month-old rats, and following long-term food restriction (FR). The most prominent change observed was the age-related decrease in ApoE mRNA regardless of the food regimen applied. In animals kept on FR, this decrease was accompanied by an increase in the mRNA expression of HMGCR and CYP46A1. The present study also demonstrates that food restriction reversed most of the dexamethasone-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in aging rats, in a region-specific manner.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (t-VNS) in the treatment of primary insomnia. (2) Methods: This is a single center, randomized, double-blind study. A total of 30 patients diagnosed with primary insomnia were randomly divided into two groups to receive 20 Hz t-VNS in either the auricular concha area (treatment group) or periauricular area (control group), twice a day for 20 min during a one-month study period. The effective rate of treatment, defined as a &amp;amp;ge;50% reduction of the Pittsburgh Sleep Index Scale (PSQI) after treatment, was compared between the two groups as the primary outcome. Response rate (defined as &amp;amp;ge;10% change in the PSQI score), and changes in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores were also assessed. (3) Results: After one month of treatment, the PSQI score of the treatment group decreased significantly (p = 0.001). The effective rate of the treatment group (73% vs. 27%, p = 0.027) was significantly higher than that of the control group. No statistical differences in changes of HAMA and HAMD scores were detected between the two groups. There were no complications in all patients. (4) Conclusion: T-VNS appeared to be a safe and effective treatment for primary insomnia.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have revealed drastic changes in motor processing in individuals with congenital or acquired limb deficiencies and dysfunction. However, little is known about whether their brains also exhibit characteristic proprioceptive processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the brain activity characteristics of four individuals with congenital or acquired paraplegia (paraplegic group) who underwent long-term wheelchair sports training, when they passively experienced a right-hand movement (passive task) and when they actively performed a right-hand motor task (active task), compared to 37 able-bodied individuals (control group). Compared with the control group, the paraplegic group showed significantly greater activity in the foot section of the left primary motor cortex and in the inferior frontoparietal proprioceptive network during the passive task. In the paraplegic group, the left intraparietal sulcus region was activated during the passive task, but suppressed during the active task, which was not observed in the control group. This shows the facilitation of hand proprioceptive processing and unique usage of the intraparietal sulcus region in proprioceptive motor processing in the brains of paraplegic individuals with long-term wheelchair sports training.</p>

	<p>Individual differences in the responsiveness of the brain to transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) are increasingly demonstrated by the large variability in the effects of tES. Anatomically detailed computational brain models have been developed to address this variability; however, static brain models are not &amp;amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;amp;rdquo; in accounting for the dynamic state of the brain. Therefore, human-in-the-loop optimization at the point of care is proposed in this perspective article based on systems analysis of the neurovascular effects of tES. First, modal analysis was conducted using a physiologically detailed neurovascular model that found stable modes in the 0 Hz to 0.05 Hz range for the pathway for vessel response through the smooth muscle cells, measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). During tES, the transient sensations can have arousal effects on the hemodynamics, so we present a healthy case series for black-box modeling of fNIRS&amp;amp;ndash;pupillometry of short-duration tDCS effects. The block exogeneity test rejected the claim that tDCS is not a one-step Granger cause of the fNIRS total hemoglobin changes (HbT) and pupil dilation changes (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, grey-box modeling using fNIRS of the tDCS effects in chronic stroke showed the HbT response to be significantly different (paired-samples t-test, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) between the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres for primary motor cortex tDCS and cerebellar tDCS, which was subserved by the smooth muscle cells. Here, our opinion is that various physiological pathways subserving the effects of tES can lead to state&amp;amp;ndash;trait variability, which can be challenging for clinical translation. Therefore, we conducted a case study on human-in-the-loop optimization using our reduced-dimensions model and a stochastic, derivative-free covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. We conclude from our computational analysis that human-in-the-loop optimization of the effects of tES at the point of care merits investigation in future studies for reducing inter-subject and intra-subject variability in neuromodulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of an illusive sense of agency caused by virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                As a part of self-consciousness, sense of agency (SoA) refers to our sensation that we initiate actions that lead to ensuing perceptual consequences. Previous neuroimaging studies manipulated voluntary actions to create differential levels of SoA, and found that the SoA network largely overlaps with the sensorimotor network. It is thus unclear whether effects observed in these regions are attributable to SoA or some specific aspects of action processes (e.g., intentionality of action) related to voluntary action control, or both. To disentangle the effect of action processes, here we utilized virtual reality (VR) technology to induce an illusive SoA in the absence of voluntary action, and examined it by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants experience of controlling an avatar hand elicited a persistent increase in temporal binding, a behavioral marker of SoA, when they merely observed the avatar hands movement in the scanner. fMRI results showed that the SoA with the non-action was associated with a cluster centered in right angular gyrus, extending to right inferior parietal lobule and the right precuneus. These high-level associative areas have been implicated in SoA with voluntary actions for their role in perceptual-motor mismatch detection and action awareness. Other traditional SoA areas, especially those governing action intentionality and motor planning, were not implicated. Hence, controlling a virtual body can generate a salient SoA whose neural correlates are distinct from those supporting action control but partially overlapping with those governing post voluntary-action SoA processes. These findings also highlight the role of angular gyrus in giving rise to the self-consciousness changes associated with virtual body embodiment in VR and metaverse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural population dynamics of human working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) depends on the activity of neural populations to maintain internal representations of information that are no longer available in the environment. The neural population dynamics that support WM in the human cortex remain largely unexplored. Utilizing fMRI and time-resolved multivariate analyses, we found evidence of both stable and dynamic WM representations during a classic memory-guided saccade task. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we identified robust neural subspaces in early visual, parietal and even frontal cortex that were stable throughout the delay period with memorized locations organized within a two-dimensional representation of visual space. The dynamic subspace, which was largely restricted to early visual cortex, had both an early and late delay component during which the WM representation changed. Leveraging models of the receptive fields of voxels comprising each of the visual field maps, we visualized how the dynamic population code changed over time. Early in the trial, the dynamic code in V1 was dominated by a narrowly tuned activation among voxels with receptive fields centered on the location of the peripheral memory target. Late in the trial, the dynamic code was driven by diffuse activation among voxels with receptive fields along a line between the fovea and the peripheral location of the target. Together, the timing, shape, and spatial distribution of the WM dynamics in early visual cortex suggest that the early component encodes feedforward visual inputs, while the late component encodes abstracted task-relevant mnemonic representations resulting from feedback signals from higher-level brain areas.

	<p> To study the biodistribution of new chemical and biological entities, an in vitro model of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) may become an essential tool during early phases of drug discovery. Here, we present a proof-of-concept of an in-house designed three-dimensional BBB biochip designed by us. This three-dimensional dynamic BBB model consists of endothelial cells and astrocytes, co-cultured on opposing sides of a polymer-coated membrane under flow mimicking blood flow. Our results demonstrate a highly effective BBB as evidenced by (i) a 30-fold increase in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), (ii) a significantly higher expression of tight junction proteins, and (iii) the low FITC&amp;amp;ndash;dextran permeability of our technical solution as compared to a static in vitro BBB model. Importantly, our three-dimensional BBB model effectively expresses P-glycoprotein (Pg-p), a hallmark characteristic for brain-derived endothelial cells. In conclusion, we provide here a complete holistic approach and insight to the whole BBB system, potentially delivering translational significance in the clinical and pharmaceutical arenas.</p>

	<p>Background: The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are still debated. The question remains as to whether there is evidence of a predominant type of deficit or whether it is a multideficit disorder with individual profiles. The assumptions of which mechanism causes the disorder influences the selection of the training approach. Methods: A sample of German neurotypical reading children (NT) and children with dyslexia (DYSL) was investigated with a comprehensive behavioral test battery assessing phonological, auditory, visual, and cerebellar performance, thus addressing performance described in three major theories in dyslexia. Results: In the present sample using the test battery of the present study, DYSL had the strongest impairment in phonological and auditory processing, accompanied by individual processing deficits in cerebellar performance, but only a few in the investigated visual domains. Phonological awareness and auditory performance were the only significant predictors for reading ability. Conclusion: These findings point out that those reading difficulties were associated with phonological as well as auditory processing deficits in the present sample. Future research should investigate individual deficit profiles longitudinally, with studies starting before literacy acquisition at as many processing domains as possible. These individual deficit profiles should then be used to select appropriate interventions to promote reading and spelling.</p>

	<p>This pilot study investigates the neurophysiological patterns of visual and auditory verbal working memory (VWM) in unilateral cochlear implant users (UCIs). We compared the task-related electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectral density of 7- to 13-year-old UCIs (n = 7) with a hearing control group (HC, n = 10) during the execution of a three-level n-back task with auditory and visual verbal (letters) stimuli. Performances improved as memory load decreased regardless of sensory modality (SM) and group factors. Theta EEG activation over the frontal area was proportionally influenced by task level; the left hemisphere (LH) showed greater activation in the gamma band, suggesting lateralization of VWM function regardless of SM. However, HCs showed stronger activation patterns in the LH than UCIs regardless of SM and in the parietal area (PA) during the most challenging audio condition. Linear regressions for gamma activation in the PA suggest the presence of a pattern-supporting auditory VWM only in HCs. Our findings seem to recognize gamma activation in the PA as the signature of effective auditory VWM. These results, although preliminary, highlight this EEG pattern as a possible cause of the variability found in VWM outcomes in deaf children, opening up new possibilities for interdisciplinary research and rehabilitation intervention.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition in which genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to its etiology. Remarkable progress has been made in deciphering disease etiology through genetic approaches, but there is limited data about how environmental and genetic factors interact to modify penetrance, risk, and disease severity. Here, we provide insights into environmental modifiers of PD, discussing precedents from other neurological and non-neurological conditions. Based on these examples, we outline genetic and environmental factors contributing to PD and review potential environmental modifiers of penetrance and clinical variability in monogenic and idiopathic PD. We also highlight the potential challenges and propose how future studies might tackle these important questions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Our aim was to assess the real-world effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multicenter survey compiling retrospective data from 79 PML patients, including 38 published cases and 41 unpublished cases, who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as add-on to standard of care. One-year follow-up data were analyzed to determine clinical outcomes and safety profile. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with one-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Predisposing conditions included hematological malignancy (n=38, 48.1%), primary immunodeficiency (n=14, 17.7%), HIV/AIDS (n=12, 15.2%), inflammatory disease (n=8, 10.1%), neoplasm (n=5, 6.3%), and transplantation (n=2, 2.5%). Pembrolizumab was most commonly used (n=53, 67.1%). One-year survival was 51.9% (41/79). PML-IRIS was reported in 15/79 patients (19%). Pretreatment expression of PD1 on circulating T cells did not differ between survivors and non-survivors. Development of contrast enhancement on follow-up MRI at least once during follow-up (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.20-8.72, p=0.02) was associated with one-year survival. CSF JCV DNA load decreased significantly by one-month follow-up in survivors compared to non-survivors (p&lt;0.0001). Thirty-two adverse events occurred among 24 of 79 patients (30.4%), and led to treatment discontinuation in 7/24 patients (29.1%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this non-controlled retrospective study of patients with PML who were treated with ICI, mortality remains high. Development of inflammatory features or overt PML-IRIS was commonly observed. This study highlights that use of immune checkpoint inhibitors should be strictly personalized toward characteristics of the individual PML patient.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the characteristics of participants with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in a trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>142 DIAD mutation carriers received either gantenerumab SC (n=52), solanezumab IV (n=50), or placebo (n=40). Participants underwent assessments with the Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®), neuropsychological testing, CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor ARIA. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated potential ARIA-related risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven participants developed ARIA-E, including 3 with mild symptoms. No ARIA-E was reported under solanezumab while gantenerumab was associated with ARIA-E compared to placebo (OR=9.1, CI[1.2, 412.3]; <i>p</i>=0.021). Under gantenerumab, <i>APOE-ɛ4</i> carriers were more likely to develop ARIA-E (OR=5.0, CI[1.0, 30.4]; <i>p</i>=0.055), as were individuals with microhemorrhage at baseline (OR=13.7, CI[1.2, 163.2]; <i>p</i>=0.039). No ARIA-E was observed at the initial 225mg/month gantenerumab dose, and most cases were observed at doses &gt;675mg. At first ARIA-E occurrence, all ARIA-E participants were amyloid-PET+, 60% were CDR&gt;0, 60% were past their estimated year to symptom onset, and 60% had also incident ARIA-H. Most ARIA-E radiologically resolved after dose adjustment and developing ARIA-E did not significantly increase odds of trial discontinuation. ARIA-E was more frequently observed in the occipital lobe (90%). ARIA-E severity was associated with age at time of ARIA-E.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In DIAD, solanezumab was not associated with ARIA. Gantenerumab dose over 225mg increased ARIA-E risk, with additional risk for individuals <i>APOE-ɛ4(+)</i> or with microhemorrhage. ARIA-E was reversible on MRI in most cases, generally asymptomatic, without additional risk for trial discontinuation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Staufen impairs autophagy in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with <i>MTOR</i> mRNA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>STAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-<i>C9ORF72</i>, <i>ATXN2</i>
<sup>
   <i>Q127</i>
</sup>, and <i>Thy1</i>-<i>TDP-43</i> transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9ORF72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by <i>STAU1</i> RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct <i>MTOR</i> mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The expression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (<i>PmCRH</i>) and the CRH-binding protein (<i>PmCRHBP</i>) mRNAs was studied by in situ hybridization in the brain of prolarvae, larvae, and adults of the sea lamprey <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>. We also generated an antibody against the PmCRH mature peptide to study the distribution of PmCRH-immunoreactive cells and fibers. PmCRH immunohistochemistry was combined with antityrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, PmCRHBP in situ hybridization, or neurobiotin transport from the spinal cord. The most numerous PmCRH-expressing cells were observed in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus-paraventricular nucleus and in the superior and medial rhombencephalic reticular formation. <i>PmCRH</i> expression was more extended in adults than in larvae, and some cell populations were mainly (olfactory bulb) or only (striatum, ventral hypothalamus, prethalamus) observed in adults. The preopto-paraventricular fibers form conspicuous tracts coursing toward the neurohypophysis, but many immunoreactive fibers were also observed coursing in many other brain regions. Brain descending fibers in the spinal cord mainly come from cells located in the isthmus and in the medial rhombencephalic reticular nucleus. The distribution of <i>PmCRHBP</i>-expressing neurons was different from that of PmCRH cells, with cells mainly present in the septum, striatum, preoptic region, tuberal hypothalamus, pretectum, pineal complex, isthmus, reticular formation, and spinal cord. Again, expression in adults was more extended than in larvae. <i>PmCRH</i>- and <i>PmCRHBP</i>-expressing cells are different, excluding colocalization of these substances in the same neuron. Present findings reveal a complex CRH/CRHBP system in the brain of the oldest extant vertebrate group, the agnathans, which shows similarities but important divergences with that of mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic synapse elimination controls ocular dominance plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a representative form of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity observed in the primary visual cortex (V1). However, the cellular mechanisms and physiological roles of synapse elimination in ODP are largely unknown. Here, we show that astrocytic phagocytosis of thalamo-cortical synapses in V1 is a critical mediator of ODP. We found that astrocytes, but not microglia, start to engulf thalamo-cortical synapses within 24 hours after monocular deprivation and that astrocytic synapse elimination is highly selective for synapses from the deprived eye, as revealed by AAV1-mediated trans-synaptic anterograde tracing of synapse phagocytosis reporters. Importantly, mice without the Megf10 phagocytic receptor in astrocytes exhibit deficits in eliminating the synapses from the deprived eye, leading to the failure to reduce the number of thalamo-cortical synapses after monocular deprivation. Remarkably, Megf10-deficient animals show severe defects in monocular deprivation-induced cortical synapse remodeling and subsequent expansion of the thalamo-cortical circuitry from the nondeprived eye. Taken together, our data show that astrocytic synapse elimination through MEGF10 is one of the key components in ODP, revealing the physiological importance of astrocytic phagocytosis in experience-dependent synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisensory inputs control the regulation of time investment for mating by sexual experience in male Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Males have finite resources to spend on reproduction. Thus, males rely on a  time investment strategy to maximize their reproductive success. For example, male Drosophila melanogaster extends their mating duration when surrounded by conditions enriched with rivals. Here we report a novel form of behavioral plasticity whereby male fruit flies exhibit a shortened duration of mating when they are sexually experienced; we refer to this plasticity as  shorter-mating-duration (SMD). SMD is a plastic behavior and requires sexually dimorphic taste neurons. We identified several neurons in the male foreleg and midleg that express specific sugar, pheromone and mechanosensory receptors. Using a cost-benefit model and behavioral experiments, we further show that SMD behavior exhibits adaptive behavioral plasticity in male flies. Thus, our study delineates the molecular and cellular basis of the sensory inputs required for SMD; this represents a plastic interval timing behavior that could serve as a model system to study how multisensory inputs converge to modify interval timing behavior for improved adaptation.

ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYMale flies use information derived from their previous sexual experiences from multiple sensory inputs to optimize their investment in mating.

                Synaptic excitation (E) and inhibition (I) stay relatively proportional to each other over different spatiotemporal scales, orchestrating neuronal activity in the brain. This proportionality, referred to as E-I balance, is thought to be critical for neuronal functions because its disruption was observed in many neurological disorders. However, the causal evidence demonstrating its significance is scarce. Here we show that deleting Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), a postsynaptic adhesion molecule at inhibitory synapses, from mouse glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons reduces inhibition cell-autonomously without affecting excitation, thereby disrupting E-I balance and causing lethality. In contrast, deleting Nlgn2 constitutively or simultaneously from both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons results in viable mice. A neural network model shows that reducing inhibition in either neuronal type is detrimental to network activity, but in both types partially re-establishes E-I balance and activity. Together, our results provide evidence for an essential role of E-I balance in brain functions and organism survival.

	<p>There is a close bidirectional relationship between sleep and epilepsy. Anti-seizure medications (ASM) act to reduce seizure frequency but can also impact sleep; this remains a relatively unexplored field given the importance of sleep on seizure occurrence, memory consolidation, and quality of life. We compared the effect of poly-ASM treatment on a night of sleep compared to an unmedicated night in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, where ASMs were withdrawn and later restored as part of their pre-surgical evaluation. Within-subject analysis between medicated and unmedicated nights showed ASMs increased spindle (11&amp;amp;ndash;16 Hz) power and decreased slow wave (0.1&amp;amp;ndash;2 Hz) amplitude. Spindles became less strongly coupled to slow waves in the ASM night compared to no-ASM night, with effects to both the phase and strength of coupling and correlated with slow wave reduction. These effects were not seen in age-matched controls from the same unit where ASMs were not changed between two nights. Overall, we found that ASM polytherapy not only changed specific sleep waveforms, but also the fine interplay of spindle/slow wave coupling. Since these sleep oscillations impact both seizure occurrence and memory consolidation, our findings provide evidence towards a decoupling impact of ASMs on sleep that should be considered in future studies of sleep and memory disruption in people with epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Despite numerous studies on the neurobiology of depression, the etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder remain poorly understood. A large number of animal models and tests to evaluate depressive-like behavior have been developed. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is the most common and frequently used model of depression, and the sucrose preference test (SPT) is one of the most common tests for assessing anhedonia. However, not all laboratories can reproduce the main effects of CUMS, especially when this refers to a decrease in sucrose preference. It is also unknown how the state of anhedonia, assessed by the SPT, relates to the state of anhedonia in patients with depression. We analyzed the literature available in the PubMed database using keywords relevant to the topic of this narrative review. We hypothesize that the poor reproducibility of the CUMS model may be due to differences in sucrose consumption, which may be influenced by such factors as differences in sucrose preference concentration threshold, water and food deprivation, and differences in animals&amp;amp;rsquo; susceptibility to stress. We also believe that comparisons between animal and human states of anhedonia should be made with caution because there are many inconsistencies between the two, including in assessment methods. We also tried to offer some recommendations that should improve the reproducibility of the CUMS model and provide a framework for future research.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) was used to describe pre-senile dementia to differentiate it from senile dementia, which develops in the adult age group of more than 65 years. AD is characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaque and tau-neurofibrillary tangles (TNTs) in the brain. The neuropathological changes in AD are related to the deposition of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and progression of neuroinflammation, neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy dysfunction, and cholinergic synaptic dysfunction. Statins are one of the main cornerstone drugs for the management of cardiovascular disorders regardless of dyslipidemia status. Increasing the use of statins, mainly in the elderly groups for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, may affect their cognitive functions. Extensive and prolonged use of statins may affect cognitive functions in healthy subjects and dementia patients. Statins-induced cognitive impairments in both patients and health providers had been reported according to the post-marketing survey. This survey depends mainly on sporadic cases, and no cognitive measures were used. Evidence from prospective and observational studies gives no robust conclusion regarding the beneficial or detrimental effects of statins on cognitive functions in AD patients. Therefore, this study is a narrative review aimed with evidences to the beneficial, detrimental, and neutral effects of statins on AD.</p>

	<p>Restless sleep disorder affects children and is characterized by frequent nocturnal movements, iron deficiency, and daytime symptoms such as poor school performance or behavioral problems. Although sleep parameters have been thoroughly studied and daytime sleepiness has been previously assessed, neurocognitive and executive functions have not. In this study, we evaluated neurocognitive functions in a group of 13 children diagnosed with restless sleep disorder using the National Institute of Health Toolbox (NIH toolbox). The mean age was 10.62 (S.D. 2.785). Among them, seven were male and six were female. The fully corrected T-scores (adjusted for demographic variables: age, ethnicity, and education level) showed the lowest values for the Flanker test (selective attention) and dimensional change card sorting test (cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control), with a very large effect size vs. the corresponding expected frequencies. For all the other tests, the average scores were 50; however, individual children scored low on pattern recognition and two composite scores (fluid and total). In conclusion, these data support the fact that cognitive functions are affected in children with restless sleep disorder, especially selective attention. Clinicians must recognize sleep disorders and daytime impairment in order to promptly intervene and prevent cognitive impairments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Standardized Nonvisual Behavioral Event Is Broadcasted Homogeneously across Cortical Visual Areas without Modulating Visual Responses</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Multiple recent studies have shown that motor activity greatly impacts the activity of primary sensory areas like V1. Yet, the role of this motor related activity in sensory processing is still unclear. Here, we dissect how these behavior signals are broadcast to different layers and areas of the visual cortex. To do so, we leveraged a standardized and spontaneous behavioral fidget event in passively viewing mice. Importantly, this behavior event had no relevance to any ongoing task allowing us to compare its neuronal correlates with visually relevant behaviors (e.g., running). A large two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging database of neuronal responses uncovered four neural response types during fidgets that were consistent in their proportion and response patterns across all visual areas and layers of the visual cortex. Indeed, the layer and area identity could not be decoded above chance level based only on neuronal recordings. In contrast to running behavior, fidget evoked neural responses that were independent to visual processing. The broad availability of visually orthogonal standardized behavior signals could be a key component in how the cortex selects, learns and binds local sensory information with motor outputs. Contrary to behaviorally relevant motor outputs, irrelevant motor signals could project to separate local neural subspaces.</p>

                Data visualization is integral for exploratory data analysis and data presentation. Consequently, every programming environment suitable for data analysis needs a feature-rich visualization library. In this paper, we present Plotly.NET - a fully featured charting library for the .NET ecosystem. Plotly.NET requires little ceremony to use, provides multiple API (application programming interface) layers for both low-code and maximum customizability, and can be used in many different visualization workflows - from interactive scripting and notebooks to user interface applications. Plotly.NET brings the charting capabilities of plotly.js to the .NET ecosystem, successfully combining the flexibility of the plotly grammar with the type-safety and expressiveness of .NET.

<p>Using CT from 9 stroke studies, we compared software with masked experts. As per indications for software use, we assessed e-ASPECTS results for patients with/without middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemia but no other cause of stroke. In an analysis outside the intended use of the software, we enriched our dataset with non-MCA ischemia, hemorrhage, and mimics to simulate a representative “front door” hospital population. With final diagnosis as the reference standard, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS for identifying stroke features (ischemia, hyperattenuated arteries, and hemorrhage) in the representative population.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 4,100 patients (51% women, median age = 78 years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] = 10, onset to scan = 2.5 hours). Final diagnosis was ischemia (78%), hemorrhage (14%), or mimic (8%). From 3,035 CTs with expert-rated ASPECTS, most (2084/3035, 69%) e-ASPECTS results were within one point of experts. In the representative population, the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70–72%) for detecting ischemic features, 85% (83–86%) for hemorrhage. Software identified more false positive ischemia (12% vs 2%) and hemorrhage (14% vs &lt;1%) than experts.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>On independent testing, e-ASPECTS provided moderate agreement with experts and overcalled stroke features. Therefore, future prospective trials testing impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) software on patient care and outcome are required before widespread implementation of stroke decision-support software.

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Transverse myelitis (TM) has recently been associated by health authorities with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), one of the 5 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) labeled severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. It is unknown whether a similar association exists for the other FDA or EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer/BioNTech], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1nCov-19 [Oxford–AstraZeneca], and NVX-CoV2373 [Novavax]). This study aimed to evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine class and TM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study examined individual case safety reports from VigiBase, the World Health Organization's pharmacovigilance database. We first conducted a disproportionality analysis with the information component (IC) using the reports of TM that occurred within 28 days following exposure to the FDA or EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, from December 1, 2020 (first adverse event related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) to March 27, 2022. Second, we analyzed the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TM cases reported in VigiBase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TM was significantly associated both with the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based (n = 364; IC<sub>025</sub> = 0.62) and vector-based (n = 136; IC<sub>025</sub> = 0.52) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are authorized by the FDA or the EMA.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Findings from this observational, cross-sectional pharmacovigilance study showed that mRNA-based and vector-based FDA/EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be associated with TM. However, because TM remains a rare event, with a previously reported rate of 0.28 cases per 1 million vaccine doses, the risk–benefit ratio in favor of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unchallenged. Rather, this study suggests that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of TM in patients presenting with early signs of spinal cord dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

                Social prescribing is a way of connecting individuals to a source of support within the community to help improve their health and well-being. Social prescribing programmes are being widely promoted within the United Kingdom (UK) and United States as non-pharmaceutical interventions for those living with addiction and substance misuse needs. These needs have been exasperated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis, with emerging research indicating short-term and long-term detrimental effects on physical and mental health due to substance misuse and addictions. Psychosocial interventions utilize psychological or social factors rather than an overreliance on biological interventions to treat the health impacts of mental illnesses such as addictions and substance use disorder. In this paper, I will discuss the associated determinants of addictions and substance for the military veteran population, as well as how the social prescribing of psychosocial interventions could be used to reaffirm participant’s identity and enhance their sense of belonging for military veterans, using a real-world example in Wales, UK.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational models reveal how chloride dynamics determine the optimal distribution of inhibitory synapses to minimise dendritic excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Brian Currin, Joseph Valentino Raimondo</p>

Many neurons in the mammalian central nervous system have complex dendritic arborisations and active dendritic conductances that enable these cells to perform sophisticated computations. How dendritically targeted inhibition affects local dendritic excitability is not fully understood. Here we use computational models of branched dendrites to investigate where GABAergic synapses should be placed to minimise dendritic excitability over time. To do so, we formulate a metric we term the “Inhibitory Level” (IL), which quantifies the effectiveness of synaptic inhibition for reducing the depolarising effect of nearby excitatory input. GABAergic synaptic inhibition is dependent on the reversal potential for GABAA receptors (EGABA), which is primarily set by the transmembrane chloride ion (Cl<sup>-</sup>) concentration gradient. We, therefore, investigated how variable EGABA and dynamic chloride affects dendritic inhibition. We found that the inhibitory effectiveness of dendritic GABAergic synapses combines at an encircled branch junction. The extent of this inhibitory accumulation is dependent on the number of branches and location of synapses but is independent of EGABA. This inhibitory accumulation occurs even for very distally placed inhibitory synapses when they are hyperpolarising–but not when they are shunting. When accounting for Cl<sup>-</sup> fluxes and dynamics in Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration, we observed that Cl<sup>-</sup> loading is detrimental to inhibitory effectiveness. This enabled us to determine the most inhibitory distribution of GABAergic synapses which is close to–but not at–a shared branch junction. This distribution balances a trade-off between a stronger combined <i>inhibitory influence</i> when synapses closely encircle a branch junction with the deleterious effects of increased <i>Cl</i><sup>-</sup> loading that occurs when inhibitory synapses are co-located.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An expert judgment model to predict early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas McAndrew, Nicholas G. Reich</p>

From February to May 2020, experts in the modeling of infectious disease provided quantitative predictions and estimates of trends in the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in a series of 13 surveys. Data on existing transmission patterns were sparse when the pandemic began, but experts synthesized information available to them to provide quantitative, judgment-based assessments of the current and future state of the pandemic. We aggregated expert predictions into a single “linear pool” by taking an equally weighted average of their probabilistic statements. At a time when few computational models made public estimates or predictions about the pandemic, expert judgment provided (a) falsifiable predictions of short- and long-term pandemic outcomes related to reported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, (b) estimates of latent viral transmission, and (c) counterfactual assessments of pandemic trajectories under different scenarios. The linear pool approach of aggregating expert predictions provided more consistently accurate predictions than any individual expert, although the predictive accuracy of a linear pool rarely provided the most accurate prediction. This work highlights the importance that expert linear pool could play in flexibly assessing a wide array of risks early in future emerging outbreaks, especially in settings where available data cannot yet support data-driven computational modeling

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MicrobiomeCensus estimates human population sizes from wastewater samples based on inter-individual variability in gut microbiomes</a></h4>

The metagenome embedded in urban sewage is an attractive new data source to understand urban ecology and assess human health status at scales beyond a single host. Analyzing the viral fraction of wastewater in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown the potential of wastewater as aggregated samples for early detection, prevalence monitoring, and variant identification of human diseases in large populations. However, using census-based population size instead of real-time population estimates can mislead the interpretation of data acquired from sewage, hindering assessment of representativeness, inference of prevalence, or comparisons of taxa across sites. Here, we show that taxon abundance and sub-species diversisty in gut-associated microbiomes are new feature space to utilize for human population estimation. Using a population-scale human gut microbiome sample of over 1,100 people, we found that taxon-abundance distributions of gut-associated multi-person microbiomes exhibited generalizable relationships with respect to human population size. Here and throughout this paper, the human population size is essentially the sample size from the wastewater sample. We present a new algorithm, MicrobiomeCensus, for estimating human population size from sewage samples. MicrobiomeCensus harnesses the inter-individual variability in human gut microbiomes and performs maximum likelihood estimation based on simultaneous deviation of multiple taxa’s relative abundances from their population means. MicrobiomeCensus outperformed generic algorithms in data-driven simulation benchmarks and detected population size differences in field data. New theorems are provided to justify our approach. This research provides a mathematical framework for inferring population sizes in real time from sewage samples, paving the way for more accurate ecological and public health studies utilizing the sewage metagenome.

                Background: Prevalence of heart failure has been increasing worldwide. Decreased muscle mass, poor physical activity, and reduced physical performance or muscle strength might lead to sarcopenia among heart failure patients and therefore lead to low cardiac output, and vice versa. Symptoms of depression are also common mental health problems in heart failure. However, little is known about the prevalence of depressive symptoms in heart failure patients with sarcopenia and the relationship with its. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of and relationship between sarcopenia and depressive symptoms in heart failure patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study comprised of 150 participants aged 35 years or older. Sarcopenia and no sarcopenia were classified by using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. Physical performance, muscle strength, and skeletal muscle mass were examined. Symptoms of depression were assessed through utilization of the validated Thai version of Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Results: The prevalence of sarcopenia was 18.67% and depression was 5.33% in heart failure patients. In addition, the prevalence of depression in heart failure patients with sarcopenia were 3.57%. The relationship was observed based on depression scores and New York Heart Association functional classification (r = 0.319, p<.001). Furthermore, heart failure patients with low New York Heart Association functional class had high depression scores (p<.001). However, no significant differences between depression scores and sarcopenia in heart failure patients were identified. Conclusions: Prevalence of sarcopenia in heart failure patients was 18.67% and only 5.33% exhibited depressive symptoms. Only 3.57% exhibited both depression and sarcopenia. Additionally, New York Heart Association functional classification was related to depression.

                Background: The Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) proposed by the World Health Organization recognises the importance for health systems to understand the reasons underpinning the death of a pregnant woman or her newborn as an essential first step in preventing future similar deaths. Data for the surveillance component of the MPDSR process are typically collected from health facility sources and post-mortem interviews with affected families, though it may be traumatising to them. This brief report aimed to assess the potential utility of an augmented data collection method for mapping journeys of maternal and perinatal deaths, which does not require sourcing additional information from grieving family members. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal and perinatal deaths that occurred across 24 public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria, between 1st November 2018 and 30th October 2019 was conducted. Data on their demographic, obstetric history and complication at presentation, travel to the hospital, and mode of birth were extracted from their hospital records. The extracted travel data was exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time to the hospital for the period of the day of travel were also extracted. Results: Of the 182 maternal deaths, most presented during the week (80.8%), travelled 5-10 km (30.6%) and 10-29 minutes (46.9%), and travelled to the nearest hospital to their places of residence (70.9%). Of the 442 pregnant women who had perinatal deaths, most presented during the week (78.5%), travelled <5 km (26.9%) and 10-29 minutes (38.0%). For both, the least reported travel data was the mode of travel used to care (>90.0%) and the period of the day they travelled (approximately 30.0%). Conclusion: An augmented data collection approach that includes accurate and complete travel data and closer-to-reality estimates of travel time and distance can be beneficial for MPDSR purposes.

                Antecedentes: El propósito del estudio fue identificar las asociaciones entre el riesgo para la salud mental, los intentos de suicidio y la función familiar.   Métodos: Se realizó un estudio descriptivo, correlacional y transversal en un grupo de adolescentes del último grado de secundaria para establecer la asociación entre el riesgo para la salud mental, el intento de suicidio y la funcionalidad familiar. Los instrumentos utilizados fueron el cuestionario de autoinforme, la escala de valoración del riesgo suicida y el APGAR familiar. El análisis de datos se realizó mediante el algoritmo de inteligencia artificial (agrupamiento de gower).  Resultados:Respondieron 246 adolescentes a los tres instrumentos, lo que permitió seleccionar aquellos con correlaciones de interés sensible y, a partir de ellas, un plan de intervención. Se encontró malestar psicológico en el 28%, síntomas psicóticos en el 85% y consumo problemático de alcohol en el 9%. Se identificó buen funcionamiento familiar en 34% y algún tipo de disfunción familiar en 66%. En cuanto al riesgo de suicidio, hubo un riesgo de suicidio bajo del 74 %, un riesgo medio del 24 % y un riesgo alto del 2 %. Se pudo demostrar que existe una correlación en un grupo del 15% de los encuestados.  Conclusiones: El riesgo de sufrir deterioro de la salud mental y el riesgo de suicidio, durante este período de pandemia, parece estar relacionado con la funcionalidad familiar.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bayes factor benefits for clinical psychology: review of child and adolescent evidence base [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Statistical methods are a cornerstone of research in clinical psychology and are used in clinical trials and reviews to determine the best available evidence. The most widespread statistical framework, frequentist statistics, is often misunderstood and misused. Even when properly applied, this framework can lead to erroneous conclusions and unnecessarily prolonged trials. The implications for clinical psychology are difficulties in interpreting best available evidence and unnecessarily costly and burdensome research. An alternative framework, Bayesian statistics, is proposed as a solution to several issues with current practice. Methods: Statistical tests of primary outcome measures were extracted from 272 studies, which were cited in 11 recent reviews in the Evidence-based updates series in the Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. The extracted tests were examined regarding relevant features and re-analyzed using Bayes Factors. Results: When statistical tests were significant, the majority (98%) of re-analyzed tests agreed with such claims. When statistical tests were nonsignificant almost half (43%) of re-analyzed tests disagreed with such claims. Equally important for clinical research, an average of 13% fewer participants per study would have been required if the studies had used Bayes Factors. Conclusions: Bayes Factors offer benefits for research in clinical psychology through intuitive interpretations, and less costly trials.

<p>The idea, methods, and main conclusions of this study. Mutual transitions between sleep stages were not necessarily the opposite of each other. Sleep stage transitions during the sleep deepening process indicated more significant changes than the sleep awakening process.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep state transitions are closely related to insomnia, drowsiness, and sleep maintenance. However, how the cortical network varies during such a transition process remains unclear. Changes in the cortical interaction during the short-term process of sleep stage transitions were investigated. In all, 40 healthy young participants underwent overnight polysomnography. The phase transfer entropy of six frequency bands was obtained from 16 electroencephalography channels to assess the strength and direction of information flow between the cortical regions. Differences in the cortical network between the first and the last 10 s in a 40-s transition period across wakefulness, N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement were, respectively, studied. Various frequency bands exhibited different patterns during the sleep stage transitions. It was found that the mutual transitions between the sleep stages were not necessarily the opposite. More significant changes were observed in the sleep deepening process than in the process of sleep awakening. During sleep stage transitions, changes in the inflow and outflow strength of various cortical regions led to regional differences, but for the entire sleep progress, such an imbalance did not intensify, and a dynamic balance was instead observed. The detailed findings of variations in cortical interactions during sleep stage transition promote understanding of sleep mechanism, sleep process, and sleep function. Additionally, it is expected to provide helpful clues for sleep improvement, like reducing the time required to fall asleep and maintaining sleep depth.</p>

In the classical model, Nodals elicit signaling by binding to a complex comprising Type I/II Activin receptors (Acvr) and the co-receptor Tdgf1. However, it is currently unclear whether receptor binding can also affect the distribution of Nodals themselves through the embryo, and it is unknown which of the putative Acvr paralogs mediate Nodal signaling in zebrafish. Here, we characterize three Type I (Acvr1) and four Type II (Acvr2) homologs and show that - except for Acvr1c - all receptor-encoding transcripts are maternally deposited and present during zebrafish embryogenesis. We generated mutants and used them together with combinatorial morpholino knockdown and CRISPR F0 knockout (KO) approaches to assess compound loss-of-function phenotypes. We discovered that the Acvr2 homologs function partly redundantly and partially independently of Nodal to pattern the early zebrafish embryo, whereas the Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b redundantly act as major mediators of Nodal signaling. By combining quantitative analyses with expression manipulations, we found that feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors can directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Wolbachia action in the sperm produces developmentally deferred chromosome segregation defects during the Drosophila mid-blastula transition</a></h4>

              
                <i>Wolbachia</i>, a vertically transmitted endosymbiont infecting many insects, spreads rapidly through uninfected populations by a mechanism known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In CI, a paternally delivered modification of the sperm leads to chromatin defects and lethality during and after the first mitosis of embryonic development in multiple species. However, whether CI-induced defects in later stage embryos are a consequence of the first division errors or caused by independent defects remains unresolved. To address this question, we focused on ~1/3 of embryos from CI crosses in <i>Drosophila simulans</i> that develop apparently normally through the first and subsequent pre-blastoderm divisions before exhibiting mitotic errors during the mid-blastula transition and gastrulation. We performed single embryo PCR and whole genome sequencing to find a large percentage of these developed CI-derived embryos bypass the first division defect. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we find increased chromosome segregation errors in gastrulating CI-derived embryos that had avoided the first division defect. Thus, <i>Wolbachia</i> action in the sperm induces developmentally deferred defects that are not a consequence of the first division errors. Like the immediate defect, the delayed defect is rescued through crosses to infected females. These studies inform current models on the molecular and cellular basis of CI.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Consequences of PDGFR a + fibroblast reduction in adult murine hearts</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblasts produce the majority of collagen in the heart and are thought to regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Although fibrosis accompanies many cardiac pathologies and is generally deleterious, the role of fibroblasts in maintaining the basal ECM network and in fibrosis <i>in vivo</i> is poorly understood. We genetically ablated fibroblasts in mice to evaluate the impact on homeostasis of adult ECM and cardiac function after injury. Fibroblast-ablated mice demonstrated a substantive reduction in cardiac fibroblasts, but fibrillar collagen and the ECM proteome were not overtly altered when evaluated by quantitative mass spectrometry and N-terminomics. However, the distribution and quantity of collagen VI, a microfibrillar collagen that forms an open network with the basement membrane, was reduced. In fibroblast-ablated mice, cardiac function was better preserved following angiotensin II/phenylephrine (AngII/PE)-induced fibrosis and myocardial infarction (MI). Analysis of cardiomyocyte function demonstrated altered sarcomere shortening and slowed calcium decline in both uninjured and AngII/PE infused fibroblast-ablated mice. After MI, the residual resident fibroblasts responded to injury, albeit with reduced proliferation and numbers immediately after injury. These results indicate that the adult mouse heart tolerates a significant degree of fibroblast loss with potentially beneficial impact on cardiac function after injury. The cardioprotective effect of controlled fibroblast reduction may have therapeutic value in heart disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid, reference-free human genotype imputation with denoising autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                Genotype imputation is a foundational tool for population genetics. Standard statistical imputation approaches rely on the co-location of large whole-genome sequencing-based reference panels, powerful computing environments, and potentially sensitive genetic study data. This results in computational resource and privacy-risk barriers to access to cutting-edge imputation techniques. Moreover, the accuracy of current statistical approaches is known to degrade in regions of low and complex linkage disequilibrium. Artificial neural network-based imputation approaches may overcome these limitations by encoding complex genotype relationships in easily portable inference models. Here we demonstrate an autoencoder-based approach for genotype imputation, using a large, commonly used reference panel, and spanning the entirety of human chromosome 22. Our autoencoder-based genotype imputation strategy achieved superior imputation accuracy across the allele-frequency spectrum and across genomes of diverse ancestry, while delivering at least 4-fold faster inference run time relative to standard imputation tools.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A feed-forward pathway drives LRRK2 kinase membrane recruitment and activation</a></h4>

              
                Activating mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinson's disease and previously we showed that activated LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases (Steger et al., 2017). Moreover, Golgi-associated Rab29 can recruit LRRK2 to the surface of the Golgi and activate it there for both auto- and Rab substrate phosphorylation. Here we define the precise Rab29 binding region of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain between residues 360-450 and show that this domain, termed 'Site #1', can also bind additional LRRK2 substrates, Rab8A and Rab10. Moreover, we identify a distinct, N-terminal, higher affinity interaction interface between LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab8 and Rab10 termed 'Site #2', that can retain LRRK2 on membranes in cells to catalyze multiple, subsequent phosphorylation events. Kinase inhibitor washout experiments demonstrate that rapid recovery of kinase activity in cells depends on the ability of LRRK2 to associate with phosphorylated Rab proteins, and phosphorylated Rab8A stimulates LRRK2 phosphorylation of Rab10 in vitro. Reconstitution of purified LRRK2 recruitment onto planar lipid bilayers decorated with Rab10 protein demonstrates cooperative association of only active LRRK2 with phospho-Rab10-containing membrane surfaces. These experiments reveal a feed-forward pathway that provides spatial control and membrane activation of LRRK2 kinase activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-rapid eye movement sleep determines resilience to social stress</a></h4>

              
                Resilience, the ability to overcome stressful conditions, is found in most mammals and varies significantly among individuals. A lack of resilience can lead to the development of neuropsychiatric and sleep disorders, often within the same individual. Despite extensive research into the brain mechanisms causing maladaptive behavioral-responses to stress, it is not clear why some individuals exhibit resilience. To examine if sleep has a determinative role in maladaptive behavioral-response to social stress, we investigated individual variations in resilience using a social-defeat model for male mice. Our results reveal a direct, causal relationship between sleep amount and resilience-demonstrating that sleep increases after social-defeat stress only occur in resilient mice. Further, we found that within the prefrontal cortex, a regulator of maladaptive responses to stress, pre-existing differences in sleep regulation predict resilience. Overall, these results demonstrate that increased NREM sleep, mediated cortically, is an active response to social-defeat stress that plays a determinative role in promoting resilience. They also show that differences in resilience are strongly correlated with inter-individual variability in sleep regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Higher levels of narrativity lead to similar patterns of EEG activity across individuals</a></h4>

              
                The focus of cognitive and psychological approaches to narrative has not so much been on the elucidation of important aspects of narrative, but rather on using narratives as tools for the investigation of higher order cognitive processes elicited by narratives (e.g., understanding, empathy, etc.). In this study, we work toward a scalar model of narrativity, which can provide testable criteria for selecting and classifying communication forms in their level of narrativity. We investigated whether being exposed to videos with different levels of narrativity modulates shared neural responses, measured by inter-subject correlation, and engagement levels. Thirty-two participants watched video advertisements with high-level and low-level of narrativity while their neural responses were measured through electroencephalogram. Additionally, participants engagement levels were calculated based on the composite of their self-reported attention and immersion scores. Results demonstrated that both calculated inter-subject correlation and engagement scores for high-level video ads were significantly higher than those for low-level, suggesting that narrativity levels modulate inter-subject correlation and engagement. We believe that these findings are a step toward the elucidation of the viewers way of processing and understanding a given communication artifact as a function of the narrative qualities expressed by the level of narrativity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential representation of natural and manmade images in the human ventral visual stream</a></h4>

              
                The human visual cortex processes visual stimuli hierarchically. Early visual areas (V1, V2) of the ventral visual stream feed crude visual features (like orientation and edges) into later visual areas (V4, lateral occipital (Lat Occ), inferior temporal (IT)) that then encode complex visual features (like object form). Previous studies have reported a difference in fMRI responses between natural and urban landscapes in certain parts of the brain. Here we asked if this distinction in the representation of complex natural and man-made visual stimuli extends to the ventral visual stream and if state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide a map to this categorical distinction. To assess this, we used an open source fMRI data set of V1-4 and LatOcc BOLD responses to 1750 passively viewed natural and man-made grayscale images. The same images were fed into the pre-trained CORnet-S, a CNN designed to model hierarchical human visual processing layer-wise. To identify differences in representations within and between the human visual cortex and the CNN, we computed representational dissimilarity matrices. The BOLD response to the manmade and natural images shows correlation differences for the two categories, which increase across V4 and LatOcc. Such differences were also observed in the model CORnet-S for the layers V4 and IT. Our results suggest that the human visual cortex processes natural and manmade images differently starting from V4 and that this representational difference is modeled in CORnet-S. In both, categorical representation is progressively established in the later processing stages. This might indicate that the brain has perhaps developed two-distinct systems for their representations which can be directed through evolution. Further analysis may facilitate the contributory role of evolution towards this paradigm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DHHC3 mediated Cadm4 palmitoylation regulates myelination in CNS</a></h4>

              
                Cell adhesion molecule 4 (Cadm4) plays important roles on plasma membrane (PM) to regulate myelin formation and the downregulation of Cadm4 is a prominent feature in many demyelination diseases. However, how Cadm4 maintains its level on PM has been elusive. Here, we identify that Cadm4 is palmitoylated at cysteine-347 (C347) and palmitoylation regulates the stable localization of Cadm4 on PM, as blocking palmitoylation by mutating C347 into alanine (C347A) results in the dissociation of Cadm4 from PM and targeting for degradation. Intriguingly, blocking Cadm4 palmitoylation by introducing C347A (Cadm4-KI) causes myelin abnormalities in CNS, characterized by loss of myelination, myelin infoldings and hypermyelination. Moreover, it is uncovered that Cadm4 palmitoylation is catalyzed by DHHC3, reducing Cadm4 palmitoylation by the deletion of DHHC3 renders the redistribution of Cadm4 for degrading. Consistently, the genetic deletion of DHHC3 leads to downregulated Cadm4 palmitoylation and defects in CNS myelination, virtually phenocopies that of the Cadm4-KI mice. Our findings suggest a mechanism that the stable localization of Cadm4 on PM regulated by protein palmitoylation is vital for myelination in CNS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nhlh1 and Nhlh2, a global transcriptional mechanism regulating commissural axon projection via activating Robo3</a></h4>

              
                Commissural neurons play the crucial role to connect neuronal information from both sides of the nervous system in bilaterians by projecting their axons contralaterally across the midline. These neurons are highly heterogenous in their developmental origins, neurotransmitters and neurophysiology, as many disparate neuron classes contain commissural neurons. In mammals, most commissural axons from the spinal cord to the midbrain, cross the midline via the floor plate, guided predominantly by a conserved molecular mechanism, i.e., Robo3 and DCC expressing commissural axons are guided by Netrin-1 secreted from the floor plate and ventral neural tube. So far, no common transcriptional program has been uncovered for specifying the axon laterality across the highly heterogenous commissural neurons. In this study, we identified a pair of highly-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Nhlh1 and Nhlh2, as such a transcriptional program. We found that Robo3 promoter contains multiple copies of Nhlh1/2 binding sites and forced expression of Nhlh1/2 can induce ectopic Robo3 expression and contralateral axon projection in the hindbrain and the midbrain. We then generated mutant mice deficient in both genes and found a marked reduction of Robo3 and a total lack of ventral commissures from the spinal cord to the midbrain. This is the first report of a global transcriptional mechanism that controls the laterality of all floor plate-crossing commissural axons via activating Robo3 expression. Nhlh1 and Nhlh2 should provide the key to deciphering the principle underlying the specific and balanced production of contralateral- versus ipsilateral-projection neurons from the spinal cord to the midbrain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantum analysis of P3a and P3b from auditory single trial ERPs differentiates borderline personality disorder from schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Traditional approaches to EEG modelling use the methods of classical physics to reconstruct scalp potentials in terms of explicit physical models of cortical neuron ensembles. The principal difficulty is that the multiplicity of cellular processes with an intricate array of deterministic and random factors prevents creation of consistent biophysical parameter sets. An original, empirically-testable solution has been recently achieved in our previous studies by a radical departure from the deterministic equations of classical physics to the probabilistic reasoning of quantum mechanics. This crucial step relocates elementary bioelectric sources of EEG signals from the cellular to the molecular level where positively and negatively ions are considered as elementary sources of electricity. The rationale is that despite dramatic differences in cellular machineries, statistical factors governed by the rules of central limit theorem produce EEG waveforms as a statistical aggregate of the synchronized activity of multiple closely-located microscale sources. Using the formalism of nonhomogeneous birth-and-death processes (BDP) the quantum models of microscale events are deduced and linked to the dynamics of macroscale EEG waveforms. This study expands these methods with new features for comprehensive analysis of event related potentials directly from single trials, i.e. the EEG segments which are closely related in timing to cognitive events. We derive a universal model of the components of single trial ERPs both in frequency and time domains. This, for the first time, enables us to quantify all significant cognitive components in single trial ERPs, providing an alternative to the traditional method of averaging. Given P300 as an important objective marker of psychiatric disorders, a methodology which reliably discloses the component compositions of this potential, may have specific diagnostic importance. In this study, reliable identification of the P3a and P3b components from an auditory oddball paradigm provided a means of differentiating borderline personality disorder from schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential Inhibitory Responses to Temporal Features Enhance Cortical Coding of Dynamic Stimuli: A Network Model</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits feature both excitatory and inhibitory cells that underlie the encoding of dynamic sensory stimuli, e.g., speech, music, odors, and natural scenes. While previous studies have shown that inhibition plays an important role in shaping the neural code, little is known about how excitatory and inhibitory cells coordinate to enhance encoding of temporally dynamic stimuli. Recent experimental recordings in mouse auditory cortex (ACx) have shown that optogenetic suppression of parvalbumin (PV) neurons results in a decrease of neural discriminability between dynamic stimuli with speech envelope modulations. Here, we present a multilayer model of a cortical circuit that mechanistically explains these results. The model incorporates characteristic short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) profiles of excitatory and PV cells. Crucially, the model performance is based on populations of PV cells that separately respond to stimulus onsets and offsets. We reveal that by tuning the relative strengths of inhibition from onset- and offset-responding PV cells, the cortical network model captures the broad range of neural discriminability profiles in cortical single-unit data, with varying contributions from rapid firing rate modulations and spike timing. The model also replicates and explains the experimentally observed reduction in neural discrimination performance during optogenetic suppression of PV neurons. These results suggest that distinct populations of PV neurons enhance cortical discriminability of dynamic stimuli by encoding distinct temporal features, enhancing temporal coding, and reducing cortical noise.

                Tau aggregates are a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases and can contain RNAs and RNA binding proteins, including SRRM2 and PNN. How these resident nuclear proteins mislocalize and their influence on the prion like propagation of tau fibers remains unknown. We demonstrate that polyserine repeats in SRRM2 and PNN are necessary and sufficient for recruitment to tau aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrate tau fibers preferentially grow in association with endogenous cytoplasmic assemblies, mitotic interchromatin granules and cytoplasmic speckles, which contain SRRM2 and PNN. Polyserine undergoes self assembly in vitro and in cells, where polyserine-assemblies are sites of tau fiber propagation. Modulating the levels of polyserine containing proteins results in a corresponding change in tau aggregation. These findings define a specific protein motif, and cellular condensates, that promote tau fiber propagation. As cytoplasmic speckles form in iPSC neurons under inflammatory or hyperosmolar stress, they may promote tau fiber propagation in various neurodegenerative diseases.

                Speech comprehension is a complex process that draws on humans abilities to extract lexical information, parse syntax, and form semantic understanding. These sub-processes have traditionally been studied using separate neuroimaging experiments that attempt to isolate specific effects of interest. More recently it has become possible to study all stages of language comprehension in a single neuroimaging experiment using narrative natural language stimuli. The resulting data are richly varied at every level, enabling analyses that can probe everything from spectral representations to high-level representations of semantic meaning. We provide a dataset containing BOLD fMRI responses recorded while 8 subjects each listened to 27 complete, natural, narrative stories (~6 hours). This dataset includes pre-processed and raw MRIs, as well as hand-constructed 3D cortical surfaces for each participant. To address the challenges of analyzing naturalistic data, this dataset is accompanied by a python library containing basic code for creating voxelwise encoding models. Altogether, this dataset provides a large and novel resource for understanding speech and language processing in the human brain.

                Hypoxic ischaemic injury (HIE) in the neonatal brain has significant consequences on neurodevelopment and increases the occurrence of neurological deficits in infants. HIE is also a leading cause of neonatal seizures. Therapeutic options for the treatment of HIE are very limited. Hypoxia-ischemia directly damages brain tissue in a primary-wave of injury which activates a cascade of events triggering local and systemic inflammatory responses, driven by the innate immune system, which contribute to a significant secondary-wave of injury taking place as early as 6 hours post-hypoxia-ischaemia. Levels of the well documented inflammatory microRNA, miR-155 are elevated in rodent seizure and epilepsy models. Here, we assessed the impact of, miR-155 deletion in myeloid cells , on regulating inflammation and seizure severity in a preclinical model of neonatal hypoxia-induced seizures (Hypoxia-Sz). Wildtype miR-155 (miR-155+/+LysMCre) mice were compared to a mouse line in which miR-155 was deleted in myeloid cells (miR-155fl/fl LysMCre). We demonstrate significant upregulation of miR-155 target genes, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), arginase-2 (arg-2), ship-1 and socs-1 in miR-155fl/fl LysMCre mice compared to controls at various time points following Hypoxia-Sz. Conversely, we report decreased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1[beta]; and IL-6 and lower protein levels of IL-1[beta]; in miR-155fl/fl LysMCre mice as compared to WTs. Myeloid miR-155 deletion significantly reduced behavioural seizure severity score, reduced electrographically (EEG) measured seizure frequency and seizure burden as compared to mice to wildtypes, suggesting miR-155 regulation of seizure occurrence in this model. Behavioural tests for motor functions at 5 weeks post Hypoxia-Sz demonstrated differences between genotypes. Excitingly this work highlights that inhibition of miR-155, specifically in myeloid cells, may hold therapeutic benefit for both seizures and comorbidities associated with hypoxic brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comprehensive evaluation of harmonization on functional brain imaging for multisite data-fusion</a></h4>

              
                To embrace big-data neuroimaging, harmonization of site effect in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data fusion is a fundamental challenge. Comprehensive evaluation of potentially effective harmonization strategies, particularly with specifically collected data has been rare, especially for R-fMRI metrics. Here, we comprehensively assess harmonization strategies from multiple perspectives, including efficiency, individual identification, test-retest reliability and replicability of group-level statistical results, on widely used R-fMRI metrics across multiple datasets including data obtained from the same participants scanned at several sites. For individual identifiability (i.e., whether the same subject could be identified across R-fMRI data scanned across different sites), we found that, while most methods decreased site effects, the Subsampling Maximum-mean-distance based distribution shift correction Algorithm (SMA) outperformed linear regression models, linear mixed models, ComBat series and invariant conditional variational auto-encoder. Test-retest reliability was better for SMA and adjusted ComBat series than alternatives, while SMA was superior to the latter in replicability, both in terms of Dice coefficient and the scale of brain areas showing sex differences reproducibly observed across datasets. Moreover, we examined test-retest datasets to identify the best target site features to optimize SMA identifiability and test-retest reliability. We noted that both sample size and distribution of the target site matter and introduced a heuristic target site selection formula. In addition to providing practical guidelines, this work can inform continuing improvements and innovations in harmonizing methodologies for big R-fMRI data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An optimized workflow to generate and characterize iPSC-derived motor neuron (MN) spheroids</a></h4>

              
                Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) from the cortex, brainstem and/or the spinal cord. In an effort to understand the underlying causes of this selective degeneration, a multitude of in vitro models based on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs have been developed. Moreover, different groups have started to use advanced 3D structures, composed of MNs and other cell types to increase the physiological relevance of such in vitro models. For instance, spheroids are simple 3D models that have the potential to be generated in large numbers that can be used across different assays. In this study, we generated MN spheroids and developed a workflow to analyze them. We confirmed the expression of different MN markers as the MN spheroids differentiate, at both the transcript and protein level, as well as their capacity to display functional activity in the form of action potentials (APs) and bursts. We also identified the presence of other cell types, namely interneurons and oligodendrocytes, which share the same neural progenitor pool with MNs. In summary, we successfully developed a MN 3D model, and we optimized a workflow that can be applied to their characterization and analysis. In the future, we will apply this model and workflow to the study of MNDs by generating MN spheroids from patient-derived iPSC lines, aiming to contribute to the development of more advance and physiological in vitro disease models.

                Complement overactivation mediates microglial synapse elimination in neurological diseases like Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but how complement activity is regulated in the brain remains largely unknown. We identified that the secreted neuronal pentraxin Nptx2 binds complement C1q and thereby regulates its activity in the brain. Nptx2-deficient mice show increased complement activity and C1q-dependent microglial synapse engulfment and loss of excitatory synapses. In a neuroinflammation culture model and in aged TauP301S mice, AAV-mediated neuronal overexpression of Nptx2 was sufficient to restrain complement activity and ameliorate microglia-mediated synapse loss. Analysis of human CSF samples from a genetic FTD cohort revealed significantly reduced levels of Nptx2 and Nptx2-C1q protein complexes in symptomatic patients, which correlated with elevated C1q and activated C3. Together, these results show that Nptx2 regulates complement activity and microglial synapse elimination in the healthy and diseased brain and that diminished Nptx2 levels might exacerbate complement-mediated neurodegeneration in FTD patients.

                Understanding actions performed by others requires us to integrate different types of information about people, scenes, objects, and their interactions. What organizing dimensions does the mind use to make sense of this complex action space? To address this question, we collected intuitive similarity judgments across two large-scale sets of naturalistic videos depicting everyday actions. We used cross-validated sparse non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify the structure underlying action similarity judgments. A low-dimensional representation, consisting of nine to ten dimensions, was sufficient to accurately reconstruct human similarity judgments. The dimensions were robust to stimulus set perturbations and reproducible in a separate odd-one-out experiment. Human labels mapped these dimensions onto semantic axes relating to food, work, and home life; social axes relating to people and emotions; and one visual axis related to scene setting. While highly interpretable, these dimensions did not share a clear one-to-one correspondence with prior hypotheses of action-relevant dimensions. Together, our results reveal a low-dimensional set of robust and interpretable dimensions that organize intuitive action similarity judgments and highlight the importance of data-driven investigations of behavioral representations.

                Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common chronic, progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. The main symptom is sensory loss; the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We found that Drosophila fed a high-sugar diet, which induces diabetes-like phenotypes, exhibit impairment of noxious heat avoidance. The impairment of heat avoidance was associated with shrinkage of the leg neurons expressing the Drosophila transient receptor potential channel Painless. Using a candidate genetic screening approach, we identified proteasome modulator 9 as one of the modulators of impairment of heat avoidance. We further showed that proteasome inhibition in the glia reversed the impairment of noxious heat avoidance, and heat-shock proteins and exosome secretion in the glia mediated the effect of proteasome inhibition. Our results establish Drosophila as a useful system for exploring molecular mechanisms of diet-induced peripheral neuropathy and propose that the glial proteasome is one of the candidate therapeutic targets for DPN.

                Mutations in mitochondrial complex I cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a group of severe neurological diseases that can result in death in infancy. The mechanisms underlying complex I deficiency pathogenesis remain poorly understood, and as a result there are currently no available treatments. To better understand the causes of neuronal dysfunction in complex I deficiency, we modelled complex I deficiency in Drosophila by knocking down the mitochondrial complex I subunit ND-75 (NDUFS1) specifically in neurons. Neuronal complex I deficiency causes locomotor defects, seizures and reduced lifespan. At the cellular level, complex I deficiency leads to mitochondrial morphology defects, reduced endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) in neurons. Remarkably, we find that expression of the yeast non-proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 in neurons, which couples NADH oxidation to transfer of electrons into the respiratory chain, reinstates endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts, prevents UPR activation and rescues the behavioural and lifespan phenotypes caused by complex I deficiency. Metabolomic analysis shows that NDI1 expression also reconfigures neuronal metabolism and implicates increased GABA levels as a contributor to the neurological manifestations of complex I deficiency. Together, these data indicate that NDI1 abrogates UPR signalling and reprogrammes metabolism to alleviate neuronal dysfunction caused by neuronal complex I deficiency.

                Fear and anxiety are brain states that evolved to mediate defensive responses to threat. While it is clear that the defense reaction includes multiple interacting behavioural, autonomic and endocrine adjustments, their integrative nature is poorly understood. In particular, threat has been associated with various cardiac changes, yet a clear consensus on their relevance for the integrated defense reaction is missing. We here define rapid microstates associated with specific behaviours and heart rate dynamics, both affected by long-lasting macrostates and reflecting context-dependent threat levels. In addition, we demonstrate that one of the most commonly used defensive behavioural responses, freezing measured by immobility, is part of an integrated cardio-behavioural microstate mediated by specific midbrain circuit elements. Our work puts forth a framework for systematic integration of cardiac and behavioural readouts that presents the basis for a better understanding of complex neural defensive states and their associated systemic functions.
