                Background: Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disease in which abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) carry insufficient oxygen throughout the body. Conventional methods of thalassemia detection through a complete blood count (CBC) test and peripheral blood smear image still possess a lot of weaknesses. Methods: This paper proposes a hybrid segmentation method to segment the RBCs. It incorporates adaptive thresholding and canny edge method to segment the RBCs. Morphological operations are performed to clean the leftovers. Shape and texture features are extracted using the segmented masks and the gray level co-occurrence matrix. Data imbalance treatment is used for solving the imbalance cell type class in distribution. In the data resampling layer, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN), and random over sampling (ROS) are performed and evaluated using the decision tree and logistic regression. In the classification layer, the decision tree, random forest classifier and support vector machine (SVM) are assessed and compared for the best performance in classification. Results:The proposed method outperforms the other methods in the image segmentation layer with the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 89.88%. In the data resampling layer, ADASYN is employed as it is more accurate than the SMOTE and ROS. The random forest classifier is chosen at the classification layer as it is more accurate than the decision tree and support vector machine (SVM). Conclusions:The proposed method is tested on the latest dataset of erythrocyteIDB3 and it solves the issues of imbalanced data due to the insufficient cell classes.

                Background: To compare the predictors In-hospital mortality of patients with septic Acute Kidney Injury (S-AKI) and non-septic AKI (NS-AKI). Methods: a cohort study of critically ill patients with AKI admitted to the emergency room at a tertiary hospital from January to June 2019. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Results: There were 116 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Compared with NS-AKI, patients with S-AKI had significantly lower mean MAP, median eGFR, and urine output. (UO). S-AKI had higher mortality and vasopressor requirements and had a lower renal recovery than NS-AKI (63.2% vs 31.4%, p=0.001; 30.8% vs 13.7%, p=0.031, and 36.9% vs 60.8%, p=0.011, respectively). AKI stage 3 and vasopressor requirements were dependent risk factors for both S-AKI and NS-AKI mortality. Meanwhile, SOFA score > 7 and the need for dialysis are dependent and independent risk factors for mortality in S-AKI. Worsening and/or persistence in UO, serum urea and creatinine levels at 48 h after admission were predictors of mortality in S-AKI and NS-AKI. Improvement in UO in surviving patients was more pronounced in S-AKI than in NS-AKI (50% vs 17.1%, p=0.007). The surviving S-AKI patients had a longer hospital stay than surviving NS-AKI [8 (6-14.5) vs 5 (4 – 8), p=0.004]. S-AKI have higher mortality and vasopressor requirements and have lower renal recovery than NS-AKI. Conclusion: S-AKI have higher mortality and vasopressor requirements and a lower renal recovery than NS-AKI. Independent predictors of mortality in S-AKI were high SOFA scores and the need for dialysis.

                Background: Business actors need to take strategic steps to maintain and improve business performance. Studying and deepening the strategies used by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to maintain their performance conditions are needed as a barometer of crisis resistance in the macroeconomic sector, especially those used by MSMEs in Medan, Indonesia. Thus, this research provides a real picture in the field of variables and indicators that affect the business strategy of MSMEs through the perspective of a lean approach. Methods: The population in this region was 466 business actors of MSMEs in Medan. A random stratified sampling strategy is used, and 169 businesses in the MSMEs production sector were obtained as samples, which has exceeded the standard achievement of 80 percent in detecting an R2 value of at least 0.10 (with a 5 percent probability of error). The research variables used consisted of one endogenous variable (use of a lean strategy), two exogenous variables (external lean practice and internal lean practice), and one mediating variable (financial performance). Seven hypotheses (inner models) were tested using structural equation modelling–partial least squares, nonparametric statistical data analysis techniques with mediation effects, assisted by Smart PLS 3.0. Results: Based on the path coefficient, internal lean practice predominantly influences the financial performance of MSMEs in Medan compared to external lean practice. Internal lean practice is the primary signal for identifying the degree of lean strategy practice in the MSMEs production sector in Medan city. Conclusion: These findings can be a map for practitioners, academics, and the government to improve the financial performance of MSMEs and assist them in their business strategies through internal business practices. Moreover, this study's impact can lead to an understanding of business strategies in operations that directly or indirectly affect the environment toward global warming and various environmental problems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CStone: A de novo transcriptome assembler for short-read data that identifies non-chimeric contigs based on underlying graph structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Raquel Linheiro, John Archer</p>

With the exponential growth of sequence information stored over the last decade, including that of <i>de novo</i> assembled contigs from RNA-Seq experiments, quantification of chimeric sequences has become essential when assembling read data. In transcriptomics, <i>de novo</i> assembled chimeras can closely resemble underlying transcripts, but patterns such as those seen between co-evolving sites, or mapped read counts, become obscured. We have created a de Bruijn based <i>de novo</i> assembler for RNA-Seq data that utilizes a classification system to describe the complexity of underlying graphs from which contigs are created. Each contig is labelled with one of three levels, indicating whether or not ambiguous paths exist. A by-product of this is information on the range of complexity of the underlying gene families present. As a demonstration of CStones ability to assemble high-quality contigs, and to label them in this manner, both simulated and real data were used. For simulated data, ten million read pairs were generated from cDNA libraries representing four species, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, <i>Panthera pardus</i>, <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> and <i>Serinus canaria</i>. These were assembled using CStone, Trinity and rnaSPAdes; the latter two being high-quality, well established, <i>de novo</i> assembers. For real data, two RNA-Seq datasets, each consisting of ≈30 million read pairs, representing two adult <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i> whole-body samples were used. The contigs that CStone produced were comparable in quality to those of Trinity and rnaSPAdes in terms of length, sequence identity of aligned regions and the range of cDNA transcripts represented, whilst providing additional information on chimerism. Here we describe the details of CStones assembly and classification process, and propose that similar classification systems can be incorporated into other <i>de novo</i> assembly tools. Within a related side study, we explore the effects that chimera’s within reference sets have on the identification of differentially expression genes. CStone is available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/cstone/.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elastic energy savings and active energy cost in a simple model of running</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryan T. Schroeder, Arthur D. Kuo</p>

The energetic economy of running benefits from tendon and other tissues that store and return elastic energy, thus saving muscles from costly mechanical work. The classic “Spring-mass” computational model successfully explains the forces, displacements and mechanical power of running, as the outcome of dynamical interactions between the body center of mass and a purely elastic spring for the leg. However, the Spring-mass model does not include active muscles and cannot explain the metabolic energy cost of running, whether on level ground or on a slope. Here we add explicit actuation and dissipation to the Spring-mass model, and show how they explain substantial active (and thus costly) work during human running, and much of the associated energetic cost. Dissipation is modeled as modest energy losses (5% of total mechanical energy for running at 3 m s<sup>-1</sup>) from hysteresis and foot-ground collisions, that must be restored by active work each step. Even with substantial elastic energy return (59% of positive work, comparable to empirical observations), the active work could account for most of the metabolic cost of human running (about 68%, assuming human-like muscle efficiency). We also introduce a previously unappreciated energetic cost for rapid production of force, that helps explain the relatively smooth ground reaction forces of running, and why muscles might also actively perform negative work. With both work and rapid force costs, the model reproduces the energetics of human running at a range of speeds on level ground and on slopes. Although elastic return is key to energy savings, there are still losses that require restorative muscle work, which can cost substantial energy during running.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Homeostatic scaling is driven by a translation-dependent degradation axis that recruits miRISC remodeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Balakumar Srinivasan, Sarbani Samaddar, Sivaram V. S. Mylavarapu, James P. Clement, Sourav Banerjee</p>

Homeostatic scaling in neurons has been attributed to the individual contribution of either translation or degradation; however, there remains limited insight toward understanding how the interplay between the two processes effectuates synaptic homeostasis. Here, we report that a codependence between protein synthesis and degradation mechanisms drives synaptic homeostasis, whereas abrogation of either prevents it. Coordination between the two processes is achieved through the formation of a tripartite complex between translation regulators, the 26S proteasome, and the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) components such as Argonaute, MOV10, and Trim32 on actively translating transcripts or polysomes. The components of this ternary complex directly interact with each other in an RNA-dependent manner. Disruption of polysomes abolishes this ternary interaction, suggesting that translating RNAs facilitate the combinatorial action of the proteasome and the translational apparatus. We identify that synaptic downscaling involves miRISC remodeling, which entails the mTORC1-dependent translation of Trim32, an E3 ligase, and the subsequent degradation of its target, MOV10 <i>via</i> the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase. We find that the E3 ligase Trim32 specifically polyubiquitinates MOV10 for its degradation during synaptic downscaling. MOV10 degradation alone is sufficient to invoke downscaling by enhancing Arc translation through its 3′ UTR and causing the subsequent removal of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Synaptic scaling was occluded when we depleted Trim32 and overexpressed MOV10 in neurons, suggesting that the Trim32-MOV10 axis is necessary for synaptic downscaling. We propose a mechanism that exploits a translation-driven protein degradation paradigm to invoke miRISC remodeling and induce homeostatic scaling during chronic network activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A survey of biomedical journals to detect editorial bias and nepotistic behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexandre Scanff, Florian Naudet, Ioana A. Cristea, David Moher, Dorothy V. M. Bishop, Clara Locher</p>

Alongside the growing concerns regarding predatory journal growth, other questionable editorial practices have gained visibility recently. Among them, we explored the usefulness of the Percentage of Papers by the Most Prolific author (PPMP) and the Gini index (level of inequality in the distribution of authorship among authors) as tools to identify journals that may show favoritism in accepting articles by specific authors. We examined whether the PPMP, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using all articles in a sample of 5,468 biomedical journals indexed in the National Library of Medicine. For articles published between 2015 and 2019, the median PPMP was 2.9%, and 5% of journal exhibited a PPMP of 10.6% or more. Among the journals with the highest PPMP or Gini index values, where a few authors were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications, a random sample was manually examined, revealing that the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61%). The papers by the most prolific authors were more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their submission. Results of analysis on a subset of articles, excluding nonresearch articles, were consistent with those of the principal analysis. In most journals, publications are distributed across a large number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be transparent about their editorial and peer review practices.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Metabolic response against traffic congestion-induced stress [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traffic congestion is a common problem in large cities, which can induce stress in participants in vehicles as well as pedestrians. In such conditions, several stress hormones, such as catecholamines and cortisol are secreted by the adrenal glands resulting in metabolic responses. Prolonged metabolic changes can lead to metabolic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to examine the metabolic responses induced by traffic congestion in young adults. Methods: We enrolled 71 undergraduate students aged 20-30 years from the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Islam Bandung, who regularly go to campus on foot, by public transportation, motorcycles, and cars. Medical history was screened by questionnaires before the testing day. Blood samples were drawn soon after participants arrived on campus. We used bioimpedance analysis to measure fasting blood glucose, lipid profiles, and nutrient body status. Results: Most participants rode motorcycles (46.48%), and the most common travel time was short (<15 min, 54.9%.). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were significantly lower in participants using vehicles - either private or public transportation - compared with pedestrians (p<0.05 and p<0.02, respectively). Participants with a short travel duration had significantly higher total cholesterol and LDL levels than those with longer ones (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively). Conclusions: Based on the above results, metabolic responses to traffic congestion such as changes to total cholesterol and LDL levels depended the type of transportation and travel duration.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are key players in the development and maintenance of the vascular tree, the establishment of the blood brain barrier and control of blood flow. Disruption in ECs is an early and active component of vascular pathogenesis. However, our ability to selectively target ECs in the CNS for identification and manipulation is limited. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we utilized a recently developed AAV-BR1 system to identify distinct classes of ECs along the vascular tree using a GFP reporter. We then developed an inducible EC-specific ectopic Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression system using AAV-BR1-CAG-DIO-Cx43-P2A-DsRed2 in combination with a mouse line carrying inducible CreERT2 in ECs. We targeted Cx43 because its loss has been implicated in microvascular impairment in numerous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular edema. GFP-labeled ECs were numerous, evenly distributed along the vascular tree and their morphology was polarized with respect to the direction of blood flow. After tamoxifen induction, ectopic Cx43 was specifically expressed in ECs. Similarly to endogenous Cx43, ectopic Cx43 was localized at the membrane contacts of ECs and it did not affect tight junction proteins. The ability to enhance gap junctions in ECs provides a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, an early pathology in numerous diseases.</p>

     alt="Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation is disinhibited following traumatic brain injury in leukemia inhibitory factor heterozygous mice"/>
<p>Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) haplodeficiency alters forebrain development and proliferative responses to closed head injury. Injury increases overall proliferation and increases the number of multipotential progenitors in the subventricular zone at 48 hr post-injury that is more dramatic in LIF Het mice. Oligodendrocyte lineage cells are most sensitive to decreased levels in LIF, and more specifically, early oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) proliferation increases in LIF Het injured mice. The addition of LIF decreases overall proliferation and decreases the number of proliferating late OPCs, suggesting that LIF pushes the cells into a more mature state.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant problem that affects over 800,000 children each year. As cell proliferation is disturbed by injury and required for normal brain development, we investigated how a pediatric closed head injury (CHI) would affect the progenitors of the subventricular zone (SVZ). Additionally, we evaluated the contribution of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) using germline LIF heterozygous mice (LIF Het), as LIF is an injury-induced cytokine, known to influence neurogenesis and gliogenesis. CHIs were performed on P20 LIF Het and wild-type (WT) mice. Ki-67 immunostaining and stereology revealed that cell proliferation increased ~250% in injured LIF Het mice compared to the 30% increase observed in injured WT mice at 48-hr post-CHI. OLIG2+ cell proliferation increased in the SVZ and white matter of LIF Het injured mice at 48-hr recovery. Using an 8-color flow cytometry panel, the proliferation of three distinct multipotential progenitors and early oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation was significantly increased in LIF Het injured mice compared to WT injured mice. Supporting its cytostatic function, LIF decreased neurosphere progenitor and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation compared to controls. In highly enriched mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cell cultures, LIF increased phospho-protein kinase B after 20 min and increased phospho-S6 ribosomal protein at 20 and 40 min of exposure, which are downstream targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Altogether, our data provide new insights into the regulatory role of LIF in suppressing neural progenitor cell proliferation and, in particular, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation after a mild TBI.</p>

                Brain circuits consist of linked neurons, connected at synaptic sites by cell-adhesion molecules presented by defined pre- and post-synaptic neurons. In this study, Donohue et al. reveal the importance of the synaptic cell adhesion molecule latrophilin-2 for the establishment of neural connections between presubiculum and medial entorhinal cortex brain regions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Inhibitory control of synaptic signals preceding locomotion in mouse frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The frontal cortex is essential for organizing voluntary movement. Zhang et al. show that frontal principal neurons produce slowly increasing ramps of subthreshold and spiking activity before running onset. Learning a task accelerates these signals. Specific subpopulations of interneurons play distinct roles in controlling the ramps and shaping their task dependence.

                Chang et al. report that Dusp6 deficiency strengthens the junctions and extends the microvilli, thereby enhancing colonic barrier integrity. Dusp6 deficiency also promotes glucose-to-lipid metabolic switch and elevates mitochondrial oxygen consumption, thereby maintaining the anaerobic state for preserving obligatory bacteria. An anti-colitis anaerobe, NHRI-C1-K-H-1-87, is identified in Dusp6-knockout mice.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Reprogramming of H3K9bhb at regulatory elements is a key feature of fasting in the small intestine</a></h4>

              
                Terranova et al. demonstrate that fasting induces production of HMGCS2 and β-hydroxybutyrate in small intestine (SI) crypt cells. This causes enrichment of H3K9bhb within regulatory regions of critical metabolic genes in crypt epithelial cells. Loss of intestinal Hmgcs2 impairs H3K9bhb enrichment and affects expression of H3K9bhb-associated metabolic gene programs.

                Muehlbauer et al. investigate how variation between different hominid microbiomes drives host gene expression in colonic epithelial cell cultures. They find that host genes that respond only to microbiomes from a specific hominid species are linked to gastrointestinal diseases, suggesting implications for understanding how the microbiome can impact human health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Increasing human motor skill acquisition by driving theta-gamma coupling</a></h4>

              
                Skill learning is a fundamental adaptive process, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Some learning paradigms, particularly in the memory domain, are closely associated with gamma activity that is amplitude-modulated by the phase of underlying theta activity, but whether such nested activity patterns also underpin skill learning is unknown. Here we addressed this question by using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over sensorimotor cortex to modulate theta-gamma activity during motor skill acquisition, as an exemplar of a non-hippocampal-dependent task. We demonstrated, and then replicated, a significant improvement in skill acquisition with theta-gamma tACS, which outlasted the stimulation by an hour. Our results suggest that theta-gamma activity may be a common mechanism for learning across the brain and provides a putative novel intervention for optimising functional improvements in response to training or therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The IRE1/XBP1 signaling axis promotes skeletal muscle regeneration through a cell non-autonomous mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal muscle regeneration is regulated by coordinated activation of multiple signaling pathways activated in both injured myofibers and satellite cells. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a major mechanism that detects and alleviates protein-folding stresses in ER. However, the role of individual arms of the UPR in skeletal muscle regeneration remain less understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that IRE1α (also known as ERN1) and its downstream target, XBP1, are activated in skeletal muscle of mice upon injury. Myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1 or XBP1 in mice diminishes skeletal muscle regeneration that is accompanied with reduced number of satellite cells and their fusion to injured myofibers. Ex vivo cultures of myofiber explants demonstrate that ablation of IRE1α reduces the proliferative capacity of myofiber-associated satellite cells. Myofiber-specific deletion of IRE1α dampens Notch signaling and canonical NF-kB pathway in skeletal muscle of mice. Our results also demonstrate that targeted ablation of IRE1α reduces skeletal muscle regeneration in the mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Collectively, our results reveal that the IRE1α-mediated signaling promotes muscle regeneration through augmenting the proliferation of satellite cells in a cell non-autonomous manner.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">BRAFV600E induces reversible mitotic arrest in human melanocytes via microrna-mediated suppression of AURKB</a></h4>

              
                Benign melanocytic nevi frequently emerge when an acquired <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutation triggers unchecked proliferation and subsequent arrest in melanocytes. Recent observations have challenged the role of oncogene-induced senescence in melanocytic nevus formation, necessitating investigations into alternative mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance of proliferation arrest in nevi. We compared the transcriptomes of melanocytes from healthy human skin, nevi, and melanomas arising from nevi and identified a set of microRNAs as highly expressed nevus-enriched transcripts. Two of these microRNAs—MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p—induced mitotic failure, genome duplication, and proliferation arrest in human melanocytes through convergent targeting of AURKB. We demonstrate that <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> induces a similar proliferation arrest in primary human melanocytes that is both reversible and conditional. Specifically, <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> expression stimulates either arrest or proliferation depending on the differentiation state of the melanocyte. We report genome duplication in human melanocytic nevi, reciprocal expression of AURKB and microRNAs in nevi and melanomas, and rescue of arrested human nevus cells with AURKB expression. Taken together, our data describe an alternative molecular mechanism for melanocytic nevus formation that is congruent with both experimental and clinical observations.

                <b>Background:</b> There is potentially considerable variation in the nature and duration of the care provided to hospitalised patients during an infectious disease epidemic or pandemic. Improvements in care and clinician confidence may shorten the time spent as an inpatient, or the need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high density unit (HDU). On the other hand, limited resources at times of high demand may lead to rationing. Nevertheless, these variables may be used as static proxies for disease severity, as outcome measures for trials, and to inform planning and logistics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DAAM mediates the assembly of long-lived, treadmilling stress fibers in collectively migrating epithelial cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Stress fibers (SFs) are actomyosin bundles commonly found in individually migrating cells in culture. However, whether and how cells use SFs to migrate in vivo or collectively is largely unknown. Studying the collective migration of the follicular epithelial cells in <i>Drosophila</i>, we found that the SFs in these cells show a novel treadmilling behavior that allows them to persist as the cells migrate over multiple cell lengths. Treadmilling SFs grow at their fronts by adding new integrin-based adhesions and actomyosin segments over time. This causes the SFs to have many internal adhesions along their lengths, instead of adhesions only at the ends. The front-forming adhesions remain stationary relative to the substrate and typically disassemble as the cell rear approaches. By contrast, a different type of adhesion forms at the SF’s terminus that slides with the cell’s trailing edge as the actomyosin ahead of it shortens. We further show that SF treadmilling depends on cell movement and identify a developmental switch in the formins that mediate SF assembly, with Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis acting during migratory stages and Diaphanous acting during postmigratory stages. We propose that treadmilling SFs keep each cell on a linear trajectory, thereby promoting the collective motility required for epithelial migration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">New fossils of Australopithecus sediba reveal a nearly complete lower back</a></h4>

              
                Adaptations of the lower back to bipedalism are frequently discussed but infrequently demonstrated in early fossil hominins. Newly discovered lumbar vertebrae contribute to a near-complete lower back of Malapa Hominin 2 (MH2), offering additional insights into posture and locomotion in <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>. We show that MH2 possessed a lower back consistent with lumbar lordosis and other adaptations to bipedalism, including an increase in the width of intervertebral articular facets from the upper to lower lumbar column (‘pyramidal configuration’). These results contrast with some recent work on lordosis in fossil hominins, where MH2 was argued to demonstrate no appreciable lordosis (‘hypolordosis’) similar to Neandertals. Our three-dimensional geometric morphometric (3D GM) analyses show that MH2’s nearly complete middle lumbar vertebra is human-like in overall shape but its vertebral body is somewhat intermediate in shape between modern humans and great apes. Additionally, it bears long, cranially and ventrally oriented costal (transverse) processes, implying powerful trunk musculature. We interpret this combination of features to indicate that <i>A. sediba</i> used its lower back in both bipedal and arboreal positional behaviors, as previously suggested based on multiple lines of evidence from other parts of the skeleton and reconstructed paleobiology of <i>A. sediba</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Giant ankyrin-B mediates transduction of axon guidance and collateral branch pruning factor sema 3A</a></h4>

              
                Variants in the high confident autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gene <i>ANK2</i> target both ubiquitously expressed 220 kDa ankyrin-B and neurospecific 440 kDa ankyrin-B (AnkB440) isoforms. Previous work showed that knock-in mice expressing an ASD-linked <i>Ank2</i> variant yielding a truncated AnkB440 product exhibit ectopic brain connectivity and behavioral abnormalities. Expression of this variant or loss of AnkB440 caused axonal hyperbranching in vitro, which implicated AnkB440 microtubule bundling activity in suppressing collateral branch formation. Leveraging multiple mouse models, cellular assays, and live microscopy, we show that AnkB440 also modulates axon collateral branching stochastically by reducing the number of F-actin-rich branch initiation points. Additionally, we show that AnkB440 enables growth cone (GC) collapse in response to chemorepellent factor semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A) by stabilizing its receptor complex L1 cell adhesion molecule/neuropilin-1. ASD-linked <i>ANK2</i> variants failed to rescue Sema 3A-induced GC collapse. We propose that impaired response to repellent cues due to AnkB440 deficits leads to axonal targeting and branch pruning defects and may contribute to the pathogenicity of <i>ANK2</i> variants.

                The molecular motor myosin undergoes a series of major structural transitions during its force-producing motor cycle. The underlying mechanism and its coupling to ATP hydrolysis and actin binding is only partially understood, mostly due to sparse structural data on actin-bound states of myosin. Here, we report 26 high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the actomyosin-V complex in the strong-ADP, rigor, and a previously unseen post-rigor transition state that binds the ATP analog AppNHp. The structures reveal a high flexibility of myosin in each state and provide valuable insights into the structural transitions of myosin-V upon ADP release and binding of AppNHp, as well as the actomyosin interface. In addition, they show how myosin is able to specifically alter the structure of F-actin.

                Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are losing efficacy against emerging variants and may not protect against future novel coronavirus outbreaks, emphasizing the need for more broadly protective vaccines. To inform the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, we investigated the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies against the spike (S) proteins of human coronaviruses (hCoV) after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We found an 11- to 123-fold increase in antibodies binding to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as a 2- to 4-fold difference in antibodies binding to seasonal hCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors, with the S2 subdomain of the S protein being the main target for cross-reactivity. In addition, we detected cross-reactive antibodies to all hCoV S proteins after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in macaques and humans, with higher responses for hCoV more closely related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings support the feasibility of and provide guidance for development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.

                Regeneration after severe peripheral nerve injury is often poor. Knowledge of human nerve regeneration and the growth microenvironment is greatly lacking. We aimed to identify the regenerative proteins in human peripheral nerve by comparing the proteome before and after a transection injury. In a unique study design, we collected from the same participants, samples from naive and degenerating sural nerve. Naive and degenerating (two weeks after injury) samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry and immunoassays. Using a correlation matrix, we found significantly altered levels following the nerve injury. Mass spectrometry revealed that post-injury samples had 672 proteins significantly upregulated and 661 significantly downregulated compared to naive samples (q < 0.05, |FC| > 2). We used Gene Ontology pathways to highlight groups of proteins that were significantly upregulated or downregulated with injury-induced degeneration and regeneration. Significant protein changes in key pathways were identified including growth factor levels, Schwann cell de-differentiation, myelination downregulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and axonal regeneration pathways. Having proteome signatures of human peripheral nerves of both the uninjured and the degenerating/regenerating state may serve as biomarkers to aid in the future development of repair strategies and in monitoring neural tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of peripheral neuronal FLT3 promotes exaggerated sensorial and emotional pain-related behaviors facilitating the transition from acute to chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Background. Acute pain events have been associated with persistent pain sensitization of nociceptive pathways increasing the risk of transition from acute to chronic pain. However, it is unclear whether injury-induced persistent pain sensitization can promote long-term mood disorders. The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is causally required for peripheral nerve injury-induced pain chronification, questioning its role in the development of pain-induced mood alterations. Methods. In a model of paw incisional pain, mice underwent single (SI) or double incision (DI) and went through behavioral and molecular phenotyping with the evaluation of both sensorial and emotional pain components. The role of FLT3 was then investigated either by inhibition using transgenic knock-out mice and functional antibodies or by activation with FLT3 ligand (FL) administrations. Results. DI mice showed significant anxiodepressive-like and spontaneous pain behaviors while SI mice did not. DI also promoted and extended mechanical pain hypersensitivity compared to SI. This emotional and sensorial pain exaggeration correlated with a potentiation of spinal microglial activation after DI versus SI. Intrathecal minocycline, a microglial inhibitor, specifically reversed DI induced-mechanical hypersensitivity. Finally, FL injections in naive animals provoked mechanical allodynia and anxiodepressive-like disorders concomitant with a significant microglial activation while FLT3 inhibition blunted the development of persistent pain and depression after DI. Conclusions. Our results show for the first time that the repetition of a peripheral lesion facilitates not only exaggerated nociceptive behaviors but also anxiodepressive disorders. The inhibition of FLT3 could become a promising therapy in the management of pain sensitization and related mood alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term potentiation at pyramidal cell to somatostatin interneuron synapses controls hippocampal network plasticity and memory</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal somatostatin (SOM) cells are dendrite-projecting inhibitory interneurons. CA1 SOM cells receive major excitatory inputs from pyramidal cells (PC-SOM synapses) which show mGluR1a- and mTORC1-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP). PC-SOM synapse LTP contributes to CA1 network metaplasticity and memory consolidation, but whether it is sufficient to regulate these processes remains unknown. Here we used optogenetic stimulation of CA1 pyramidal cells and whole cell recordings in slices to show that optogenetic theta burst stimulation (TBSopto) produces LTP at PC-SOM synapses. At the network level, we found that TBSopto differentially regulates metaplasticity of pyramidal cell inputs: enhancing LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses and depressing LTP at temporo-ammonic synapses. At the behavioral level, we uncovered that in vivo TBSopto regulates learning-induced LTP at PC-SOM synapses, as well as contextual fear memory. Thus, LTP of PC-SOM synapses is a long-term feedback mechanism controlling pyramidal cell synaptic plasticity, sufficient to regulate memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison of neuromuscular junction dynamics following ischemic and aged skeletal muscle</a></h4>

              
                Both aging and neuromuscular diseases lead to significant changes in the morphology and functionality of the neuromuscular synapse. Skeletal muscles display a remarkable regenerative capacity, however, are still susceptible to diseases of aging and peripheral nerve perturbations. In this study, we assessed how neuromuscular synapses differ in aged and injured skeletal muscle using an improved neuromuscular junction (NMJ) staining and imaging method. We found that both aged and ischemic skeletal muscle display Wallerian degeneration of the presynaptic motor axons and fragmentation of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Quantifiable measurements of various metrics of the NMJs provide a more concrete idea of the dynamics that are occurring in the muscle microenvironment. We questioned whether neuronal degradation precedes myofiber atrophy or vice versa. Previously, it was shown that a cellular crosstalk exists among the motor neurons, myofibers, vasculature, and mitochondria within the muscle microdomain. It is apparent that lack of blood flow to motor neurons in ischemic skeletal muscle disrupts the structure of NMJs, however it is unclear if the aging condition experiences similar dynamics. We demonstrated that both aged and ischemic skeletal muscle demonstrate similar patterns of degeneration, characterized by a smaller percentage overlap of presynaptic and postsynaptic sides, greater fragmentation of AChRs, and a smaller area of AChR clusters. Together, these results reveal high resolution, precise parallels between the aged and ischemic NMJs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Is categorization in visual working memory a way to reduce mental effort? A pupillometry study</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies on visual working memory (VWM) have shown that visual information can be stored in VWM as continuous (e.g., a specific shade of red) as well as categorical representations (e.g., the general category red). It has been widely assumed, yet never directly tested, that continuous representations require more VWM mental effort than categorical representations; given limited VWM capacity, this would mean that fewer continuous, as compared to categorical, representations can be maintained simultaneously. We tested this assumption by measuring pupil size, as a proxy for mental effort, in a delayed estimation task. Participants memorized one to four ambiguous (boundaries between adjacent color categories) or prototypical colors to encourage continuous or categorical representations, respectively; after a delay, a probe indicated the location of the to-be-reported color. We found that, for set size 1, pupil size was larger while maintaining ambiguous as compared to prototypical colors, but without any difference in memory precision; this suggests that participants relied on an effortful continuous representation to maintain a single ambiguous color, thus resulting in pupil dilation while preserving precision. In contrast, for set size 2 and higher, pupil size was equally large while maintaining ambiguous and prototypical colors, but memory precision was now substantially reduced for ambiguous colors; this suggests that participants now also relied on categorical representations for ambiguous colors (which are by definition a poor fit to any category), thus reducing memory precision but not resulting in pupil dilation. Taken together, our results suggest that continuous representations are more effortful than categorical representations, and that very few continuous representations (perhaps only one) can be maintained simultaneously.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective Inhibitory Circuit Dysfunction after Chronic Frontal Lobe Contusion</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurologic disability; the most common deficits affect prefrontal cortex-dependent functions such as attention, working memory, social behavior, and mental flexibility. Despite this prevalence, little is known about the pathophysiology that develops in frontal cortical microcircuits after TBI. We investigated if alterations in subtype-specific inhibitory circuits are associated with cognitive inflexibility in a mouse model of frontal lobe contusion that recapitulates aberrant mental flexibility as measured by deficits in rule reversal learning. Using patch clamp recordings and optogenetic stimulation, we identified selective vulnerability in the non-fast spiking, somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) subtype of inhibitory neurons in layer V of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) two months after injury. These neurons exhibited reduced intrinsic excitability and a decrease in their synaptic output onto pyramidal neurons. By contrast, fast spiking, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons did not show changes in intrinsic excitability or synaptic output. Impairments in SOM+ inhibitory circuit function were also associated with network hyperexcitability. These findings provide evidence for selective disruptions within specific inhibitory microcircuits that may guide the development of novel therapeutics for TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vitro and in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screens reveal drivers of aging in neural stem cells of the brain</a></h4>

              
                Aging impairs the ability of neural stem cells to transition from quiescence to activation (proliferation) in the adult mammalian brain. Neural stem cell (NSC) functional decline results in decreased production of new neurons and defective regeneration upon injury during aging, and this is exacerbated in Alzheimer's disease. Many genes are upregulated with age in NSCs, and the knockout of some of these boosts old NSC activation and rejuvenates aspects of old brain function. But systematic functional testing of genes in old NSCs - and more generally in old cells - has not been done. This has been a major limiting factor in identifying the most promising rejuvenation interventions. Here we develop in vitro and in vivo high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screening platforms to systematically uncover gene knockouts that boost NSC activation in old mice. Our genome-wide screening pipeline in primary cultures of young and old NSCs identifies over 300 gene knockouts that specifically restore old NSC activation. Interestingly, the top gene knockouts are involved in glucose import, cilium organization and ribonucleoprotein structures. To determine which gene knockouts have a rejuvenating effect for the aging brain, we establish a scalable CRISPR-Cas9 screening platform in vivo in old mice. Of the 50 gene knockouts we tested in vivo, 23 boost old NSC activation and production of new neurons in old brains. Notably, the knockout of Slc2a4, which encodes for the GLUT4 glucose transporter, is a top rejuvenating intervention for old NSCs. GLUT4 protein expression increases in the stem cell niche during aging, and we show that old NSCs indeed uptake ~2-fold more glucose than their young counterparts. Transient glucose starvation increases the ability of old NSCs to activate, which is not further improved by knockout of Slc2a4/GLUT4. Together, these results indicate that a shift in glucose uptake contributes to the decline in NSC activation with age, but that it can be reversed by genetic or external interventions. Importantly, our work provides scalable platforms to systematically identify genetic interventions that boost old NSC function, including in vivo in old brains, with important implications for regenerative and cognitive decline during aging.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) cause neuroinflammation, exaggerated immune response, and, consequently, neurodegeneration. The gut microbiome is an essential modulator of the immune system, impacting in the brain. There are not effective treatments for TBI, therefore, modulating the gut microbiome may shed novel therapeutics for the damaged brain. Also, in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the microbiota has been associated with a lack of diversity, which negatively modulates the immune system. This study aimed to determine whether the gut microbiota from AD mice exacerbates neurological deficits after TBI in young mice. For this purpose, we performed fecal microbiota transplants from AD (FMT-AD) mice into young C57BL/6 (wild-type, WT) mice following TBI. Thus, FMT-AD and fecal microbiota transplants from healthy controls (FMT-young) were administered orally to young WT mice after the TBI occurred. We first determined the gut microbiota diversity and composition by analyzing full-length 16S rRNA sequences from mouse fecal samples using the Oxford Nanopore MinION technology. We collected the blood, brain, and gut tissues for protein and immunohistochemical analysis. Our results showed that FMT-AD treatment stimulates a higher relative abundance of Muribaculum intestinal and a decrease in Lactobacillus johnsonii compared FMT-young treatment in WT mice. Furthermore, WT mice exhibited larger lesion volumes, increased the number of activated microglia/macrophages cells, and reduced motor recovery after FMT-AD compared to FMT-young one day after TBI. Thus, the gut microbiota from AD mice not only aggravates the neuroinflammatory response and motor recovery, but also increases the lesion size after TBI in young WT mice.

                Protein S-palmitoylation is a reversible post translational lipid modification that plays a critical role in neuronal development and plasticity, while dysregulated S-palmitoylation underlies a number of severe neurological disorders. Dynamic S-palmitoylation is regulated by a large family of ZDHHC palmitoylating enzymes, their accessory proteins, and a small number of known de-palmitoylating enzymes. Here, we curated and analyzed expression data for the proteins that mediate S-palmitoylation from publicly available RNAseq datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of their distribution in the mouse nervous system. We developed a web-tool that enables interactive visualization of the expression patterns for these proteins in the nervous system (http://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/), and explored this resource to find region and cell-type specific expression patterns that give insight into the function of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes in the brain and neurological disorders. We found coordinated expression of ZDHHC enzymes with their accessory proteins, de-palmitoylating enzymes and other brain-expressed genes that included an enrichment of S-palmitoylation substrates. Finally, we utilized ZDHHC expression patterns to predict and validate palmitoylating enzyme-substrate interactions.

                Subcortical nuclei and other deep brain structures are known to play an important role in the regulation of the central and peripheral nervous systems. It can be difficult to identify and delineate many of these nuclei and their finer subdivisions in conventional MRI due to their small size, buried location, and often subtle contrast compared to neighboring tissue. To address this problem, we applied a multi-modal approach in ex vivo non-human primate (NHP) brain that includes high-resolution mean apparent propagator (MAP)-MRI and five different histological stains imaged with high-resolution microscopy in the brain of the same subject. By registering these high-dimensional MRI data to high-resolution histology data, we can map the location, boundaries, subdivisions, and micro-architectural features of subcortical gray matter regions in the macaque monkey brain. At high spatial resolution, diffusion MRI in general, and MAP-MRI in particular, can distinguish a large number of deep brain structures, including the larger and smaller white matter fiber tracts as well as architectonic features within various nuclei. Correlation with histology from the same brain enables a thorough validation of the structures identified with MAP-MRI. Moreover, anatomical details that are evident in images of MAP-MRI parameters are not visible in conventional T1-weighted images. We also derived subcortical template SC21 from segmented MRI slices in three-dimensions and registered this volume to a previously published anatomical template with cortical parcellation (Reveley et al., 2017; Saleem and Logothetis, 2012), thereby integrating the 3D segmentation of both cortical and subcortical regions into the same volume. This newly updated three-dimensional D99 digital brain atlas (V2.0) is intended for use as a reference standard for macaque neuroanatomical, functional, and connectional imaging studies, involving both cortical and subcortical targets. The SC21 and D99 digital templates are available as volumes and surfaces in standard NIFTI and GIFTI formats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quasi-universal scaling in mouse-brain neuronal activity stems from edge-of-instability critical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The brain is in a state of perpetual reverberant neural activity, even in the absence of specific tasks or stimuli. Shedding light on the origin and functional significance of such activity is essential to understanding how the brain transmits, processes, and stores information. An inspiring, albeit controversial, conjecture proposes that some statistical characteristics of empirically observed neuronal activity can be understood by assuming that brain networks operate in a dynamical regime near the edge of a phase transition. Moreover, the resulting critical behavior, with its concomitant scale invariance, is assumed to carry crucial functional advantages. Here, we present a data-driven analysis based on simultaneous high-throughput recordings of the activity of thousands of individual neurons in various regions of the mouse brain. To analyze these data, we construct a unified theoretical framework that synergistically combines cutting-edge methods for the study of brain activity (such as a phenomenological renormalization group approach and techniques that infer the general dynamical state of a neural population), while designing complementary tools. This unified approach allows us to uncover strong signatures of scale invariance that is "quasi-universal" across brain regions and reveal that these areas operate, to a greater or lesser extent, at the edge of instability. Furthermore, this framework allows us to distinguish between quasi-universal background activity and non-universal input-related activity. Taken together, the following study provides strong evidence that brain networks actually operate in a critical regime which, among other functional advantages, provides them with a scale-invariant substrate of activity in which optimal input representations can be sustained.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH OUR HIDDEN SIDE</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that the sensory modality used to identify the position of proprioceptive targets hidden from sight, but frequently viewed, influences the type of the body representation employed for reaching them with the finger. The question then arises as to whether this observation also applies to proprioceptive targets which are hidden from sight, and rarely, if ever, viewed. We used an established technique for pinpointing the type of body representation used for the spatial encoding of targets which consisted of assessing the effect of peripheral gaze fixation on the pointing accuracy. More precisely, an exteroceptive, visually dependent, body representation is thought to be used if gaze deviation induces a deviation of the pointing movement. Three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were positioned at the participants' eye level at -25 deg, 0 deg and +25 deg with respect to the cyclopean eye. Without moving the head, the participant fixated the lit LED before the experimenter indicated one of the three target head positions: topmost point of the head (vertex) and two other points located at the front and back of the head. These targets were either verbal-cued or tactile-cued. The goal of the subjects (n=27) was to reach the target with their index finger. We analysed the accuracy of the movements directed to the topmost point of the head, which is a well-defined, yet out of view anatomical point. Based on the possibility of the brain to create visual representations of the body areas that remain out of view, we hypothesized that the position of the vertex is encoded using an exteroceptive body representation, both when verbally or tactile-cued. Results revealed that the pointing errors were biased in the opposite direction of gaze fixation for both verbal-cued and tactile-cued targets, suggesting the use of a vision-dependent exteroceptive body representation. The enhancement of the visual body representations by sensorimotor processes was suggested by the greater pointing accuracy when the vertex was identified by tactile stimulation compared to verbal instruction. Moreover, we found in a control condition that participants were more accurate in indicating the position of their own vertex than the vertex of other people. This result supports the idea that sensorimotor experiences increase the spatial resolution of the exteroceptive body representation. Together, our results suggest that the position of rarely viewed body parts are spatially encoded by an exteroceptive body representation and that non-visual sensorimotor processes are involved in the constructing of this representation.

                Schwann cells, the main glial cell in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), ensheath bundles of small unmyelinated axons or form myelin on larger axons. PNS injuries initiate transcriptional reprograming in both Schwann cells and sensory neurons that promotes regeneration. While the factors that initiate the transcriptional reprograming in Schwann cells are well characterized, the full range of stimuli that initiate this reprograming in sensory neurons remain elusive. Here, using a genetic model of Schwann cell ablation, we find that Schwann cell loss results in transient PNS demyelination without overt axonal loss. By profiling sensory ganglia at single-cell resolution we show that this demyelination induces transcriptional reprogramming preferably in proprioceptive and A{beta} RA-LTMR neurons. Transcriptional reprogramming is assumed to be a cell-autonomous response of sensory neurons to mechanical axonal injury. By identifying similar reprogramming in non-injured, demyelinated neurons, our study suggests that this reprogramming represents a non-cell-autonomous transcriptional response of sensory neurons to the loss of axon-Schwann cell interactions.

                Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has emerged as a powerful unbiased approach for generating seed regions of interest (ROIs) in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis in a data-driven manner. The aim of the present study was to investigate RSFC differences between persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and healthy controls (HCs). We performed a whole-brain connectome-wide MVPA in 50 RRMS patients with expanded disability status scale [&le;]4 and 50 age and gender-matched HCs. Significant group differences were noted in RSFC in 9 clusters distributed in 7 regions; right middle frontal gyrus, frontal medial cortex, left frontal pole, anterior cingulate gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left posterior middle temporal gyrus and right lateral occipital cortex. Whole-brain seed-to-voxel RSFC characterization of these clusters as seed ROIs revealed significantly increased RSFC to the posterior brain regions (bilateral superior lateral occipital cortices, right lingual gyrus and left occipital pole) and reduced connectivity in the anterior and medial regions (right paracingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, left amygdala and left frontal orbital cortex) in RRMS compared to HCs. The results of this study agree with the previous reports on abnormalities of RSFC in RRMS, the cognitive and clinical implications of which are discussed herein.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha power and stimulus-evoked activity dissociate metacognitive reports of attention, visibility and confidence in a visual detection task</a></h4>

              
                Variability in the detection and discrimination of weak visual stimuli has been linked to prestimulus neural activity. In particular, the power of oscillatory activity in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) has been shown to impact upon the objective likelihood of stimulus detection, as well as measures of subjective visibility, attention, and decision confidence. We aimed to clarify how prestimulus alpha influences performance and phenomenology, by recording simultaneous subjective measures of attention and confidence (Experiment 1), or attention and visibility (Experiment 2) on a trial-by-trial basis in a visual detection task. Across both experiments, prestimulus alpha power was negatively and linearly correlated with the intensity of subjective attention. In contrast to this linear relationship, we observed a quadratic relationship between the strength of prestimulus alpha power and subjective ratings of confidence and visibility. We find that this same quadratic relationship links prestimulus alpha power to the strength of stimulus evoked responses. Visibility and confidence judgements corresponded to the strength of evoked responses, but confidence, uniquely, incorporated information about attentional state. As such, our findings reveal distinct psychological and neural correlates of metacognitive judgements of attentional state, stimulus visibility, and decision confidence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How increased cognitive load affects the dual-task cost in healthy young adults? A randomized, double-blind sham-controlled study</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to interact flexibly with the surrounding environment and achieve an adaptive goal-directed response is one of the necessities of balance control. This study aimed to examine the interaction between cognitive demand and the necessity for keeping balance in unstable conditions. We examined the effects of performing two cognitive tasks, namely the Stroop test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), on postural balance in healthy young adults. Stroop and the WCST test assess selective attention and cognitive flexibility in shifting between rules, respectively. Thirty-two healthy adults were included in two experimental conditions (control and treatment) in random order, separated by at least seven days. Standing balance was evaluated by the Sway Medical Mobile application in eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) in different stance positions: feet apart, feet together, semi-tandem, tandem, and single-leg stance (SLS). Balance was evaluated before and after the cognitive test in each experimental condition. Our findings indicate that performing cognitively demanding tasks adversely affected the balance ability in more demanding balance tests such as the SLS with EC (P 0.05). However, no significant changes were seen in other balance tests (P 0.05). Additionally, no significant changes were seen in balance ability after the Stroop or Wisconsin card sorting test alone. These results confirm that performing cognitively demanding tasks significantly reduced the ability to keep balance in less stable conditions. These findings have significant implications in understanding and preventing falls and incidents resulting from an impaired balance in complex and cognitively demanding conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Categorical encoding of voice in human superior temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ability to recognize abstract features of voice during auditory perception is a complex, yet poorly understood, feat of human audition. For the listener, this occurs in near-automatic fasion to seamlessly extract complex cues from a highly variable auditory signal. Voice perception depends on specialized regions of auditory cortex, including superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, the nature of voice encoding at the cortical level remains poorly understoood. We leverage intracerebral recordings across human auditory cortex during presentation of voice and non-voice acoustic stimuli to examine voice encoding in auditory cortex, in eight patient-participants undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation. We show that voice-selectivity increases along the auditory hierarchy from supratemporal plane (STP) to the STG and STS. Results show accurate decoding of vocalizations from human auditory cortical activity even in the complete absence of linguistic content. These findings show an early, less-selective temporal window of neural activity in the STG and STS followed by a sustained, strongly voice-selective window. We then developed encoding models that demonstrate divergence in the encoding of acoustic features along the auditory hierarchy, wherein STG/STS responses were best explained by voice category as opposed to the acoustic features of voice stimuli. This is in contrast to neural activity recorded from STP, in which responses were accounted for by acoustic features. These findings support a model of voice perception that engages categorical encoding mechanisms within STG and STS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic control of striatal GABAergic microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are essential elements of striatal circuits and behaviors. While acetylcholine signaling via muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) have been well studied, more recent data indicate that postsynaptic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) located on GABAergic interneurons (GINs) are equally critical. One demonstration is that CINs stimulation induces large disynaptic inhibition of SPNs mediated by nAChR activation of striatal GINs. While these circuits are ideally positioned to modulate striatal output activity, the neurons involved are not definitively identified due largely to an incomplete mapping of CINs-GINs interconnections. Here, we show that CINs optogenetic activation evokes an intricate dual mechanism involving co-activation of pre- and postsynaptic mAChRs and nAChRs on four GINs populations. Using multi-optogenetics, we demonstrate the participation of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing GINs in the disynaptic inhibition of SPNs likely via heterotypic electrical coupling with neurogliaform interneurons. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of CINs in regulating GINs microcircuits via complex synaptic/heterosynaptic mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased heterogeneity and task-related reconfiguration of functional connectivity within a lexicosemantic network in autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly heterogeneous in etiology and clinical presentation. Findings on intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) or task-induced FC in ASD have been inconsistent including both over- and underconnectivity and diverse regional patterns. As FC patterns change across different cognitive demands, a novel and more comprehensive approach to network architecture in ASD is to examine the change in FC patterns between rest and task states, referred to as reconfiguration. This approach is suitable for investigating inefficient network connectivity that may underlie impaired behavioral functioning in clinical disorders. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine FC reconfiguration during lexical processing, which is often affected in ASD, with additional focus on interindividual variability. Thirty adolescents with ASD and a matched group of 23 typically developing (TD) participants completed a lexicosemantic decision task during fMRI, using multiecho-multiband pulse sequences with advanced BOLD signal sensitivity and artifact removal. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected based on task-related activation across both groups, and FC and reconfiguration were compared between groups. The ASD group showed increased interindividual variability and overall greater reconfiguration than the TD group. An ASD subgroup with typical performance accuracy (at the level of TD participants) showed reduced similarity and typicality of FC during the task. In this ASD subgroup, greater FC reconfiguration was associated with increased language skills. Findings suggest that intrinsic functional networks in ASD may be inefficiently organized for lexicosemantic decisions and may require greater reconfiguration during task processing, with high performance levels in some individuals being achieved through idiosyncratic mechanisms.

                Visual search depends on both the foveal and peripheral visual system, yet the foveal attention mechanisms is still lack of insights. We simultaneously recorded the foveal and peripheral activities in V4, IT and LPFC, while monkeys performed a category-based visual search task. Feature attention enhanced responses of Face-selective, House-selective, and Non-selective foveal cells in visual cortex. While foveal attention effects appeared no matter the peripheral attention effects, paying attention to the foveal stimulus dissipated the peripheral feature attentional effects, and delayed the peripheral spatial attentional effects. When target features appeared both in the foveal and the peripheral, feature attention effects seemed to occur predominately in the foveal, which might not distribute across the visual field according to common view of distributed feature attention effects. As a result, the parallel attentive process seemed to occur during distractor fixations, while the serial process predominated during target fixations in visual search.

                Objective: Persons with tetraplegia can use brain-machine interfaces to make visually guided reaches with robotic arms. Without somatosensory feedback, these movements will likely be slow and imprecise, like those of persons who retain movement but have lost proprioception. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) has promise for providing artificial somatosensory feedback. If ICMS can mimic naturally occurring neural activity, afferent interfaces may be more informative and easier to learn than interfaces that evoke unnaturalistic activity. To develop such biomimetic stimulation patterns, it is important to characterize the responses of neurons to ICMS. Approach: Using a Utah multi-electrode array, we recorded activity evoked by single pulses, and short (~0.2 s) and long (~4 s) trains of ICMS at a wide range of amplitudes and frequencies. As the electrical artifact caused by ICMS typically prevents recording for many milliseconds, we deployed a custom rapid-recovery amplifier with nonlinear gain to limit signal saturation on the stimulated electrode. Across all electrodes after stimulation, we removed the remaining slow return to baseline with acausal high-pass filtering of time-reversed recordings. With these techniques, we could record ~0.7 ms after stimulation offset even on the stimulated electrode. Main results: We recorded likely transsynaptically-evoked activity as early as ~0.7 ms after single pulses of stimulation that was immediately followed by suppressed neural activity lasting 10-150 ms. Instead of this long-lasting inhibition, neurons increased their firing rates for ~100 ms after trains. During long trains, the evoked response on the stimulated electrode decayed rapidly while the response was maintained on non-stimulated channels. Significance: The detailed description of the spatial and temporal response to ICMS can be used to better interpret results from experiments that probe circuit connectivity or function of cortical areas. These results can also contribute to the design of stimulation patterns to improve afferent interfaces for artificial sensory feedback.

                Computational Deep Language Models (DLMs) have been shown to be effective in predicting neural responses during natural language processing. This study introduces a novel computational framework, based on the concept of fine-tuning (Hinton, 2007), for modeling differences in interpretation of narratives based on the listeners' perspective (i.e. their prior knowledge, thoughts, and beliefs). We draw on an fMRI experiment conducted by Yeshurun et al. (2017), in which two groups of listeners were listening to the same narrative but with two different perspectives (cheating versus paranoia). We collected a dedicated dataset of ~3000 stories, and used it to create two modified (fine-tuned) versions of a pre-trained DLM, each representing the perspective of a different group of listeners. Information extracted from each of the two fine-tuned models was better fitted with neural responses of the corresponding group of listeners. Furthermore, we show that the degree of difference between the listeners' interpretation of the story - as measured both neurally and behaviorally - can be approximated using the distances between the representations of the story extracted from these two fine-tuned models. These models-brain associations were expressed in many language-related brain areas, as well as in several higher-order areas related to the default-mode and the mentalizing networks, therefore implying that computational fine-tuning reliably captures relevant aspects of human language comprehension across different levels of cognitive processing.

                The somatic marker hypothesis posits that perceiving emotions entails reenacting markers of self emotions, in particular in the autonomous nervous system. Well studied in decision-making tasks, it has not been tested in a social cognitive neuroscience framework, and in particular for the automatic processing of positive emotions during natural interactions. Here, we address this question using a unique corpus of brain activity recorded during unconstrained conversations between participants and a human or a humanoid robot. fMRI recordings are used to test whether activity in the most important brain regions in relation to the autonomic system, the amygdala, hypothalamus and insula, is affected by the level of happiness expressed by the human and robot agents. Results indicate that for the hypothalamus and the insula, in particular the anterior agranular region strongly involved in processing social emotions, activity in the right hemisphere increases with the level of happiness expressed by the human, but not the robot. Results indicate that perceiving positive emotions in social interactions induces the local brain responses predicted by the somatic marker hypothesis, but only when the interacting agent is a real human.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">mrHARDIflow : A pipeline tailored for the preprocessing and analysis of Multi-Resolution High Angular diffusion MRI and its application to a variability study of the PRIME-DE database</a></h4>

              
                The validation of advanced methods in diffusion MRI requires finer acquisition resolutions, which is hard to acquire with decent Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in humans. The use of Non-Human Primates (NHP) and anaesthesia is key to unlock valid microstructural maps, but tools must be adapted and configured finely for them to work well. Here, we propose a novel processing pipeline implemented in Nextflow, designed for robustness and scalability, in a modular fashion to allow for maintainability and a high level of customization and parametrization, tailored for the analysis of diffusion data acquired on multiple spatial resolutions. Modules of processes and workflows were implemented upon cutting edge and state-of-the-art MRI processing technologies and diffusion modelling algorithms, namely Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) and DIstribution of Anisotropic MicrOstructural eNvironments in Diffusion-compartment imaging (DIAMOND), a multi-tensor distribution estimator. Using our pipeline, we provide an in-depth study of the variability of diffusion models and measurements computed on 32 subjects from 3 sites of the PRIME-DE, a database containing anatomical (T1, T2), functional (fMRI) and diffusion (DWI) imaging of Non-Human Primate (NHP). Together, they offer images acquired over a range of different spatial resolutions, using single-shell and multi-shell b-value gradient samplings, on multiple scanner vendors, that present artifacts at different level of importance. We also perform a reproducibility study of DTI, CSD and DIAMOND measurements outputed by the pipeline, using the Aix-Marseilles site, to ensure our implementation has minimal impact on their variability. We observe very high reproducibility from a majority of diffusion measurements, only gamma distribution parameters computed on the DIAMOND model display a less reproducible behaviour. This should be taken into consideration when future applications are performed. We also show that even if promising, the PRIME-DE diffusion data exhibits a great level of variability and its usage should be done with care to prevent instilling uncertainty in statistical analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Patient brain organoids identify a link between the 16p11.2 copy number variant and the RBFOX1 gene.</a></h4>

              
                Copy number variants (CNVs) that delete or duplicate 30 genes within the 16p11.2 genomic region give rise to a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes with high penetrance in humans. Despite the identification of this small region, the mechanisms by which 16p11.2 CNVs lead to disease are unclear. Relevant models, like human cortical organoids (hCOs), are needed to understand the human-specific mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disease. We generated hCOs from 18 patients and controls, profiling 167,958 cells with single cell (sc)RNA-seq. Analysis revealed neuronal-specific differential expression of genes outside of the 16p11.2 region that were related to cell-cell adhesion, neuronal projection growth, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, 16p11.2 deletion syndrome organoids exhibited reduced mRNA and protein levels of RBFOX1, a gene which can also harbor CNVs linked to neurodevelopmental phenotypes. We found that many genes previously shown to be regulated by RBFOX1 are also perturbed in organoids from patients with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, and thus identified a novel link between independent CNVs associated with neuronal development and autism. Overall, this work suggests convergent signaling, which indicates the possibility of a common therapeutic mechanism across multiple rare neuronal diseases.

	<p>People with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) present with a characteristic progressive breakdown of semantic knowledge. There are currently no pharmacological interventions to cure or slow svPPA, but promising behavioural approaches are increasingly reported. This article offers an overview of the last two decades of research into interventions to support language in people with svPPA including recommendations for clinical practice and future research based on the best available evidence. We offer a lay summary in English, Spanish and French for education and dissemination purposes. This paper discusses the implications of right- versus left-predominant atrophy in svPPA, which naming therapies offer the best outcomes and how to capitalise on preserved long-term memory systems. Current knowledge regarding the maintenance and generalisation of language therapy gains is described in detail along with the development of compensatory approaches and educational and support group programmes. It is concluded that there is evidence to support an integrative framework of treatment and care as best practice for svPPA. Such an approach should combine rehabilitation interventions addressing the language impairment, compensatory approaches to support activities of daily living and provision of education and support within the context of dementia.</p>

	<p>In the elderly, walking while simultaneously engaging in other activities becomes more difficult. This study aimed to examine the changes in cortical activity during walking with aging. We try to reveal the effects of an additional task and increased walking speed on cortical activation in the young-old and the old-old elderly. Twenty-seven young-old (70.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.0 years) and 23 old-old (78.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.3 years) participated in this study. Each subject completed four walking tasks on the treadmill, a 2 &amp;amp;times; 2 design; two single-task (ST) walking conditions with self-selected walking speed (SSWS) and fast walking speed (FWS), and two dual-task (DT) walking conditions with SSWS and FWS. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was applied for measurement of cerebral oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) concentration during walking. Cortical activities were increased during DT conditions compared with ST conditions but decreased during the FWS compared with the SSWS on the primary leg motor cortex, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in both the young-old and the old-old. These oxyHb concentration changes were significantly less prominent in the old-old than in the young-old. This study demonstrated that changes in cortical activity during dual-task walking are lower in the old-old than in the young-old, reflecting the reduced adaptive plasticity with severe aging.</p>

	<p>The current study explored the possibility that the consonantal landmarks served as predictors of dysarthric speech produced by English-speaking adults with cerebral palsy (CP). Additionally, the relationship between the perceptual severity of dysarthric speech and the consonantal landmarks was explored. The analyses included 210 sentences from the TORGO database produced by seven English-speaking CP speakers with dysarthria and seven typically developing controls matched in age and gender. The results indicated that the clinical group produced more total landmark features than did the control group. A binominal regression analysis revealed that the improper control of laryngeal vibration and the inability to tactically control the energy in a voiced segment would lead to the higher likelihood of dysarthric speech. A multinominal regression analysis revealed that producing too many +v and &amp;amp;minus;v landmark features would lead to higher perceptual severity levels among the CP speakers. Together with literature, the current study proposed that the landmark-based acoustic analysis could quantify the differences in consonantal productions between dysarthric and non-dysarthric speech and reflect the underlying speech motor deficits of the population in concern.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Alterations of spatial attention can have adverse effects, such a greater probability of accidents. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving dialysis have stronger left-sided spatial attentional bias, suggesting that this disorder or treatment alters the brain networks that mediate spatial attention. The hemispheric networks that mediate the allocation of horizontal attention may also influence the allocation of vertical attention. However, the allocation of vertical spatial attention has not been studied in ESRD patients. Methods: Twenty-three ESRD patients receiving dialysis and 23 healthy right-handed controls performed line bisections using 24 vertical lines (24 cm long and 2 mm thick) aligned with the intersection of their midsagittal and coronal planes. Results: Hemodialyzed ESRD patients had a significantly greater upward bias than healthy controls. The magnitude of this bias was correlated with the duration of the kidney disease. Conclusions: The reason why upward attentional bias is increased in hemodialyzed ESRD patients is not known. Further research is needed to better understand the brain mechanism that might account for this bias, as well as its treatment. However, hemodialyzed ESRD patients and their families-caregivers should be made aware of this disorder to avoid accidents such as tripping.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Microcontroller-Based System for the Wheel-Running Activity in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Voluntary wheel-running activity is a way to assess rodents&rsquo; circadian rhythm and motivation for exercise. Deficits in these behaviors are implicated in the pathophysiology of sleep and psychiatric disorders. Limited space in animal facilities can hamper long-term monitoring of running wheel activity outside of the home cage. To address this issue, we provide a stand-alone solution to monitor the wheel-running activity of mice in their home cage. This system, named the wheel-running activity acquisition (WRAQ) system, is based on a microcontroller driven by a lithium polymer battery. With the WRAQ, we can record the wheel-running activity and illumination data for at least 30 d. Applying the WRAQ to an endotoxemia mouse model robustly detected the altered wheel-running activity and its recovery. With wireless data transfer capability extension, the system also allows for online monitoring and reporting of the circadian time (CT). We used the online monitoring of wheel-running activity with this extended WRAQ system and observed a significant shift of the active period in the circadian rhythm following a temporal chemogenetic activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)-subparaventricular zone (SPZ). Together, these findings indicate that the WRAQ system is a novel and cost-effective solution for the analysis of wheel-running activity in mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Dynamics Convey Differential Sensitivity to Input Pattern Changes in Two Muscles Innervated by the Same Motor Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Postsynaptic responses depend on input patterns as well as short-term synaptic plasticity, summation, and postsynaptic membrane properties, but the interactions of those dynamics with realistic input patterns are not well understood. We recorded the responses of the two pyloric dilator (PD) muscles, <I>cpv2a</I> and <I>cpv2b</I>, that are innervated by and receive identical periodic bursting input from the same two motor neurons in the lobster <I>Homarus americanus</I>. <I>Cpv2a</I> and <I>cpv2b</I> showed quantitative differences in membrane nonlinearities and synaptic summation. At a short timescale, responses in both muscles were dominated by facilitation, albeit with different frequency and time dependence. Realistic burst stimulations revealed more substantial differences. Across bursts, <I>cpv2a</I> showed transient depression, whereas <I>cpv2b</I> showed transient facilitation. Steady-state responses to bursting input also differed substantially. Neither muscle had a monotonic dependence on frequency, but <I>cpv2b</I> showed particularly pronounced bandpass filtering. <I>Cpv2a</I> was sensitive to changes in both burst frequency and intra-burst spike frequency, whereas, despite its much slower responses, <I>cpv2b</I> was largely insensitive to changes in burst frequency. <I>Cpv2a</I> was sensitive to both burst duration and number of spikes per burst, whereas <I>cpv2b</I> was sensitive only to the former parameter. Neither muscle showed consistent sensitivity to changes in the overall spike interval structure, but <I>cpv2b</I> was surprisingly sensitive to changes in the first intervals in each burst, a parameter known to be regulated by dopamine (DA) modulation of spike propagation of the presynaptic axon. These findings highlight how seemingly minor circuit output changes mediated by neuromodulation could be read out differentially at the two synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Explaining the unexpected COVID-19 trends and potential impact across Africa. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Official COVID-19 case counts and mortality rates across Africa are lower than had been anticipated. Research reports, however, indicate far higher exposure rates than the official counts in some countries. Particularly in Western and Central Africa, where mortality rates are disproportionately lower than the rest of the continent, this occurrence may be due to immune response adaptations resulting from (1) frequent exposure to certain pro-inflammatory pathogens, and (2) a prevalence of low-grade inflammation coupled with peculiar modifications to the immune response based on one’s immunobiography. We suggest that the two factors lead to a situation where post infection, there is a rapid ramp-up of innate immune responses, enough to induce effective defense and protection against plethora pathogens. Alongside current efforts at procuring and distributing vaccines, we draw attention to the need for work towards appreciating the impact of the apparently widespread, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections on Africa’s populations vis a vis systemic inflammation status and long-term consequences for public health.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">De novo protein fold families expand the designable ligand binding site space</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xingjie Pan, Tanja Kortemme</p>

A major challenge in designing proteins <i>de novo</i> to bind user-defined ligands with high affinity is finding backbones structures into which a new binding site geometry can be engineered with high precision. Recent advances in methods to generate protein fold families <i>de novo</i> have expanded the space of accessible protein structures, but it is not clear to what extend <i>de novo</i> proteins with diverse geometries also expand the space of designable ligand binding functions. We constructed a library of 25,806 high-quality ligand binding sites and developed a fast protocol to place (“match”) these binding sites into both naturally occurring and <i>de novo</i> protein families with two fold topologies: Rossman and NTF2. Each matching step involves engineering new binding site residues into each protein “scaffold”, which is distinct from the problem of comparing already existing binding pockets. 5,896 and 7,475 binding sites could be matched to the Rossmann and NTF2 fold families, respectively. <i>De novo</i> designed Rossman and NTF2 protein families can support 1,791 and 678 binding sites that cannot be matched to naturally existing structures with the same topologies, respectively. While the number of protein residues in ligand binding sites is the major determinant of matching success, ligand size and primary sequence separation of binding site residues also play important roles. The number of matched binding sites are power law functions of the number of members in a fold family. Our results suggest that <i>de novo</i> sampling of geometric variations on diverse fold topologies can significantly expand the space of designable ligand binding sites for a wealth of possible new protein functions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hybrid dedicated and distributed coding in PMd/M1 provides separation and interaction of bilateral arm signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tanner C. Dixon, Christina M. Merrick, Joni D. Wallis, Richard B. Ivry, Jose M. Carmena</p>

Pronounced activity is observed in both hemispheres of the motor cortex during preparation and execution of unimanual movements. The organizational principles of bi-hemispheric signals and the functions they serve throughout motor planning remain unclear. Using an instructed-delay reaching task in monkeys, we identified two components in population responses spanning PMd and M1. A “dedicated” component, which segregated activity at the level of individual units, emerged in PMd during preparation. It was most prominent following movement when M1 became strongly engaged, and principally involved the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast to recent reports, these dedicated signals solely accounted for divergence of arm-specific neural subspaces. The other “distributed” component mixed signals for each arm within units, and the subspace containing it did not discriminate between arms at any stage. The statistics of the population response suggest two functional aspects of the cortical network: one that spans both hemispheres for supporting preparatory and ongoing processes, and another that is predominantly housed in the contralateral hemisphere and specifies unilateral output.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling the effects of Aedes aegypti’s larval environment on adult body mass at emergence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melody Walker, Karthikeyan Chandrasegaran, Clément Vinauger, Michael A. Robert, Lauren M. Childs</p>

Mosquitoes vector harmful pathogens that infect millions of people every year, and developing approaches to effectively control mosquitoes is a topic of great interest. However, the success of many control measures is highly dependent upon ecological, physiological, and life history traits of mosquito species. The behavior of mosquitoes and their potential to vector pathogens can also be impacted by these traits. One trait of interest is mosquito body mass, which depends upon many factors associated with the environment in which juvenile mosquitoes develop. Our experiments examined the impact of larval density on the body mass of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes, which are important vectors of dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and other pathogens. To investigate the interactions between the larval environment and mosquito body mass, we built a discrete time mathematical model that incorporates body mass, larval density, and food availability and fit the model to our experimental data. We considered three categories of model complexity informed by data, and selected the best model within each category using Akaike’s Information Criterion. We found that the larval environment is an important determinant of the body mass of mosquitoes upon emergence. Furthermore, we found that larval density has greater impact on body mass of adults at emergence than on development time, and that inclusion of density dependence in the survival of female aquatic stages in models is important. We discuss the implications of our results for the control of <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes and on their potential to spread disease.

                Background: Foam cells are markers of atherosclerosis and characterise advanced atherosclerotic plaque, stimulated by inflammation caused by high lipid levels in macrophages. The combination of decaffeinated coffee and green tea extract (DCGTE) has been suggested to have a role in foam cell inhibition. Objective: we investigated the inhibiting role of DCGTE against foam cell formation, through modulation of the inflammation process and cholesterol metabolism in macrophage colony stimulating factor- (M-CSF) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-exposed macrophages. Methods: Coffee and green tea were extracted by filtration and infusion respectively, and underwent decaffeination using active carbon and blanching methods, respectively. Cells were administered 160/160 and 320/320μg/ml of DCGTE. Foam cell formation was observed using a light microscope after staining with Oil Red O (ORO), and the accumulation of lipids in macrophages with ELISA. Observations of lipid influx and efflux were determined through semiquantitative cluster differentiation 36 (CD36) and ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression through immunofluorescence. The inflammation process was quantified using inflammatory/anti-inflammatory markers, e.g., tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 10 (IL10) with ELISA. Peroxisome proliferator activated response γ (PPARγ) expression and activity were assessed with PCR and ELISA, respectively. The expression of microRNA 155 (miR-155) was examined using qPCR. Results: DCGTE at the above concentrations tended to reduce foam cell numbers, significantly inhibited lipid accumulation (p=0.000), reduced CD36 expression (p=0.000) and TNFα secretion (p=0.000) in Raw264.7 exposed to M-CSF 50ng/ml and oxLDL 50μg/ml.  PPARγ expression (p=0.00) and activity (p=0.001), miR-155 relative expression (p=0.000), and IL10 production (p=0.000) also increased. Conclusion: DCGTE lowered foam cell numbers, possibly through attenuation of the inflammatory process and improvement of lipid/efflux mechanisms in M-CSF and oxLDL-stimulated Raw264.7 cells, via upregulation of PPARγ and miR-155.  Our results suggest DCGTE may help prevent atherosclerosis-based diseases.

                Background: : Rugby league involves repeated, complex, and high intensity change-of-direction (COD) movements with no existing test protocols that specifically assesses these multiple physical fitness components simultaneously. Thus, the current study examined the convergent validity of a repeated Illinois Agility (RIA) protocol with the repeated T-agility protocol, and the repeatability of the RIA protocol in adolescent Rugby League players. Furthermore, aerobic capacity and anaerobic and COD performance were assessed to determine whether these physical qualities were important contributors to the RIA protocol. Methods: Twenty-two junior Rugby League players completed 4 sessions with each separated by 7 days. Initially, physical fitness characteristics at baseline (i.e., Multi-stage Shuttle test, countermovement jump, 30-m sprint, single-effort COD and repeated sprint ability [RSA]) were assessed. The second session involved a familiarisation of RIA and repeated T-agility test (RTT) protocols. During the third and fourth sessions, participants completed the RIA and RTT protocols in a randomised, counterbalanced design to examine the validity and test-retest reliability of these protocols. Results: For convergent validity, significant correlations were identified between RIA and RTT performances (r= >0.80; p<0.05). For contributors to RIA performance, significant correlations were identified between all baseline fitness characteristics and RIA (r = >0.71; p < 0.05). Reliability of the RIA protocol was near perfect with excellent intra-class correlation coefficient (0.87-0.97), good ratio limits of agreement (×/÷ 1.05-1.06) and low coefficient of variations (1.8-2.0%). Conclusions: The current study has demonstrated the RIA to be a simple, valid and reliable field test for RL athletes that can provide coaches with information about their team’s ability to sustain high intensity, multi-directional running efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Correlations between components of the immune system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: No evidence of the possibility to alter a constituent of the immune system without directly affecting one of its associated components has been shown yet. Methods: A schematic model was developed in which two triggers, fasting and splenectomy, were studied for their ability to affect the expression of cell membrane epitopes and the cytokine secretion of out-of-body autogeneic and syngeneic lymphocytes. Results: Fasting decreased expression of CD8 and CD25 and increased TNFα levels. The effect of splenectomy as a trigger was investigated in non-fasting mice by comparing splenectomized and non-splenectomized mice. An increase in the CD8 expression and in TNFα, IFNg, and IL10 secretion was noted. The effect of splenectomy as a trigger was investigated in fasting mice by comparing splenectomized and non-splenectomized mice. Splenectomy had a significant effect on expression of CD25 and CD4 CD25 and on secretion of TNFα, IFNg, and IL10. To determine the effect of keeping the cells in an out-of-body location on the expression of lymphocyte epitopes, tubes kept on top of the cages of the fasting mice were compared with tubes kept on top of empty cages. A significant change in the CD8 expression was noted. To determine the effect of keeping cells in an out-of-body location on cytokine secretion, tubes kept on top of cages were tested for cytokine levels. A significant decrease was noted for the secretion of TNFα and IFNg. Conclusions: The data obtained from this study characterized a system for induction of correlations between two components of the immune system without a transfer of mediators. The study showed that a mouse could affect cells at a distance and alter the expression of surface markers and cytokine secretion following two types of triggers: fasting and/or splenectomy. Thus, an out-of-body correlation can be induced between two components of the immune system.

                <p>This study was undertaken to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 causes a persistent central nervous system infection. SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody index and SARS-CoV-2 RNA were studied in cerebrospinal fluid following COVID-19. Cerebrospinal fluid was assessed between days 1 and 30 (n = 12), between days 31 and 90 (n = 8), or later than 90 days (post–COVID-19, n = 20) after COVID-19 diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all patients, and in none of the 20 patients with post–COVID-19 syndrome were intrathecally produced anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected. The absence of evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid argues against a persistent central nervous system infection as a cause of neurological or neuropsychiatric post–COVID-19 syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The elusive varicose astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary pattern of different astrocyte types across animal species remains unresolved. In a recent study, Falcone and colleagues revealed that varicose projection astrocytes, a rare form of astrocyte characterized by long varicosities-containing processes, are exclusively found in hominoid brains while being absent from other primate brains.

                Zebrafish have made significant contributions to our understanding of the vertebrate brain and the neural basis of behavior, earning a place as one of the most widely used model organisms in neuroscience. Their appeal arises from the marriage of low cost, early life transparency, and ease of genetic manipulation with a behavioral repertoire that becomes more sophisticated as animals transition from larvae to adults. To further enhance the use of adult zebrafish, we created the first fully segmented three-dimensional digital adult zebrafish brain atlas (AZBA). AZBA was built by combining tissue clearing, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, and three-dimensional image registration of nuclear and antibody stains. These images were used to guide segmentation of the atlas into over 200 neuroanatomical regions comprising the entirety of the adult zebrafish brain. As an open source, online (azba.wayne.edu), updatable digital resource, AZBA will significantly enhance the use of adult zebrafish in furthering our understanding of vertebrate brain function in both health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mutation saturation for fitness effects at human CpG sites</a></h4>

              
                Whole exome sequences have now been collected for millions of humans, with the related goals of identifying pathogenic mutations in patients and establishing reference repositories of data from unaffected individuals. As a result, we are approaching an important limit, in which datasets are large enough that, in the absence of natural selection, every highly mutable site will have experienced at least one mutation in the genealogical history of the sample. Here, we focus on CpG sites that are methylated in the germline and experience mutations to T at an elevated rate of ~10<sup>-7</sup> per site per generation; considering synonymous mutations in a sample of 390,000 individuals, ~99% of such CpG sites harbor a C/T polymorphism. Methylated CpG sites provide a natural mutation saturation experiment for fitness effects: as we show, at current sample sizes, not seeing a non-synonymous polymorphism is indicative of strong selection against that mutation. We rely on this idea in order to directly identify a subset of CpG transitions that are likely to be highly deleterious, including ~27% of possible loss-of-function mutations, and up to 20% of possible missense mutations, depending on the type of functional site in which they occur. Unlike methylated CpGs, most mutation types, with rates on the order of 10<sup>-8</sup> or 10<sup>-9</sup>, remain very far from saturation. We discuss what these findings imply for interpreting the potential clinical relevance of mutations from their presence or absence in reference databases and for inferences about the fitness effects of new mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A coarse-grained NADH redox model enables inference of subcellular metabolic fluxes from fluorescence lifetime imaging</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial metabolism is of central importance to diverse aspects of cell and developmental biology. Defects in mitochondria are associated with many diseases, including cancer, neuropathology, and infertility. Our understanding of mitochondrial metabolism <i>in situ</i> and dysfunction in diseases are limited by the lack of techniques to measure mitochondrial metabolic fluxes with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we developed a new method to infer mitochondrial metabolic fluxes in living cells with subcellular resolution from fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH. This result is based on the use of a generic coarse-grained NADH redox model. We tested the model in mouse oocytes and human tissue culture cells subject to a wide variety of perturbations by comparing predicted fluxes through the electron transport chain (ETC) to direct measurements of oxygen consumption rate. Interpreting the FLIM measurements of NADH using this model, we discovered a homeostasis of ETC flux in mouse oocytes: perturbations of nutrient supply and energy demand of the cell do not change ETC flux despite significantly impacting NADH metabolic state. Furthermore, we observed a subcellular spatial gradient of ETC flux in mouse oocytes and found that this gradient is primarily a result of a spatially heterogeneous mitochondrial proton leak. We concluded from these observations that ETC flux in mouse oocytes is not controlled by energy demand or supply, but by the intrinsic rates of mitochondrial respiration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Strong confinement of active microalgae leads to inversion of vortex flow and enhanced mixing</a></h4>

              
                Microorganisms swimming through viscous fluids imprint their propulsion mechanisms in the flow fields they generate. Extreme confinement of these swimmers between rigid boundaries often arises in natural and technological contexts, yet measurements of their mechanics in this regime are absent. Here, we show that strongly confining the microalga Chlamydomonas between two parallel plates not only inhibits its motility through contact friction with the walls but also leads, for purely mechanical reasons, to inversion of the surrounding vortex flows. Insights from the experiment lead to a simplified theoretical description of flow fields based on a quasi-2D Brinkman approximation to the Stokes equation rather than the usual method of images. We argue that this vortex flow inversion provides the advantage of enhanced fluid mixing despite higher friction. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive framework for analyzing the collective flows of strongly confined swimmers.

                For several decades, the field of human neurophysiology has focused on the role played by cortical oscillations in enabling brain function underpinning behaviors. In parallel, a less visible but robust body of work on the stochastic resonance phenomenon has also theorized contributions of neural noise - hence more heterogeneous, complex and less predictable activity - in brain coding. The latter notion has received indirect causal support via improvements of visual function during non-regular or random brain stimulation patterns. Nonetheless, direct evidence demonstrating an impact of brain stimulation on direct measures of neural noise is still lacking. Here we evaluated the impact of three non frequency-specific TMS bursts, compared to a control pure high-beta TMS rhythm, delivered to the left FEF during a visual detection task, on the heterogeneity, predictability and complexity of ongoing brain activity recorded with scalp EEG. Our data showed surprisingly that the three non frequency-specific TMS patterns did not prevent a build-up of local high-beta activity. Nonetheless, they increased power across broader or in multiple frequency bands compared to control purely rhythmic high-beta bursts tested along. Importantly, non frequency-specific patterns enhanced signal entropy over multiple time-scales, suggesting higher complexity and an overall induction of higher levels of cortical noise than rhythmic TMS bursts. Our outcomes provide indirect evidence on a potential modulatory role played by sources of stochastic noise on brain oscillations and synchronization. Additionally, they pave the way towards the development of novel neurostimulation approaches to manipulate cortical sources of noise and further investigate their causal role in neural coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Unique Cytoarchitecture and Wiring of the Human Default Mode Network</a></h4>

              
                It is challenging to specify the role of the default mode network (DMN) in human behaviour. Contemporary theories, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggest that the DMN is insulated from the external world, which allows it to support perceptually-decoupled states and to integrate external and internal information in the construction of abstract meanings. To date, the neuronal architecture of the DMN has received relatively little attention. Understanding the cytoarchitectural composition and connectional layout of the DMN will provide novel insights into its role in brain function. We mapped cytoarchitectural variation within the DMN using a cortical type atlas and a histological model of the entire human brain. Next, we used MRI acquired in healthy young adults to explicate structural wiring and effective connectivity. We discovered profound diversity of DMN cytoarchitecture. Connectivity is organised along the most dominant cytoarchitectural axis. One side of the axis is the prominent receiver, whereas the other side remains more insulated, especially from sensory areas. The structural heterogeneity of the DMN engenders a network-level balance in communication with external and internal sources, which is distinctive, relative to other functional communities. The neuronal architecture of the DMN suggests it is a protuberance from the core cortical processing hierarchy and holds a unique role in information integration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive coding of stimulus information in human fronto-parietal cortex during visual classification</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to flexibly adapt to changing demands is supported by flexible coding of task-relevant information in frontal and parietal brain regions. Converging evidence suggest that coding of stimuli and task rules in these regions become stronger as task difficulty increases. Here, we tested whether there is a corresponding change in the representational format as well, an issue that has rarely been addressed directly in past research. Participants performed a visual classification task under varying levels of perceptual difficulty, while we acquired fMRI. Using a model-based representational similarity approach, we tested whether stimulus representations retain exemplar-level information. We expected representations to drop such exemplar-level information as perceptual difficulty increases, which would indicate a focus on representing behaviorally relevant category information. Counter to these expectations, and in contrast to previous research, we found frontal and parietal brain regions contained exemplar-level stimulus information. Interestingly, the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) retained exemplar-level stimulus information even in perceptually difficult trials, and these representations were directly related to performance. Overall, these findings call for a reassessment of the neural mechanisms underlying human adaptive behavior during visual classification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human visual gamma for color stimuli: When LGN drive is equalized, red is not special</a></h4>

              
                Strong gamma-band oscillations in primate early visual cortex can be induced by spatially homogeneous, high-contrast stimuli, such as color surfaces. Compared to other hues, particularly strong gamma oscillations have been reported for red stimuli. However, precortical color processing and the resultant strength of input to V1 has often not been fully controlled for. This leaves the possibility that stronger responses to some hues were due to differences in V1 input strength. We presented stimuli that had equal luminance and color contrast levels in a color coordinate system based on color responses of the lateral geniculate nucleus, the main input source for area V1. With these stimuli, we recorded magnetoencephalography in 30 human subjects. We found narrowband color-induced gamma oscillations in early visual cortex, which, contrary to previous reports, did not differ between red and green stimuli of equal L-M cone contrast. Notably, blue stimuli with contrast exclusively on the S cone axis induced very weak gamma responses, as well as smaller event-related fields and poorer change detection performance. The strength of human color gamma responses could be well explained by the strength of thalamic input induced by each hue and does not show a clear red bias when this input strength is properly equalized.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The gendered self: Evidence for differences in whole-brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                How the brain constructs gender identity is largely unknown, but some neural differences have recently been discovered. Here, we used an intrinsic-ignition framework to investigate if gender identity changes the propagation of the neural activity across the whole-brain network and within resting-state networks. Studying 29 transmen and 17 transwomen with gender incongruence, 22 ciswomen, and 19 cismen, we computed the capability of a given brain area in space to propagate activity to other areas (mean-ignition) and its variability across time (node-metastability). We found that both measures differentiated all four groups across the whole-brain network. Furthermore, at the network level, we found that compared to the other groups, cismen showed higher mean-ignition of the dorsal attention network and node-metastability of the dorsal and ventral attention, executive control, and temporal parietal networks. We also found mean-ignition differences between cismen and ciswomen within the executive control network, but higher in ciswomen than cismen and transmen for the default-mode network. For the node-metastability, this was higher in cismen compared to ciswomen in the somatomotor network, while both mean-ignition and node-metastability were higher for cismen than transmen in the limbic network. Finally, we computed correlations between both measures and their body image scores. Transmen dissatisfaction, cismen, and ciswomen satisfaction towards their own body image were distinctively associated with specific networks per group. Overall, the study of the whole-brain network dynamical complexity discriminates binary gender identity groups, and functional connectivity dynamics approaches are needed to disentangle the complex understanding of the gendered self.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological correlates of confidence differ across correct and erroneous perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Every decision we make is accompanied by an estimate of the likelihood that our decision is accurate or appropriate. This likelihood estimate is termed our degree of decision confidence. Recent work has uncovered event-related potential (ERP) correlates of confidence both during decision formation and after a decision has been made. However, the interpretation of these findings is complicated by methodological issues related to ERP amplitude measurement that are prevalent across existing studies. To more accurately characterise the neural correlates of confidence, we presented participants with a difficult perceptual decision task that elicited a broad range of confidence ratings. We identified a frontal ERP component within an onset prior to the behavioural response, which exhibited more positive-going amplitudes in trials with higher confidence ratings. This frontal effect also biased measures of the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) component at parietal electrodes via volume conduction. Amplitudes of the error positivity (Pe) component that followed each decision were negatively associated with confidence for trials with decision errors, but not for trials with correct decisions. We provide evidence for both pre- and post- decisional neural correlates of decision confidence that are observed in trials with correct and erroneous decisions, respectively. Our findings suggest that certainty in having made a correct response is associated with frontal activity during decision formation, whereas certainty in having committed an error is instead associated with the post-decisional Pe component. We additionally show that some previously reported associations between decision confidence and CPP/Pe component amplitudes are (at least partly) a consequence of ERP amplitude measurement-related confounds.

                Chronic stress can increase the risk of developing a substance use disorder in vulnerable individuals. Numerous models have been developed to probe the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, however most prior work has been restricted to male rodents, conducted only in rats, or introduces physical injury that can complicate opioid studies. Here we sought to establish how chronic psychosocial stress influences fentanyl consumption in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We used chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), or the modified vicarious chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS), and used social interaction to stratify mice as stress-susceptible or resilient. We then subjected mice to a 15 day fentanyl drinking paradigm in the home cage that consisted of alternating forced and choice periods with increasing fentanyl concentrations. Male mice susceptible to either CWDS or CSDS consumed more fentanyl relative to unstressed mice, and exhibited increased preference for fentanyl. CWDS-susceptible female mice did not differ from unstressed mice during the forced periods, but showed increased preference for fentanyl. We also found decreased expression of nucleus accumbens Rho GTPases in male, but not female mice following stress and fentanyl drinking. We also compare fentanyl drinking behavior in mice that had free access to plain water throughout. Our results indicate that stress-sensitized fentanyl consumption is dependent on both sex and behavioral outcomes to stress.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-optical electrophysiology with improved genetically encoded voltage indicators reveals interneuron network dynamics in vivo</a></h4>

              
                All-optical electrophysiology can be a powerful tool for studying neural dynamics in vivo, as it offers the ability to image and perturb membrane voltage in multiple cells simultaneously. The "Optopatch" constructs combine a red-shifted archaerhodopsin (Arch)-derived genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) with a blue-shifted channelrhodopsin actuator (ChR). We used a video-based pooled screen to evolve Arch-derived GEVIs with improved signal-to-noise ratio (QuasAr6a) and kinetics (QuasAr6b). By combining optogenetic stimulation of individual cells with high-precision voltage imaging in neighboring cells, we mapped inhibitory and gap junction-mediated connections, in vivo. Optogenetic activation of a single NDNF-expressing neuron in visual cortex Layer 1 significantly suppressed the spike rate in some neighboring NDNF interneurons. Hippocampal PV cells showed near-synchronous spikes across multiple cells at a frequency significantly above what one would expect from independent spiking, suggesting that collective inhibitory spikes may play an important signaling role in vivo. By stimulating individual cells and recording from neighbors, we quantified gap junction coupling strengths. Together, these results demonstrate powerful new tools for all-optical microcircuit dissection in live mice.

                Intellectual disability is the most prevalent and limiting hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), without any pharmacological treatment available. Neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are relevant neurological features of DS reaching to early development of Alzheimer s disease. Preclinical evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system, an important neuromodulator on cognition and neuroinflammation, could act as beneficial target in DS. Indeed, cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) activity was enhanced in the hippocampus of young-adult trisomic Ts65Dn mice, a well-characterized surrogate model of DS. In previous studies, inhibition of CB1R, was able to restore key neurological deficits in this mouse model. To determine the possible clinical relevance of this target, it is mandatory to evaluate the long-term consequences of attenuated CB1R activity and to minimize the possible side-effects associated to this mechanism. We found that CB1R expression was significantly enhanced in the hippocampus brains of aged DS subjects. Similarly, middle-aged trisomic mice showed enhanced CB1R expression. Long-term oral administration of a low dose of the CB1R specific antagonist rimonabant was administered to male and female Ts65Dn trisomic and wild-type mice from the time of weaning to 10 months, an age when signs of neurodegeneration have been described in the model. CB1R inhibition resulted in significant cognitive improvement in novel object-recognition memory in trisomic male and female mice, reaching a similar performance to that of wild-type littermates. Interestingly, this long-term rimonabant treatment modify locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, body weight or survival rates. Brain analysis at 10 months of age revealed noradrenergic and cholinergic neurodegeneration signs in trisomic mice that were not modified by the treatment, although the alterations in hippocampal microglia morphology shown by vehicle-treated trisomic mice was normalized in trisomic mice exposed to rimonabant. Altogether, our results demonstrate a sustained pro-cognitive effect of CB1R inhibition at doses that do not produce major side effects that could be associated to an anti-inflammatory action, suggesting a potential interest in this target of to preserve cognitive functionality in DS.

                Satellite glial cells (SGCs) tightly surround and support primary sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system and are increasingly recognized for their involvement in the development of neuropathic pain following nerve injury. The SGCs are difficult to investigate due to their flattened shape and tight physical connection to neurons in vivo and their rapid changes in phenotype and protein expression when cultured in vitro. Consequently, several aspects of SGC function under normal conditions as well as after a nerve injury remain to be explored. The recent advance in single cell RNAseq technologies has enabled a new approach to investigate SGCs. Here we publish a dataset from mice subjected to sciatic nerve injury as well as a dataset from dorsal root ganglia cells after 3 days in culture. We use a meta-analysis approach to compare the injury response with that in other published datasets and conclude that SGCs share a common signature following sciatic nerve crush and sciatic ligation, involving transcriptional regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. We also observed a considerable transcriptional change when culturing SGCs, suggesting that some differentiate into a specialised in vitro state, while others start resembling Schwann cell-like precursors. The datasets are available via the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal Gradient Mapping of Rodent Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a central role in supporting our coherent and enduring sense of self and our place in the world. Understanding its functional organisation is central to understanding this complex role. Previous studies suggest function varies along a long hippocampal axis, but there is disagreement about the presence of sharp discontinuities or gradual change along that axis. Other open questions relate to the underlying drivers of this variation and the conservation of organisational principles across species. Here, we delineate the primary organisational principles underlying patterns of hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) in the mouse using gradient analysis on resting state fMRI data. We further applied gradient analysis to mouse gene co-expression data to examine the relationship between variation in genomic anatomy and functional organisation. Two principal FC gradients along a hippocampal axis were revealed. The principal gradient exhibited a sharp discontinuity that divided the hippocampus into dorsal and ventral compartments. The second, more continuous, gradient followed the long axis of the ventral compartment. Dorsal regions were more strongly connected to areas involved in spatial navigation while ventral regions were more strongly connected to areas involved in emotion, recapitulating patterns seen in humans. In contrast, gene co-expression gradients showed a more segregated and discrete organisation. Our findings suggest that hippocampal functional organisation exhibits both sharp and gradual transitions and that hippocampal genomic anatomy exerts a subtle influence on this organisation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do naps benefit novel word learning? Developmental differences and white matter correlates</a></h4>

              
                Behavioural and neuroimaging data suggest that memory representations of newly learned words undergo changes during nocturnal sleep, including improvements in explicit recall and lexical integration (i.e., after sleep, novel words compete with existing words during online word recognition). Some studies have revealed larger sleep-benefits in children relative to adults. However, whether daytime naps play a similar facilitatory role is unclear. We investigated the effect of a daytime nap (relative to wake) on explicit memory (recall/recognition) and lexical integration (lexical competition) of newly learned novel words in young adults and children aged 10-12 years, also exploring white matter correlates of the pre- and post-nap effects of word learning in the child group with diffusion weighted MRI. In both age groups, a nap maintained explicit memory of novel words and wake led to forgetting. However, there was an age group interaction when comparing change in recall over the nap: children showed a slight improvement whereas adults showed a slight decline. There was no evidence of lexical integration at any point. Although children spent proportionally more time in slow-wave sleep (SWS) than adults, neither SWS nor spindle parameters correlated with over-nap changes in word learning. For children, increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the uncinate fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus were associated with the recognition of novel words immediately after learning, and FA in the right arcuate fasciculus was further associated with changes in recall of novel words over a nap, supporting the importance of these tracts in the word learning and consolidation process. These findings point to a protective role of naps in word learning, and emphasize the need to advance theories of word learning by better understanding both the active and passive roles that sleep plays in supporting vocabulary consolidation over development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estradiol and oxytocin modulate sex differences in hippocampal reactivity and episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Considerable evidence supports sex differences in autobiographical and episodic memory which may translate to heightened vulnerability to stress- and trauma-related disorders in women. The hormones estradiol and oxytocin both affect episodic memory, but possible sex-specific effects and hormonal interactions have not been systemically tested in humans. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving healthy women (n = 111) and men (n = 115). Participants were scanned under four experimental conditions: 1. estradiol gel (2 mg) and intranasal oxytocin (24 IU), 2. placebo gel and intranasal oxytocin, 3. estradiol gel and placebo spray, 4. placebo gel and placebo spray. During fMRI, participants viewed positive, neutral and negative scenes. A surprise recognition task three days later was used to classify encoding trials as remembered or forgotten. Under placebo, women showed a significantly better recognition memory and increased hippocampal responses to subsequently remembered items independent of the emotional valence compared to men. Separate treatments with either estradiol or oxytocin significantly diminished this mnemonic and hippocampal sex difference, whereas the combined treatment produced no significant effect. Collectively, our results suggest that estradiol and oxytocin play a crucial role in modulating sex differences in episodic memory. Furthermore, possible antagonistic interactions between estradiol and oxytocin could explain previously observed opposing hormonal effects in women and men.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Miniscope-LFOV: A large field of view, single cell resolution, miniature microscope for wired and wire-free imaging of neural dynamics in freely behaving animals</a></h4>

              
                We present a large field of view (FOV) open-source miniature microscope (MiniLFOV) designed to extend the capabilities of the UCLA Miniscope platform to large-scale, single cell resolution neural imaging in freely behaving large rodents and head-fixed mice. This system is capable of multiple imaging configurations, including deep brain imaging using implanted optical probes and cortical imaging through cranial windows. The MiniLFOV interfaces with existing open-source UCLA Miniscope DAQ hardware and software, can achieve single cell resolution imaging across a 3.6 x 2.7 mm field of view at 23 frames per second, has an electrically adjustable working distance of up to 3.5 mm{+/-}150 {micro}m using an onboard electrowetting lens, incorporates an absolute head-orientation sensor, and weighs under 14 grams. The MiniLFOV provides a 30-fold larger FOV and yields 20-fold better sensitivity than Miniscope V3, and a 12-fold larger FOV with 2-fold better sensitivity than Miniscope V4. Power and data transmission are handled through a single, flexible coaxial cable down to 0.3 mm in diameter facilitating naturalistic behavior. We validated the MiniLFOV in freely behaving rats by simultaneously imaging >1000 GCaMP7s expressing neurons in the CA1 layer of the hippocampus and in head-fixed mice by simultaneously imaging ~2000 neurons in the mouse dorsal cortex through a 4 x 4 mm cranial window. For freely behaving experiments, the MiniLFOV supports optional wire-free operation using a 3.5 g wire-free data acquisition expansion board which enables close to 1-hour of wire-free recording with a 400 mAh (7.5 g) on-board single-cell lithium-polymer battery and expands wire-free imaging techniques to larger animal models. We expect this new open-source implementation of the UCLA Miniscope platform will enable researchers to address novel hypotheses concerning brain function in freely behaving animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anxiety attenuates learning advantages conferred by statistical stability and induces loss of volatility-attuning in brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety can alter an individual's perception of their external sensory environment. Previous studies suggest that anxiety can increase the magnitude of neural responses to unexpected (or surprising) stimuli. Additionally, surprise responses are reported to be boosted during stable compared to volatile environments. Few studies, however, have examined how learning is impacted by both threat and volatility. To investigate these effects, we used threat-of-shock to transiently increase subjective anxiety in healthy adults during an auditory oddball task, in which the regularity could be stable or volatile, while undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scanning. We then used Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) mapping to pinpoint the brain areas where different models of anxiety displayed the highest evidence. Behaviourally, we found that threat-of-shock eliminated the accuracy advantage conferred by environmental stability over volatility in the task at hand. Neurally, we found that threat-of-shock led to both attenuation and loss of volatility-attuning of neural activity evoked by surprising sounds across most subcortical and limbic brain regions including the thalamus, basal ganglia, claustrum, insula, anterior cingulate, hippocampal gyrus and also the superior temporal gyrus. Conversely, within two small clusters in the left medial frontal gyrus and extrastriate area, threat-of-shock boosted the neural activity (relative to the safe and volatile condition) to the levels observed during the safe and stable condition, while also inducing a loss of volatility-attuning. Taken together, our findings suggest that threat eliminates the learning advantage conferred by statistical stability compared to volatility. Thus, we propose that anxiety disrupts behavioural adaptation to environmental statistics, and that multiple subcortical and limbic regions are implicated in this process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Missing genetic links between general factors of brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, cognition and psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                General factors capturing the shared genetics in psychiatric (genomic p-factor) and cognitive traits (genomic g-factor), and more recently in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging-derived brain networks, have contributed to our increased understanding of the etiologies in their respective domains. Yet it remains unclear whether general factors can capture the three-way genetic overlap of psychopathology, cognition and brain function. Here we tested for the presence of this genetic overlap via genetic correlation analyses using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of the p-factor (N = 162,151 cases and 276,846 controls), the g-factor (N = 269,867), and the two genomic factors estimated from the amplitude in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging-derived brain networks (N = 31,688). Unlike hypothesized, only the genetic correlation between the p-factor and the g-factor was significant. We conclude that specific functional brain network constructs may have more potential than their derived general dimensions to capture relevant genetic variation for cognition and psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humans can track but fail to predict accelerating objects</a></h4>

              
                Objects in our visual environment often move unpredictably and can suddenly speed up or slow down. The ability to account for acceleration when interacting with moving objects can be critical for survival. Here, we investigate how human observers track an accelerating target with their eyes and predict its time of reappearance after a temporal occlusion by making an interceptive hand movement. Before occlusion, the target was initially visible and accelerated for a brief period. We tested how observers integrated target motion information by comparing three alternative models that predicted time-to-contact (TTC) based on the (1) final target velocity sample before occlusion, (2) average target velocity before occlusion, or (3) target acceleration. We show that visually-guided smooth pursuit eye movements reliably reflect target acceleration prior to occlusion. However, systematic saccade and manual interception timing errors reveal an inability to consider acceleration when predicting TTC. Interception timing is best described by the final velocity model that relies on extrapolating the last available velocity sample before occlusion. These findings provide compelling evidence for differential acceleration integration mechanisms in vision-guided eye movements and prediction-guided interception and a mechanistic explanation for the function and failure of interactions with accelerating objects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A structured scaffold underlies activity in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Place cells are believed to organize memory across space and time, inspiring the idea of the cognitive map. Yet unlike the structured activity in the associated grid and head-direction cells, they remain an enigma: their responses have been difficult to predict and are complex enough to be statistically well-described by a random process. Here we report one step toward the ultimate goal of understanding place cells well enough to predict their fields. Within a theoretical framework in which place fields are derived as a conjunction of external cues with internal grid cell inputs, we predict that even apparently random place cell responses should reflect the structure of their grid inputs and that this structure can be unmasked if probed in sufficiently large neural populations and large environments. To test the theory, we design experiments in long, locally featureless spaces to demonstrate that structured scaffolds undergird place cell responses. Our findings, together with other theoretical and experimental results, suggest that place cells build memories of external inputs by attaching them to a largely prespecified grid scaffold.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The different brain areas occupied for integrating information of hierarchical linguistic units: a study based on EEG and TMS</a></h4>

              
                Human linguistic units are hierarchical, and our brain responds differently when processing linguistic units during sentence comprehension, especially when the modality of the received signal is different (auditory, visual, or audio-visual). However, it is unclear how the brain processes and integrates language information at different linguistic units (words, phrases, and sentences) provided simultaneously in audio and visual modalities. To address the issue, we presented participants with sequences of short Chinese sentences through auditory or visual or combined audio-visual modalities, while electroencephalographic responses were recorded. With a frequency tagging approach, we analyzed the neural representations of basic linguistic units (i.e., characters/monosyllabic words) and higher-level linguistic structures (i.e., phrases and sentences) across the three modalities separately. We found that audio-visual integration occurs at all linguistic units, and the brain areas involved in the integration varied across different linguistic levels. In particular, the integration of sentences activated the local left prefrontal area. Therefore, we used continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to verify that the left prefrontal cortex plays a vital role in the audio-visual integration of sentence information. Our findings suggest the advantage of bimodal language comprehension at hierarchical stages in language-related information processing and provide evidence for the causal role of the left prefrontal regions in processing information of audio-visual sentences.
