              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15163">Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity Driver Extraction through Non-Negative Sparse Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) extracted from electrocardiogram has gained attention as a novel noninvasive measure of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), while electrodermal activity (EDA) has long served this purpose. SparsEDA is a sparse deconvolution technique originally developed for EDA to extract phasic drivers indicating the start of sympathetic burst responses. Our focus is on applying this method to preprocessed SKNA signals, justified by both SKNA and EDA signals' connection to sympathetic nerve activity and prior observed similarities. In a thermal-grill pain experiment, 16 subjects underwent six stimulations each to elicit SNS responses, with simultaneous recording of EDA and SKNA. We confirmed the method's accuracy in identifying stimuli initiation. Results were assessed for burst detection and accuracy of driver placement compared to annotated labels. The SKNA drivers achieved an RMSE of 0.42 from annotated stimulations, a 97% hit rate in detecting applied stimuli, and minimal false alarms during the 2-minute control period and interstimulus intervals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15234">Adaptive Intelligence: leveraging insights from adaptive behavior in animals to build flexible AI systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological intelligence is inherently adaptive -- animals continually adjust their actions based on environmental feedback. However, creating adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) remains a major challenge. The next frontier is to go beyond traditional AI to develop "adaptive intelligence," defined here as harnessing insights from biological intelligence to build agents that can learn online, generalize, and rapidly adapt to changes in their environment. Recent advances in neuroscience offer inspiration through studies that increasingly focus on how animals naturally learn and adapt their world models. In this Perspective, I will review the behavioral and neural foundations of adaptive biological intelligence, the parallel progress in AI, and explore brain-inspired approaches for building more adaptive algorithms.

                arXiv:2411.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI's significant recent advances using general-purpose circuit computations offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum of the brain are able to achieve a diverse range of functions across sensory, cognitive, and motor domains, despite their uniform circuit structures. However, comparing the brain and AI is challenging unless clear similarities exist, and past reviews have been limited to comparison of brain-inspired vision AI and the visual neocortex. Here, to enable comparisons across diverse functional domains, we subdivide circuit computation into three elements -- circuit structure, input/outputs, and the learning algorithm -- and evaluate the similarities for each element. With this novel approach, we identify wide-ranging similarities and convergent evolution in the brain and AI, providing new insights into key concepts in neuroscience. Furthermore, inspired by processing mechanisms of AI, we propose a new theory that integrates established neuroscience theories, particularly the theories of internal models and the mirror neuron system. Both the neocortex and cerebellum predict future world events from past information and learn from prediction errors, thereby acquiring models of the world. These models enable three core processes: (1) Prediction -- generating future information, (2) Understanding -- interpreting the external world via compressed and abstracted sensory information, and (3) Generation -- repurposing the future-information generation mechanism to produce other types of outputs. The universal application of these processes underlies the ability of the neocortex and cerebellum to accomplish diverse functions with uniform circuits. Our systematic approach, insights, and theory promise groundbreaking advances in understanding the brain.

                arXiv:2411.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronous firing of neurons is thought to play important functional roles such as feature binding and switching of cognitive states. Although synchronization has mainly been investigated using model neurons with simple connection topology so far, real neural networks have more complex structures. Here we examine behavior of pulse-coupled leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with various network structures. We first show that the dispersion of the number of connections for neurons influences dynamical behavior even if other major topological statistics are kept fixed. The rewiring probability parameter representing the randomness of networks bridges two spatially opposite frameworks: precise local synchrony and rough global synchrony. Finally, cooperation of the global connections and the local clustering property, which is prominent in small-world networks, reinforces synchrony of distant neuronal groups receiving coherent inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16558">Stability of Brain Functional Network During Working Memory Using Structural Balance Theory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working memory plays a crucial role in various aspects of human life. Therefore, it has been an area of interest in different research studies, especially neuroscience. The neuroscientists investigating working memory have primarily emphasized the brain's functional modularity. At the same time, a holistic perspective is still required to investigate the brain as an integrated and unified system. We hypothesized that the brain should shift towards a more stable state during working memory than the resting state. Therefore, based on the Structural Balance Theory (SBT), we aimed to address this process. To achieve this, we examined triadic associations in signed fMRI networks in healthy individuals using the N-back as the working memory task. We demonstrated that the number of balanced triads increased during the working memory task compared to the resting state, while the opposite is true for imbalanced triads. The increase of balanced triads forced the network to a more stable state with a lower balance energy level. The increase of balanced triads was crucially related to changes in anti-synchrony to synchronous activities between the Temporal Cortex, the Prefrontal Cortex, and the Parietal Cortex, which are known to be involved in various aspects of working memory, during the working memory process. We hope these findings pave the way to a better understanding the working memory process.

                arXiv:2411.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for modelling time-varying connectivity in neuroimaging data, focusing on the slow fluctuations in synaptic efficacy that mediate neuronal dynamics. Building on the framework of Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), we propose a method that incorporates temporal basis functions into neural models, allowing for the explicit representation of slow parameter changes. This approach balances expressivity and computational efficiency by modelling these fluctuations as a Gaussian process, offering a middle ground between existing methods that either strongly constrain or excessively relax parameter fluctuations. We validate the ensuing model through simulations and real data from an auditory roving oddball paradigm, demonstrating its potential to explain key aspects of brain dynamics. This work aims to equip researchers with a robust tool for investigating time-varying connectivity, particularly in the context of synaptic modulation and its role in both healthy and pathological brain function.

                arXiv:2411.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential for artificial agents to develop core consciousness, as proposed by Antonio Damasio's theory of consciousness. According to Damasio, the emergence of core consciousness relies on the integration of a self model, informed by representations of emotions and feelings, and a world model. We hypothesize that an artificial agent, trained via reinforcement learning (RL) in a virtual environment, can develop preliminary forms of these models as a byproduct of its primary task. The agent's main objective is to learn to play a video game and explore the environment. To evaluate the emergence of world and self models, we employ probes-feedforward classifiers that use the activations of the trained agent's neural networks to predict the spatial positions of the agent itself. Our results demonstrate that the agent can form rudimentary world and self models, suggesting a pathway toward developing machine consciousness. This research provides foundational insights into the capabilities of artificial agents in mirroring aspects of human consciousness, with implications for future advancements in artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2405.10488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mammalian whole-brain connectomes at nanoscale synaptic resolution are a crucial ingredient for holistic understanding of brain function. Imaging these connectomes at sufficient resolution to densely reconstruct cellular morphology and synapses represents a longstanding goal in neuroscience. Although the technologies needed to reconstruct whole-brain connectomes have not yet reached full maturity, they are advancing rapidly enough that the mouse brain might be within reach in the near future. Detailed exploration of these technologies is warranted to help plan projects with varying goals and requirements. Whole-brain human connectomes remain a more distant goal yet are worthy of consideration to orient large-scale neuroscience program plans. Here, we quantitatively compare existing and emerging imaging technologies that have potential to enable whole-brain mammalian connectomics. We perform calculations on electron microscopy (EM) techniques and expansion microscopy coupled with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (ExLSFM) methods. We consider techniques from the literature that have sufficiently high resolution to identify all synapses and sufficiently high speed to be relevant for whole mammalian brains. Each imaging modality comes with benefits and drawbacks, so we suggest that attacking the problem through multiple approaches could yield the best outcomes. We offer this analysis as a resource for those considering how to organize efforts towards imaging whole-brain mammalian connectomes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03330">Modeling Latent Neural Dynamics with Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.03330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the collective activity of neural populations relates to computation and ultimately behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.

However, how to best quantify circadian disruption remains unclear, as it can manifest across various properties and timescales. A promising but under-explored approach is to assess the intra-individual variability in circadian rhythms over timescales of weeks to years. This is yet to be studied in epilepsy.
  Methods: We retrospectively used wearable smartwatch data (Fitbit) from 143 people with epilepsy (PWE) and 31 controls. For each participant, we extracted the circadian oscillation underlying their heart rate time series and analysed the intra-individual variability of three circadian properties: period, acrophase, and amplitude.
  Findings: We found increased intra-individual variability in period (77 min vs. 62 min, z=3.32, p<0.001) and acrophase (68 min vs. 54 min, z=2.97, p=0.003) for PWE compared to controls, but not in amplitude (1.98 bpm vs. 2.05 bpm, z=-0.66, p=0.51). For PWE, we did not find any correlations between seizure frequency and intra-individual variability in circadian properties, or any difference between weeks with and without seizures.
  Interpretation: This finding indicates that the circadian rhythm of heart rate is more variable for people with epilepsy and that this can be detected using a wearable device. However, we were unable to find any associations with seizure frequency or occurrence, suggesting intra-individual variability could be another manifestation of epilepsy aetiology. Future work should investigate the combined role of anti-seizure medications, demographics, co-morbidities, and health behaviours in driving the increased intra-individual variability of circadian properties in epilepsy.

Abstract: Stockart et al. (2024) recommend guidelines for best practices in the field of unconscious cognition. However, they condone the repeatedly criticized technique of excluding trials with high visibility ratings or of participants with high sensitivity for the critical stimulus. Based on standard signal detection theory for discrimination judgments, we show that post-hoc trial selection only isolates points of neutral response bias but remains consistent with uncomfortably high levels of sensitivity. We argue that post-hoc selection constitutes a sampling fallacy that capitalizes on chance, generates regression artifacts, and wrongly ascribes unconscious processing to stimulus conditions that are far from indiscriminable. As an alternative, we advocate the study of functional dissociations, where direct (D) and indirect (I) measures are conceptualized as spanning up a two-dimensional D-I-space and where single, sensitivity, and double dissociations appear as distinct curve patterns. While Stockart et al.'s recommendations cover only a single line of that space where D is close to zero, functional dissociations can utilize the entire space, circumventing requirements like null visibility and exhaustive reliability, and allowing for the planful measurement of theoretically meaningful functional relationships between experimentally controlled variables.

                arXiv:2311.04742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistical study of human memory requires large-scale experiments, involving many stimuli conditions and test subjects. While this approach has proven to be quite fruitful for meaningless material such as random lists of words, naturalistic stimuli, like narratives, have until now resisted such a large-scale study, due to the quantity of manual labor required to design and analyze such experiments. In this work, we develop a pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) both to design naturalistic narrative stimuli for large-scale recall and recognition memory experiments, as well as to analyze the results. We performed online memory experiments with a large number of participants and collected recognition and recall data for narratives of different sizes. We found that both recall and recognition performance scale linearly with narrative length; however, for longer narratives people tend to summarize the content rather than recalling precise details. To investigate the role of narrative comprehension in memory, we repeated these experiments using scrambled versions of the narratives. Although recall performance declined significantly, recognition remained largely unaffected. Recalls in this condition seem to follow the original narrative order rather than the actual scrambled presentation, pointing to a contextual reconstruction of the story in memory. Finally, using LLM text embeddings, we construct a simple measure for each clause based on semantic similarity to the whole narrative, that shows a strong correlation with recall probability. Overall, our work demonstrates the power of LLMs in accessing new regimes in the study of human memory, as well as suggesting novel psychologically informed benchmarks for LLM performance.

Abstract: The pursuit of creating artificial intelligence (AI) mirrors our longstanding fascination with understanding our own intelligence. From the myths of Talos to Aristotelian logic and Heron's inventions, we have sought to replicate the marvels of the mind. While recent advances in AI hold promise, singular approaches often fall short in capturing the essence of intelligence. This paper explores how fundamental principles from biological computation--particularly context-dependent, hierarchical information processing, trial-and-error heuristics, and multi-scale organization--can guide the design of truly intelligent systems. By examining the nuanced mechanisms of biological intelligence, such as top-down causality and adaptive interaction with the environment, we aim to illuminate potential limitations in artificial constructs. Our goal is to provide a framework inspired by biological systems for designing more adaptable and robust artificial intelligent systems.

                arXiv:2411.16445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems.
  In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to the Plastic Arbor framework, supporting simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the new framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. Using the new framework, we have already been able to investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, showing a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information.
  By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.

                arXiv:2411.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaheuristics are stochastic optimization algorithms that mimic natural processes to find optimal solutions to complex problems. The success of metaheuristics largely depends on the ability to effectively explore and exploit the search space. Memory mechanisms have been introduced in several popular metaheuristic algorithms to enhance their performance. This chapter explores the significance of memory in metaheuristic algorithms and provides insights from well-known algorithms. The chapter begins by introducing the concept of memory, and its role in metaheuristic algorithms. The key factors influencing the effectiveness of memory mechanisms are discussed, such as the size of the memory, the information stored in memory, and the rate of information decay. A comprehensive analysis of how memory mechanisms are incorporated into popular metaheuristic algorithms is presented and concludes by highlighting the importance of memory in metaheuristic performance and providing future research directions for improving memory mechanisms. The key takeaways are that memory mechanisms can significantly enhance the performance of metaheuristics by enabling them to explore and exploit the search space effectively and efficiently, and that the choice of memory mechanism should be tailored to the problem domain and the characteristics of the search space.

Abstract: This paper presents the Multi-Objective Ant Nesting Algorithm (MOANA), a novel extension of the Ant Nesting Algorithm (ANA), specifically designed to address multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). MOANA incorporates adaptive mechanisms, such as deposition weight parameters, to balance exploration and exploitation, while a polynomial mutation strategy ensures diverse and high-quality solutions. The algorithm is evaluated on standard benchmark datasets, including ZDT functions and the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2019 multi-modal benchmarks. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art algorithms like MOPSO, MOFDO, MODA, and NSGA-III demonstrates MOANA's superior performance in terms of convergence speed and Pareto front coverage. Furthermore, MOANA's applicability to real-world engineering optimization, such as welded beam design, showcases its ability to generate a broad range of optimal solutions, making it a practical tool for decision-makers. MOANA addresses key limitations of traditional evolutionary algorithms by improving scalability and diversity in multi-objective scenarios, positioning it as a robust solution for complex optimization tasks.

                arXiv:2411.15235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning, or the ability to progressively integrate new concepts, is fundamental to intelligent beings, enabling adaptability in dynamic environments. In contrast, artificial deep neural networks face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. To alleviate the problem of forgetting, recent approaches aim to preserve essential weight subspaces for previous tasks by limiting updates to orthogonal subspaces via gradient projection. While effective, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In this work, we introduce COnceptor-based gradient projection for DEep Continual Learning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix representations, a computational model inspired by neuroscience, to more flexibly handle highly correlated tasks. CODE-CL encodes directional importance within the input space of past tasks, allowing new knowledge integration in directions modulated by $1-S$, where $S$ represents the direction's relevance for prior tasks. Additionally, we analyze task overlap using conceptor-based representations to identify highly correlated tasks, facilitating efficient forward knowledge transfer through scaled projection within their intersecting subspace. This strategy enhances flexibility, allowing learning in correlated tasks without significantly disrupting previous knowledge. Extensive experiments on continual learning image classification benchmarks validate CODE-CL's efficacy, showcasing superior performance with minimal forgetting, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods.

                arXiv:2411.15290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has driven innovations and created new opportunities across various sectors. However, leveraging domain-specific knowledge often requires automated tools to design and configure models effectively. In the case of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), researchers and practitioners usually resort to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches, which are resource- and time-intensive, requiring the training and evaluation of numerous candidate architectures. This raises sustainability concerns, particularly due to the high energy demands involved, creating a paradox: the pursuit of the most effective model can undermine sustainability goals. To mitigate this issue, zero-cost proxies have emerged as a promising alternative. These proxies estimate a model's performance without the need for full training, offering a more efficient approach. This paper addresses the challenges of model evaluation by automatically designing zero-cost proxies to assess DNNs efficiently. Our method begins with a randomly generated set of zero-cost proxies, which are evolved and tested using the NATS-Bench benchmark. We assess the proxies' effectiveness using both randomly sampled and stratified subsets of the search space, ensuring they can differentiate between low- and high-performing networks and enhance generalizability. Results show our method outperforms existing approaches on the stratified sampling strategy, achieving strong correlations with ground truth performance, including a Kendall correlation of 0.89 on CIFAR-10 and 0.77 on CIFAR-100 with NATS-Bench-SSS and a Kendall correlation of 0.78 on CIFAR-10 and 0.71 on CIFAR-100 with NATS-Bench-TSS.

                arXiv:2411.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AdamZ is an advanced variant of the Adam optimiser, developed to enhance convergence efficiency in neural network training. This optimiser dynamically adjusts the learning rate by incorporating mechanisms to address overshooting and stagnation, that are common challenges in optimisation. Specifically, AdamZ reduces the learning rate when overshooting is detected and increases it during periods of stagnation, utilising hyperparameters such as overshoot and stagnation factors, thresholds, and patience levels to guide these adjustments. While AdamZ may lead to slightly longer training times compared to some other optimisers, it consistently excels in minimising the loss function, making it particularly advantageous for applications where precision is critical. Benchmarking results demonstrate the effectiveness of AdamZ in maintaining optimal learning rates, leading to improved model performance across diverse tasks.

                arXiv:2411.15643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical world dynamics are generally governed by underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) with unknown analytical forms in science and engineering problems. Neural network based data-driven approaches have been heavily studied in simulating and solving PDE problems in recent years, but it is still challenging to move forward from understanding to controlling the unknown PDE dynamics. PDE boundary control instantiates a simplified but important problem by only focusing on PDE boundary conditions as the control input and output. However, current model-free PDE controllers cannot ensure the boundary output satisfies some given user-specified safety constraint. To this end, we propose a safety filtering framework to guarantee the boundary output stays within the safe set for current model-free controllers. Specifically, we first introduce a general neural boundary control barrier function (BCBF) to ensure the feasibility of the trajectorywise constraint satisfaction of boundary output. Based on a neural operator modeling the transfer function from boundary control input to output trajectories, we show that the change in the BCBF depends linearly on the change in input boundary, so quadratic programming-based safety filtering can be done for pre-trained model-free controllers. Extensive experiments under challenging hyperbolic, parabolic and Navier-Stokes PDE dynamics environments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving better general performance and boundary constraint satisfaction compared to the model-free controller baselines.

                arXiv:2411.15925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simply by rearranging the regions of an image, we can create a new image of any subject matter. The definition of regions is user definable, ranging from regularly and irregularly-shaped blocks, concentric rings, or even individual pixels. Our method extends and improves recent work in the generation of optical illusions by simultaneously learning not only the content of the images, but also the parameterized transformations required to transform the desired images into each other. By learning the image transforms, we allow any source image to be pre-specified; any existing image (e.g. the Mona Lisa) can be transformed to a novel subject. We formulate this process as a constrained optimization problem and address it through interleaving the steps of image diffusion with an energy minimization step. Unlike previous methods, increasing the number of regions actually makes the problem easier and improves results. We demonstrate our approach in both pixel and latent spaces. Creative extensions, such as using infinite copies of the source image and employing multiple source images, are also given.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16206">Batch Bayesian Optimization via Expected Subspace Improvement</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.16206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation can enable the designer to make the most use of parallel computing technology. Most of current batch approaches use artificial functions to simulate the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm's behavior to select a batch of points for parallel evaluation. However, as the batch size grows, the accumulated error introduced by these artificial functions increases rapidly, which dramatically decreases the optimization efficiency of the algorithm. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation. Different from existing batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point from each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace improvement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate point can achieve within a certain subspace. By optimizing these expected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of query points for expensive evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can achieve near-linear speedup when compared with the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively when compared with eight state-of-the-art batch algorithms. This work provides a simple yet efficient approach for batch Bayesian optimization. A Matlab implementation of our approach is available at https://github.com/zhandawei/Expected_Subspace_Improvement_Batch_Bayesian_Optimization

                arXiv:2301.10292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from interaction is the primary way that biological agents acquire knowledge about their environment and themselves. Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) explores a computational approach to learning from interaction and has made significant progress in solving various tasks. However, despite its power, DRL still falls short of biological agents in terms of energy efficiency. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, we believe that the integration of spiking communication between neurons and biologically-plausible synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role in achieving greater energy efficiency. Following this biological intuition, we optimized a spiking policy network (SPN) using a genetic algorithm as an energy-efficient alternative to DRL. Our SPN mimics the sensorimotor neuron pathway of insects and communicates through event-based spikes. Inspired by biological research showing that the brain forms memories by creating new synaptic connections and rewiring these connections based on new experiences, we tuned the synaptic connections instead of weights in the SPN to solve given tasks. Experimental results on several robotic control tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve the same level of performance as mainstream DRL methods while exhibiting significantly higher energy efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the satellite industry, the information transmission network based on communication satellites has gradually become a major and important part of the future satellite ground integration network. However, the low transmission efficiency of the satellite data relay back mission has become a problem that is currently constraining the construction of the system and needs to be solved urgently. Effectively planning the task of satellite ground networking by reasonably scheduling resources is crucial for the efficient transmission of task data. In this paper, we hope to provide a task execution scheme that maximizes the profit of the networking task for satellite ground network planning considering feeding mode (SGNPFM). To solve the SGNPFM problem, a mixed-integer planning model with the objective of maximizing the gain of the link-building task is constructed, which considers various constraints of the satellite in the feed-switching mode. Based on the problem characteristics, we propose a distance similarity-based genetic optimization algorithm (DSGA), which considers the state characteristics between the tasks and introduces a weighted Euclidean distance method to determine the similarity between the tasks. To obtain more high-quality solutions, different similarity evaluation methods are designed to assist the algorithm in intelligently screening individuals.

                arXiv:2409.19315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to Large Language Models. In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks.
  We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of magnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power generative Transformers.

Abstract: Previous research in the scientific field has utilized statistical empirical models and machine learning to address fitting challenges. While empirical models have the advantage of numerical generalization, they often sacrifice accuracy. However, conventional machine learning methods can achieve high precision but may lack the desired generalization. The article introduces a Regression-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Reg-PINNs), which embeds physics-inspired empirical models into the neural network's loss function, thereby combining the benefits of generalization and high accuracy. The study validates the proposed method using the magnetopause boundary location as the target and explores the feasibility of methods including Shue et al. [1998], a data overfitting model, a fully-connected networks, Reg-PINNs with Shue's model, and Reg-PINNs with the overfitting model. Compared to Shue's model, this technique achieves approximately a 30% reduction in RMSE, presenting a proof-of-concept improved solution for the scientific community.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software development, shifting from task-specific codes (Software 1.0) to neural network-based approaches (Software 2.0). However, applying this transition in engineering software presents challenges, including low surrogate model accuracy, the curse of dimensionality in inverse design, and rising complexity in physical simulations. We introduce an interpolating neural network (INN), grounded in interpolation theory and tensor decomposition, to realize Engineering Software 2.0 by advancing data training, partial differential equation solving, and parameter calibration. INN offers orders of magnitude fewer trainable/solvable parameters for comparable model accuracy than traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). Demonstrated in metal additive manufacturing, INN rapidly constructs an accurate surrogate model of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) heat transfer simulation, achieving sub-10-micrometer resolution for a 10 mm path in under 15 minutes on a single GPU. This makes a transformative step forward across all domains essential to engineering software.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning based energy management approaches, specifically reinforcement learning with a safety layer (OptLayerPolicy) and a metaheuristic algorithm generating a decision tree control policy (TreeC), have shown promise. However, their effectiveness has only been demonstrated in computer simulations. This paper presents the real-world validation of these methods, comparing against model predictive control and simple rule-based control benchmark. The experiments were conducted on the electrical installation of 4 reproductions of residential houses, which all have their own battery, photovoltaic and dynamic load system emulating a non-controllable electrical load and a controllable electric vehicle charger. The results show that the simple rules, TreeC, and model predictive control-based methods achieved similar costs, with a difference of only 0.6%. The reinforcement learning based method, still in its training phase, obtained a cost 25.5\% higher to the other methods. Additional simulations show that the costs can be further reduced by using a more representative training dataset for TreeC and addressing errors in the model predictive control implementation caused by its reliance on accurate data from various sources. The OptLayerPolicy safety layer allows safe online training of a reinforcement learning agent in the real-world, given an accurate constraint function formulation. The proposed safety layer method remains error-prone, nonetheless, it is found beneficial for all investigated methods. The TreeC method, which does require building a realistic simulation for training, exhibits the safest operational performance, exceeding the grid limit by only 27.1 Wh compared to 593.9 Wh for reinforcement learning.

                In growing cell populations such as tumours, mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples. The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours. However, little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Here, we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. Using spatial metrics of evolution, we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface. We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology.

	<p>Background: Transferring learned manipulations to new manipulation tasks has enabled humans to realize thousands of dexterous object manipulations in daily life. Two-digit grasp and three-digit grasp manipulations require different fingertip forces, and our brain can switch grasp types to ensure good performance according to motor memory. We hypothesized that several brain areas contribute to the execution of the new type of motor according to the motor memory. However, the motor memory mechanisms during this transfer period are still unclear. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we aimed to investigate the cortical mechanisms involved in motor memory during the transfer phase of learned manipulation tasks. Methods: Using a custom-built T-shaped object with an adjustable weight distribution, the participants performed grasp and lift manipulation tasks under different conditions to simulate the learning and transfer phases. The learning phase consisted of four grasp-and-lift repetitions with one motor type, followed by a transfer phase with four repetitions involving different motors (adding or removing a digit). Results: By comparing brain activity in the learning and transfer phases, we identified three regions (the superior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus) associated with motor memory during the transfer of learned manipulations. Conclusions: Our findings improve the understanding of the role of the posterior parietal cortex in motor memory, highlighting how sensory information from memory and real-time input is integrated to generate novel motor control signals that guide the precise reapplication of control strategies. Furthermore, we believe that these areas contribute to motor learning from motor memory and may serve as key regions of interest for investigating neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: Response&amp;amp;ndash;response (RR) binding, involving the integration of independently planned and executed responses, presents a novel perspective on action control. While behavioral evidence on RR binding has been extensively examined, corresponding electrophysiological evidence remains scarce. This study aims to contribute novel insights into RR binding by event-related potentials (ERP) techniques to provide new evidence for RR binding. Methods: An adapted prime-probe paradigm was employed, in which the required responses could either involve repetition or change conditions from the prime to the probe phase. EEG data were collected from thirty-six participants, and ERP analysis focused on the peak amplitude and latency of the P1 and P3 components. Results: Notably shorter RTs were observed in the response&amp;amp;ndash;repetition conditions compared to others, consistent with previous findings on RR binding. Furthermore, the response&amp;amp;ndash;repetition conditions exhibited larger P3 amplitudes and shorter P1 and P3 latencies relative to other conditions. Conclusions: In summary, this study strengthens the evidence base for RR binding by bridging both behavioral and electrophysiological perspectives.</p>

	<p>Introduction: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool for enhancing stroke diagnosis, aiding treatment decision making, and improving overall patient care. Leading AI-driven platforms such as RapidAI, Brainomix&amp;amp;reg;, and Viz.ai have been developed to assist healthcare professionals in the swift and accurate assessment of stroke patients. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. Characteristic descriptive measures were gathered as appropriate from all included studies, including the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and comparison of the available tools. Results: A total of 31 studies were included, of which 29 studies focused on detecting acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or large vessel occlusions (LVOs), and 2 studies focused on hemorrhagic strokes. The four main tools used were Viz.ai, RapidAI, Brainomix&amp;amp;reg;, and deep learning modules. Conclusions: AI tools in the treatment of stroke have demonstrated usefulness for diagnosing different stroke types, providing high levels of accuracy and helping to make quicker and more precise clinical judgments.</p>

	<p>Background: In the last decade, empirical studies on the beneficial effects of meditation on prosocial capacities have accumulated, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Buddhist sources state that liberating oneself from a fixed view of the self by gaining access to its transitory and malleable nature leads to increased compassion and other prosocial traits. These, however, have not yet been empirically tested. Methods: The current study aims at filling this gap by first examining whether 44 long term meditators differ from 53 controls in prosocial capacities on different levels of the socio-cognitive hierarchy, and second by examining whether these are associated with meditation-induced &amp;amp;lsquo;selfless&amp;amp;rsquo; states, operationalized here as the sense of boundary (SB) flexibility. We capitalize on our previous work on the neurophenomenology of mindfulness-induced SB dissolution, which yielded a neural index of SB-flexibility, solely for the meditators, and examine its correlations with a battery of validated behavioral prosociality tasks. Results: Our findings reveal enhanced low-level prosocial processes in meditators, including enhanced emotion recognition and reduced outgroup bias. We show the stability of SB flexibility over a year, demonstrating consistent high beta deactivation. The neural index of SB flexibility negatively correlates with recognizing negative emotions, suggesting a link to reduced social threat perception. Conclusions: These results connect the neural correlates of SB flexibility to prosociality, supported by stable high beta deactivations. We expect the results to raise awareness regarding the prosocial potential of flexing one&amp;amp;rsquo;s self-boundaries through meditation.</p>

                Introduction Many Ethiopian women, especially those who live in rural and pastoral areas, have little knowledge and a negative attitude toward long-acting reversible family planning. Therefore, this study investigated the factors that affect the knowledge and attitudes of women toward long-acting reversible contraceptives among pastoral women in southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 376 women of reproductive age who were randomly selected from three pastoral districts in the West Guji Zone. The data were collected by using a pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Ordinary logistic regression analyses with a p value < 0.05 were used to determine statistical significance. Results Less than half, 118 (31.40%), of the study participants had good knowledge, and 88 (23.40%) had a positive attitude toward long-acting reversible contraceptives. The negative predictors of good knowledge and positive attitudes were never attending school (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.96), not having a job (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.79), having an unplanned pregnancy (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.63) and not having a history of abortion (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.78). Conclusions Having maternal education, being employed, having a planned pregnancy, having partner support for family planning and having a history of abortion were predictors for good knowledge and positive attitudes. Thus, this study recommends collaborative efforts between the health sector and other stakeholders to support women’s employment and education, as well as developing a program to spread family planning-related messaging to enhance women’s attitudes and understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-858/v2?src=rss">Protocol for the systematic review of age and sex in preclinical models of age-correlated diseases [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The translation of animal-based biomedical research into clinical research is often inadequate. Maximizing translation should be central to animal research on human diseases, guiding researchers in study design and animal model selection. However, practical considerations often drive the choice of animal model, which may not always reflect key patient characteristics, such as sex and age, impacting the disease's course. Despite diseases affecting both sexes, researchers frequently use male mice. To address this imbalance, journals and funding agencies have begun questioning the sex of animals used in studies and issued new guidelines. Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade. By systematically assessing the age and sex of the mice, we aim to initiate a discussion on the appropriate choice of animal model to improve the translatability of research results.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1421/v1?src=rss">Comparison of Scapulohumeral rhythm in individuals with and without Forward Shoulder Posture [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Forward Shoulder Posture (FSP) is one of the most common postural deviations of the upper back, which may affect the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR). This study aimed to investigate changes in scapulohumeral rhythm during scapular plane shoulder abduction between individuals with and without FSP. Methods A cross sectional study with two group comparison. Young adults with FSP (N=39) with a forward shoulder angle ≥ 52°and without FSP(N=40) with a forward shoulder angle < 52° were recruited for the study. Scapular upward rotation was measured with the help of two inclinometers during scapular plane shoulder abduction, at resting shoulder abduction, at 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, and at full range of shoulder abduction, and SHR was calculated. The scapulohumeral rhythm was compared between the two groups using an independent t test. Results Data analysis showed a statistically significant difference in scapulohumeral rhythm at 30°(p=0.004), 60°(p=0.013), and 90°(p=0.009) shoulder abduction between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the other ranges of shoulder abduction between the two groups. Conclusion Forward shoulder posture alters the scapulohumeral rhythm between 30 ° and 90°shoulder abduction. Clinicians, trainers, and sports therapists should be aware of this change to intervene at an early stage and prevent the development of pathological conditions around the shoulder.

                Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) is widely used as a reporter gene, aiding in protein recovery and transduction studies. In this study, EGFP was tagged with eleven arginine residues (PolyR) and six histidine residues (His-tag) for purification. The aim was to enhance the synthesis of EGFP-PolyR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and evaluate the effects of polyarginine modification on protein stability and expression levels. The expression of EGFP and EGFP-PolyR in S. cerevisiae was assessed through fluorescence measurements and protein levels. Structural analyses were conducted using in silico tools to investigate changes in beta strands and helices, which were validated through Western blots. Results showed that EGFP-PolyR maintained similar fluorescence levels to EGFP, but with notable structural changes. EGFP-PolyR's final beta strand terminates at Ala228, compared to Gly229 in EGFP, affecting the beta sheet's stability. Structural modifications also included altered helix lengths, with a longer helix 10 and shorter helix 9 in EGFP-PolyR. These alterations, along with shifts in helix-helix interactions, contribute to destabilization. Additionally, EGFP-PolyR exhibited unique gamma coils absent in EGFP, further differentiating its structure. The structural changes led to decreased protein expression and solubility, as indicated by Western blot analysis, with EGFP-PolyR showing significantly lower expression levels. The findings suggest that EGFP-PolyR is prone to aggregation and misfolding, characteristics often associated with aggregation-prone proteins.In conclusion, the polyarginine modification significantly impacts the structural integrity, stability, and solubility of EGFP. While fluorescence is retained, these changes hinder protein detectability and purification, highlighting the importance of considering structural alterations when modifying reporter proteins for experimental use.

                Background “Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)” is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders involving collagen type I with a 10–30% incidence of bleeding diathesis placing these individuals at an increased risk of bleeding. Our study aims to ascertain the risk factors that increase the propensity of perioperative blood transfusions in pediatric population. Methods A single center retrospective observational study of patients aged <18 years undergoing orthopedic surgeries at our tertiary care hospital from January 2016 to August 2024 were included and each surgery was analyzed as a discrete event. Age, type of OI, number of osteotomies, and number of bones operated simultaneously were recorded. The fall in hemoglobin, requirement for blood transfusions and associated factors were analyzed. Results Amongst 53 individuals who underwent surgery, 141 procedures were analyzed. The mean age was 11.07± 5.29 years, majority (n=33;62.2%) were phenotypically type III OI, and 42/53 (79%) patients underwent multiple osteotomies. Significant hemoglobin fall was observed after surgery (p<0.001) and was considerable in patients undergoing various osteotomies (p=0.002). Older children showed a smaller drop in hemoglobin level. Patients with type III OI showed significant hemoglobin fall (1.82 ± 0.86 g/dL). The transfusion requirement was seen in 23 (16.3%) surgeries besides it was significant in those undergoing multiple osteotomies (p= <0.05). Conclusion Our study inferred that the fall in hemoglobin was significant postoperatively in OI patients and was associated with younger age, type III OI, and multiple osteotomies. Before performing orthopedic surgeries on patients with OI, surgeons might consider the latter risk factors to explore therapeutic options aimed at reducing hemorrhage and improving outcomes.

                Background Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is considered the most suitable approach for relative performance efficiency calculation for banks as it is believed to be superior to traditional ratio-based analysis and other conventional performance evaluations. This study provides statistical evidence on the sampling error that can creep into performance evaluation studies using the DEA methodology. Inferences are drawn based on samples, and various preventive measures must be taken to eliminate or avoid sampling errors and misleading results. This study demonstrates the possibility of sampling error in DEA with the secondary data available in financial statements and reports from a sample set of banks. Methods The samples included 15 public sectors and five leading private sector banks in India based on their market share, and the data for calculating efficiencies were retrieved from the published audited reports. The sample data was collected from 2014 to 2017 because the banking sector in India witnessed a series of mergers of public sector banks post-2017, and the data after that would be skewed and not comparable due to the demonetization policy implementation and merger process-related consolidation implemented by the Government of India. The efficiency measures thus computed are further analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results We found statistically significant discrepancies in the efficiency score calculations using DEA approach when specific outlier values. Evidence is provided on statistically significant differences in the efficiencies due to the inclusion and exclusion of particular samples in the DEA. Conclusion The study offers a novel contribution along with statistical evidence on the possible sampling error that can creep into the performance evaluation of organizations while applying the DEA methodology.

Research on cell differentiation facilitates a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes of life, elucidates the intrinsic mechanisms underlying diseases such as cancer, and advances the development of therapeutics and precision medicine. Existing methods for inferring cell differentiation trajectories from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data primarily rely on static gene expression data to measure distances between cells and subsequently infer pseudotime trajectories. In this work, we introduce a novel method, scGRN-Entropy, for inferring cell differentiation trajectories and pseudotime from scRNA-seq data. Unlike existing approaches, scGRN-Entropy improves inference accuracy by incorporating dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks (GRN). In scGRN-Entropy, an undirected graph representing state transitions between cells is constructed by integrating both static relationships in gene expression space and dynamic relationships in the GRN space. The edges of the undirected graph are then refined using pseudotime inferred based on cell entropy in the GRN space. Finally, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm is applied to derive the cell differentiation trajectory. We validate the accuracy of scGRN-Entropy on eight different real scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in inferring cell differentiation trajectories through comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methods.

                <p>by Maurizio Porfiri, Nicole Abaid, Simon Garnier</p>

Despite almost a century of research on energetics in biological systems, we still cannot explain energy regulation in social groups, like ant colonies. How do individuals regulate their collective activity without a centralized control system? What is the role of social interactions in distributing the workload amongst group members? And how does the group save energy by avoiding being constantly active? We offer new insight into these questions by studying an intuitive compartmental model, calibrated with and compared to data on ant colonies. The model describes a previously unexplored balance between positive and negative social feedback driven by individual activity: when activity levels are low, the presence of active individuals stimulates inactive individuals to start working; when activity levels are high, however, active individuals inhibit each other, effectively capping the proportion of active individuals at any one time. Through the analysis of the system stability, we demonstrate that this balance results in energetic spending at the group level growing proportionally slower than the group size. Our finding is reminiscent of Kleiber’s law of metabolic scaling in unitary organisms and highlights the critical role of social interactions in driving the collective energetic efficiency of group-living organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012568">An inductive bias for slowly changing features in human reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noa L. Hedrich, Eric Schulz, Sam Hall-McMaster, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions. Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.

                <p>by Vitaly V. Ganusov, Afsal Kolloli, Selvakumar Subbian</p>

Tuberculosis (TB), the disease caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), remains a major health problem with 10.6 million cases of the disease and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown. We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv (the segregation coefficient being <i>s</i> = 0.10 in HN878 vs. <i>s</i> = 0.18 in H37Rv). Interestingly, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several (at least 2) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics: one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated, while another, a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Importantly, a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically. Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas, our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas. Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time. Taken together, our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that “rabbits are not mice”.

                <p>by Jojo A. Prentice, Sandhya Kasivisweswaran, Robert van de Weerd, Andrew A. Bridges</p>

Bacteria frequently colonize niches by forming multicellular communities called biofilms. To explore new territories, cells exit biofilms through an active process called dispersal. Biofilm dispersal is essential for bacteria to spread between infection sites, yet how the process is executed at the single-cell level remains mysterious due to the limitations of traditional fluorescent proteins, which lose functionality in large, oxygen-deprived biofilms. To overcome this challenge, we developed a cell-labeling strategy utilizing fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs) and cognate far-red dyes, which remain functional throughout biofilm development, enabling long-term imaging. Using this approach, we characterize dispersal at unprecedented resolution for the global pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. We reveal that dispersal initiates at the biofilm periphery and approximately 25% of cells never disperse. We define novel micro-scale patterns that occur during dispersal, including biofilm compression during cell departure and regional heterogeneity in cell motions. These patterns are attenuated in mutants that reduce overall dispersal or that increase dispersal at the cost of homogenizing local mechanical properties. Collectively, our findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of biofilm dispersal, advancing our understanding of how pathogens disseminate. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of FAPs as a powerful tool for high-resolution studies of microbial dynamics in complex environments.

Understanding the origin of eukaryotic cells is one of the most difficult problems in all of biology. A key challenge relevant to the question of eukaryogenesis is reconstructing the gene repertoire of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). As data sets grow, sketching an accurate genomics-informed picture of early eukaryotic cellular complexity requires provision of analytical resources and a commitment to data sharing. Here, we summarise progress towards understanding the biology of LECA and outline a community approach to inferring its wider gene repertoire. Once assembled, a robust LECA gene set will be a useful tool for evaluating alternative hypotheses about the origin of eukaryotes and understanding the evolution of traits in all descendant lineages, with relevance in diverse fields such as cell biology, microbial ecology, biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine. In this Consensus View, we put forth the status quo and an agreed path forward to reconstruct LECA’s gene content.

                Background This study examines the challenges faced by Ethiopian public universities in achieving institutional, administrative, academic, and financial autonomy. Institutional autonomy refers to a university’s ability to self-govern, set its mission, and establish policies without external interference. Administrative autonomy concerns decision-making in operations, academic autonomy relates to academic freedom and quality assurance, and financial autonomy involves control over resources and revenue generation. In Ethiopia, centralized governance, political interference, and limited financial strategies create significant barriers to autonomy. Method A qualitative research approach was employed, utilizing semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and direct observations. Data were collected from 59 participants across three public universities. Tools included consent forms, interview guides, focus group discussion guides, and observation checklists. Thematic analysis was used to identify key patterns in the autonomy challenges. The study is grounded in Institutional Theory, Principal-Agent Theory, and Resource Dependency Theory. Result The findings indicate that institutional autonomy is constrained by centralized governance and political interference, limiting universities’ ability to make independent decisions, as explained by Institutional Theory. Administrative autonomy faces similar restrictions, with decision-making influenced by external entities, as highlighted by Principal-Agent Theory. Academic autonomy is challenged by the tension between standardization and institutional diversity, particularly in quality assurance and accreditation. Financial autonomy is limited by restricted revenue sources, economic instability, and a lack of innovative funding strategies, as discussed through Resource Dependency Theory. Conclusion The study concludes that Ethiopian public universities face significant barriers to autonomy. Addressing these challenges requires reducing strict governmental control, improving governance structures, and promoting independent decision-making and sources of incomes. Recommendations The study recommends implementing governance reforms, providing leadership training for university administrators, enhancing academic freedom with flexible quality assurance systems, and diversifying revenue streams through partnerships and expanded university enterprises to ensure financial sustainability.

                Background Home care services are an extension of hospital services provided by hospital staff. The hospital must conduct evaluation, coordination, and education for home care patients to ensure proper care and expedite their recovery. This service also introduces a new concept to the community, as it can help save on costs and equipment. The purpose of this study has been added to the background, namely to determine what factors can influence patient satisfaction with home care services from previously published literature. A systematic review examined the factors influencing patient satisfaction using home care services by following the PRISMA guidelines. PROSPERO submitted and approved the study protocol with the following numbers: CRD42023482315. Researchers have searched articles through the ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The researcher chose the three databases that are open access providers. Including Scopus and ScienceDirect are article search databases that can be accessed directly in the electronic resources of the University of Indonesia Library. The 10-year time span is considered as a source of literature that is still relevant to be used as a reference in evaluating home care service satisfaction. Result Two hundred eighty-eight articles were selected, but 10 met the inclusion criteria. It was found that factors influenced patient satisfaction with home care services and two things that did not affect them: financial aspects and working time. Conclusion Fifteen aspects influence patient satisfaction and two aspects that do not influence patient satisfaction. It is expected that the results of this literature review can be used as a reference for hospitals that provide home care services to pay attention to aspects that can affect satisfaction. The author realizes that the varying methods in the articles reviewed are deficiencies in the results of this study.

                Background Studies have this reported the presence of death anxiety, ranging from near-death experiences to physically ill people, to a simple thought about death, as well as when it is associated with states of loneliness. The Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), based on Eysenk’s incubation theory, has been adapted and validated in different contexts and is still insufficient in countries such as Peru. This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the DAS, its internal structure, and factorial invariance. Methods An online scale was used in 1248 Peruvians aged between 18 and 70 years (M= 27.37, SD= 11.29) from all regions. DAS was validated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), convergent validity, measurement invariance, and internal consistency (reliability). Results Psychometric properties were found with adequate values in its structure and validity based on the internal structure through exploratory factor analysis, where it was found that the components of the scale are interrelated and the data matrix is factorizable. model of three specific factors and a general factor is presented, which is consistent with the theory and has practical utility, revealing adequate statistical values that reflect acceptable levels of reliability. Finally, there was fairness according to sex and age group of the scale by means of factorial invariance analysis. Conclusions Our results indicate adequate psychometric properties and facilitate a better data collection process for future research.

                Background RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific sites on RNA molecules. Identifying these binding sites is crucial for understanding the many functions of RBPs in cellular function, development and disease. Current experimental methods for identifying RBP binding sites, such as ultra-violet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and especially the enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) protocol, were developed to identify authentic RBP binding sites experimentally. Methods To make this data more accessible to the scientific community, we have developed RBP-Tar (https://ncbr.muni.cz/RBP-Tar ), a web server and database that utilises eCLIP data for 167 RBPs mapped on the human genome. The web server allows researchers to easily search and retrieve binding site information by genomic location and RBP name. Use case Researchers can produce lists of all known RBP binding sites on a gene of interest, or produce lists of binding sites for one RBP on different genomic loci. Conclusions Our future goal is to continue to populate the web server with additional experimental datasets from CLIP experiments as they become available and processed, making it an increasingly valuable resource for the scientific community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1252/v3?src=rss">Reporting of angiographic studies in patients diagnosed with a cerebral arteriovenous malformation: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cAVM) is an abnormal tangle of cerebral blood vessels. The consensus document by the Joint Writing Group (JWG) highlighted which cAVM features should be recorded. Subsequent publications have reported cAVM angioarchitecture, but it is unknown if all followed the JWG recommendations. The aim of this systematic review was to describe use of the JWG guidelines. A database search, using the PRISMA checklist, was performed. We describe the proportion of publications that used JWG reporting standards, which standards were used, whether the definitions used differed from the JWG, or if any additional angiographic features were reported. Out of 4306 articles identified, 105 were selected, and a further 114 from other sources. Thirty-three studies (33/219; 15%) specifically referred to using JWG standards. Since the JWG publication, few studies have used their standards to report cAVMs. This implies that the angioarchitecture of cAVMs are not routinely fully described.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27143?af=R">Different Treatment Outcomes of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Receiving Ocrelizumab or Ofatumumab</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>B-cell–depletion via CD20 antibodies is a safe and effective treatment for active relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Both ocrelizumab (OCR) and ofatumumab (OFA) have demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials and are approved for treatment of RMS, yet nothing is known on their comparative effectiveness, especially in the real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study includes patients that were started on either OCR or OFA between September 2021 and December 2023. Patients were followed until June 2024 and recruited at 3 large tertiary centers in Germany (Duesseldorf, Essen, and Giessen). Propensity-score-matching was used to address baseline imbalances among patients. Clinical relapses, presence of new or enlarging MRI lesions and 6-month confirmed disability worsening were evaluated. Non-inferiority of OFA compared to OCR was evaluated through comparison of Kaplan–Meier-estimates.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,138 patients were initially enrolled in the cohort. Following patient selection and propensity-score-matching, 544 OCR and 417 OFA patients were included in the final analysis. In our primary analysis, OFA was non-inferior to OCR in terms of relapses, disability progression, and accrual of MRI lesions. Subgroup analyses confirmed findings in previously naïve and platform-treated patients. Potential differences between OFA and OCR were seen in patients switching from S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We here provide comparative data on the effectiveness of OCR and OFA in patients with active RMS. OFA was non-inferior to OCR in the overall cohort. Potential differences observed in patients switching from S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab require further validation. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                In asexual populations that don’t undergo recombination, such as cancer, deleterious mutations are expected to accrue readily due to genome-wide linkage between mutations. Despite this mutational load of often thousands of deleterious mutations, many tumors thrive. How tumors survive the damaging consequences of this mutational load is not well understood. Here, we investigate the functional consequences of mutational load in 10,295 human tumors by quantifying their phenotypic response through changes in gene expression. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), we find that high mutational load tumors up-regulate proteostasis machinery related to the mitigation and prevention of protein misfolding. We replicate these expression responses in cancer cell lines and show that the viability in high mutational load cancer cells is strongly dependent on complexes that degrade and refold proteins. This indicates that the upregulation of proteostasis machinery is causally important for high mutational burden tumors and uncovers new therapeutic vulnerabilities.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92775">Brain-derived and in vitro-seeded alpha-synuclein fibrils exhibit distinct biophysical profiles</a></h4>

              
                The alpha-synuclein (αSyn) seeding ampliﬁcation assay (SAA) that allows the generation of disease-speciﬁc in vitro seeded ﬁbrils (SAA ﬁbrils) is used as a research tool to study the connection between the structure of αSyn fibrils, cellular seeding/spreading, and the clinicopathological manifestations of different synucleinopathies. However, structural differences between human brain-derived and SAA αSyn ﬁbrils have been recently highlighted. Here, we characterize the biophysical properties of the human brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils from the brains of patients with Parkinson’s disease with and without dementia (PD, PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and compare them to the ‘model’ SAA ﬁbrils. We report that the brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils show distinct biochemical proﬁles, which were not replicated in the corresponding SAA ﬁbrils. Furthermore, the brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils from all synucleinopathies displayed a mixture of ‘straight’ and ‘twisted’ microscopic structures. However, the PD, PDD, and DLB SAA ﬁbrils had a ’straight’ structure, whereas MSA SAA ﬁbrils showed a ‘twisted’ structure. Finally, the brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils from all four synucleinopathies were phosphorylated (S129). Interestingly, phosphorylated αSyn were carried over to the PDD and DLB SAA fibrils. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the limitation of the SAA ﬁbrils modeling the brain-derived αSyn ﬁbrils and pay attention to the necessity of deepening the understanding of the SAA fibrillation methodology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88224">Water and chloride as allosteric inhibitors in WNK kinase osmosensing</a></h4>

              
                Osmotic stress and chloride regulate the autophosphorylation and activity of the WNK1 and WNK3 kinase domains. The kinase domain of unphosphorylated WNK1 (uWNK1) is an asymmetric dimer possessing water molecules conserved in multiple uWNK1 crystal structures. Conserved waters are present in two networks, referred to here as conserved water networks 1 and 2 (CWN1 and CWN2). Here, we show that PEG400 applied to crystals of dimeric uWNK1 induces de-dimerization. Both the WNK1 the water networks and the chloride-binding site are disrupted by PEG400. CWN1 is surrounded by a cluster of pan-WNK-conserved charged residues. Here, we mutagenized these charges in WNK3, a highly active WNK isoform kinase domain, and WNK1, the isoform best studied crystallographically. Mutation of E314 in the Activation Loop of WNK3 (WNK3/E314Q and WNK3/E314A, and the homologous WNK1/E388A) enhanced the rate of autophosphorylation, and reduced chloride sensitivity. Other WNK3 mutants reduced the rate of autophosphorylation activity coupled with greater chloride sensitivity than wild-type. The water and chloride regulation thus appear linked. The lower activity of some mutants may reflect effects on catalysis. Crystallography showed that activating mutants introduced conformational changes in similar parts of the structure to those induced by PEG400. WNK activating mutations and crystallography support a role for CWN1 in WNK inhibition consistent with water functioning as an allosteric ligand.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98747">The Jag2/Notch1 signaling axis promotes sebaceous gland differentiation and controls progenitor proliferation</a></h4>

              
                The sebaceous gland (SG) is a vital appendage of the epidermis, and its normal homeostasis and function is crucial for effective maintenance of the skin barrier. Notch signaling is a well-known regulator of epidermal differentiation, and has also been shown to be involved in postnatal maintenance of SGs. However, the precise role of Notch signaling in regulating SG differentiation in the adult homeostatic skin remains unclear. While there is evidence to suggest that Notch1 is the primary Notch receptor involved in regulating the differentiation process, the ligand remains unknown. Using monoclonal therapeutic antibodies designed to specifically inhibit of each of the Notch ligands or receptors, we have identified the Jag2/Notch1 signaling axis as the primary regulator of sebocyte differentiation in mouse homeostatic skin. Mature sebocytes are lost upon specific inhibition of the Jag2 ligand or Notch1 receptor, resulting in the accumulation of proliferative stem/progenitor cells in the SG. Strikingly, this phenotype is reversible, as these stem/progenitor cells re-enter differentiation when the inhibition of Notch activity is lifted. Thus, Notch activity promotes correct sebocyte differentiation, and is required to restrict progenitor proliferation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97598">Noisy neuronal populations effectively encode sound localization in the dorsal inferior colliculus of awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Sound location coding has been extensively studied at the central nucleus of the mammalian inferior colliculus (CNIC), supporting a population code. However, this population code has not been extensively characterized on the single-trial level with simultaneous recordings or at other anatomical regions like the dorsal cortex of inferior colliculus (DCIC), which is relevant for learning-induced experience dependent plasticity. To address these knowledge gaps, here we made in two complementary ways large-scale recordings of DCIC populations from awake mice in response to sounds delivered from 13 different frontal horizontal locations (azimuths): volumetric two-photon calcium imaging with ~700 cells simultaneously recorded at a relatively low temporal resolution, and high-density single-unit extracellular recordings with ~20 cells simultaneously recorded at a high temporal resolution. Independent of the method, the recorded DCIC population responses revealed substantial trial-to-trial variation (neuronal noise) which was significantly correlated across pairs of neurons (noise correlations) in the passively listening condition. Nevertheless, decoding analysis supported that these noisy response patterns encode sound location on the single-trial basis, reaching errors that match the discrimination ability of mice. The detected noise correlations contributed to minimize the error of the DCIC population code of sound azimuth. Altogether these findings point out that DCIC can encode sound location in a similar format to what has been proposed for CNIC, opening exciting questions about how noise correlations could shape this code in the context of cortico-collicular input and experience-dependent plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92940">Cortical neuroprosthesis-mediated functional ipsilateral control of locomotion in rats with spinal cord hemisection</a></h4>

              
                Control of voluntary limb movement is predominantly attributed to the contralateral motor cortex. However, increasing evidence suggests the involvement of ipsilateral cortical networks in this process, especially in motor tasks requiring bilateral coordination, such as locomotion. In this study, we combined a unilateral thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) with a cortical neuroprosthetic approach to investigate the functional role of the ipsilateral motor cortex in rat movement through spared contralesional pathways. Our findings reveal that in all SCI rats, stimulation of the ipsilesional motor cortex promoted a bilateral synergy. This synergy involved the elevation of the contralateral foot along with ipsilateral hindlimb extension. Additionally, in two out of seven animals, stimulation of a sub-region of the hindlimb motor cortex modulated ipsilateral hindlimb flexion. Importantly, ipsilateral cortical stimulation delivered after SCI immediately alleviated multiple locomotor and postural deficits, and this effect persisted after ablation of the homologous motor cortex. These results provide strong evidence of a causal link between cortical activation and precise ipsilateral control of hindlimb movement. This study has significant implications for the development of future neuroprosthetic technology and our understanding of motor control in the context of SCI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92404">The exocyst complex controls multiple events in the pathway of regulated exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic cells depend on exocytosis to direct intracellularly synthesized material toward the extracellular space or the plasma membrane, so exocytosis constitutes a basic function for cellular homeostasis and communication between cells. The secretory pathway includes biogenesis of secretory granules (SGs), their maturation and fusion with the plasma membrane (exocytosis), resulting in release of SG content to the extracellular space. The larval salivary gland of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is an excellent model for studying exocytosis. This gland synthesizes mucins that are packaged in SGs that sprout from the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network and then undergo a maturation process that involves homotypic fusion, condensation, and acidification. Finally, mature SGs are directed to the apical domain of the plasma membrane with which they fuse, releasing their content into the gland lumen. The exocyst is a hetero-octameric complex that participates in tethering of vesicles to the plasma membrane during constitutive exocytosis. By precise temperature-dependent gradual activation of the Gal4-UAS expression system, we have induced different levels of silencing of exocyst complex subunits, and identified three temporarily distinctive steps of the regulated exocytic pathway where the exocyst is critically required: SG biogenesis, SG maturation, and SG exocytosis. Our results shed light on previously unidentified functions of the exocyst along the exocytic pathway. We propose that the exocyst acts as a general tethering factor in various steps of this cellular process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92438">Key determinants of the dual clamp/activator function of Complexin</a></h4>

              
                Complexin determines magnitude and kinetics of synchronized secretion, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Here, we show that the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix at the C-terminus of Complexin II (CpxII, amino acids 115–134) binds to fusion-promoting SNARE proteins, prevents premature secretion, and allows vesicles to accumulate in a release-ready state in mouse chromaffin cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that an unrelated amphipathic helix functionally substitutes for the C-terminal domain (CTD) of CpxII and that amino acid substitutions on the hydrophobic side compromise the arrest of the pre-fusion intermediate. To facilitate synchronous vesicle fusion, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CpxII (amino acids 1–27) specifically cooperates with synaptotagmin I (SytI), but not with synaptotagmin VII. Expression of CpxII rescues the slow release kinetics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding mutant Syt I R233Q, whereas the N-terminally truncated variant of CpxII further delays it. These results indicate that the CpxII NTD regulates mechanisms which are governed by the forward rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Syt I. Overall, our results shed new light on key molecular properties of CpxII that hinder premature exocytosis and accelerate synchronous exocytosis.

">Idiosyncratic navigation determines mouse CA1 representational structure in a multicompartment environment</a></h4>

              
                Organisms from mice to humans rely on cognitive maps instantiated by the hippocampal formation to flexibly and efficiently navigate the world. Traditional theories of cognitive mapping posit that these representations encode geometric relationships among their contents, while recent alternative theories propose that they encode the predictive relationships among their contents that the navigator experiences. Here, we leverage longitudinal miniscope calcium imaging of CA1 in mice navigating a multicompartment environment to adjudicate between predictions of these theories. We find that different mice instantiate different representational structures across identical compartments. Within mouse, compartments with more similar navigational patterns on a particular spatiotemporal scale are represented more similarly, accounting for these individual differences. Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating navigational patterns on this scale induces a corresponding change in CA1 representational structure. Together, these results demonstrate that idiosyncratic navigation is a key determinant of hippocampal representational structure, consistent with predictive theories of cognitive mapping.

">Conspecific sociability is regulated by associative learning circuits</a></h4>

              
                Sociability, an animal's ease and propensity to interact with members of its own species, is a prerequisite for many important social interactions including courtship, mating, brood rearing, and collective behavior. Despite its fundamental nature, the manner through which sociability arises -whether it is innate or acquired and its neural mechanisms- remains unknown. Here, we found that the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, produces a constellation of fearful reactions when it encounters another fly for the first time. However, these animals become sociable following several hours of exposure to conspecific (but not heterospecific) odors. Two large-scale neural silencing screens of 188 brain cell types revealed that both initial fearful reactions and learned sociability depend upon overlapping networks including circuits in the mushroom body, the principal center for associative learning and memory in the insect brain. Functional recordings of key mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) from this network over two hours of social interactions support a mechanistic model whereby fly odors modulate social valence by rebalancing MBON population activity, biasing action selection, and thereby driving sociable rather than fearful responses towards other flies. Thus, a center for learning and memory plays a fundamental role in establishing the basis for most social interactions.

">Regionally specific picture naming benefits of focal tDCS are dependent on baseline performance in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Word-finding difficulty is a common challenge in older age and is linked to various neuropathological conditions associated with ageing. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promise as a cognitive enhancement tool for both healthy aging and age-related cognitive disorders. However, its effectiveness in enhancing word-finding ability remains inconsistent, especially among healthy adults. This variability is likely due to factors such as task selection, stimulation parameters, and small sample sizes. Additionally, many studies have overlooked the role of baseline performance in evaluating tDCS efficacy. In this preregistered study, we examined 72 older and 72 younger adults using a double-blind, sham-controlled design, delivering anodal focal tDCS to either the left inferior frontal gyrus or the left temporoparietal junction. Baseline naming performance and fluid intelligence were measured before stimulation. Anodal stimulation of the left inferior frontal gyrus significantly increased response speed for object and action naming in older adults, but crucially only in older adults who performed poorly during the baseline naming session. Findings demonstrate regionally specific effects of focal tDCS in healthy older individuals in greater need for naming facilitation. Notably, performance on a broad measure of fluid intelligence was unrelated to stimulation response, suggesting task specificity of this effect.

">H- and m-channel overexpression promotes seizure-like events by impairing the ability of inhibitory neurons to process correlated inputs</a></h4>

              
                Channelopathies affecting h- and m-channels present a paradox in epilepsy research: while both over- and underexpression of these channels can be epileptogenic, channel overexpression does not appear to increase the excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance as caused by channel underexpression. We here derive a viable mechanism for ictogenesis driven by h- and m-channel overexpression from analysis of an in silico spiking neuronal microcircuit exhibiting spontaneous seizure-like events (SLEs). Such SLEs are dependent upon sufficiently strong gain in two adaptation terms phenomenologically modeling these channels' effects: voltage homeostasis (h-current) and spike-frequency adaptation (m-current). Excessive gain of these adaptation terms interferes with the circuit's processing of highly correlated input, promoting a sequence of network-level events that collectively provoke an SLE. Importantly, these changes do not cause increased excitability in isolated neurons, nor does this cascade require a change in the amplitude of external input to the circuit, suggesting an ictogenic pathway independent of classical changes to the E-I balance. The viability of this mechanism for SLE onset is strengthened by the host of experimentally-characterized features of seizure produced in this model reliant upon the presence of these adaptation terms, including the irregular initiation and termination of seizure-like events and time-varying peak frequency of oscillations during such events (i.e., chirps). Moreover, the cell-type dependent effects of changes in these adaptation terms, as delineated in our analyses, represent experimentally-testable predictions for future study of h- and m-channelopathies. These computational results provide vital new insights into the epileptogenic nature of h- and m-channel overexpression currently absent in the experimental literature.

">Embryonically generated interneurons (EGINs) exhibit a distinctive developmental program and lamination in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Interneurons (INs) in the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) develop during an extensive period of time that begins in the embryo and continues throughout the lifetime of an individual. The connectivity and location of these neurons is profoundly affected by the time of generation, making these developmental windows critical to understand the circuitry of the OB. Here, we focus on the OB embryonic generated interneurons (or EGINs), which have generally received less attention than those generated in the adult. Birthdates of EGINs were differentiated by embryonic injections of thymidine analogs and their final destinations and phenotypes analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We found that EGINs were retained in the adult and were distributed across all layers of the OB. However, a lateral-to-medial neurogenic gradient is seen only in the earliest generated EGINs. Within the granule cell layer (GCL), EGINs predominantly accumulated in the superficial region at almost all ages and remained there during adulthood. Immunostaining for calbindin, parvalbumin, tyrosine hydroxylase, and calretinin were largely negative suggesting that EGINs may represent subpopulations of OB INs that are not yet fully characterized. Using in utero electroporation to label EGIN progenitors, we demonstrated that they reach the primordial OB as early as E13 and begin to differentiate apical dendrites by E15. At E16, EGIN progenitors clustered into a chain of migrating neuroblasts denoting the embryonic rostral migratory stream (RMS). Collectively, our data highlight the importance of studying OB INs in isolated time windows to better understand the formation of circuits that define the olfactory responses.

">Integration of hunger and hormonal state gates infant-directed aggression</a></h4>

              
                Social behaviour is profoundly shaped by internal physiological states. While significant progress has been made in understanding how individual states such as hunger, stress, or arousal modulate behaviour, animals experience multiple states at any given time. The neural mechanisms that integrate such orthogonal states - and how this integration affects behaviour - remain poorly understood. Here we report how hunger and estrous state converge on neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) to shape infant-directed behaviour. We find that hunger promotes pup-directed aggression in normally non aggressive virgin female mice. This behavioural switch occurs through inhibition of MPOA neurons, driven by the release of neuropeptide Y (NPY) from Agouti-related peptide-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ArcAgRP neurons). The propensity for hunger induced aggression is set by reproductive state, with MPOA neurons detecting changes in progesterone (P4) to estradiol (E2) ratio across the estrous cycle. Hunger and estrous state converge on HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) channels, which sets the baseline activity and excitability of MPOA neurons. Using micro endoscopic imaging, we confirm these findings in vivo, revealing that MPOA neurons encode a state for pup-directed aggression. This work thus provides a mechanistic understanding of how multiple physiological states are integrated to flexibly control social behaviour.

">Increased reluctant vesicles underlie synaptic depression by GPR55 in axon terminals of cerebellar Purkinje cells</a></h4>

              
                Control of synaptic transmission efficacy by neuronal activity and neuromodulators is pivotal for brain function. Synaptic suppression by cannabinoids activating CB1 receptors has been extensively studied at the molecular and cellular levels to understand the neuronal basis for symptoms of cannabis intake. Here, we focused on another type of cannabinoid receptor GPR55, which shows sensitivity to cannabidiol, a chemical included in cannabis, aiming to highlight its actions on presynaptic function. Taking advantage of direct patch-clamp recordings from axon terminals of cerebellar Purkinje cells together with fluorescent imaging of vesicular exocytosis using synapto-pHluorin, we show that GPR55 suppresses synaptic transmission as CB1 receptor does, but through a distinct presynaptic modulation of release machinery. Activation of GPR55 reduced transmitter release by changing neither presynaptic action potential waveform nor Ca2+ influx, but by making a large population of Ca2+-responsive synaptic vesicles insensitive to Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, leading to substantial reduction of the readily releasable pool of vesicles. Thus, the present study identifies a unique mechanism to suppress presynaptic transmitter release by atypical receptor for cannabinoid, which would enable subtype-specific modulation of neuronal computation by cannabinoid receptors.

">Distinct decision processes for 3D and motion stimuli in both humans and monkeys revealed by computational modelling</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making models distil principles of information processing that underlie a range of cognitive functions. For the cases of motion detection in random-dot kinematograms and decisions about the rotation of 3D structure-from-motion cylinders, contributing neural processes have been localized to specific circuits in extrastriate area V5/MT on the basis of both causal and correlative evidence, suggesting a common decision path. Here, we arranged for humans and rhesus monkeys to make perceptual choices about these two stimulus types, indicating their decision with either hand or eye movements. In both species, the parameter distributions of a hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) revealed systematic differences for stimulus type but not the different modes of response. States in a hidden Markov model also indicated distinct decision strategies, again for the two stimulus types but not for response mode. Although physiological evidence points to area V5/MT as a vehicle for relevant perceptual signals for both stimulus types, computational modelling of the present results reveal distinct decision processes, therefore predicting that different neural processes underlie judgements about motion and 3D-depth, consistently for humans and monkeys.

">Fast Photostable Expansion Microscopy Using QDots andDeconvolution</a></h4>

              
                Expansion microscopy (ExM) enables sub-diffraction imaging by physically expanding labeled tissue samples. This increases the tissue volume relative to the instrument point spread function (PSF), thereby improving the effective resolution by reported factors of 4 - 20X. However, this volume increase dilutes the fluorescence signal, reducing both signal-to noise ratio (SNR) and acquisition speed. This paper proposes and validates a method for mitigating these challenges. We overcame the limitations of ExM by developing a fast photo-stable protocol to enable scalable widefield three-dimensional imaging with ExM. We combined widefield imaging with quantum dots (QDots). Widefield imaging provides a significantly faster acquisition of a single field-of-view (FOV). However, the uncontrolled incoherent illumination induces photobleaching. We mitigated this challenge using QDots, which exhibit a long fluorescence lifetime and improved photostability. First, we developed a protocol for QDot labeling. Next, we utilized widefield imaging to obtain 3D image stacks and applied deconvolution, which is feasible due to reduced scattering in ExM samples. We show that tissue clearing, which is a side-effect of ExM, enables widefield deconvolution, dramatically reducing the acquisition time for three-dimensional images compared to laser scanning microscopy. The proposed QDot labeling protocol is compatible with ExM and provides enhanced photostability compared to traditional fluorescent dyes. Widefield imaging significantly improves SNR and acquisition speed compared to conventional confocal microscopy. Combining widefield imaging with QDot labeling and deconvolution has the potential to be applied to ExM for faster imaging of large three-dimensional samples with improved SNR.

">Intuitive physical reasoning is not mediated by linguistic nor exclusively domain-general abstract representations</a></h4>

              
                The ability to reason about the physical world is a critical tool in the human cognitive toolbox, but the nature of the representations that mediate physical reasoning remains debated. Here, we use fMRI to illuminate this question by investigating the relationship between the physical- reasoning system and two well-characterized systems: a) the domain-general Multiple Demand (MD) system, which supports abstract reasoning, including mathematical and logical reasoning, and b) the language system, which supports linguistic computations and has been hypothesized to mediate some forms of thought. We replicate prior findings of a network of frontal and parietal areas that are robustly engaged by physical reasoning and identify an additional physical-reasoning area in the left frontal cortex, which also houses components of the MD and language systems. Critically, direct comparisons with tasks that target the MD and the language systems reveal that the physical-reasoning system overlaps with the MD system, but is dissociable from it in fine-grained activation patterns, which replicates prior work. Moreover, the physical-reasoning system does not overlap with the language system. These results suggest that physical reasoning does not rely on linguistic representations, nor exclusively on the domain- general abstract reasoning that the MD system supports.

">The Virtual Brain links transcranial magnetic stimulation evoked potentials and inhibitory neurotransmitter changes in major depressive disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation evoked potentials (TEPs) show promise as a biomarker in major depressive disorder (MDD), but the origin of the increased TEP amplitude in these patients remains unclear. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) may be involved, as TEP peak amplitude is known to increase with GABAergic activity, but paradoxically MDD patients exhibit reduced GABA levels. We employed a computational modeling approach to investigate this contradiction. Methods: Whole-brain simulations in 'The Virtual Brain' (thevirtualbrain.org), employing the Jansen and Rit neural mass model, were optimized to simulate TEPs of healthy individuals (N=20, 14 females, 24.5+/-4.9 years). To mimic MDD, a GABAergic deficit was introduced to the simulations by altering one of two selected inhibitory parameters, the inhibitory synaptic time constant b or the number of inhibitory synapses C4. The TEP amplitude was quantified and compared for all simulations. Results: Both parameters, the inhibitory synaptic time constant (r=-0.6, p<0.001) and the number of inhibitory synapses (r=-0.79, p<0.001), showed a significant negative linear correlation to the TEP amplitude. Thus, under local parameter changes, we were able to alter the TEP amplitude towards pathological levels, i.e. creating an MDD-like increase of the global mean field amplitude in line with empirical results. Conclusions: Our model suggests specific GABAergic deficits as the cause of increased TEP amplitude in MDD patients, which may serve as therapeutic targets. This work highlights the potential of whole-brain simulations in the investigation of neuropsychiatric diseases.

">Multimodal, multifaceted Imaging-based Human Brain White Matter Atlas</a></h4>

              
                Comparable to an atlas for navigating the Earth, a brain atlas outlines the brain's neuroanatomical and functional landmarks. The tract-based brain's white matter atlas (WMA) captures only tract boundaries, neglecting functionally relevant information, including emerging evidence on reliable neurodynamic detection in WM. Thus, a suitable WMA for functional investigations is needed. We delineated WM areas from coarse to fine-grained parcellations using local anatomical architecture and global functional dynamics using multimodal 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging in the Human Connectome Project. The multimodal WMA (MWMA) exhibited high between-subject consistency (69.1%) and test-retest reliability (93.1%), which aligned with the spatial pattern of chemoarchitectural homogeneity derived from open molecular imaging sources. Compared to a tract-based atlas, the MWMA better described the white matter's cerebellum-association gradient axis, and precisely identified unique functional connectivity profiles of the corpus callosum. This improved MWMA will facilitate studies of WM functional organization, supporting cognition research and ultimately neuropathological vulnerability studies from a whole brain perspective.

">A versatile mouse model to advance human microglia transplantation research in neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent studies highlight the critical role of microglia in neurodegenerative disorders, and emphasize the need for humanized models to accurately study microglial responses. Human-mouse microglia xenotransplantation models are a valuable platform for functional studies and for testing therapeutic approaches, yet currently those models are only available for academic research. This hampers their implementation for the development and testing of medication that targets human microglia. Methods We developed the hCSF1Bdes mouse line suitable as new transplantation model available to be crossed to any disease model of interest. The hCSF1Bdes model created by CRISPR gene editing is RAG2 deficient and expresses human CSF1. Additional we crossed this model with two humanized App KI mice, the AppHu and the AppSAA . Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and bulk sequencing was used to study the response of microglia in the context of Alzheimers disease. Results Our results demonstrate the successful transplantation of iPSC-derived human microglia into the brains of hCSF1Bdes mice without triggering a NK-driven immune response. Furthermore we confirmed the multipronged response of microglia in the context of Alzheimers disease. The hCSF1Bdes and the crosses with the Alzheimers disease knock-in model AppSAA and the humanized App knock-in control mice, AppHu are deposited with EMMA and fully accessible to the research community. Conclusion The hCSF1Bdes mouse is available for both non-profit and for-profit organisations, facilitating the use of the xenotransplantation paradigm for human microglia to study complex human disease.

">Absolute quantification of cerebral metabolites using 2D 1H-MRSI with quantitative MRI-based water reference</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Metabolite concentrations are valuable biomarkers in brain tumors (BT). However, correction of water relaxation effects often requires time-consuming quantitative MRI (qMRI) sequences on top of a lengthy spectroscopic water reference acquisition. The goal of this work was to develop and validate a fast metabolite quantification method where a 2D spectroscopic water reference acquisition is obtained using a fast qMRI protocol and single-voxel STEAM sequence. Methods: A 2D sLASER sequence was acquired for MRSI. An 8-minute qMRI protocol was also acquired. A single-voxel unsuppressed water signal was acquired using a STEAM sequence. The H2O map, obtained from qMRI, was calibrated based on the STEAM-signal to obtain the spectroscopic water reference (proposed method). Five healthy volunteers and one BT patient were scanned at 3T. Concentrations obtained using the proposed and two reference methods, one where water relaxation effects were corrected using literature values (Reference method) and one where they were corrected using qMRI-derived values (Reference method with qMRI) were compared. Results: In healthy subjects, WM metabolite concentrations obtained using water relaxation using literature values (Reference method) significantly differed from those using individual-specific corrections (Reference method with qMRI and proposed method). Bland-Altman analyses revealed a very low bias and SD of the differences between the Reference method with qMRI and the proposed-method (Bias<0.5% and SD<10%). The BT regions showed a ~15% underestimation of metabolite concentrations using the Reference method. Conclusion: For metabolite quantification, accurate water referencing with individual-specific corrections for water relaxation times was obtained in 8 minutes using the proposed method.

">Parp1 deletion rescues cerebellar hypotrophy in xrcc1 mutant zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Defects in DNA single-strand break repair are associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. One such disorder is that resulting from mutations in XRCC1, a scaffold protein that plays a central role in DNA single-strand base repair. XRCC1 is recruited at sites of single-strand breaks by PARP1, a protein that detects and is activated by such breaks and is negatively regulated by XRCC1 to prevent excessive PARP binding and activity. Loss of XRCC1 leads to the toxic accumulation and activity of PARP1 at single-strand breaks leading to base excision repair defects, a mechanism that may underlie pathological changes in patients carrying deleterious XRCC1 mutations. Here, we demonstrate that xrcc1 knockdown impairs development of the cerebellar plate in zebrafish. In contrast, parp1 knockdown alone does not significantly affect neural development, and instead rescues the cerebellar defects observed in xrcc1 mutant larvae. These findings support the notion that PARP1 inhibition may be a viable therapeutic candidate in neurological disorders.

">Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles inhibit inflammatory pyroptosis in 5XFAD mice brains</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study investigates the effects of intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles on inflammation and programmed cell death by pyroptosis in 5XFAD Alzheimers Disease (AD) mice. Methods: 5XFAD and wild type (WT) B6SJLF1/J mice were treated with intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles (5 mg/kg), daily, Monday to Friday, for 12 weeks continuously, starting at 9 months of age. Blood and brain were harvested at 13 months of age, one month after completion of 12 weeks intranasal dantrolene nanoparticle treatment. Blood biomarkers function of liver (Alanine transaminase, ALT), kidney (Creatinine), and thyroid (TSH: Thyroid-stimulating hormone) were measured using ELISA. The changes of whole brain tissue proteins on Ca2+ release channels on membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (type 2 ryanodine and type 1 InsP3 receptors, RyR-2 and InsP3R-1), lipid peroxidation byproduct malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified proteins, 4-HNE, pyroptosis regulatory proteins (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, full length or N-terminal of Gasdermin D (GSDMD), cytotoxic (IL-1, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-) and cytoprotective (IL-10) cytokines, astrogliosis (GFAP), microgliosis (IBA-1) and synapse proteins (PSD-95, Synapsin-1) were determined using immunoblotting. Body weights were monitored regularly. Results: Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles significantly inhibited the increase of RyR-2 and InsP3R-1 proteins, MDA-modified proteins, 4-NHE, pyroptosis regulatory proteins (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, N-terminal GSDMD), cytotoxic cytokine (IL-1, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-), biomarkers for astrogliosis (GFAP) and microgliosis (IBA-1), and the decrease of cytoprotective cytokine (IL-10) and synaptic proteins (PSD-95, synpasin-1). Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles for 12 weeks did not affect blood biomarkers for function of liver, kidney, and thyroid, not did it change body weight significantly. Conclusion: Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles significantly inhibit the increase of RyR-2 and InsP3R-1 Ca2+ channel receptor proteins, ameliorate activation of the pyroptosis pathway and pathological inflammation, and the associated loss of synapse proteins. Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles for three months did not affect liver, kidney and thyroid functions or cause other side effects.

">Folate prevents the autism-related phenotype caused by developmental pyrethroid exposure in prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have dramatically increased in prevalence to an alarming one in six children, and yet both causes and preventions remain elusive. Recent human epidemiology and animal studies have implicated developmental exposure to pyrethroid pesticides, one of the most common classes of pesticides in the US, as an environmental risk factor for autism and NDDs. Our previous research has shown that low-dose chronic developmental pyrethroid exposure (DPE) changes folate metabolites in the adult mouse brain. We hypothesize that DPE acts directly on molecular targets in the folate metabolism pathway, and that high-dose maternal folate supplementation can prevent or reduce the biobehavioral effects of DPE. We exposed pregnant prairie vole dams to vehicle or deltamethrin (3 mg/kg every 3 days) with or without folate supplementation (5 mg/kg methylfolate every 3 days). The resulting DPE offspring showed broad deficits in five behavioral domains relevant to NDDs; increased plasma folate concentrations; and increased neural expression of SHMT1, a cellular folate cycle enzyme. Maternal folate supplementation prevented most of the behavioral phenotype (except for repetitive behaviors) and caused potentially compensatory changes in neural expression of FOLR1 and MTHFR, two other folate-related proteins. We conclude that DPE causes NDD-relevant behavioral deficits; DPE directly alters aspects of folate metabolism; and preventative interventions targeting folate metabolism are effective in reducing, but not eliminating, the behavioral effects of DPE.

">The cell-type underpinnings of regional brain entropy (BEN) in human brain</a></h4>

              
                Brain entropy (BEN) indicates the irregularity, unpredictability and complexity of brain activity. Research using regional brain entropy (rBEN) based on fMRI has established its associations with structural and functional brain networks, as well as their coupling. These relationships are influenced by the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis and cytoarchitectural organization. Recent studies have also revealed links between functional connectome gradients and cell-type, suggesting that rBEN may have a biological basis at the cellular level. However, this possibility remains unexplored at specifically cellular level. In this study, we analyzed mean rBEN maps derived from 176 participants using HCP 7T data and correlated these with publicly available cell-type datasets. Our findings rBEN exhibited a positive correlation with oligodendrocytes (Oligo) and a negative correlation with parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVALB) under both resting-state and movie-watching conditions at the whole-brain level. Furthermore, we observed that the S-A axis modulates the relationship between rBEN and cell-type. Specifically, L5 extratelencephalic neurons (L5 ET) showed a positive correlation with rBEN in unimodal cortex but a negative correlation in multimodal cortex and interneurons somatostatin (SST) was correlated with rBEN only in multimodal cortex. These results provide further evidence that rBEN has a biological foundation at the cellular level, with spatial heterogeneity in its associations with different cell types. Moreover, rBEN appears to capture information beyond functional connectivity network.

">THE BRAIN-MESH MODEL: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FORNEURAL SYNCHRONY, PLASTICITY, AND COHERENCE</a></h4>

              
                The brain-mesh model introduces a novel three-layered architecture that integrates local and macroregional connectivity with an underlying, mesh-inspired network layer. This foundational mesh layer, based on metallic mesh structures, spans the entire brain and generates interference patterns, noise, and resonance effects that modulate both local and global neural dynamics. The fused model goes beyond traditional connectivity frameworks by providing a unified explanation for phenomena such as brain-wide phase gradients, stable low-frequency resonance frequencies, and long-range plasticity effects, which are often difficult to explain cohesively within existing models. In addition to accounting for classical neurobiological observations--such as phase synchrony, functional connectivity fluctuations, and local Hebbian plasticity--the fused model offers novel insights into less understood phenomena. Specifically, it predicts connectivity-independent phase gradients across non-synaptic regions, harmonic resonance peaks consistent across individuals, and diffuse plasticity driven by global interference patterns, all of which are challenging to explain under current frameworks. These unique predictions align with partial empirical observations, such as traveling wave dynamics, consistent low-frequency oscillations, and task-induced connectivity shifts, underscoring the model's relevance. Additionally, the brain-mesh model generates testable hypotheses that distinguish it from traditional approaches, providing a promising framework for future experimental validation and opening new avenues for understanding global brain function.

">Dopamine alters motor learning performance in the presence and absence of feedback</a></h4>

              
                Skilled motor performance is essential for survival. Indeed, we often not only choose to learn motor skills because of some external reward, but also because skilled movement, in and of itself, is satisfying. While dopamine is known to drive reward-based motor learning, it remains unclear whether dopamine is implicated in motor learning under conditions ostensibly driven by intrinsic rewards/motivation (i.e., in the absence of extrinsic feedback or reward). Here, we investigated the role of dopamine in motor skill learning guided by internally determined signals of performance success, using a task where learning occurred either in the absence or presence of feedback. We found that dopamine altered performance both in the presence and in the absence of information on task success. This provides direct causal evidence for a role of dopamine in motor learning driven by internal task goals.

Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed widespread postnatal reductions in white matter fractional anisotropy, concentrated in the corpus callosum for both reduced protein levels relative to control diet. Despite extensive neurodevelopmental alterations detectable by longitudinal imaging, early behavioral assessments conducted at 1 month revealed minor perturbations.

	<p>Accurate identification and functional annotation of splicing isoforms and non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), alongside full-length protein-encoding transcripts, are critical for understanding gene (mis)regulation and metabolic reprogramming in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). This study aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate transcriptome resource to improve existing AD transcript databases. Background/Objectives: Gene mis-regulation and metabolic reprogramming play a key role in AD, yet existing transcript databases lack accurate and comprehensive identification of splicing isoforms and lncRNAs. This study aims to generate a refined transcriptome dataset, expanding the understanding of AD onset and progression. Methods: Publicly available RNA-seq data from pre-AD and AD tissues were utilized. Advanced bioinformatics tools were applied to assemble and annotate full-length transcripts, including splicing isoforms and lncRNAs, with an emphasis on correcting errors and enhancing annotation accuracy. Results: A significantly improved transcriptome dataset was generated, which includes detailed annotations of splicing isoforms and lncRNAs. This dataset expands the scope of existing AD transcript databases and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. The findings demonstrate that the refined dataset captures more relevant details about AD progression compared to publicly available data. Conclusions: The newly developed transcriptome resource and the associated analysis tools offer a valuable contribution to AD research, providing deeper insights into the disease&#039;s molecular mechanisms. This work supports future research into gene regulation and metabolic reprogramming in AD and serves as a foundation for exploring novel therapeutic targets.</p>

	<p>Context: Spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) is a condition characterized by muscle stiffness and involuntary movements, which greatly affect movement abilities and overall well-being. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has emerged as a treatment option for managing spasticity, though the current evidence varies. Objective: This systematic review seeks to assess the efficacy of LLLT on spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. We hope it will pinpoint areas where more research is needed and suggest directions for future studies. Method: A search of the literature was performed across databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Elicit. The search utilized keywords and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Only studies conducted in English that focused on children with cerebral palsy (CP) and explored the effects of LLLT on spasticity were considered. The quality of the selected studies was evaluated using assessment tools. Results: The search identified 534 references, out of which eight studies met the screening criteria for inclusion. All cited papers indicated reductions in spasticity with further mention of reduced pain and greater muscle strength by some authors. Conclusions: This review indicates that LLLT shows promise in decreasing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Nevertheless, a lack of treatment parameters, heterogeneity in research methods, and a lack of objective outcome measures weaken the results. This review underscores the importance of standardized procedures and carefully planned randomized controlled trials to establish conclusive findings on the effectiveness of LLLT in this population.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in brain tumor diagnosis by providing clear visualization of soft tissues without the use of ionizing radiation. Given the increasing incidence of brain tumors, there is an urgent need for reliable diagnostic tools, as misdiagnoses can lead to harmful treatment decisions and poor outcomes. While machine learning has significantly advanced medical diagnostics, achieving both high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. Methods: This study proposes a hybrid model that integrates MobileNetV2 for feature extraction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for the classification of brain tumors. The model was trained and validated using the Kaggle MRI brain tumor dataset, which includes 7023 images categorized into four types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. MobileNetV2&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficient architecture was leveraged for feature extraction, and SVM was used to enhance classification accuracy. Results: The proposed hybrid model showed excellent results, achieving Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.99 for glioma, 0.97 for meningioma, and 1.0 for both pituitary tumors and the no tumor class. These findings highlight that the MobileNetV2-SVM hybrid not only improves classification accuracy but also reduces computational overhead, making it suitable for broader clinical use. Conclusions: The MobileNetV2-SVM hybrid model demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing brain tumor diagnostics by offering a balance of precision and computational efficiency. Its ability to maintain high accuracy while operating efficiently could lead to better outcomes in medical practice, particularly in resource limited settings.</p>

	<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is among the most prevalent chronic autoimmune disorders affecting the central nervous system. In Poland, the MS incidence rate is 6.3 per 100,000 patients. The results of studies indicate that people suffering from MS are less involved in sexual life in both the physical and emotional aspects, they assess that sex is less important to them than to healthy people, and their sexual motivation is limited, especially its physical dimension. Methods: A total of 121 people participated in the study. It used four questionnaires: authors&amp;amp;rsquo; survey on sociodemographic and biomedical data, Short Sexual Well-Being Scale, Guy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Neurological Disability Scale, and Expanded Disability Status Scale. Results: A positive and moderate relationship was found between neurological disability and physical disability. Also, the correlation between neurological disability and the number of sexual dysfunctions was significant. Problems in the neurological sphere were also negatively associated with sexual well-being. Physical disability was not significantly associated with the level of sexual well-being or the number of declared sexual dysfunctions. The number of dysfunctions was moderately associated with the levels of sexual well-being. The polynomial regression analyses did not find any non-linear relationships between the severity of disability and sexual well-being. Conclusions: This study suggests that the occurrence of sexual dysfunctions can be an important subject in MS patients&amp;amp;rsquo; sexual well-being. It underlines the fact that the subject of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s sexuality cannot be omitted while providing medical and psychological support for individuals with MS.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study explores whether sex differences in reactive aggression (RA) and proactive aggression (PA) are attributable to sex, gender role orientation, or their interaction and explores the neuroanatomical characteristics of these sex differences. Methods: In a sample of 108 males and 126 females, we examined the sex-by-gender role orientation interaction on RA, PA, and brain gray matter volume (GMV). Then, we explored the relationship between aggression and regional GMV. Results: When the effects of sex and gender role orientation on aggression were disentangled, there were no sex differences in RA, regardless of gender role orientation. However, sex differences (male &amp;amp;gt; female) in PA were observed within the masculine group but not within the feminine group. Brain imaging results revealed sex differences (male &amp;amp;gt; female) on the right inferior frontal gyrus GMV, a region involved in cognitive control, within the masculine group. Moreover, a negative association between PA and the right inferior frontal gyrus GMV was observed in masculine females rather than masculine males. Conclusions: These findings indicate that gender role orientation has a more significant effect on aggression than sex, particularly with regard to PA, and hint that the goal of cognitive control involved in displaying PA differs in masculine males and masculine females.</p>

">Brain Feature Maps Reveal Progressive Animal-Feature Representations in the Ventral Stream.</a></h4>

              
                What are the fundamental units of representation in the primate visual brain? While objects have become an intuitive framework for studying neurons in many parts of cortex, it is possible that neurons follow a more expressive organizational principle, such as encoding generic features present across textures, places, and objects. In this study, we used multi-electrode arrays to record from neurons in early (V1/V2), middle (V4), and late (posterior inferotemporal cortex (PIT)) areas across the visual hierarchy, estimating the local operation of each neuron over the entire visual scene. These estimates, called "heatmaps," approximate the weight sharing operation of convolutional neural networks. We found that while populations of neurons across V1, V4, and PIT responded over the full scene, they focused on salient sub-regions within object outlines. The best captured object feature class belonged to animals, not general objects, as a trend that increased over the visual hierarchy. These results show that the monkey ventral stream is partially organized to encode local animal features over objects, even as early as primary visual cortex.

">A meta-analysis of the effects of early life stress on the prefrontal cortex transcriptome suggests long-term effects on myelin</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early life stress (ELS) refers to exposure to negative childhood experiences, such as neglect, disaster, and physical, mental, or emotional abuse. ELS can permanently alter the brain, leading to cognitive impairment, increased sensitivity to future stressors, and mental health risks. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain region implicated in the effects of ELS. Methods: To better understand the effects of ELS on the PFC, we ran a meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptional profiling datasets. We identified five datasets (GSE89692, GSE116416, GSE14720, GSE153043, GSE124387) that characterized the long-term effects of multi-day postnatal ELS paradigms (maternal separation, limited nesting/bedding) in male and female laboratory rodents (rats, mice). The outcome variable was gene expression in the PFC later in adulthood as measured by microarray or RNA-Seq. To conduct the meta-analysis, preprocessed gene expression data were extracted from the Gemma database. Following quality control, the final sample size was n=89: n=42 controls & n=47 ELS: GSE116416 n=23 (no outliers); GSE116416 n=44 (2 outliers); GSE14720 n=7 (no outliers); GSE153043 n=9 (1 outlier), and GSE124387 n=6 (no outliers). Differential expression was calculated using the limma pipeline followed by an empirical Bayes correction. For each gene, a random effects meta-analysis model was then fit to the ELS vs. Control effect sizes (Log2 Fold Changes) from each study. Results: Our meta-analysis yielded stable estimates for 11,885 genes, identifying five genes with differential expression following ELS (false discovery rate< 0.05): transforming growth factor alpha (Tgfa), IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 3 (Iqgap3), collagen, type XI, alpha 1 (Col11a1), claudin 11 (Cldn11) and myelin associated glycoprotein (Mag), all of which were downregulated. Broadly, gene sets associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and brain development were downregulated following ELS. In contrast, genes previously shown to be upregulated in Major Depressive Disorder patients were upregulated following ELS. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ELS during critical periods of development may produce long-term effects on the efficiency of transmission in the PFC and drive changes in gene expression similar to those underlying depression.

">Controlling Reciprocity in Binary and Weighted Networks: A Novel Density-Conserving Approach</a></h4>

              
                We introduce efficient Network Reciprocity Control (NRC) algorithms for steering the degree of asymmetry and reciprocity in binary and weighted networks while preserving fundamental network properties. Our methods maintain edge density in binary networks and cumulative edge weight in weighted graphs. We test these algorithms on synthetic benchmark networks-including random, small-world, and modular structures- as well as brain connectivity maps (connectomes) from various species. We demonstrate how adjusting the asymmetry-reciprocity balance under edge density and total weight constraints influences key network features, including spectral properties, degree distributions, community structure, clustering, and path lengths. Additionally, we present a case study on the computational implications of graded reciprocity by solving a memory task within the reservoir computing framework. Furthermore, we establish the scalability of the NRC algorithms by applying them to networks of increasing size. These approaches enable systematic investigation of the relationship between directional asymmetry and network topology, with potential applications in computational and network sciences, social network analysis, and other fields studying complex network systems where the directionality of connections is essential.

">The Alzheimers Disease Risk Genes MS4A4A And MS4A6A Cooperate to Negatively Regulate Trem2 and Microglia states</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variations in MS4A4A and MS4A6A are linked to the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels and are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and progression. Using CRISPR knockout and MS4A4A-degrading antibodies in primary human microglia, non-human primates (NHP), and a xenotransplantation model of amyloid pathology, we provide evidence that MS4A4A and MS4A6A are negative regulators of both the transmembrane and soluble TREM2 proteins. They also negatively regulate microglia proliferation, survival, metabolism, lysosomal function, energetics, phagocytosis, and disease-fighting states. Mechanistically, we find that MS4A4A exerts negative regulation by interacting with MS4A6A and protecting it from degradation. MS4A6A in turn forms a complex with and blocks the co-receptor DAP12, which is required for the stability, cell surface localization, and signaling of TREM2 and other receptors. Taken together, the data indicate that MS4A4A and MS4A6A are cooperating, post-transcriptional negative regulators of TREM2 and microglial function, and potential drug targets for AD.

">Triple network dynamics and future alcohol consumption in adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human neuroimaging increasingly suggests that the brain is best modeled as a highly interconnected and dynamic system. However, novel methodology for studying functional brain network dynamics have never been applied to the study of adolescent alcohol consumption. We sought to determine whether brain network dynamics are related to future drinking behavior in teenagers. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series from 17-year-old non/low drinking participants (n=295) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study were used to fit a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM). Regions of the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN), collectively known as the Triple Network, were included in modeling. The HSMM identified the most-likely state sequence for each participant, a trajectory through distinct brain network states over the course of their fMRI scan. Poisson regression models were used to assess relationships between state sequence metrics and future drinking frequency. Potential sex differences in state sequence metrics or the relationship between sequence metrics and future drinking were assessed with permutation testing and interactions in regression models. Results: No sex differences in state sequence metrics were observed. However, the relationship between occupancy times and future drinking frequency differed by sex for two brain states. In the full sample, occupancy time in a state characterized by high interconnectivity between the SN and CEN was negatively associated with drinking. Occupancy time in a separate state characterized by high activation in the DMN and SN, but low activation in the CEN, was negatively associated with future drinking. Conclusions: Brain network dynamics may be useful neural markers of predisposition to drinking in adolescents. Brain states which make teens vulnerable or resilient to drinking may differ between sexes.

">Single-unit activations confer inductive biases for emergent circuit solutions to cognitive tasks</a></h4>

              
                Trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become the leading framework for modeling neural dynamics in the brain, owing to their capacity to mimic how population-level computations arise from interactions among many units with heterogeneous responses. RNN units are commonly modeled using various nonlinear activation functions, assuming these architectural differences do not affect emerging task solutions. Contrary to this view, we show that single-unit activation functions confer inductive biases that influence the geometry of neural population trajectories, single-unit selectivity, and fixed point configurations. Using a model distillation approach, we find that differences in neural representations and dynamics reflect qualitatively distinct circuit solutions to cognitive tasks emerging in RNNs with different activation functions, leading to disparate generalization behavior on out-of-distribution inputs. Our results show that seemingly minor architectural differences provide strong inductive biases for task solutions, raising a question about which RNN architectures better align with mechanisms of task execution in biological networks.

">mTOR inhibition alleviated tau phosphorylation-induced mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                Aim: Hyperphosphorylated tau plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) directly interacts with the Tau protein at Ser214, Ser356 and Thr231 is not clear. This study aimed to investigate whether mTOR-regulated tau phosphorylation disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and function and whether rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, can modulate tau phosphorylation levels and attenuate AD-related alterations. Methods: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors were used to intracranially deliver the TauS214E/T231E/S356E (Tau3E) variant into 2-month-old C57BL/6 mice. The mice were intraperitoneally administered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin for one week, followed by assessment via the Morris water maze test. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry were employed to measure the expression levels of mTOR, p70S6K, and tau; mitochondrial dynamics; and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HT22 cells and a mouse model overexpressing Tau3E, as well as in postmortem brain tissues from AD patients. Results: p-mTORS2448 colocalized with p-TauSer214, p-TauSer356, and p-TauThr231 in the hippocampal CA3 region of AD patients. HT22 cells and C57BL/6 mice overexpressing Tau3E presented elevated levels of p-mTOR, downstream target p-p70S6K, and ROS production; mitochondrial fragmentation; and p-TauSer214, p-TauSer356, and p-TauThr231. Rapamycin treatment partially mitigated the cognitive and molecular alterations in Tau3E mice. Conclusion: This study revealed a causal link between Tau phosphorylation at Ser214, Ser356, and p-Thr231 and mTOR upregulation and downstream impairments in ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive function. Treatment using mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (i.p.) can alleviate impairment, reduce p-Tau and restore mitochondrial homeostasis, neuronal loss and cognitive impairment in mice.

">Separating three variability and noise sources in the response fluctuation of brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are among the few directly observable responses to suprathreshold brain stimulation and serve a variety of applications. If the MEP size is graphed over the stimulation strength, they form an input-output (IO), recruitment, or dose-response curve. Previous statistical models with two variability sources inherently consider the small MEPs at the low plateau as part of the neural recruitment properties. However, recent studies demonstrated that small MEP responses are contaminated and over-shadowed by background noise of mostly technical quality and suggested that the recruitment curve should continue below this noise level. This work intends to separate physiological variability from background noise and improve the description of recruitment behaviour. We developed a model with three variability sources and a logarithmic logistic function without a lower plateau. Compared to previous models, we incorporated an additional source for background noise from amplifiers, electrode impedance, and remote bioelectric activity, which form the obesrved low-side plateau. Compared to the dual-variability source modes, our approach better described IO characteristics, evidenced by lower Bayesian Information Criterion scores across all subjects and pulse shapes. The model independently extracted hidden variability information across the stimulated neural system and isolated it from background noise, which led to an accurate estimation of the IO curve parameters. This new model offers a robust tool to analyse brain stimulation IO curves in clinical and experimental neuroscience, reducing the risk of spurious results from inappropriate statistical methods. By providing a more accurate representation of MEP responses and variability sources, this approach advances our understanding of cortical excitability and may improve the assessment of neuromodulation effects.

">Visual speech enhances auditory onset timing and envelope tracking through distinct mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Seeing the face of a speaker facilitates speech recognition in challenging listening environments. Prior work has shown that visual speech contains timing information to aid auditory speech processing, yet how these signals are integrated within the auditory system during audiovisual speech perception remains poorly understood. Observation of preparatory mouth movements may initiate phase reset of intrinsic oscillations, potentially sensitizing the auditory system for receptive speech processing, while observation of mouth movements post speech onset may facilitate entrainment to the speech envelope. Yet, little work has been done to test whether visual speech enhances encoding of auditory speech onset, speech envelope tracking, or both, and through independent or overlapping mechanisms. To investigate this, we examined the ways in which visual speech timing information alters theta band power and phase using human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in a large group of patients with epilepsy (n = 21). Prior to speech onset, preparatory mouth movements elicited theta phase reset (increased inter-trial phase coherence; ITPC) throughout the superior temporal gyrus (STG), which is thought to enhance speech onset encoding. Following speech onset, visual speech modulated theta ITPC only at anterior STG electrodes while theta power was modulated at posterior STG electrodes. Pre- and post-speech onset were spatially and temporally dissociated, consistent with the hypothesis that audiovisual speech onset encoding and envelope tracking mechanisms are partially distinct. Crucially, congruent and incongruent visual speech, designed here to have identical visual timing information about speech onset time, but different visual mouth evolution, produced only a small difference in the phase of theta band oscillations in the anterior STG, highlighting a more restricted role of visual speech in ongoing auditory entrainment. These results support the hypothesis that visual speech improves the precision of auditory speech encoding through two separate mechanisms, with auditory speech onset encoded throughout the entire STG and ongoing speech envelope tracking within anterior STG.

">Global Neuron Shape Reasoning with Point Affinity Transformers</a></h4>

              
                Connectomics is a subfield of neuroscience that aims to map the brains intricate wiring diagram. Accurate neuron segmentation from microscopy volumes is essential for automating connectome reconstruction. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms use image-based convolutional neural networks that are limited to local neuron shape context. Thus, we introduce a new framework that reasons over global neuron shape with a novel point affinity transformer. Our framework embeds a (multi-)neuron point cloud into a fixed-length feature set from which we can decode any point pair affinities, enabling clustering neuron point clouds for automatic proofreading. We also show that the learned feature set can easily be mapped to a contrastive embedding space that enables neuron type classification using a simple KNN classifier. Our approach excels in two demanding connectomics tasks: proofreading segmentation errors and classifying neuron types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets derived from state-of-the-art connectomes, our method outperforms point transformers, graph neural networks, and unsupervised clustering baselines.

	<p>Objectives: Cerebral edema, a prevalent consequence of brain injury, is associated with significant mortality and disability. Timely diagnosis and monitoring are crucial for patient prognosis. There is a pressing clinical demand for a real-time, non-invasive cerebral edema monitoring method. Ultrasound methods are prime candidates for such investigations due to their non-invasive nature. Methods: Acute cerebral edema was introduced in rats by permanently occluding the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Ultrasonic echo signals were collected at nine time points over a 24 h period to extract features from both the time and frequency domains. Concurrently, histomorphological changes were examined. We utilized support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LogR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) algorithms for classifying cerebral edema types, and SVM, RF, linear regression (LR), and feedforward neural network (FNNs) for predicting the cerebral infarction volume ratio. Results: The integration of 16 ultrasonic features associated with cerebral edema development with the RF model enabled effective classification of cerebral edema types, with a high accuracy rate of 97.9%. Additionally, it provided an accurate prediction of the cerebral infarction volume ratio, with an R2 value of 0.8814. Conclusions: Our proposed strategy classifies cerebral edema and predicts the cerebral infarction volume ratio with satisfactory precision. The fusion of ultrasound echo features with machine learning presents a promising non-invasive approach for the monitoring of cerebral edema.</p>

	<p>Background: The role of non-linguistic factors, such as executive functions, in the reading comprehension process has been analyzed. The present research sought to investigate the relationship between executive functions and reading comprehension. Methods: In an exploratory cross-sectional study, a group of 89 fourth-grade students were evaluated, considering a balanced number of children with and without reading comprehension difficulties. Results: The results indicate that students with reading comprehension difficulties present a lowered profile with respect to both executive functions and reading variables. The path analysis indicates the presence of differences in the variables that explain reading comprehension for both groups. While in the case of students without reading comprehension difficulties, working memory has both a direct and an indirect effect, i.e., through vocabulary, on reading comprehension; in the case of children with reading comprehension difficulties, only cognitive flexibility has a direct impact. In both cases, inhibition has an indirect impact through vocabulary. Conclusions: We reflect on the differentiated role of executive functions according to the level of development of reading skills, highlighting the possibility that some skills may act in a compensatory manner in the presence of general difficulties. The role of vocabulary in the relationship between executive skills and reading is highlighted.</p>

                Background The selling of Jamu Gendong (an Indonesian traditional herbal medicine), is closely associated with the informal work of women who migrate to different regions. In Sukoharjo Regency and Wonogiri Regency, Central Java Province, the pressing need to meet household necessities in their places of origin compels women to assume the role of breadwinners. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the livelihood capital and resilience of migrant women selling jamu gendong. Methods The study was conducted in Ciamis Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia, in November 2022, using quantitative and qualitative methods. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample comprised 51 women selected through snowball sampling and actively involved in selling Jamu Gendong, along with six key individuals from relevant agencies. Results The research findings indicate that the households of migrant women who sell jamu gendong can survive and adapt during their migration to prevent poverty by implementing diverse livelihood strategies. They are the only ones who move without their family members renting a place to live with them. This research has identified various capital sources, including productive age and skills in preparing jamu gendong; physical capital, including road infrastructure, markets, and access to health and education facilities; and natural, social, and financial capital. This research provides an in-depth understanding of women’s roles in family economic resilience, diversification of life strategies, the importance of social capital in migrant networks, economic empowerment through migration, and the influence of cultural values on livelihood strategies. Conclusions The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the resilience demonstrated by migrant women selling jamu gendong. However, further research should be conducted in areas beyond the city center to obtain a holistic view of their resilience.

                Low-stakes assessments (LSAs) are widely used in medical education to promote continuous learning by providing formative feedback and minimizing the high-stress environment associated with high-stakes assessments. While LSAs are recognized for their role in supporting student learning, questions remain about their reliability and validity. This scoping review aims to systematically identify and synthesize existing literature on the reliability and validity of LSAs within medical education contexts. This study aims to map the methodologies used to establish psychometric parameters, identify problems, and offer best practices. The review will use the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, encompassing a comprehensive search across six academic databases and grey literature to identify relevant studies published from 2000 onward. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract data, using the Covidence tool for systematic screening and data extraction. Data will be analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide an overview of reliability and validity evidence for LSAs in medical education. Insights into motivational and psychometric theories, such as Self-Determination Theory, Classical Test Theory, and Generalizability Theory, that inform LSA design and implementation will be used to analyse the findings in this review. Expected outcomes include a detailed map of the literature on LSA reliability and validity, identification of key challenges, theoretical underpinnings and recommended strategies for improving LSA practices in medical education. Findings will inform future research and provide guidelines for optimizing the use of LSAs to enhance student learning outcomes, assessment integrity, and the educational experience in medical training.

                <p>Social status and dominance are critical factors influencing well-being and survival across multiple species. However, dominance behaviors vary widely across species, from elaborate feather displays in birds to aggression in chimps. To effectively study dominance, it is essential to clearly define and reliably measure dominance behaviors. In laboratory settings, C57BL/6 mice are commonly used to study dominance due to their stable and linear social hierarchies. However, other mouse strains are also used for laboratory research. Despite substantial evidence for strain effects on behavioral repertoires, the impact of strain on dominance in mice remains largely unstudied. To address this gap, we compared dominance behaviors between CD1 and C57BL/6 male mice across four assays: observation of agonistic behaviors, urine marking, tube test, and a reward competition. We found that CD1 mice demonstrate increased fighting, increased territorial marking through urination, and increased pushing and resisting in the tube test. We used unsupervised machine learning and pose estimation data from the reward competitions to uncover behavioral differences across strains and across rank differences between competing pairs. Of the four assays, urine marking and agonistic behaviors showed the strongest correlation with dominance in both strains. Most notably, we found that CD1 dominance rankings based on the tube test negatively correlated with rankings from all three other assays, suggesting that the tube test may measure a different behavior in CD1 mice. Our results highlight that behaviors can be strain-specific in mice and studies that measure social rank should consider assays carefully to promote reproducibility.</p>

                The co-infection of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) and hydatid disease is rare. Diagnosis and treatment of this co-infection may be challenging as both diseases present with overlapping clinical manifestations, especially in war zones where the health system is destroyed. We are reporting a 45-year-old female police officer transferred to Sinnar Sudan due to ongoing conflict. She was admitted with chronic cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. The preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary TB was made based on chest X-ray examination and sputum analysis. Further imaging showed cystic lesions in both the liver and the lungs, and thus a diagnosis of Echinococcosis was made. Surgical intervention was done successfully followed by the courses of Albendazole and anti-TB medication. The clinical condition of the patient improved, with the disappearance of all symptoms. This case represents the diagnostic dilemma of dual infections in the areas of their endemicity because of the symptomatology overlap that might occur and result in an erroneous diagnosis. It does demand an appropriate diagnostic approach, thus, with advanced imaging applications, and once more, emphasizes the interdisciplinary attitude in its treatment for the best possible result.

                Nigeria is located south of the Sahara and is confronted with rapid desertification, with severe impacts in northern Nigeria with signs of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southward of Nigeria. Therefore, this study assessed the rate of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southwards in Nigeria. The climate of Imo State was studied using Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET)data. The climatic variables studied were annual rainfall, maximum and minimum annual temperatures. The mean temperature was computed from the temperature data. Data from the 30-year period from 1987 to 2016 were used. The annual rainfall and temperature data were divided into three decades, from 1987 to 1996, 1997 to 2006, and 2007 to 2016, to study the variation in decades. Mean monthly variations were also studied. Land features were also assessed. Desert encroachment was assessed in the study area using the criteria for the evaluation of desertification status proposed by the FAO/UNEP (1984). The results revealed that annual rainfall in Owerri was highest in the first decade, with a mean of 2,526.2 mm and the lowest in the third decade, with a mean of 2,278.66 mm. This shows a drop in annual rainfall as the years progressed. The results also reveal that the annual rainfall totals in Imo State are reducing by 13.50 mm annually, indicating desert encroachment as evidenced in loss of vegetation and erosion menace. According to the FAO/UNEP (1984) rating of desertification, desert encroachment in the study area is rated as ‘moderate.’ The maximum temperature shows a mean of 32 °C for the first decade, 32.5 °C for the second decade, and 32.5 °C for the third decade. The mean annual temperature of Owerri was found to increase by 0.02 ° °C per annum. This shows the atmospheric warming of Imo State.

                Background Given the high prevalence of tobacco use, India presents a significant challenge in tobacco control. Yet, the support received for tobacco cessation is suboptimal. Hence, the aim of this narrative review was to identify and heuristically evaluate ‘high-quality’ and ‘engaging’ tobacco cessation mobile apps using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Also, to categorize and analyse their features with respect to engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. Methods A systematic search of tobacco cessation apps was done within app stores of prominent smartphone platforms developed by Apple and Android. The following search terms: ‘quit smoking,’ ‘smoking cessation, ‘stop smoking,’ ‘smoking therapy,’ ‘quit tobacco,’ ‘cigarette cessation,’ ‘cold turkey,’ and ‘quit cigarette.’ Pearson’s correlations were used to analyse correlations between app scores (Total score app-quality/mean score) and downloads/ratings and number of downloads with the overall MARS score. A Chi-square test was performed to analyse any association between app focus and app release dates. Results Total MARS scores ranged from 3.1 to 4.9. Quitsure app (4.9), Craving to Quit! app (4.8) and Stop Tobacco Mobile Trainer: Quit Smoking App (4.74) were ranked the highest according to the MARS overall mean score. Older apps focussed more on mere goal setting or substance use, as compared to behaviour change; whereas, recently developed apps are now focussing more on behaviour change. Conclusions The content and functionality of behaviour change-focused apps were of higher quality than those of other app categories. These recently developed mHealth apps can effectively supersede the traditional smoking cessation methods.

                This article explores the determinants of the consumption of geographical indication agricultural products through a ten-year systematic review. In recent years, the demand for healthier and safer products from consumers has been continuously increasing owing to the influence of the geographical indication of agricultural products. Geographical indication products, a type of label that associates food with specific regions, occupy a certain position in the global food market. This article aims to answer research questions about the determinants of the consumption of geographical indication agricultural products and provide a comparative analysis of five literature reviews related to this topic.

                Background A novel modality of cancer treatment based on exposure to non-contact electric fields has been developed to reduce cancer incidence. However, the safety of the electric field exposure was not fully investigated. Therefore, This study aimed to observe the safety of electric field exposure on kidney and liver structures. Methods Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into one control group and three treatment groups. Animals were treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene for mammary tumour induction and exposed to non-contact electric fields individually for 10 hours a day for three weeks. Fresh samples of the kidney and liver were collected for observation of structural damage in both organs. Both organs were prepared for histopathological cross-sectioning using the paraffin method and Hematoxylin and Eosin staining followed by histological scoring using the post-examination masking method. Results Damages found in the kidney were as follows: thickening of the Bowman capsule, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, cloudy swelling, epithelial sloughing, inflammation, haemorrhage, and congestion. In addition, the number of inflammation and haemorrhage in the kidney structure of healthy rats that were exposed to electric fields was significantly lower than that in the control group. All damages to the kidneys were also found in the liver, but each showed a different degree of damage. Exposure to this electric field can cause haemorrhagic damage to the livers of healthy rats, but not to rats with breast cancer. Conclusions Exposure to non-contact electric fields can cause haemorrhagic damage to the livers of healthy rats, however, in other liver tissues and the kidneys, exposure to this electric field was safe. It can even decrease the number of inflammations and haemorrhages in the kidneys.

                Background There have been significant changes in the lifestyles of individuals in the past few decades, which has led to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Both smoking and chewing forms of tobacco are highly prevalent, especially in India, and are implicated as causes of diseases, including oropharyngeal carcinomas. Effective tobacco cessation techniques and sources can help overcome addiction and reduce the disease burden in society. The aim was to evaluate the quality and readability of contents of various sources on an internet website about tobacco cessation. Objectives i) To evaluate the readability of internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests and the quality of internet content (Google) by using the JAMA benchmark, HONcode and DISCERN questionnaire. Methods A content review was employed to screen the content of the Google search engine for educational tobacco cessation websites, and the top 50 websites were selected according to criteria and reviewed by two reviewers. The readability of the internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation was evaluated using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. The quality of the screened sites was evaluated by using the JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) benchmark, HONcode (The Health on the Net Code of Conduct) and DISCERN (Discerning the Quality of Information for Choosing Treatments) questionnaire, and the readability and quality of the screened websites were correlated using the above instruments. Results FK readability ease was found to be 49% standard and 30% easy. The FK grade test found that 33% of the content could be easily understood by < 5th grade. All 4 JAMA benchmarks were met by 23% of websites, and authorship was the least fulfilled criterion. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between FK ease score and FK grade score. Conclusions The Read-ability Ease and Read-ability Grade Levels of the websites related to tobacco cessation were not standard, and few websites fulfilled the JAMA benchmarks and had HONcode certification.

                <p>by Shuanger Li, Davorka Gulisija, Oana Carja</p>

Coexistence of multiple strains of a pathogen in a host population can present significant challenges to vaccine development or treatment efficacy. Here we discuss a novel mechanism that can increase rates of long-lived strain polymorphism, rooted in the presence of social structure in a host population. We show that social preference of interaction, in conjunction with differences in immunity between host subgroups, can exert varying selection pressure on pathogen strains, creating a balancing mechanism that supports stable viral coexistence, independent of other known mechanisms. We use population genetic models to study rates of pathogen heterozygosity as a function of population size, host population composition, mutant strain fitness differences and host social preferences of interaction. We also show that even small periodic epochs of host population stratification can lead to elevated strain coexistence. These results are robust to varying social preferences of interaction, overall differences in strain fitnesses, and spatial heterogeneity in host population composition. Our results highlight the role of host population social stratification in increasing rates of pathogen strain diversity, with effects that should be considered when designing policies or treatments with a long-term view of curbing pathogen evolution.

                <p>by Anush Devadhasan, Oren Kolodny, Oana Carja</p>

Many evolving ecosystems have spatial structures that can be conceptualized as networks, with nodes representing individuals or homogeneous subpopulations and links the patterns of spread between them. Prior models of evolution on networks do not take ecological niche differences and eco-evolutionary interplay into account. Here, we combine a resource competition model with evolutionary graph theory to study how heterogeneous topological structure shapes evolutionary dynamics under global frequency-dependent ecological interactions. We find that the addition of ecological competition for resources can produce a reversal of roles between amplifier and suppressor networks for deleterious mutants entering the population. We show that this effect is a nonlinear function of ecological niche overlap and discuss intuition for the observed dynamics using simulations and analytical approximations. We use these theoretical results together with spatial representations from imaging data to show that, for ductal carcinoma, where tumor growth is highly spatially constrained, with cells confined to a tree-like network of ducts, the topological structure can lead to higher rates of deleterious mutant hitchhiking with metabolic driver mutations, compared to tumors characterized by different spatial topologies.

CD74 is a cell-surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF binding to CD74 induces a signaling cascade resulting in the release of its cytosolic intracellular domain (CD74-ICD), which regulates transcription in naïve B and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of CD74 in the regulation of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and is characterized by massive infiltration of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment, making this tumor a good candidate for immunotherapy. The tumor and immune cells in TNBC express high levels of CD74; however, the function of this receptor in the tumor environment has not been extensively characterized. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) and tolerogenic dendritic cells) tol-DCs (were previously shown to attenuate the antitumor immune response in TNBC. Here, we demonstrate that CD74 enhances tumor growth by inducing the expansion of tumor-infiltrating tol-DCs and Bregs. Utilizing CD74-KO mice, Cre-flox mice lacking CD74 in CD23<sup>+</sup> mature B cells, mice lacking CD74 in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> population, and a CD74 inhibitor (DRQ), we elucidate the mechanism by which CD74 inhibits antitumor immunity. MIF secreted from the tumor cells activates CD74 expressed on DCs. This activation induces the binding of CD74-ICD to the SP1 promotor, resulting in the up-regulation of SP1 expression. SP1 binds the IL-1β promotor, leading to the down-regulation of its transcription. The reduced levels of IL-1β lead to decreased antitumor activity by allowing expansion of the tol-DC, which induces the expansion of the Breg population, supporting the cross-talk between these 2 populations. Taken together, these results suggest that CD74<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs are the dominant cell type involved in the regulation of TNBC progression. These findings indicate that CD74 might serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cholinergic projection neurons of the nucleus basalis and substantia innominata (NBM/SI) densely innervate the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and have been shown to contribute to the encoding of fundamental and life-threatening experiences. Given the vital importance of these circuits in the acquisition and retention of memories that are essential for survival in a changing environment, it is not surprising that the basic anatomical organization of the NBM/SI is well conserved across animal classes as diverse as teleost and mammal. What is not known is the extent to which the physiology and morphology of NBM/SI neurons have also been conserved. To address this issue, we made patch-clamp recordings from NBM/SI neurons in ex vivo slices of two widely divergent mammalian species, mouse and rhesus macaque, focusing our efforts on cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA. We then reconstructed most of these recorded neurons post hoc to characterize neuronal morphology. We found that rhesus macaque BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons were both more intrinsically excitable and less morphologically compact than their mouse homologs. Combining measurements of 18 physiological features and 13 morphological features, we illustrate the extent of the separation. Although macaque and mouse neurons both exhibited considerable within-group diversity and overlapped with each other on multiple individual metrics, a combined morphoelectric analysis demonstrates that they form two distinct neuronal classes. Given the shared purpose of the circuits in which these neurons participate, this finding raises questions about (and offers constraints on) how these distinct classes result in similar behavior.</p>

                Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished in intensity, the virus continues to circulate globally. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a key enzyme in the life cycle of the virus, making it important for the development of treatments against future variants of the virus. In this work, Peruvian natural compounds were evaluated against different mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Methods In silico techniques such as virtual screening, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and energy estimation analysis were applied. Results Of the tested compounds by virtual screening, rutin was identified as the best binding agent against the different proposed Mpro mutations. In addition, computational simulations and energy estimation analysis demonstrated the high structural and energetic stability between the Mpro-rutin systems. Conclusions Overall, our study identified rutin as the most promising compound with a strong affinity for various Mpro mutations, potentially playing a key role in the development of new treatments for emerging viral variants.

                Background The provision of effective musculoskeletal physiotherapy and treatment outcomes are challenged by the shortage of resources, limitations in adherence to clinical guidelines, and client unacceptability. This study aims to evaluate the process quality of musculoskeletal physiotherapy service in the physiotherapy department of Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Mekelle, Ethiopia, 2020. Method This is a health facility-based single-embedded case study design that involves both quantitative and qualitative methods to describe the service using a three dimensions assessment for quality service evaluation (compliance of the unit, technical compliance, and service acceptability). The quantitative data was collected through document review and observation of the musculoskeletal physiotherapy unit, direct observations of 20 client-physiotherapist interactions, and chart review on systematically selected 172 client charts. For qualitative data; in-depth interviews with five Key informants and 21 clients were conducted. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS v.25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was done and data were presented using frequency and percentage. The calculated outputs were used to judge the overall service against the predetermined criteria (i.e. Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor). Results The compliance of the musculoskeletal physiotherapy unit, service providers’ technical compliance, and service acceptability by the users were judged poor (56.1%), fair (60.1%), and good (73.1%) respectively. The compliance of physiotherapists in recording patient information was concerningly poor (30.2%). The majority of clients were satisfied with the service and adhered to their treatment. Conclusion & recommendation The overall service process quality of physiotherapy service was judged as fair (62.55%). However, the assessed dimensions were not as per the expected standard. Therefore, the relevant stakeholders are recommended to improve the service provision gaps.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27128?af=R">Neurologic Manifestations of Long COVID Disproportionately Affect Young and Middle‐Age Adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) in post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients across the adult lifespan.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional study of the first consecutive 200 PNP and 1,100 NNP patients evaluated at a Neuro-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinic between May 2020 and March 2023. Patients were divided into younger (18–44 years), middle-age (45–64 years), and older (65+ years) age groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals accounted for 142 of 200 (71%) of PNP and 995 of 1100 (90.5%) of NNP patients. Significant age-related differences in the frequencies of comorbidities and abnormal neurologic findings demonstrated higher prevalence in older patients. Conversely, 10 months from COVID-19 onset, we found significant age-related differences in Neuro-PASC symptoms indicating lower prevalence, and therefore, symptom burden, in older individuals. Moreover, there were significant age-related differences in subjective impression of fatigue (median [interquartile range (IQR)] patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] score: younger 64 [57–69], middle-age 63 [57–68], older 60.5 [50.8–68.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (median [IQR] PROMIS score: younger 57 [51–63], middle-age 56 [53–63], older 54 [46.8–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.002) in the NNP group, commensurate with higher impairment in quality of life (QoL) among younger patients. Finally, there were significant age-related differences in objective executive function (median [IQR] National Institutes of Health [NIH] toolbox score: younger 48 [35–63], middle-age 49 [38–63], older 54.5 [45–66.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.01), and working memory (median [IQR] NIH toolbox score: younger 47 [40–53], middle-age 50 [44–57], older 48 [43–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.0002) in NNP patients, with the worst performance coming from the younger group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals are disproportionally affected by Neuro-PASC regardless of acute COVID-19 severity. Although older people more frequently have abnormal neurologic findings and comorbidities, younger and middle-age patients suffer from a higher burden of Neuro-PASC symptoms and cognitive dysfunction contributing to decreased QoL. Neuro-PASC principally affects adults in their prime, contributing to profound public health and socioeconomic impacts warranting dedicated resources for prevention, diagnosis and interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87083">Switching of RNA splicing regulators in immature neuroblasts during adult neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The lateral wall of the mouse subventricular zone harbors neural stem cells (NSC, B cells) which generate proliferating transient-amplifying progenitors (TAP, C cells) that ultimately give rise to neuroblasts (NB, A cells). Molecular profiling at the single-cell level struggles to distinguish these different cell types. Here, we combined transcriptome analyses of FACS-sorted cells and single-cell RNAseq to demonstrate the existence of an abundant, clonogenic and multipotent population of immature neuroblasts (iNB cells) at the transition between TAP and migrating NB (mNB). iNB are reversibly engaged in neuronal differentiation. Indeed, they keep molecular features of both undifferentiated progenitors, plasticity and unexpected regenerative properties. Strikingly, they undergo important progressive molecular switches, including changes in the expression of splicing regulators leading to their differentiation in mNB subdividing them into two subtypes, iNB1 and iNB2. Due to their plastic properties, iNB could represent a new target for regenerative therapy of brain damage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98716">Spatial and temporal coordination of Duox/TrpA1/Dh31 and IMD pathways is required for the efficient elimination of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine of Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Multiple gut antimicrobial mechanisms are coordinated in space and time to efficiently fight foodborne pathogens. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) together with intestinal cell renewal play a key role in eliminating gut microbes. A complementary mechanism would be to isolate and treat pathogenic bacteria while allowing colonization by commensals. Using real-time imaging to follow the fate of ingested bacteria, we demonstrate that while commensal <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> freely circulate within the intestinal lumen, pathogenic strains such as <i>Erwinia carotovora</i> or <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>, are blocked in the anterior midgut where they are rapidly eliminated by antimicrobial peptides. This sequestration of pathogenic bacteria in the anterior midgut requires the Duox enzyme in enterocytes, and both TrpA1 and Dh31 in enteroendocrine cells. Supplementing larval food with hCGRP, the human homolog of Dh31, is sufficient to block the bacteria, suggesting the existence of a conserved mechanism. While the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is essential for eliminating the trapped bacteria, it is dispensable for the blockage. Genetic manipulations impairing bacterial compartmentalization result in abnormal colonization of posterior midgut regions by pathogenic bacteria. Despite a functional IMD pathway, this ectopic colonization leads to bacterial proliferation and larval death, demonstrating the critical role of bacteria anterior sequestration in larval defense. Our study reveals a temporal orchestration during which pathogenic bacteria, but not innocuous, are confined in the anterior part of the midgut in which they are eliminated in an IMD-pathway-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96353">Spatiotemporal recruitment of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP8 directs endosome maturation</a></h4>

              
                The spatiotemporal transition of small GTPase Rab5 to Rab7 is crucial for early-to-late endosome maturation, yet the precise mechanism governing Rab5-to-Rab7 switching remains elusive. USP8, a ubiquitin-specific protease, plays a prominent role in the endosomal sorting of a wide range of transmembrane receptors and is a promising target in cancer therapy. Here, we identified that USP8 is recruited to Rab5-positive carriers by Rabex5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5. The recruitment of USP8 dissociates Rabex5 from early endosomes (EEs) and meanwhile promotes the recruitment of the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1. In USP8-deficient cells, the level of active Rab5 is increased, while the Rab7 signal is decreased. As a result, enlarged EEs with abundant intraluminal vesicles accumulate and digestive lysosomes are rudimentary. Together, our results reveal an important and unexpected role of a deubiquitinating enzyme in endosome maturation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97665">T-follicular helper cells are epigenetically poised to transdifferentiate into T-regulatory type 1 cells</a></h4>

              
                Chronic antigenic stimulation can trigger the formation of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-producing T-regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells in vivo. We have recently shown that murine T-follicular helper (TFH) cells are precursors of TR1 cells and that the TFH-to-TR1 cell transdifferentiation process is characterized by the progressive loss and acquisition of opposing transcription factor gene expression programs that evolve through at least one transitional cell stage. Here, we use a broad range of bulk and single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic tools to investigate the epigenetic underpinnings of this process. At the single-cell level, the TFH-to-TR1 cell transition is accompanied by both, downregulation of TFH cell-specific gene expression due to loss of chromatin accessibility, and upregulation of TR1 cell-specific genes linked to chromatin regions that remain accessible throughout the transdifferentiation process, with minimal generation of new open chromatin regions. By interrogating the epigenetic status of accessible TR1 genes on purified TFH and conventional T-cells, we find that most of these genes, including <i>Il10</i>, are already poised for expression at the TFH cell stage. Whereas these genes are closed and hypermethylated in Tconv cells, they are accessible, hypomethylated, and enriched for H3K27ac-marked and hypomethylated active enhancers in TFH cells. These enhancers are enriched for binding sites for the TFH and TR1-associated transcription factors TOX-2, IRF4, and c-MAF. Together, these data suggest that the TR1 gene expression program is genetically imprinted at the TFH cell stage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94689">Automated workflow for the cell cycle analysis of (non-)adherent cells using a machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, non-adherent cells remain challenging. In this study, we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI(CA)2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells.

                In most murine species, spermatozoa exhibit a falciform apical hook at the head end. The function of the sperm hook is not yet clearly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of the sperm hook in the migration of spermatozoa through the female reproductive tract in <i>Mus musculus</i> (C57BL/6), using a deep tissue imaging custom-built two-photon microscope. Through live reproductive tract imaging, we found evidence indicating that the sperm hook aids in the attachment of spermatozoa to the epithelium and facilitates interactions between spermatozoa and the epithelium during migration in the uterus and oviduct. We also observed synchronized sperm beating, which resulted from the spontaneous unidirectional rearrangement of spermatozoa in the uterus. Based on live imaging of spermatozoa-epithelium interaction dynamics, we propose that the sperm hook plays a crucial role in successful migration through the female reproductive tract by providing anchor-like mechanical support and facilitating interactions between spermatozoa and the female reproductive tract in the house mouse.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous interoception research has demonstrated that sensory processing is reduced during cardiac systole, an effect associated with diminished cortical excitability, possibly due to heightened baroreceptor activity. This study aims to determine how phases of the cardiac cycle—systole and diastole—modulate neural sensorimotor activity during motor imagery (MI) and motor execution (ME). We hypothesised that MI performance, indexed by enhanced suppression of contralateral sensorimotor alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (14–30 Hz) activity, would be modulated by the cardiac phases, with improved performance during diastole due to enhanced sensory processing of movement cues. Additionally, we investigated whether movement cues during systole or diastole enhance muscle activity. To test these hypotheses, 29 participants were instructed to perform or imagine thumb abductions, while we recorded their electroencephalography, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram (EMG) activity. We show that imaginary movements instructed during diastole lead to more pronounced suppression of alpha and beta activity in contralateral sensorimotor cortices, with no significant cardiac timing effects observed during ME as confirmed by circular statistics. Additionally, diastole was associated with significantly increased EMG on the side of actual and, to a lesser degree, imagined movements. Our study identifies optimal cardiac phases for MI performance, suggesting potential pathways to enhance MI-based assistive technologies.</span>

While SCS is well documented for conditions like failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), its effectiveness in managing pain related to spinal cord injuries (SCI) is less studied. This study aims to assess the efficacy of SCS in alleviating SCI-related pain and improving patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life, filling a gap in the existing literature. Methods: This cohort study included 15 adult patients with traumatic and non-traumatic SCIs, treated between 2016 and 2022. Patients received SCS implants after either a trial or direct implantation. Pain levels were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) scores, while quality of life was evaluated using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) scale. The SCS devices were implanted at different spinal levels, with various stimulation protocols applied, including high-frequency stimulation (10 kHz). Results: In patients with traumatic SCI, the mean VAS score decreased from 8.6 to 4.5, with 71% reporting more than 50% pain relief. Non-traumatic SCI patients experienced a reduction from 8.5 to 2.5, with all showing more than 50% pain relief. EQ-5D scores improved in both groups. A 49% reduction in pain medication usage was also observed, though one patient required revision surgery due to an adverse event. Conclusions: SCS significantly reduces pain and improves quality of life for SCI patients, particularly with high-frequency protocols. While promising, further research is needed to optimize patient selection and stimulation parameters for better long-term outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: As a form of visual input, bodily expressions can be maintained and manipulated in visual working memory (VWM) over a short period of time. While the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an indispensable role in top-down control, it remains largely unclear whether this region also modulates the VWM storage of bodily expressions during a delay period. Therefore, the two primary goals of this study were to examine whether the emotional bodies would elicit heightened brain activity among areas such as the PFC and extrastriate body area (EBA) and whether the emotional effects subsequently modulate the functional connectivity patterns for active maintenance during delay periods. Methods: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, participants performed a delayed-response task in which they were instructed to view and maintain a body stimulus in working memory before emotion categorization (happiness, anger, and neutral). If processing happy and angry bodies consume increased cognitive demands, stronger PFC activation and its functional connectivity with perceptual areas would be observed. Results: Results based on univariate and multivariate analyses conducted on the data collected during stimulus presentation revealed an enhanced processing of the left PFC and left EBA. Importantly, subsequent functional connectivity analyses performed on delayed-period data using a psychophysiological interaction model indicated that functional connectivity between the PFC and EBA increases for happy and angry bodies compared to neutral bodies. Conclusions: The emotion-modulated coupling between the PFC and EBA during maintenance deepens our understanding of the functional organization underlying the VWM processing of bodily information.</p>

	<p>Creativity and the production of artwork can have an impact on the course and treatment of comorbid severe mental illness and neurodegeneration. We report on a 70-year-old male patient with highly original artistic behavior, who suffered from lifelong recurrent major depression and subsequently developed symptoms of progressive bulbar palsy (PBP). In the context of a systematic literature review, we detail the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s personal and artistic biographies and portray artwork from his artistic portfolio together with his disease history, clinical examination, psychopathological and neuropsychological evaluations, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, neuroimaging, neurophysiological testing, and psychotherapeutic treatment. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s 1&amp;amp;ndash;2-year history of primarily bulbar motor symptoms and signs aligned with electromyography, showing widespread signs of continuing denervation/chronic neurogenic changes. Slight impairments in semantic fluency, executive control, and visuoconstructive abilities were observed in neuropsychological testing, in conjunction with right-sided medial temporal lobe atrophy in an MRI. He was prescribed medication, including extended-release venlafaxine, trazodone, pramipexole, and zolpidem, and took his medication regularly, usually at high doses. For most of his life, the patient had attributed professional &amp;amp;ldquo;success&amp;amp;rdquo; and artistic output to, at times, excessive alcohol consumption. Later, however, his interest in creative work continued despite alcohol reduction and cessation. Psychotherapy grounded him in reality via goal-centered behaviors, making him realize that his physical and mental ailments rather hindered his creative output. In summary, creative behavior can be utilized in the treatment of patients with psychiatric conditions (affective or addictive disorders) and/or neurodegenerative diseases. In the reported case, specific psychopharmacology and psychotherapy that address goal-directed self-efficacy experiences of reality were critical to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: The link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) and the complexity of their differential diagnosis has been vastly investigated. Growing attention has been paid to the presence of problematic Internet use (PIU) in autistic individuals. Studies assessing OCD traits in autistic individuals are scarce and even less take into account the role that this overlap may have on the development and maintenance of PIU. We aimed to investigate OCD features in ASD individuals and their association with autism severity and the prevalence of PIU, and the potential dimensions associated with a greater probability of PIU. Methods: a total of 46 participants with ASD and 53 controls were assessed with the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum questionnaire and the Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Spectrum&amp;amp;mdash;Short Version. Results: There were significantly higher OCD features in ASD participants along with important correlations between OCD and ASD dimensions and a higher prevalence of PIU in the ASD group. Participants with putative PIU reported greater scores on some ASD and OCD dimensions, the with Doubt and Non-verbal communication domains emerging as significant predictors of the presence of putative PIU. Conclusions: These results support the three-way link between ASD, OCD, and PIU, contributing to the hypothesis of a neurodevelopmental basis for those conditions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prematurely born individuals are at risk for developing socio-emotional difficulties and psychopathologies such as autism spectrum disorder. Particular difficulties processing social information conveyed by the face may underlie these vulnerabilities. Methods: This comprehensive review provides an overview of 27 studies published between 2000 and mid-2022 concerning face processing in individuals born preterm and/or born with low birth weight across different age ranges, paradigms, and outcome measures. The results were interpreted across different developmental stages. Results: Behavioural studies indicated that prematurity is associated with poorer facial identity and expression processing compared to term-born controls, especially for negative emotions. Structural alterations and delayed maturation in key neural face processing structures could explain these findings. Neuroimaging also revealed functional atypicalities, which may either be rooted in the structural alterations or may partly compensate for the delayed maturation. Conclusions: The results suggest that altered face processing may be associated with an increased risk of developing psychopathologies in individuals born prematurely. Future studies should investigate the preterm behavioural phenotype and the potential need for face processing rehabilitation programs.</p>

	<p>Objectives: The present open-label multicenter pilot study sought to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of rimegepant in treating migraine attacks. Methods: The primary endpoint was pain freedom at two hours post-dose, while the co-primary efficacy endpoints included a reduction in the headache intensity and freedom from the most bothersome symptoms (MBS) associated with migraine at the same time point. To test the potential efficacy of rimegepant, patients were asked to record in a questionnaire all the relevant changes with each migraine attack treated with rimegepant at two hours post-dose vs. two hours before. The attending neurologists provided information on the basic demographics, medical anamnesis, and migraine history as well as the triptan use history. Results: A total of 54 patients (32 with episodic and 22 with chronic migraine) received rimegepant 75 mg at least once during a single migraine attack (overall, 140 dosage intakes). Pain freedom at 2 h was achieved in 45/140 (32.1%) intakes. Regarding the efficacy of the first rimegepant dose (n = 54), significant reductions in the headache intensity were observed between the pre- and 2 h post-treatment average VAS scores (&amp;amp;minus;4.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8 mean; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Likewise, the same mean reductions in the average VAS scores occurred when the 2 h response to all 140 doses was analyzed (&amp;amp;minus;5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Freedom from MBS at 2 h post-dose was achieved for photophobia in 43%, for phonophobia in 53%, and for nausea in 57%. The ability to fully return to everyday activities at 2 h post-dose was achieved in 83/140 instances (59%). We only recorded mild adverse events in 24/140 dosages. Conclusions: Our preliminary results demonstrate that rimegepant is effective, safe, and well tolerated in treating acute migraine attacks.</p>

	<p>Background: Educational professionals face significant challenges in determining the most appropriate educational placement for each child with ASD, which is a major concern for their parents. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors in the development of students with ASD (language development, cognitive development, and socio-emotional development) that are most relevant in determining the modalities of schooling in early childhood education. Methods: A total of 381 Psychopedagogical Evaluation Reports from students with ASD aged 3 to 5 years were reviewed. The importance of each variable was identified using artificial neural network analysis. Classification trees were used to determine their distribution in the two schooling modalities. Results: A total of 42.9% of boys aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years with ASD and 54.12% of girls aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years with ASD were enrolled in specific modalities. Conclusions: Cognitive development and comprehensive language were the two variables that best explained whether children with ASD were educated in specific or ordinary modalities. The presence of a significantly impaired level of cognitive development was the best predictor of schooling in specific modalities, and for the rest of the cognitive levels, the greater the difficulties in comprehensive language, the greater the likelihood of schooling in specific modalities.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Studies have shown that emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) multimodal physiological signals exhibits superior performance compared to that of unimodal approaches. Nonetheless, there remains a paucity of in-depth investigations analyzing the inherent relationship between EEG and fNIRS and constructing brain networks to improve the performance of emotion recognition. Methods: In this study, we introduce an innovative method to construct hybrid brain networks in the source space based on simultaneous EEG-fNIRS signals for emotion recognition. Specifically, we perform source localization on EEG signals to derive the EEG source signals. Subsequently, causal brain networks are established in the source space by analyzing the Granger causality between the EEG source signals, while coupled brain networks in the source space are formed by assessing the coupling strength between the EEG source signals and the fNIRS signals. The resultant causal brain networks and coupled brain networks are integrated to create hybrid brain networks in the source space, which serve as features for emotion recognition. Results: The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated on multiple emotion datasets. The experimental results indicate that the recognition performance of our approach significantly surpasses that of the baseline method. Conclusions: This work offers a novel perspective on the fusion of EEG and fNIRS signals in an emotion-evoked experimental paradigm and provides a feasible solution for enhancing emotion recognition performance.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (NSCNP) exhibit sensorimotor disturbances, with proprioception impairment considered an important aspect. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a novel inertial sensor-based electrogoniometer (KFORCE Sens&amp;amp;reg;) for cervical spine (CS) proprioception measurement in patients with NSCNP. Methods: The within-day intra-rater reliability of CS proprioception and its association with patient demographics and clinical status were examined in fifty-nine patients with NSCNP, aged between 25&amp;amp;ndash;65 years, recruited from primary care. CS proprioception was examined via angle reproduction, in angles set mid-range in the available CS range of motion (ROM) in each motion direction. The clinical status evaluation comprised the maximum and average pain intensity in the last week, disability, fear of movement/re-injury, catastrophizing, neck awareness, and CS-ROM. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1), standard error of the measurement (SEM), and minimum detectable change (MDC95%). Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s R assessed between-measures associations. Results: CS proprioception reliability was good (ICC2,1 = 0.75&amp;amp;ndash;0.89), with low measurement error (SEM = 1.38&amp;amp;ndash;3.02&amp;amp;deg; and MDC95% = 3.83&amp;amp;ndash;8.38&amp;amp;deg;). Correlations between participants&amp;amp;rsquo; CS proprioception and their clinical status or demographics were not significant. Conclusions: The reliability of CS proprioception assessment with the KFORCE Sens&amp;amp;reg; was good in a sample of mildly to moderately disabled patients with CNP and thus deemed suitable for further research in this field.</p>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                Background The impact and changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis affect the patient’s fulfilment and quality of life. Objective This study aims to thoroughly investigate the experiences of end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This research uses a qualitative descriptive approach with in-depth interview methods. Participants numbered 15 people from Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital and Hasanuddin University Hospital, which were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Result There are three themes produced in this research: 1) various responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) various impacts, and 3) coping mechanisms developed. Conclusion These findings indicate that patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo hemodialysis have attempted to build adaptive coping strategies in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they still need support from healthcare providers in the hemodialysis unit to overcome various problems and impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Hemodialysis nurses are expected to be able to carry out holistic assessments and continuous evaluation in order to provide comprehensive nursing care to meet patient needs for hemodialysis in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1403/v1?src=rss">Mental health status of caregivers of cancer patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The global prevalence of cancer is rapidly increasing, and patients often require ancillary non-clinical care during treatment. Caregivers, in turn, experience several mental health challenges as they fulfil their responsibilities. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among caregivers of cancer patients at a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar; and explore the psychosocial factors contributing to their mental health. Methods For objective 1, a cross-sectional study design was employed to collect data from 230 caregivers accompanying cancer patients who attended a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha during February-April 2024. A licensed version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate the levels of anxiety and depression, while the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used to assess stress. For objective 2, ten in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers, then recorded, transcribed and translated for thematic analysis. Results The prevalence of anxiety, depression and perceived stress among caregivers was found to be 45.2%, 43.4% and 44.8%, respectively. ‘Being the sole caregiver’ was identified as a significant predictor of caregivers’ mental health, affecting levels of depression, stress, and anxiety. Further, qualitative analysis identified factors like social support, financial hardships, emotional toll, personal wellbeing, communication with healthcare provider and transportation as key contributors to caregivers’ mental health decline. Conclusion Caregivers of cancer patients face significant mental health challenges that need focused attention. Integrating informal social networks, counselling services, creating support groups and offering financial assistance into cancer care programs can help address their needs.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                <p>Neuroinflammation can lead to chronic maladaptive pain affecting millions of people worldwide. Neurotransmitters, cytokines, and ion channels are implicated in neuroimmune cell signaling, but their roles in specific behavioral responses are not fully elucidated. Voltage-gated Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity in skin controls rapid and transient heat hypersensitivity induced by intradermal (i.d.) capsaicin via IL-1a cytokine signaling. Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are not, however, involved in mechanical hypersensitivity that developed in the i.d. capsaicin animal model. Here, we show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are also critical for heat hypersensitivity induced by i.d. complete Freund adjuvant (CFA). i.d. CFA, a model of chronic neuroinflammation, involves ongoing cytokine signaling for days leading to pronounced edema and hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli. Peripheral Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity in the skin was required for the full development and week-long time course of heat hypersensitivity induced by i.d. CFA, but paw edema and mechanical hypersensitivity were independent of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity. CFA induced increases in several cytokines in hindpaw fluid including IL-6 which was also dependent on Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity. Using IL-6&ndash;specific neutralizing antibodies in vivo, we show that IL-6 contributes to heat hypersensitivity and that neutralizing both IL-1a and IL-6 was even more effective at reducing the magnitude and duration of CFA-induced heat hypersensitivity. Our findings demonstrate a functional link between Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity and the release of IL-6 in the skin and show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels have a privileged role in the induction and maintenance of heat hypersensitivity during chronic forms of neuroinflammation in the skin.</p>

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) approach is considered as one of the minimally invasive interventions. The success of restoration depends on various clinical factors like material, patient and operator factor. Conjoint analysis is a technique for measuring individual’s preference structures via systematical variations of products attributes in an experimental design. Aim Assess Pedodontists’ perception of non-clinical factors and investigate influence of child’s age, level of cooperation and vulnerability status on their decisions to perform Atraumatic Restorative Approach (ART) approach using hypothetical patient scenario’s and conjoint design. Materials and methods A cross-sectional exploratory survey using a web-based questionnaire was performed among Pedodontists registered as life members under Indian Association of Pedodontic and Preventive Dentistry. Self-designed structured scenario-based questionnaire was prepared and validated. Three non-clinical factors Age of child, Cooperation level and Vulnerability status were considered. Using orthogonal design, SPSS software nine profiles were created randomly along with two holdouts. Final study proforma consisted of three sections with description of eleven clinical scenarios. It was administered to participants using Google forms. Using SPSS conjoint software relative utilities for each factor on decision for using ART was estimated. Results Four hundred and thirty-two pedodontists had completed the survey (35.9%). Pedodontists considered vulnerability status of the child as the most important factor for their decision to use ART treatment. For the vulnerability status, the factor vulnerable had the greatest utility (-0.364) compared to non-vulnerable factor (0.364). For cooperation level, factor uncooperative had greater utility (-0.343), as compared to moderately cooperative (0.066) and uncooperative (0.277). For the age factor, the age of 4 years had the greatest utility (-0.175) compared with age 6 (-0.013) and age 12 (0.19). Conclusion The most preferred scenario by pedodontists to consider ART as treatment of choice was child belonging to vulnerable section, being very young and uncooperative.

                Consumer satisfaction is an outcome of business marketing activities, bridging the buying and usage phases with subsequent consequences such as attitude changes, recurring purchases, and brand loyalty. Most studies have utilized variations of the disconfirmation paradigm, which posits that satisfaction is influenced by the degree and type of disconfirmation experienced and initial expectations. Despite the importance of satisfaction, there remains a paucity of evidence on the cause and effect leading to expectation-confirmation and disconfirmation paradigm. This paper explores the reasons and the key factors in the perspectives of the relevant literature and aims to identify the intention of confirmation and disconfirmation in satisfaction theories. This conceptual paper also suggests various critical analyses based on the arguments for and against the paradigm in customer satisfaction. Consequently, the paper seeks to examine existing gaps in the literature regarding customer satisfaction theories for business sustainability and decision making, which may need to be more concise in the satisfaction generation process.

                Background Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly morbid disease. Chemotherapy for NSCLC lacks specificity and efficacy mainly because of drug resistance. The current study aimed to explore computational tools to target allosteric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sites and screen for the top molecules in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. Methods Molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamic studies revealed that acenocoumarol and silodosin are the top two allosteric EGFR inhibitors. They were further tested for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle, and gene expression by qPCR, western blotting, A549 cell xenograft anti-proliferative activity, and tumor regression efficacy analysis. Results Acenocoumarol and silodosin exhibited cytotoxicity in A549 and IMR-90 cells at concentrations below 50 and 80 μM, respectively. Acenocoumarol and silodosin induced S-phase and G2/M-phase arrest in A549 cells in the cell cycle analysis. Both drugs showed early apoptosis at their IC50 doses (acenocoumarol 50 μM and silodosin 25 μM). KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) gene regulation in A549 cells was confirmed using qPCR. KRAS and ERK2 activities were quantified by western blot analysis. In the xenograft study, tumor size, body weight, and organ weight were significantly attenuated by the test drugs compared with the standard cisplatin. Immunoblotting and western blot results of the A549-xenograft tissue indicated downregulation of KRAS and ERK2. Furthermore, the test drugs have upregulated caspase-3 gene expression. Conclusion The drugs acenocoumarol and silodosin downregulate KRAS and ERK2 both in cell line and in Xenograft model. KRAS and ERK2 are associated with EGFR inhibition. Hence, acenocoumarol and silodosin can be further explored for repurposing studies in human trials.

                <p>by Wyatt G. Madden, Wei Jin, Benjamin Lopman, Andreas Zufle, Benjamin Dalziel, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Bryan T. Grenfell, Max S. Y. Lau</p>

Measles is an important infectious disease system both for its burden on public health and as an opportunity for studying nonlinear spatio-temporal disease dynamics. Traditional mechanistic models often struggle to fully capture the complex nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in measles outbreaks. In this paper, we first develop a high-dimensional feed-forward neural network model with spatial features (SFNN) to forecast endemic measles outbreaks and systematically compare its predictive power with that of a classical mechanistic model (TSIR). We illustrate the utility of our model using England and Wales measles data from 1944-1965. These data present multiple modeling challenges due to the interplay between metapopulations, seasonal trends, and nonlinear dynamics related to demographic changes. Our results show that while the TSIR model yields similarly performant short-term (1 to 2 biweeks ahead) forecasts for highly populous cities, our neural network model (SFNN) consistently achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) across other forecasting windows. Furthermore, we show that our spatial-feature neural network model, without imposing mechanistic assumptions <i>a priori</i>, can uncover gravity-model-like spatial hierarchy of measles spread in which major cities play an important role in driving regional outbreaks. We then turn our attention to integrative approaches that combine mechanistic and machine learning models. Specifically, we investigate how the TSIR can be utilized to improve a state-of-the-art approach known as Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks (PINN) which explicitly combines compartmental models and neural networks. Our results show that the TSIR can facilitate the reconstruction of latent susceptible dynamics, thereby enhancing both forecasts in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and parameter inference of measles dynamics within the PINN. In summary, our results show that appropriately designed neural network-based models can outperform traditional mechanistic models for short to long-term forecasts, while simultaneously providing mechanistic interpretability. Our work also provides valuable insights into more effectively integrating machine learning models with mechanistic models to enhance public health responses to measles and similar infectious disease systems.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012605">An off-lattice discrete model to characterise filamentous yeast colony morphology</a></h4>

We combine an off-lattice agent-based mathematical model and experimentation to explore filamentous growth of a yeast colony. Under environmental stress, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> yeast cells can transition from a bipolar (sated) to unipolar (pseudohyphal) budding mechanism, where cells elongate and bud end-to-end. This budding asymmetry yields spatially non-uniform growth, where filaments extend away from the colony centre, foraging for food. We use approximate Bayesian computation to quantify how individual cell budding mechanisms give rise to spatial patterns observed in experiments. We apply this method of parameter inference to experimental images of colonies of two strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, in low and high nutrient environments. The colony size at the transition from sated to pseudohyphal growth, and a forking mechanism for pseudohyphal cell proliferation are the key features driving colony morphology. Simulations run with the most likely inferred parameters produce colony morphologies that closely resemble experimental results.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002915">The human posterior parietal cortices orthogonalize the representation of different streams of information concurrently coded in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yaoda Xu</p>

The key to adaptive visual processing lies in the ability to maintain goal-directed visual representation in the face of distraction. In visual working memory (VWM), distraction may come from the coding of distractors or other concurrently retained targets. This fMRI study reveals a common representational geometry that our brain uses to combat both types of distractions in VWM. Specifically, using fMRI pattern decoding, the human posterior parietal cortex is shown to orthogonalize the representations of different streams of information concurrently coded in VWM, whether they are targets and distractors, or different targets concurrently held in VWM. The latter is also seen in the human occipitotemporal cortex. Such a representational geometry provides an elegant and simple solution to enable independent information readout, effectively combating distraction from the different streams of information, while accommodating their concurrent representations. This representational scheme differs from mechanisms that actively suppress or block the encoding of distractors to reduce interference. It is likely a general neural representational principle that supports our ability to represent information beyond VWM in other situations where multiple streams of visual information are tracked and processed simultaneously.
