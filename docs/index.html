              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10547">Biomarkers of brain diseases</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the diversity of brain data acquired and advanced AI-based algorithms to analyze them, brain features are rarely used in clinics for diagnosis and prognosis. Here we argue that the field continues to rely on cohort comparisons to seek biomarkers, despite the well-established degeneracy of brain features. Using a thought experiment, we show that more data and more powerful algorithms will not be sufficient to identify biomarkers of brain diseases. We argue that instead of comparing patient versus healthy controls using single data type, we should use multimodal (e.g. brain activity, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, brain imaging) and longitudinal brain data to guide the grouping before defining multidimensional biomarkers for brain diseases.

                arXiv:2509.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder has traditionally been conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental condition associated with deficits such as inattention, impulsivity, and poor time management. Such perspectives often emphasize pathology and functional limitations. More recent scholarship, however, has begun to reconceptualize ADHD by identifying potential adaptive characteristics, including heightened energy, periods of hyperfocus, and advanced cognitive flexibility. A growing body of qualitative research also examines self reported experiences of high functioning individuals with ADHD, highlighting positive traits and successful coping strategies. Despite these developments, the majority of existing studies remain concentrated in Western contexts, particularly the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Canada. This review seeks to address this imbalance by analyzing literature on ADHD strengths in Europe and North America alongside emerging studies from Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10552">Trial-Level Time-frequency EEG Desynchronization as a Neural Marker of Pain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pain remains one of the most pressing health challenges, yet its measurement still relies heavily on self-report, limiting monitoring in non-communicative patients and hindering translational research. Neural oscillations recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) provide a promising avenue for identifying reproducible markers of nociceptive processing. Prior studies have reported pain-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha and beta bands, but most rely on trial-averaging, obscuring variability that may be critical for perception. We analyzed high-density EEG from 59 healthy participants who underwent electrical stimulation under Pain and No-Pain conditions. Per-trial time-frequency decomposition revealed robust beta-band ERD in frontal-central electrodes that differentiated Pain from No-Pain trials. Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that ERD scaled with subjective intensity ratings (VAS), and that age and gender moderated this relationship. Reverse models further showed that ERD predicted VAS ratings across participants, underscoring its potential as a nonverbal marker of pain. These findings provide preliminary evidence that trial-level EEG oscillations can serve as reliable indicators of pain and open avenues for individualized, report-free pain monitoring. Future work should validate these results in patient populations and extend analyses to multimodal approaches combining EEG, MRI, and attention-based modulation strategies.

                arXiv:2509.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based assessment of motor symptoms in conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) offers a scalable alternative to in-clinic evaluations, but home-recorded videos introduce significant challenges, including visual degradation, inconsistent task execution, annotation noise, and domain shifts. We present HiLWS, a cascaded human-in-the-loop weak supervision framework for curating and annotating hand motor task videos from both clinical and home settings. Unlike conventional single-stage weak supervision methods, HiLWS employs a novel cascaded approach, first applies weak supervision to aggregate expert-provided annotations into probabilistic labels, which are then used to train machine learning models. Model predictions, combined with expert input, are subsequently refined through a second stage of weak supervision. The complete pipeline includes quality filtering, optimized pose estimation, and task-specific segment extraction, complemented by context-sensitive evaluation metrics that assess both visual fidelity and clinical relevance by prioritizing ambiguous cases for expert review. Our findings reveal key failure modes in home recorded data and emphasize the importance of context-sensitive curation strategies for robust medical video analysis.

                arXiv:2509.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective analysis in neuroscience benefits significantly from robust conceptual frameworks. Traditional metrics of interbrain synchrony in social neuroscience typically depend on fixed, correlation-based approaches, restricting their explanatory capacity to descriptive observations. Inspired by the successful integration of geometric insights in network science, we propose leveraging discrete geometry to examine the dynamic reconfigurations in neural interactions during social exchanges. Unlike conventional synchrony approaches, our method interprets inter-brain connectivity changes through the evolving geometric structures of neural networks. This geometric framework is realized through a pipeline that identifies critical transitions in network connectivity using entropy metrics derived from curvature distributions. By doing so, we significantly enhance the capacity of hyperscanning methodologies to uncover underlying neural mechanisms in interactive social behavior.

                arXiv:2509.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consciousness spans macroscopic experience and microscopic neuronal activity, yet linking these scales remains challenging. Prevailing theories, such as Integrated Information Theory, focus on a single scale, overlooking how causal power and its dynamics unfold across scales. Progress is constrained by scarce cross-scale data and difficulties in quantifying multiscale causality and dynamics. Here, we present a machine learning framework that infers multiscale causal variables and their dynamics from near-cellular-resolution calcium imaging in the mouse dorsal cortex. At lower levels, variables primarily aggregate input-driven information, whereas at higher levels they realize causality through metastable or saddle-point dynamics during wakefulness, collapsing into localized, stochastic dynamics under anesthesia. A one-dimensional top-level conscious variable captures the majority of causal power, yet variables across other scales also contribute substantially, giving rise to high emergent complexity in the conscious state. Together, these findings provide a multiscale causal framework that links neural activity to conscious states.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11530">Residual Gaze Behavior During Navigation in Blindness and Low Vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Outdoor navigation poses significant challenges for people with blindness or low vision, yet the role of gaze behavior in supporting mobility remains underexplored. Fully sighted individuals typically adopt consistent scanning strategies, whereas those with visual impairments rely on heterogeneous adaptations shaped by residual vision and experience.
  Methods: We conducted a comparative eye-tracking study of fully sighted, low vision, blind, and fully blind participants navigating outdoor routes. Using a wearable eye tracker, we quantified fixation counts, fixation rate, fixation area, direction, peak fixation location, and walking speed.
  Results: Walking speed declined systematically with worsening vision. Fixation count increased with greater impairment, reflecting slower travel times and more frequent sampling. Fixation rate rose with worsening vision, though between-group differences were generally not significant between most groups. Fixation spatial coverage decreased along the continuum of vision loss. Fixation patterns were most consistent in the fully sighted group. Peak fixation locations were centered in fully sighted participants but shifted outward and became more variable with impairment.
  Conclusion: Gaze strategies during navigation form a graded continuum across vision groups, with fully sighted and fully blind participants at opposite poles and low vision and blind groups spanning the middle. Visual acuity alone does not predict functional gaze use, as rehabilitation experience and adaptive strategies strongly shape behavior. These findings highlight the need for personalized rehabilitation and assistive technologies, with residual gaze patterns offering insight into mobility capacity and training opportunities for safer navigation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11545">Representational drift under spontaneous activity -- self-organized criticality enhances representational reliability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural systems face the challenge of maintaining reliable representations amid variations from plasticity and spontaneous activity. In particular, the spontaneous dynamics in neuronal circuit is known to operate near a highly variable critical state, which intuitively contrasts with the requirement of reliable representation. It is intriguing to understand how reliable representation could be maintained or even enhanced by critical spontaneous states. We firstly examined the co-existence of the scale-free avalanche in the spontaneous activity of mouse visual cortex with restricted representational geometry manifesting representational reliability amid the representational drift with respect to the visual stimulus. To explore how critical spontaneous state influences the neural representation, we built an excitation-inhibition network with homeostatic plasticity, which self-organizes to the critical spontaneous state. This model successfully reproduced both representational drift and restricted representational geometry observed experimentally, in contrast with randomly shuffled plasticity which causes accumulated drift of representational geometry. We further showed that the self-organized critical state enhances the cross-session low-dimensional representation, comparing to the non-critical state, by restricting the synapse weight into a low variation space. Our findings suggest that spontaneous self-organized criticality serves not only as a ubiquitous property of neural systems but also as a functional mechanism for maintaining reliable information representation under continuously changing networks, providing a potential explanation how the brain maintains consistent perception and behavior despite ongoing synaptic rewiring.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10900">Geometric Phase of Stochastic Oscillators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior.

Abstract: Decoding the activity of the nervous system is a critical challenge in neuroscience and neural interfacing. In this study, we present a neuromuscular recording system that enables large-scale sampling of muscle activity using microelectrode arrays with over 100 channels embedded in forearm muscles. These arrays captured intramuscular high-density signals that were decoded into patterns of activation of spinal motoneurons. In two healthy participants, we recorded high-density intramuscular activity during single- and multi-digit contractions, revealing distinct motoneuron recruitment patterns specific to each task. Based on these patterns, we achieved perfect classification accuracy (100%) for 12 single- and multi-digit tasks and over 96% accuracy for up to 16 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art EMG classification methods. This intramuscular high-density system and classification method represent an advancement in neural interfacing, with the potential to improve human-computer interaction and the control of assistive technologies, particularly for replacing or restoring impaired motor function.

Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural systems operate near a phase transition, optimizing the processing of information. While scale invariance and non-Gaussian dynamics--hallmarks of criticality--have been observed in brain activity, a direct link between criticality and behavioral performance remains unexplored. Here, we use a phenomenological renormalization group approach to examine neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of mice performing a visual recognition task. We show that nontrivial scaling in neuronal activity is associated with enhanced task performance, with pronounced scaling observed during successful task completion. When rewards were removed or non-natural stimuli presented, scaling signatures diminished. These results suggest that critical dynamics in the brain is crucial for optimizing behavioral outcomes, offering new insights into the functional role of criticality in cortical processing.

Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.

                arXiv:2502.11105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. Memory is stored as statistics organized into structures that are repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Repeated summarization requires an intensive ongoing process guided by heuristics that help optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are progressively elaborated into more abstract constructs. This framework differs from previous accounts of memory by its emphasis on a process that is intensive, complex, and expensive, its reliance on statistics as a representation of memory, and the use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics at each summarization step. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.

Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.

                arXiv:2509.07001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The encounter of artificial intelligence with consciousness research is often framed as a challenge: could this science determine whether such systems are conscious? We suggest it is equally an opportunity to expand and test the scope of existing theories of consciousness. Current approaches remain polarized. Computational functionalism emphasizes abstract organization, often realized through neural correlates of consciousness, while biological naturalism insists that consciousness is tied to living embodiment. Both positions risk anthropocentrism and limit the possibility of recognizing non-biological forms of subjectivity. To move beyond this impasse, we propose a dual-resolution framework that defines the ontological and epistemic conditions for consciousness. This approach combines the Information Theory of Individuality, which defines the ontological conditions of informational autonomy and self-maintenance, with the Moment-to-Moment theory, which specifies the epistemic conditions of temporal updating and phenomenological unfolding. This integration reframes consciousness as the epistemic expression of individuated systems in substrate-independent informational terms, offering a generalizable theory of consciousness and positioning AI as a promising testbed for its emergence.

                arXiv:2411.16445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems. In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to support simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the extended framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that Arbor is highly efficient in terms of runtime and memory use as compared to other simulators. Using the extended framework, as an example, we investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, finding a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information. By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.

Abstract: Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. Here, we give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. In particular, using a cavity approach, we analyze three high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. Furthermore, for perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a naive method.

Abstract: A machine learning method is proposed using two agents that simulate the biological behavior of a predator and a prey. In this method, the predator and the prey interact with each other - the predator chases the prey while the prey runs away from the predator - to perform an optimization on the landscape. This method allows, for the case of a ravine landscape (i.e., a landscape with narrow ravines and with gentle slopes along the ravines) to avoid getting optimization stuck in the ravine. For this, in the optimization over a ravine landscape the predator drives the prey along the ravine. Thus we also call this approach, for the case of ravine landscapes, the driven hunt method. For some examples of grokking (i.e., delayed generalization) problems we show that this method allows for achieving up to a hundred times faster learning compared to the standard learning procedure.

                arXiv:2509.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant efforts to manually design high-performance evolutionary algorithms, their adaptability remains limited due to the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of real-world problems. The "no free lunch" theorem highlights that no single algorithm performs optimally across all problems. While online adaptation methods have been proposed, they often suffer from inefficiency, weak convergence, and limited generalization on constrained optimization problems (COPs).
  To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for automated component configuration in Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to address COPs, powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Specifically, we propose SuperDE, a foundation model that dynamically configures DE's evolutionary components based on real-time evolution. Trained offline through meta-learning across a wide variety of COPs, SuperDE is capable of recommending optimal per-generation configurations for unseen problems in a zero-shot manner. Utilizing a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), SuperDE adapts its configuration strategies in response to the evolving population states during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that SuperDE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark test suites, achieving superior generalization and optimization performance.

                arXiv:2509.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to correct inference errors caused by stuck-at faults in fully analog ReRAM-based neuromorphic circuits. Using a Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) simulation framework, we model and analyze six spatial defect types-circular, circular-complement, ring, row, column, and checkerboard-across multiple layers of a multi-array neuromorphic architecture. We demonstrate that the proposed correction method, which employs a lightweight neural network trained on the circuit's output voltages, can recover up to 35% (from 55% to 90%) inference accuracy loss in defective scenarios. Our results, based on handwritten digit recognition tasks, show that even small corrective networks can significantly improve circuit robustness. This method offers a scalable and energy-efficient path toward enhanced yield and reliability for neuromorphic systems in edge and internet-of-things (IoTs) applications. In addition to correcting the specific defect types used during training, our method also demonstrates the ability to generalize-achieving reasonable accuracy when tested on different types of defects not seen during training. The framework can be readily extended to support real-time adaptive learning, enabling on-chip correction for dynamic or aging-induced fault profiles.

Abstract: Developmental changes in body morphology profoundly shape locomotion in animals, yet artificial agents and robots are typically trained under static physical parameters. Inspired by ontogenetic scaling of muscle power in biology, we propose Scaling Mechanical Output over Lifetime (SMOL), a novel curriculum that dynamically modulates robot actuator strength to mimic natural variations in power-to-weight ratio during growth and ageing. Integrating SMOL into the MAP-Elites quality-diversity framework, we vary the torque in standard robotics tasks to mimic the evolution of strength in animals as they grow up and as their body changes. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that the SMOL schedule consistently elevates both performance and diversity of locomotion behaviours across varied control scenarios, by allowing agents to leverage advantageous physics early on to discover skills that act as stepping stones when they reach their final standard body properties. Based on studies of the total power output in humans, we also implement the SMOL-Human schedule that models isometric body variations due to non-linear changes like puberty, and study its impact on robotics locomotion.

                arXiv:2505.06850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-structured combinatorial problems in complex networks are prevalent in many domains, and are computationally demanding due to their complexity and non-linear nature. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while robust, often face obstacles due to content-shallow encoding limitations and lack of structural awareness, necessitating hand-crafted modifications for effective application. In this work, we introduce an original framework, visual evolutionary optimization (VEO), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as the backbone evolutionary optimizer in this context. Specifically, we propose a context-aware encoding scheme, representing the solution of the network as an image. In this manner, we can utilize MLLMs' image processing capabilities to intuitively comprehend network configurations, thus enabling machines to solve these problems in a human-like way. We develop MLLM-based operators tailored for various evolutionary optimization stages, including initialization, crossover, and mutation. Furthermore, we propose that graph sparsification can effectively enhance the applicability and scalability of VEO on large-scale networks, owing to the scale-free nature of real-world networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a well-known task in complex networks, influence maximization, and validate it on eight different real-world networks of various structures. The results confirm VEO's reliability and enhanced effectiveness compared to traditional evolutionary optimization.

                arXiv:2505.17108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with discrete variables and finite search space are critical across numerous fields, and solving them in metaheuristic algorithms is popular. However, addressing a specific COP typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP. Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure, destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4 single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading, assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.

                arXiv:2505.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a key framework for protecting sensitive data in machine learning, but standard DP-SGD often suffers from significant accuracy loss due to injected noise. To address this limitation, we introduce the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that improves gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. FFTKF applies frequency-domain filtering to shift privacy noise into less informative high-frequency components, preserving the low-frequency gradient signals that carry most learning information. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with a finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. The method has per-iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ and achieves higher test accuracy than DP-SGD and DiSK on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that FFTKF ensures equivalent privacy while delivering a stronger privacy--utility trade-off through reduced variance and controlled bias.

">Encoding visual stimuli by striatal neurons</a></h4>

              
                To move through the world, animals extract visual features from objects. Although visual object encoding is considered a cortical attribute, subcortical areas also contain visual processing circuits. Using electrophysiological recordings of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) located in a target region of the primary visual cortex, we identified striatal modules that process basic visual features. SPNs from the direct and indirect pathways exhibited high orientation selectivity in the absence of behavioral contingencies. SPNs population activity reliably predicted different visual features. Pathway-specific silencing of SPNs revealed that high orientation selectivity depends on intra-striatal connectivity. Thus, specialized striatal modules are active participants in visual feature extraction. These findings indicate parallel visual information processing in basal ganglia circuits, expanding current models of visual perception beyond cortical networks.

                Arousal is essential for survival, and maladaptive arousal processing leads to an inability to focus, anxiety-like behavior, and dysregulated affective states. Norepinephrine (NE) is known to regulate anxiety, arousal, and learning through locus coeruleus (LC) projections throughout the brain. Evidence for co-release of the NE precursor and neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) from LC neurons has been accumulating for years, yet definitive measures of DA release across regions, stimulus paradigms, and behaviors associated with the LC-NE system remain controversial. Here, we identified the physiological and behavioral properties that evoke DA release from LC axon terminals. Using concomitant approaches, we inhibited the LC and ventral tegmental area (VTA) to selectively isolate the contributions of LC-derived DA release. Together these findings establish the constraints by which LC neurons release DA in a modality-dependent manner.

">Hypoplasticity in sensory-driven neocortical circuits of the Fragile X syndrome mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience and learning are tightly linked to plasticity in neocortical circuits. Repetitive sensory stimulation, such as rhythmic whisker stimulation (RWS) at behaviourally relevant frequencies (8 Hz), can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses in typically developing mice. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading monogenically inherited form of intellectual disability, is associated with altered tactile reactivity, where non-noxious touch can be aversive. To investigate how sensory-evoked plasticity is altered in FXS, we combined ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the Somatosensory (S1) cortex of adult male Fragile X mouse model (Fmr1-/y) mice and typically developing (Fmr1+/y) control littermates. We found that plasticity induced by repetitive sensory stimulation was impaired in Fmr1-/y mice ex and in vivo compared to controls. L4-evoked subthreshold synaptic responses were hyperexcitable in L2/3 PNs, consistent with circuit-level disinhibition. Despite this, baseline intrinsic spiking evoked by current steps remained largely unchanged and whisker-evoked activity appeared diminished in vivo. We observed a shortening of the axon initial segment (AIS) in L2/3 in Fmr1-/y compared to control mice, which may reveal a potential mechanism to explain why subthreshold hyperexcitability did not induce more spiking. We also observed an increase in adaptation to the repetitive stimulation in Fmr1-/y mice compared to controls, which may underlie failure to induce plasticity. Together, these findings suggest that L2/3 PNs of S1 in Fmr1-/y mice are locked in a hypoplastic state, potentially related to disrupted inhibitory control, AIS shortening, and rapid adaptation during repetitive sensory stimulation. As somatosensory processes underly tactile perception, these findings may potentially underly altered tactile reactivity in FXS.

">Encoding of motor sequences in primate globus pallidus and motor cortex: Uniform preference for ordinal position</a></h4>

              
                How the brain organizes discrete actions into fluid sequences is a central problem in motor neuroscience. Competing models of basal ganglia (BG) function propose that BG neurons either signal sequence boundaries or encode movements across ordinal positions. Prior studies have largely examined fixed sequences with end-of-sequence rewards, leaving open whether such findings generalize to more naturalistic conditions. We trained four rhesus macaques to perform a visuomotor sequence task requiring four or five out-and-back joystick movements to peripheral targets. Sequences were completed under two conditions: a random condition, in which target order varied across trials, and a fixed condition, in which order was predictable and consistent. Rewards were delivered after each movement, dissociating reward timing from sequence completion. We recorded single-unit activity in arm-related regions of the globus pallidus (GP; n = 458) and primary motor cortex (M1; n = 306). Regression analyses revealed that many neurons in both GP and M1 encoded ordinal position within a sequence. Order effects were more frequent in the fixed condition, but were also present during random sequences. We found no evidence for preferential encoding of sequence initiation or termination in overlearned sequences, in contrast to prior studies reporting start/stop signals in basal ganglia. Weak effects appeared under the random condition in one animal pair, but these did not generalize across animals or conditions. Instead, neurons exhibited heterogeneous order-related responses spanning the full sequence. These results demonstrate that GP neurons, like those in M1, encode ordinal position throughout a sequence rather than acting solely as sequence initiators or terminators. This challenges boundary-specific models of BG function and highlights a broader role for the BG in representing serial order during motor sequence production.

">Morphological details contribute to neuronal response variability within the same cell type</a></h4>

              
                A large body of literature offers an explanation on how biophysical diversity and variable branching patterns of neurons contribute to degeneracy, and therefore enable multiple solutions for a characteristic neuronal response. The specific influence of finer morphological details, such as diameter and length of dendritic branches, on response variability is yet unclear. In this study, we address this question using a model database approach with spatially extended, conductance-based compartmental models to study variability of response features, such as resting membrane potential, input resistance, spike count, first spike latency, spike height, and spike width. Using 15 reconstructed morphologies of leech touch cells with fixed branching patterns, we identified several thousands of parameter sets that reproduced the experimentally measured response features of all the tested morphologies. Even when the biophysical parameters were kept equal across reconstructed morphologies, variability in response features arose from the morphological details. Systematically varying the distribution of ion channels across the neuronal membrane revealed that all spike response features are influenced by the location of spike initiation zones with higher conductance density. Nevertheless, biologically plausible responses can arise from different locations of spike initiation zones and even homogeneous distribution of ion channels. Furthermore, comparing the simulated spike responses from two morphological subtypes of leech touch cells revealed that the previously published systematic differences cannot be explained by the morphological differences alone. A larger total conductance was required to reproduce the experimental finding of an increased spike count and a larger spike amplitude in a morphological subtype with a larger membrane area. In conclusion, biophysical properties, morphological details, and ion channel distribution across the membrane all interact in their contribution to the functionality and response variability of neurons of the same cell type.

">Spontaneous reinstatement of episodic memories in the developing human brain</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus supports episodic memories in development, and yet how the brain stabilizes these memories determines their long-term accessibility. This study examined how episodic memories formed in development are stabilized and whether early-life experiences influence the neural mechanisms involved. Using fMRI and multivariate analyses, we tracked neural reinstatement of newly learned item-location-context associations in youth (N = 49; mean age = 11.68 years). Hippocampus and visual cortex activity during encoding predicted later memory success. Crucially, spontaneous reinstatement in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during post-encoding rest also predicted memory. In a second sample (N = 32, mean age = 12.86 years) with early adversity, differential recruitment of the precuneus and visual cortex during encoding, and angular gyrus during reinstatement, was observed. These findings suggest that hippocampus and mPFC contribute to developmental memory stabilization in ways consistent with mature function, while differences in memory accessibility across developmental experiences arise from broader network adaptations.

Vestibular sensory neurons provide the nervous system with information about head rotation and acceleration. However, the nervous system can also modify the activity of sensory neurons and hair cells via the actions of the efferent vestibular system (EVS). The function of the EVS has remained unknown partly because of an inability to target efferent vestibular neurons in a selective manner to understand their synaptic inputs and function during behaviour. Here, we present a novel method for the selective targeting and expression of flp-recombinase in EVS neurons. We take advantage of the dual expression of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in these neurons to develop an adeno-associate virus (AAV) that expresses a gene only in neurons with this intersectional expression. We use this system to map the monosynaptic inputs to EVS neurons and show inputs from distinct populations of brainstem and midbrain regions indicating a functional role as a multimodal processing center and integrator for the vestibular periphery. To demonstrate the applicability of our technology in behavioural assays, we performed a preliminary behaviour analysis in mice with disrupted EVS function. While more bespoke assays are required to ascertain EVS function/s, our viral method presents a novel tool for investigators examining the role of the vestibular system and its central circuits.

">The Hippocampus Rapidly Integrates Sequence Representations During Novel Multistep Predictions</a></h4>

              
                Memories for temporally extended sequences can be used adaptively to predict future events on multiple timescales, a function that relies on the hippocampus. For such predictions to be useful, they should be updated when environments change. We investigated how and when new learning shapes hippocampal representations of temporally extended sequences, and how this updating relates to flexible predictions about future events. Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants' ability to update their predictions in behavior. Together, these results advance our understanding of how structured knowledge dynamically emerges in service of adaptive behavior.

">Distributed and drifting signals for working memory load in human cortex</a></h4>

              
                Increasing working memory (WM) load incurs behavioral costs, and whether the neural constraints on behavioral costs are localized (i.e., emanating from the intraparietal sulcus) or distributed across cortex remains an active area of debate. In a pre-registered fMRI experiment, 12 humans (12 scanner-hours each) performed a visual WM task with varying memory load (0-4 items). We replicated a localized, load-dependent increase in univariate BOLD activity in parietal cortex. However, we also observed both systematic increases and decreases in univariate activity with load across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, multivariate activation patterns encoded WM load regardless of the direction of the univariate effect, arguing against a restricted locus of load signals in parietal cortex. Finally, we observed representational drift in activity patterns encoding memory load across scanning sessions. Our results suggest a distributed code for memory load that may be continually refined over time to support more efficient information storage.

">Hierarchical processing of sensory information across topographically organized thalamocortical-like circuits in the zebrafish brain</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical projections contribute to the spatial organization and functional hierarchies of the mammalian cortex. Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.

">Functional Divergence of Axon-Carrying Dendrite (AcD) and NonAcD Cells in Learning and Stability</a></h4>

              
                Axon-carrying dendrite (AcD) cells are a specialized class of hippocampal neurons where the axon initial segment originates from a basal dendrite rather than the soma, creating a privileged pathway for excitatory inputs on AcD branches to bypass perisomatic inhibition. However, their functional role in learning and synaptic stability remains unclear. To address this question, we modeled a CA3-CA1 network to compare the learning dynamics and synaptic stability of AcD and nonAcD cells. The results revealed that, during learning, these cell types employ distinct mechanisms. AcD cells primarily adopt a single-modal strategy, with all dendritic branches converging to encode inputs from a single assembly, whereas nonAcD cells follow a multi-modal approach, with individual branches encoding inputs from distinct assemblies. Additionally, consistent with experimental findings, our results suggest that during periods of high inhibition (such as ripples), AcD cells maintain stable synaptic weights, unlike the synaptic decay observed in nonAcD cells. These results, in line with experimental evidence, suggest that although the morphological distinction between AcD and nonAcD cells was long overlooked, it proves to be important, as it results in functional differences in learning mechanisms and in the capacity for stable information storage, highlighting their key role in learning and memory consolidation.

">Developmental Connectomics of the Mouse Cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                To uncover the developmental processes that establish the precise patterns of synaptic connectivity in the CNS, we employed a connectomic approach in the mouse cerebellar cortex between birth and 2 weeks of age. There were dramatic quantitative and qualitative changes in the structure and connectivity of cerebellar cells. Parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells increased ~500-fold, with the most rapid growth taking place a week after birth. To support this profound synaptogenesis, Purkinje cells generated thousands of transient parallel fiber-oriented filopodia that received nascent synapses from parallel fibers. Importantly, we find that granule cells initiate synaptic output onto Purkinje cells only after receiving mossy fiber input, revealing a sequential, input-dependent logic for circuit assembly. In sharp contrast to the concurrent pruning of climbing fiber inputs, parallel fiber connectivity expanded and became highly individualized during development. Despite anatomical overlap, neighboring Purkinje cells share significantly fewer parallel fiber inputs than expected by chance. Moreover, parallel fibers themselves diverged spatially, further enforcing selective input allocation and resulting in highly specific parallel fiber cohorts for each Purkinje cell. Our findings uncover a mechanistic sequence in which early afferent activity and transient cellular structures guide the selective wiring and expansion of parallel fiber input to Purkinje cells, establishing developmental principles that ensure functional specificity in the mature brain.

">Whole-brain clearing reveals region- and cell type-specific imbalances in inhibitory neurons in a mouse model for Kleefstra Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic inhibition is essential for balanced brain function and is frequently disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The inhibition is generated by a diverse population of GABAergic interneurons, which differ in subtype composition and spatial density across the brain. Here, we applied an unbiased whole-brain clearing and light-sheet imaging approach to systematically map the distribution of the three major GABAergic interneuron subtypes - Parvalbumin-positive (PV+), Somatostatin-positive (SST+), and Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide-positive (VIP+) cells - across the mouse brain in a model of Kleefstra Syndrome (Ehmt1+/-), a monogenic intellectual disability disorder with a strong ASD component. Analyzing 895 brain regions we identified widespread, cell type- and region-specific alterations in GABAergic populations. Notably, we observed increased VIP+ neuron density in the Ehmt1+/- cortex and decreased SST+ neuron density in sensory cortical and subcortical regions. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), PV+ interneurons exhibited precocious maturation already at the juvenile stage, which persisted into adulthood and was associated with enhanced inhibitory input onto BLA principal neurons. We here demonstrate that Ehmt1 haploinsufficiency results in region- and cell-type specific changes throughout the brain. These results underscore the value of whole-brain, high-resolution mapping approaches in uncovering previously unrecognized patterns of neural vulnerability in neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Biological experiments often require a series of precisely timed operations, and small variations in treatment can result in inconsistent or biased results. To handle multiple samples in parallel with precise temporal resolution, experimentalists may stagger treatments by initiating the workflow of one sample during the wait or incubation time of another. However, as the number of samples processed in parallel and the number of operations increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and execute valid treatment regimens that permit the handling of each sample. To address this, I developed StaggR, an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes compatible staggering intervals for complex experimental workflows. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for defining protocol operations, durations, and wait times. It can automatically calculate the shortest possible conflict-free interval for initiating sample treatments, or allow users to simulate specific intervals to explore potential treatment regimens or bottlenecks. Using StaggR, users of any experience level can rapidly generate complete, color-coded experimental workflows, visualize these workflows in an easy-to-read chart, and execute them using a built-in timer displaying a treatment schedule with live updates. The experimental designs can be saved, shared, and re-imported, ensuring full reproducibility and user control. The application of StaggR is expected to expedite the design and throughput of complex experimental workflows while maximizing reproducibility.

                Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease representing a global public health concern and is associated with severe complications such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. Although several species of the genus Acalypha have demonstrated biological activity, no prior studies have evaluated the hypoglycemic effect of Acalypha argomuelleri Briq., making this study relevant. Method The hypoglycemic effect of the aqueous leaf extract of A. argomuelleri Briq. (AAAE) was evaluated in an experimental model using Rattus rattus var. albinus. A randomized, prospective design was employed, consisting of a control group and three treatment groups receiving doses of 100, 150, and 300 mg/kg of the extract, respectively. Hyperglycemia was induced via oral glucose administration. Results The qualitative phytochemical analysis of AAAE revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenols, cardiotonic glycosides, and diterpenes, with no reducing sugars. The 300 mg/kg dose produced a significant and sustained reduction in blood glucose levels, reaching near-normal values at 90 minutes, demonstrating a dose- and time-dependent hypoglycemic effect. Discussion The study confirmed that AAAE has a dose-dependent hypoglycemic effect, with optimal efficacy at 300 mg/kg. This dose showed a faster and more sustained reduction in glucose levels compared to 100 and 150 mg/kg, suggesting higher efficacy at elevated concentrations. The identified flavonoids and phenols, associated with glucose metabolism modulation and pancreatic β-cell protection, likely explain the observed effect. The absence of reducing sugars indicates the hypoglycemic effect is linked to secondary metabolites. Conclusions The AAAE exhibited a significant dose- and time-dependent hypoglycemic effect, with optimal efficacy at 300 mg/kg after 90 minutes. These findings support the potential of A. argomuelleri Briq. as a natural alternative for blood glucose control, though further studies are needed to assess its safety and efficacy in clinical models.

                Background Sleep disturbances frequently occur in concomitance with chronic pain, exacerbating its detrimental effects and diminishing patients’ quality of life. Although various studies have explored the relationship between chronic pain and sleep disturbances, comprehensive evidence on detailed assessment methods and their bidirectional interactions remains limited. This scoping review aimed to examine the characteristics and prevalence of assessment methods for sleep and pain-related outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. Methods A comprehensive search of nine databases identified observational and interventional studies examining the relationship between sleep disturbances/disorders and chronic pain in adults. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) as well as gray literature sources, Open Grey. In addition, the following trial registries were searched for ongoing or unpublished trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Results This review included 81 of 3,513 studies. Approximately 90.1% of studies relied on self-report sleep assessments, whereas only 9.9% incorporated objective measures. Additionally, 7.4% of studies used a combination of self-report and objective sleep assessments. The visual analog and numeric rating scales were the most frequently used methods for assessing pain-related outcomes (58.0%). Despite extensive research on sleep and chronic pain, critical gaps persist, particularly in the integration of multidimensional assessment tools. Conclusions This scoping review discovered imbalances in the content of both sleep and pain assessments. Future studies should integrate both objective and self-report assessment tools to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this interaction.

                Background Psychosomatic disorders, characterized by physical symptoms exacerbated or caused by psychological factors, present significant challenges in clinical management. Hypnotherapy, a therapeutic technique that induces a trance-like state to promote focused attention and suggestibility, has shown promise in treating such conditions. This scoping review explores the existing evidence on hypnotherapy’s efficacy in managing psychosomatic disorders. Method A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature for studies published between 2019 and 2025. Keywords included hypnotherapy, psychosomatic disorders, and names of all psychosomatic disorders like asthma, fibromyalgia, and etc. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were included, and non professional hypnosis was excluded. Results Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria, covering conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic pain, diabetes, vaginismus. According to a study, hypnotherapy can noticeably lessen anxiety and depression in patients after a few sessions, 1 improve their quality of life 2 and alleviate rumination and other psychological symptoms. 3 Conclusion Hypnotherapy appears to be a viable adjunctive treatment for psychosomatic disorders, though further high-quality research is needed to establish standardized protocols and long-term efficacy.

                <p>Understanding the roles of astrocytic calcium signaling in multiple brain regulatory mechanisms including metabolism, blood flow, neuromodulation, and neuroinflammation has remained one of the enduring challenges in glial biology. To delineate astrocytic contribution from concurrent neuronal activity, it is vital to establish robust control and manipulate astrocytes using a technique like optogenetics due to its high cellular specificity and temporal resolution. The lack of an experimental paradigm to induce controlled calcium signaling in astrocytes has hindered progress in the field. To address this, in this study, we systematically characterize and identify light stimulation paradigms for inducing regulated, on-demand increases in astrocytic calcium in acute brain slice cortical astrocytes from MlC1-ChR2(C128S)-EYFP mice (of either sex). We identified paradigms 20, 40 and 60% (of <I>T</I> = 100&nbsp;s) to elicit robust calcium responses upon periodic stimulations, while the 95% paradigm exhibited a response only during the first stimulation. We also quantified several parameters, including peak height, full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), and latencies, and observe that the 20% paradigm/duty cycle has the highest peak <I>F</I>/<I>F</I><SUB>0</SUB> among the paradigms across all stimulations and the lowest FWHM during the first stimulation. To illustrate the impact of our study, we observed robust changes in cerebral blood flow, because of 20% optogenetic stimulation, in vivo, using laser Doppler flowmetry. Overall, the 20% paradigm is a favorable choice for eliciting robust astrocytic calcium responses in astrocytes while performing periodic stimulations.</p>

                The ever-increasing generation of municipal solid waste remains an environmental and managerial challenge. Understanding the psychological underpinnings of consumer recycling behavior (CRB) is essential for designing effective interventions. This study develops and tests an integrated conceptual model grounded in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), Construal Level Theory (CLT), and Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT) to explain the motivational dynamics of CRB. Drawing on a cross-sectional survey of a convenient sample of Malaysian university students (N = 508), the model examines how threat and coping appraisals, psychological distance of environmental harm, and individual regulatory focus shape intention to recycle. Structural equation modeling results confirm that both threat appraisal (perceived severity and vulnerability) and coping appraisal (self-efficacy and response efficacy) significantly predict recycling intention, while perceived cost serves as a behavioral barrier. All four dimensions of psychological distance—temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical—negatively predict threat appraisal, with perceived vulnerability showing stronger associations than perceived severity. Mediation analyses reveal that threat appraisal fully mediates the effect of psychological distance on recycling intention. Furthermore, the PORCESS analysis conducted to test moderated mediation hypotheses supports the role of regulatory focus: prevention focus attenuates the impact of psychological distance via severity perception, while promotion focus strengthens it. Findings highlight the interplay between cognitive appraisals, perceived distance, and motivational orientation in shaping pro-environmental intentions, offering actionable insights for the design of targeted recycling campaigns and public communication strategies. Implications for theory and policy, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.

                Background Bayesian methods provide a flexible framework for meta-analysis, particularly for network meta-analysis (NMA), which enables simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions and robust modeling of heterogeneity. However, implementing Bayesian meta-analysis often requires advanced programming skills. Methods We developed BayesMetaNMA, an open-source R/Shiny application for Bayesian pairwise and network meta-analyses. The application uses rjags for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, netmeta for network structure visualization and frequentist NMA outputs, and meta for conventional pairwise analyses. Users can select from various effect measures (standardized mean difference, mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, hazard ratio), set MCMC parameters, and define prior distributions. Outputs include MCMC diagnostics, posterior summaries, study-level estimates, and network-specific analyses such as ranking tables and inconsistency checks. Results BayesMetaNMA produces comprehensive outputs for both pairwise and network models, including convergence diagnostics (trace, density, autocorrelation, Gelman–Rubin plots), pooled and treatment-specific effects, heterogeneity estimates, and optional meta-regression. All plots and summaries are downloadable. Conclusions BayesMetaNMA provides a user-friendly interface for applying Bayesian methods to evidence synthesis without extensive coding. By integrating established R packages in an interactive workflow, it facilitates robust Bayesian analyses for a wide range of research applications.

                Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant and biofilm-forming bacterium that poses serious challenges to conventional antibiotic therapy. In this study, a dose-dependent antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) approach was developed using Allura Red in combination with a 630 nm red laser. Four complementary assays were integrated into a unified evaluation platform: AMDA for singlet oxygen, XTT for metabolic activity, CFU enumeration for bacterial viability, and Crystal Violet (CV) staining for biofilm biomass. Results: The Allura Red–mediated PDT demonstrated dose-dependent effects, with 15 J/cm2 yielding ~87% CFU reduction and >75% biofilm inhibition. Conclusion: This study introduces, for the first time, a novel Allura Red–based, multi-assay PDT framework against P. aeruginosa, providing a comprehensive and translational evaluation method. Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant and biofilm-forming bacterium that represents a major challenge to conventional antibiotics. Methods In this study, a novel dose-dependent antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) approach was applied using Allura Red combined with red laser light (630 nm) at fluences of 5, 10, and 15 J/cm2. Four complementary assays were integrated into a single protocol: aminophenyl methylene diphosphonate (AMDA) and XTT for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and singlet oxygen detection, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts for bacterial viability, and Crystal Violet (CV) staining for biofilm biomass. All experiments were performed in triplicate with appropriate controls, and statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). Results Treatment with 15 J/cm2 produced the highest ROS generation and bacterial killing, with CFU counts reduced by approximately 87%, compared to 71% at 10 J/cm2 and 36% at 5 J/cm2. Biofilm inhibition exceeded 76% at the highest dose. Statistical analysis confirmed significant dose-dependent effects across all assays. Conclusion The integrated, multidimensional protocol provides a reliable method for assessing PDT efficacy and offers valuable insight into the relationship between oxidative stress, bacterial inactivation, and biofilm disruption. This strategy represents a promising approach against biofilm-associated and drug-resistant pathogens.

                Background The accumulation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste poses environmental and sustainability challenges due to its non-biodegradable nature and limited disposal options. Repurposing PET as aggregates in structural lightweight concrete (SLWC) offers a dual benefit of waste valorisation and conservation of natural resources, while supporting circular economy objectives. Methods Eight experimental mix proportions of SLWC were developed using a factorial design approach, with water–to–cement ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.45. PET aggregates were produced via thermal–mechanical processing and subjected to calcium hypochlorite treatment to improve surface bonding with cement paste. Standard tests were conducted to determine workability (Vebe time), fresh and dry densities, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and water absorption. Structural efficiency was also computed as a strength-to-weight performance indicator. Results The fresh and dry densities of the PET-based SLWC ranged from 1455–1515 kg/m3 and 1490–1537 kg/m3, respectively, corresponding to category D1.6 lightweight concrete. Compressive strengths ranged between 14.1 and 16.5 MPa, fulfilling the LC13 classification for structural applications. Splitting tensile strengths were between 0.84 and 1.4 MPa, with several mixes achieving minimum thresholds for structural performance. Water absorption values ranged from 4.66% to 10.16%, remaining within international standards for lightweight concrete durability. Workability was low (Vebe times 13–40 s), attributed to the angular and hydrophobic properties of PET aggregates. Structural efficiency values of 9.5–10.9 kPa·m3/kg exceeded minimum international requirements. Conclusions This study confirms that PET aggregates can be successfully utilised to produce structurally viable and durable lightweight concrete. Although workability is reduced, the compressive strength, tensile strength, density, and durability criteria align with international standards. These results demonstrate a sustainable strategy for PET waste valorisation in construction, contributing to resource conservation, reduced environmental burden, and advancement of circular economy goals.

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled ventures are reshaping clinical practice by extending diagnostic, triage, and telehealth capabilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Problem Despite rapid startup activity, rigorous evidence of tangible, equitable impact and cost-effectiveness in routine LMIC care remains limited; unresolved concerns include data privacy, algorithmic bias, interoperability, and governance. Research Objectives To assess how AI-driven healthcare entrepreneurship transforms access, quality, and affordability in clinical practice, and to surface enablers, barriers, and ethical implications. RQs (1) Where and how are entrepreneurial AI tools integrated into clinical workflows? (2) What measured effects on access, quality, efficiency, and costs are reported? (3) Which infrastructural, human-capital, and policy factors enable or impede adoption? (4) How are ethics—privacy, bias, explainability, accountability—addressed, and what frameworks are needed? Methodology Mixed-methods secondary synthesis combining a systematic literature review with NLP-assisted evidence mining (>200 records; 87 deeply reviewed), triangulation of quantitative indicators (workforce, connectivity, investment) with qualitative case evidence (WHO and policy reports), interpreted through Diffusion of Innovation, Resource-Based View, and Principlism lenses. Results Startups deploy AI triage chatbots (as reflected in our aggregation of secondary sources described in §§3.2–3.3), portable imaging/diagnostics, telemedicine platforms, and supply-chain tools that can broaden coverage, speed diagnosis, and streamline workflows. Yet real-world evaluations are few; cost-effectiveness is context-dependent; adoption is uneven due to infrastructure gaps, limited/biased local data, interoperability frictions, and trust barriers. Success correlates with workflow fit, VRIO resources (data, talent, partnerships), local co-design, and human-in-the-loop, explainable models. Emerging evidence points to faster emergency logistics, expanded screening reach, and reduced wait times, but definitive outcome and economic endpoints remain scarce. Conclusion AI entrepreneurship can augment clinicians and improve service delivery but is not a panacea. Implication To realize equitable system-level gains, stakeholders should invest in digital public goods and representative datasets, build clinician and data-science capacity, operationalize WHO-aligned governance (privacy, bias audits, explainability, accountability), ensure reimbursement pathways beyond pilots, and scale through public-private and civil-society partnerships.

                Introduction Increased work pressure, lifestyle modifications, and deteriorated living conditions brought on by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can exacerbate mental health concerns such as anxiety, sleeplessness, depression, and stress-related illnesses. Recent studies have shown that a high burden of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, stress, panic attacks, impulsivity, irrational anger, somatization disorder, sleep disorders, emotional disturbance, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal thoughts, may be experienced by COVID-19 survivors. Due to differences in their susceptibility to infection and lifestyle factors, people with different medical conditions and social roles may have various kinds and severities of mental health problems. This study aimed to provide essential insights into the prevalence, types, and linkages of various mental health issues to improve patient outcomes, guide future treatments, and advance holistic well-being. Methodology This cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of common mental health issues among patients receiving treatment at Ayurvedic health centers in Udupi Taluk. Five Ayurvedic centers were chosen randomly from 275 Ayurvedic centers registered in Udupi Taluk. A total of 423 patients aged 18 years and above were selected for this study. The Perceived Stress Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to collect data. Results and discussion The study revealed the presence of some level of perceived stress and depression among the participants. The factor associated with stress was the educational status of participants (p =0.01). The comparison between different stress levels revealed that moderate stress levels were significantly higher among participants with a lower educational status. Conclusion According to a study on perceived stress levels and educational status, participants with lower educational status reported feeling more stressed than those with higher educational status.

                Abstract Background Uncaria nervosa Elmer is an Indonesian herbal plant that is traditionally used for breast cancer. The results of phytochemical screening contained alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the ethanol extract of this plant. Based on literature searches, reports regarding the bioactive compounds responsible for breast cancer have not been found. Further research is needed to understand the potential of Uncaria nervosa Elmer as a breast cancer treatment and to identify the specific compounds responsible for its effects Methods This study aims to determine the metabolite profiling of ethanol extract, the isolation, characterization of bioactive compounds, and their bioactivity in T47D breast cancer cells. The research began by extracting the leaves by maceration using 70% ethanol, and then solid phase extraction was carried out using the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. In this study, the sorbent used was polyamide. The extract was analyzed using a tandem analysis technique based on LCMS using the MZmine and SIRIUS platforms. Isolation was carried out using column chromatography, and preparative recycling HPLC. Bioactive compounds were characterized using UV, HPLC, NMR, and 2D NMR, as well as bioactivity tests using the MTT method. Results The results show that the extract contained N-[(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7-prop-2-ynylpurin-8-yl) amino] formamide, N-(3-phenylbutyl)hexan-2-amine, 1,1-Dichloro-1-nitrosopropane, ceratodictyol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, 7-methyl-N-[6-[(7-methyl-6-oxooctanoyl) amino] hexyl]-6-oxononanamide, nervisterol and 3,5,10-tris (acetyloxy)-2-hydroxy-4,14,16,16-tetramethyl-8-methylidene-13-oxo-15oxatetracyclo [9.4.1.01,14.04,9] hexadecan-7-yl 3-phenylprop-2-enoate. The ethanol extract of Uncaria nervosa Elmer leaves contains nine compounds consisting of alkaloids, terpenoids, and fatty acid. The bioactive compounds that were successfully isolated were betulinic acid, and ursolic acid, with IC50 values of ˃100 and 14,70±4,50 μg/ml, respectively. These compounds were reported in this plant for the first time. Conclusion Betulinic acid, and ursolic acid have been successfully isolated from leaves Uncaria nervosa Elmer, and ursolic acid have moderate cytotoxic activity on T47D breast cancer cells.

                <p>by Kamil Wolos, Leszek Pstras, Urszula Bialonczyk, Malgorzata Debowska, Wojciech Dabrowski, Dorota Siwicka-Gieroba, Jan Poleszczuk</p>

This study investigates whether examining the shape of arterial pulse waves and fitting to them a physiology-based mathematical model of pulse wave propagation can provide additional insights into the state of the cardiovascular system in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), potentially enhancing vasopressor dosing strategies. We conducted a longitudinal study on 25 sTBI patients in an intensive care unit. Arterial pulse waves were recorded non-invasively from wrists and ankles using an oscillometric method and were used to inform a 0-1D model of the arterial blood ﬂow dynamics. Model-estimated, patient-specific cardiovascular parameters were then used in a statistical model to predict changes in the administered dose of vasopressor (norepinephrine) in the next 24 hours. The model fits to the recorded pulse waves were satisfactory, with the coefficients of determination (R2) of approximately 0.9 and the differences between the measured and model-estimated mean arterial pressure of 0.1 ± 1.0 mmHg (R2=0.99). Except for a few patients, we found no clear association between the model-estimated parameters and norepinephrine dose at the time of pulse wave recording. Nevertheless, our predictive model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.85 when trained and tested on the entire dataset and 0.76 when using the leave-one-out cross-validation, with 8 misclassifications among the total of 77 observations. Thus, despite the known inter-patient variability of hemodynamic response to vasopressors, the proposed method allowed predicting the direction of norepinephrine dose changes in the next 24 hours with satisfactory accuracy. Subject to further studies and extensive validation, our approach could inform a decision-support tool for optimizing vasopressor dosing on a per-patient basis.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013496">The size-weight illusion and beyond: A new model of perceived weight</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Veronica Pisu, Erich W. Graf, Wendy J. Adams</p>

In the size-weight illusion (SWI), the smaller of two same-weight, same apparent material objects is perceived as heavier. The SWI has proved difficult to explain via traditional Bayesian models, which predict the opposite effect: expected weight from size (smaller = lighter) should be integrated with felt weight, such that the smaller object should be perceptually lighter. Other authors have proposed that weight and density are combined according to Bayesian principles, or that Bayesian models incorporating efficient coding can predict the SWI via ‘likelihood repulsion’. These models, however, have been evaluated only under the narrow conditions of typical SWI stimuli. Here we establish a general model of perceived weight for pairs of objects that differ in weight and/ or density and/ or size by varying amounts. In a visuo-haptic task, participants (N = 30) grasped and lifted pairs of cubes, and reported their perceived heaviness. We report that the SWI occurs even at very small density differences, repudiating the idea that the illusion requires a large difference between expected and felt weight. Across all object pairs, perceived weight was well described by a model (R<sup>2</sup> =.98) that includes a positive influence of both objects’ weights and the judged object’s density, but a negative influence of the other object’s density. Critically, the influence of both densities on perceived weight is strongly modulated by weight difference, being three times as large for zero/ small weight differences than for large differences. Thus, it is only under the unusual conditions of typical SWI studies that density affects perceived weight to a substantial extent. Unlike existing models, that are inconsistent with our more comprehensive dataset, our descriptive model provides a quantitative, accurate and generalised account of weight perception for pairs of objects across various weight and size conditions.

                <p>by Samuel Cure, Florian G. Pflug, Simone Pigolotti</p>

Epidemic models on complex networks are widely used to assess how the social structure of a population affects epidemic spreading. However, their numerical simulation can be computationally heavy, especially for large networks. In this paper, we introduce NEXT-Net: a flexible implementation of the next reaction method for simulating epidemic spreading on both static and temporal weighted networks. We find that NEXT-Net is substantially faster than alternative algorithms, while being exact. It permits, in particular, to efficiently simulate epidemics on networks with millions of nodes on a standard computer. It also permits simulating a broad range of epidemic models on temporal networks, including scenarios in which the network structure changes in response to the epidemic. NEXT-Net is implemented in C++ and accessible from Python and R, thus combining speed with user friendliness. These features make our algorithm an ideal tool for a broad range of applications.

                <p>by Marco Garcia Noceda, Gargi Kher, Shikhar Uttam, John P. Barton</p>

Drug treatment can control HIV-1 replication, but it cannot cure infection. This is because of a long-lived population of quiescent infected cells, known as the latent reservoir (LR), that can restart active replication even after decades of successful drug treatment. Many cells in the LR belong to highly expanded clones, but the processes underlying the clonal structure of the LR are unclear. Understanding the dynamics of the LR and the keys to its persistence is critical for developing an HIV-1 cure. Here we develop a quantitative model of LR dynamics that fits available patient data over time scales spanning from days to decades. We show that the interplay between antigenic stimulation and clonal heterogeneity shapes the dynamics of the LR. In particular, we find that large clones play a central role in long-term persistence, even though they rarely reactivate. Our results could inform the development of HIV-1 cure strategies.

                <p>by Matthias Bruhns, Jan T. Schleicher, Maximilian Wirth, Marcello Zago, Sepideh Babaei, Manfred Claassen</p>

Highly multiplexed single-cell imaging technologies have revolutionized our ability to capture spatial protein expression at the single-cell level, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of tissue organization and function. However, these advancements rely on accurate cell segmentation, which defines cell boundaries to generate expression profiles. Despite its importance, there is a gap in quantifying how segmentation inaccuracies propagate through analytical pipelines, particularly affecting cell clustering and phenotyping. We introduce a framework that uses affine transformations to simulate realistic segmentation errors. Our approach mimics the variations induced by segmentation algorithms, allowing us to evaluate the robustness of downstream analyses under controlled perturbation conditions. We show that even moderate segmentation errors can significantly distort estimated protein profiles and disrupt cellular neighborhood relationships in feature space. Effects are most pronounced in clustering analyses, where both unsupervised k-Means and graph-based Leiden algorithms exhibit reduced consistency with increasing perturbation — especially with smaller neighborhood sizes. Similarly, cell phenotyping via Gaussian Mixture Models is adversely impacted, with higher levels of segmentation error leading to notable misclassifications between closely related cell types. These results highlight the importance of ensuring high-quality segmentation and careful data processing strategies to mitigate spurious results for downstream analysis tasks. Considering segmentation inaccuracies, possibly in a probabilistic modeling framework, will improve the reliability and reproducibility of findings in multiplexed tissue imaging studies.

                <p>by Zoe Nahas, Anthony John Bridgen, Torkel E. Loman, Jean Dillon, Katie Abley, Dora L. Cano-Ramirez, Fabrizio Ticchiarelli, Madeleine Seale, James C. W. Locke, Ottoline Leyser</p>

As part of their modular development, plants continuously adapt their shoot branching architecture according to environmental conditions. This occurs by regulating the activity of axillary buds established in each leaf axil. Whether a bud grows into a shoot depends partly on the presence of other active shoots, which can inhibit bud activation. This systemic coordination is proposed to be mediated by the transport network of the plant hormone auxin, with buds competing to establish sustained transport of auxin, termed canalized auxin transport, into the main stem. A second hormone, strigolactone, tunes this competition by influencing the removal of the PIN1 auxin export protein from the plasma membrane, and hence the dynamics of canalization. Strigolactone also regulates the expression of another key regulatory hub, the bud-expressed transcription factor <i>BRANCHED1</i> (<i>BRC1</i>). The interplay between auxin transport and BRC1 in regulating bud activity is poorly understood. Here, we investigate this interplay in the context of competition between buds, using Arabidopsis explants with two axillary buds as a minimal system. Using experimental data, we develop a mathematical model of bud-bud competition in which BRC1 influences the establishment of canalized auxin transport by regulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. We identify single model parameters that plausibly correspond to the dual impact of strigolactone on <i>BRC1</i> expression and PIN1. We show that modulating these two parameters reproduces the dynamics of bud growth and bud-bud competition observed in relevant mutants and treatments. Our model produces testable hypotheses, which we validate by generating a chimeric PIN1 auxin transporter with impaired strigolactone sensitivity, helping us uncouple the effects of strigolactone on PIN1 and BRC1. These results support the hypothesis that BRC1 influences local bud competitiveness by downregulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. Together with the systemic feedbacks in the auxin transport network, this enables plants to adjust dynamically the number and location of growing branches.

                <p>by Kiran Pandey, Hui Xian Poh, Samie R. Jaffrey</p>

The conversion of adenosine to <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification made to eukaryotic mRNA and is involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression. When dysregulated, m6A has been linked to a variety of diseases, including cancer. Unlike other RNA methyltransferases, m6A conversion is catalyzed by a multi-protein writer complex with only one catalytic subunit. So why is the m6A writer complex composed of so many proteins? This Unsolved Mystery explores the possible functions of the proteins of the m6A writer complex and discusses why it might require multiple subunits. Understanding the roles of these proteins could provide insight into how m6A is regulated and reveal new strategies for targeting diseases linked to m6A dysregulation.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Under-vehicle blast (UVB) generated from landmines is a unique traumatic brain injury (TBI) mechanism affecting warfighters. UVB hyperacceleration can result in injury independent of impact; however, a secondary impact injury can also occur. To date, translation of findings from rodent TBI models to improved patient outcomes has been unsuccessful, perhaps due to neuroanatomical differences between humans and rodents, including white-to-gray matter ratio and cortical gyrification. To address this modeling difference, a UVB model was developed in ferrets, the brains of which more closely resemble humans. Male ferrets underwent UVB-alone (Blast), controlled cortical impact (CCI)-alone, combined UVB + CCI (BCCI), or craniotomy (Sham) procedures. Neurobehavioral assays were optimized and used to assess mood, memory, and motor control. Blast and BCCI ferrets underwent neuroimaging at baseline and 7 days post-injury. All ferrets were euthanized by terminal perfusion with paraformaldehyde on day 7 for histologic analysis. Results indicate that UVB alters cortical metabolites and induces blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. CCI leads to BBB disruption and cortical diffuse axonal injury, but this is not exacerbated by combination with UVB. BCCI does result in several alterations in key cortical metabolites indicative of increased neuronal injury, oxidative stress, and glial activation as well as impaired neurotransmission and energy generation. Additionally, BCCI significantly increases hyperactivity and impairs spatial memory. Anxiety-like behavior, mood, and motor function approached statistical significance. Taken together, we provide a military-relevant model of UVB in a gyrencephalic animal, the ferret, that may be applied in future investigations into TBI pathophysiology and potential treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-920/v1?src=rss">Exploring simulation as a teaching pedagogy for male undergraduate nursing students: A Qualitative Study in the United Arab Emirates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The nursing profession is increasingly appealing to male students at the undergraduate level. Society’s demand for nurses, particularly male nurses, is rising; nevertheless, the availability of clinical placements for nursing students is insufficient to meet this demand. Simulation has significantly advanced as an educational method for training healthcare personnel. Simulation makes replicating real-life events and honing skills like clinical decision-making and communication. Using simulation as an adjunct or alternative to clinical practice is now under discussion. Simulation is a resource-intensive pedagogical approach, necessitating careful consideration of its organization and implementation to maximize efficiency without undermining learning outcomes. Objective This study aimed to explore simulation as a teaching pedagogy for male undergraduate nursing students in the United Arab Emirates. Method This study adopted a descriptive qualitative approach. The purposive sampling method recruited 43 male students from nursing programs in the University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, to participate in the individual interviews. In addition, two focus group discussions were conducted on an online meeting platform. Data analysis was done using thematic analysis. Results In this study, we identified four major themes: 1) Students’ perceptions of simulation, 2) Preparation for realistic situations, 3) Feeling of anxiety and stress, and 4) Theory and practice abilities gaps. Conclusion The study findings indicate that male nursing students received the overall simulation experience well. The study highlights the importance of skilled and encouraging simulation instructors who can provide participants with valuable guidance and feedback for more individualized teaching. Study results provide important new information about how simulation-based learning could improve nursing education and further studies in this field. The findings shed light on the problems that male nursing students have been dealing with for years and highlight efforts to make changes as soon as feasible. It may be helpful to revise the simulation to provide more opportunities for independent problem-solving skills and to incorporate more real-life factors and variables into the scenario. Additionally, developing more individualized approaches to building self-confidence may be helpful, such as providing personalized feedback and guidance based on each student’s strengths and weaknesses.

                Han Xu et al. demonstrate that three distinct firing patterns in dOB M/T cells form a neural coding mechanism for innate fear odors. This coding mechanism requires normal Cdk5 expression, linking M/T cell dynamics to fear-related behavioral responses.

                Rhoads et al. demonstrate that neurons and astrocytes have distinct organelle compositions, morphologies, interactions, distributions, and dynamics. Through direct comparison between cell types, they find that these “organelle signatures” reflect known physiological functions and are remodeled following acute stress in a cell-type- and stress-specific manner.

Free, online webinar platforms offer a powerful way to democratize scientific knowledge and support career development globally. Drawing from our experience building Open Box Science — a not-for-profit grassroots organization that has hosted over 250 webinars for audiences from more than 70 countries — and examining other successful initiatives, we share practical insights on how to build thriving communities for scientific exchange and call for the continuous support of such platforms. We also highlight how early-career scientists can leverage such platforms to expand their network and enrich their perspectives.

">The fecal microbiota transplantation from drug-naive schizophrenia patients distinctively changes gut microbiome and metabolic profiles in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Emerging evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in schizophrenia (SCZ) and antipsychotic-induced metabolic perturbations. Using human fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice, this study investigated the role of gut microbiome in metabolic changes related to SCZ and antipsychotic (olanzapine) treatment. Methods: 5-6 weeks old germ-free NIH Swiss mice of both sexes received microbiota from either SCZ patients (SCZ-FMT) or healthy controls (HC-FMT) followed by a diet with or without olanzapine for six-weeks. Food intake and body weight were monitored weekly, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and open field test were performed. Serum glucose, and insulin were measured. Gut microbiome characterization and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) quantification were performed in the cecal samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Results: Olanzapine treatment decreased the locomotor activity in the open field test, irrespective of sex or microbiota. Female SCZ-FMT recipient mice exhibited insulin resistance compared to HC-FMT, irrespective of olanzapine treatment. Female SCZ-FMT mice showed significantly lower alpha-diversity compared to HC-FMT, whereas olanzapine treatment increased alpha-diversity. SCZ-FMT and olanzapine treatment differentially altered the microbial abundances and metabolic pathways in male and female mice. Interestingly, cecal SCFAs, mainly acetate levels, were significantly decreased in female SCZ-FMT mice compared to HC-FMT, while olanzapine treatment increased acetate levels in male mice. Both male and female SCZ-FMT mice showed elevated levels of isovaleric acid compared to HC-FMT. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that the gut microbiome could be a predisposing factor contributing to the intrinsic risk of developing type 2 diabetes associated with SCZ in females.

">Multiomic profiling reveals pericyte and smooth muscle cell contributions to CADASIL pathology in cell-specific Notch3 mutant mice</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral ischemic small vessel disease (SVD) is the leading cause of vascular dementia and a major contributor to stroke. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common monogenic form of familial SVD. CADASIL is caused by dominant missense mutations in Notch3, a receptor expressed in mural cells, including smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and pericytes. However, the cell-type specific contributions driving the CADASIL pathology remain unknown due to lack of animal models. Here, we generated two conditional knock-in mouse models carrying the CADASIL-causing Notch3R170C mutation selectively in SMC and brain pericytes. Both Notch3R170C models showed perivascular accumulation of the NOTCH3 extracellular domain, yet developed distinct neurovascular changes depending on the affected cell type. Pericyte-specific Notch3R170C mice displayed pronounced region-selective microglial activation and vascular changes, whereas SMC-specific Notch3R170C mice showed localized perivascular gliosis with minimal vascular remodeling. Proteomic profiling of isolated brain vessels revealed largely unique cell-specific responses. Pericytes Notch3R170C expression dysregulated metabolic pathways, whereas SMC Notch3R170C expression induced immune signaling related pathways. Integration with single-cell RNA-seq data revealed that many of the proteomic and phosphoproteomic shifts might also include brain endothelial cells, including metabolic changes in the presence of pericyte Notch3R170C and inflammatory signaling in the presence of SMC-Notch3R170C. Together, these findings define mural cell-specific mechanisms that contribute to the CADASIL-associated vascular pathology.

">Ectopic expression of two cone opsins in mouse RGCs results in opposite responses to light stimulation, likely due to differential G protein activation</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis pigmentosa, a leading cause of inherited blindness, results in photoreceptor degeneration that current optogenetic approaches aim to address through microbial opsin expression in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). While these microbial proteins restore light sensitivity, their clinical potential remains limited by low light sensitivity and immunogenicity risks. Recent efforts have focused on vertebrate opsins as safer alternatives, with mid-wavelength cone opsin (MW-opsin) demonstrating RGC depolarization via endogenous G-protein signaling. In this study, we reveal a surprising divergence in signaling outcomes of expressing short-wavelength mouse cone opsin (Opn1sw) in RGCs of blind mice. Using multielectrode array recordings and whole-cell patch clamping, we demonstrate that Opn1sw induces membrane hyperpolarization in RGCs - a stark contrast to MW-opsin's depolarizing effects. This unexpected inversion suggests differential engagement of intracellular signaling pathways, potentially stemming from distinct G-protein coupling preferences. Comparative analysis of native G-protein expression profiles in RGCs versus cone photoreceptors supports this hypothesis, revealing mismatches that may explain ectopic opsin behavior. Our findings challenge the assumption of conserved opsin signaling across spectral subtypes and cell types, highlighting critical gaps in understanding vertebrate opsin-G protein interactions in non-native cellular environments. This discovery points to the necessity of systematic characterization of opsin signaling networks in target retinal cells, a prerequisite for engineering optimized optogenetic tools that reliably produce desired electrophysiological outcomes. By establishing spectral subtype-dependent signaling divergence, our work redefines parameters for developing next-generation vision restoration therapies.

">High-frequency, low-intensity pulsed electric field and N-acetylcysteine synergistically protect SH-SY5Y cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell damage in vitro</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress plays an important role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has gained attention as a potential agent due to its antioxidant capabilities. This study investigated the synergistic neuroprotective effects of combining NAC with non-contact high-frequency low-intensity pulsed electric field (H-LIPEF) stimulation on SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells subjected to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage. It was found that after SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with NAC and exposed to H-LIPEF stimulation, the oxidative stress of cells was reduced in the subsequent treatment with H2O2. The results showed that the combined NAC and H-LIPEF treatment significantly improved cell viability and better preserved cellular morphology compared to either treatment alone. Additionally, this combination treatment more effectively reduced mitochondrial apoptosis. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the combination substantially decreased levels of superoxide and intracellular H2O2, which was associated with enhanced activation of the p-Akt/Nrf2/SOD2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the treatment reduced the accumulation of 8-oxo-dG accumulation and elevated MTH1 expression, indicating a protective effect against oxidative DNA damage. These results suggest that H-LIPEF enhances the neuroprotective efficacy of low-dose NAC, highlighting the potential of this combination approach as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NDDs.

">Neurophysiological Sensitivity to Envelope and Pulse Timing Interaural Time Differences in Cochlear Implanted Rats with Different Hearing Experiences</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear implants (CIs) have successfully restored hearing in more than one million patients with severe to profound hearing loss worldwide. While CIs effectively restore speech perception in quiet environments, sound localization remains challenging for bilateral CI users, particularly their ability to utilize interaural time differences (ITDs). The majority of clinical CI processors use a coding strategy that encodes ITD information only in the envelope of electrical pulse trains rather than their pulse timing, which may contribute to the poorer spatial hearing perception of CI users. We recently demonstrated in a behavioral study on early deafened, bilaterally CI-implanted rats that pulse timing ITDs completely dominate ITD perception, while sensitivity to envelope ITDs is almost negligible in comparison. Building on this, we here investigated the neurophysiological sensitivity of the inferior colliculus (IC) to envelope and pulse timing ITDs at two different pulse rates (900 and 4500 pulses/s) and three different stimulation modulations (5, 20 and 100 Hz) in CI rats with different hearing experiences. Our results indicate that IC neurons exhibit far greater sensitivity to pulse timing ITD than envelope ITD independent of pulse rate, modulation rate or hearing experience. These findings suggest that to improve binaural hearing outcome in bilateral CI users, clinical stimulation strategies should provide informative pulse timing ITDs.

">From ambiguous object to illusory faces: EEG decoding reveals a dynamic cascade of face pareidolia</a></h4>

              
                Face pareidolia, perceiving faces in inanimate objects, provides a unique window into how the brain constructs perceptual meaning from ambiguous visual input. In this work, we investigated the neural dynamics of face pareidolia, testing the hypothesis that it emerges from a temporal cascade that integrates global (low spatial frequency, LSF) and local (high spatial frequency, HSF) visual information. With a pareidolia detection task, we combined event-related potentials (ERP), multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to map the evolving neural code for illusory face perception. Behaviorally, participants experienced pareidolia from both LSF and HSF stimuli, but the percept was strongest for broadband images containing both frequency bands. Electrophysiological results revealed a clear temporal progression. Early processing (<150 ms) was driven by low-level attributes, with distinct P100/N100 components and neural representations for LSF and HSF signals. A critical shift occurred around 145 ms, after which MVPA decoding could reliably distinguish between images perceived as faces and those that were not. Concurrently, RSA showed that the geometry of neural representations shifted to reflect participants' subjective face-likeness ratings, rather than the initial physical properties of the stimuli. This transition to a higher-order, subjective evaluation was marked by a later N250 component, whose amplitude indexed the cognitive load of integrating the visual cues. Together, these findings demonstrate that face pareidolia is a dynamic neural cascade, from early sensory encoding to higher-order perceptual evaluation, driven by the integration of global configuration and local features of visual stimuli. Our results illuminate how the brain transforms ambiguous input into meaningful social perception, offering insight into the temporal dynamics of visual awareness.

">Sex Differences in Plasma Levels of Endocannabinoids and Related Lipids Before and After acute and repeated mTBI: an exploratory study for plasma biomarkers for mTBI</a></h4>

              
                Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common diagnosis across all age groups and while most symptoms resolve within a few weeks; between 10 and 25 percent of mTBI patients suffer long-term problems. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), symptoms include headache, a range of cognitive deficits, and depression. Currently, there are no established treatments for PCS and no clear predictive biometrics to determine which patients are at increased risk. Previous studies have identified some protein-derived plasma biomarkers for mTBI, however, the effects of mTBI on lipid signaling molecules and metabolites in blood is largely unknown. Endogenous lipids (endolipids) such as the endocannabinoids (eCBs) and their congeners are lipid signaling molecules that are associated with promoting neuroprotective responses after head trauma in animal models. Here, we examine the plasma lipidome using a rat model of acute and repeated mTBI that we previously demonstrated had a sex dependent change in neuroinflammation wherein females showed a higher degree of neurodegeneration after repeated head-injury than males. Key results of this exploratory lipidomics screen here demonstrates that acute head injury drives significantly more changes in plasma endolipids in males (32%) than females (8%), whereas, on the second day of head injury, only 11% change in males but 15% in females. Some key endolipids were modified in both males are precursors for resolving molecules and this was lacking in females. Given that females with repeated mTBI in this model demonstrated aspects of PCS, this could be an important component in evaluating clinical cases. Endolipids in the screen were measurable in plasma using only 100 microL, a volume necessary to be able to perform multiple blood draws on these rodent subjects. This threshold provides evidence that the levels of these endolipids could be readily measured throughout patient recovery. Therefore, this family of endolipids has the potential to provide data on the progression of the injury and could be another crucial aspect in predicting mTBI outcomes.

">Temporal dynamics of neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration in the central auditory system following noise-induced hearing loss: A multimodal imaging and histological study</a></h4>

              
                Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a sensorineural disorder that triggers profound neuroplastic and neurodegenerative consequences in the central auditory nervous system (CNS). This study examined how neuronal density, axonal integrity and glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission are affected after acute overstimulation in the central inferior colliculus (CIC) and the ventral medial geniculate body of the thalamus (MGV). To achieve this, a correlative multimodal approach combining audiometric, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological biomarkers was performed. Adult mice were noise-exposed to broadband white noise (5-20 kHz) for 3 hours at either high (115 dB SPL) or moderate (90 dB SPL) intensity, while unexposed mice were used as controls. Separate cohorts of mice were investigated 1-, 7-, 56- and 84-days post-exposure using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter density (GMD), diffusion MRI (dMRI) of microstructure and connectivity, and single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) for glutamate and GABA quantification. Frequency-specific auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded at 4, 8, 16 and 32 kHz before and after exposure to examine hearing threshold (HT) shifts. Following imaging, brains were processed for fluorescence immunohistochemistry (FIHC) targeting Neuronal Nuclear Protein (NeuN), 4',6-diamidino-2-fenilindo (DAPI), Neurofilament (SMI312), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and vesicular glutamate transporters 1 (VGLUT1) and 2 (VGLUT2). HTs were significantly elevated 7d, 56d and 84d after 115 dB noise exposure, suggesting a NIHL phenotype. Neurofilament density significantly increased in the CIC and MGV 1d after 115 dB noise exposure, and returned to baseline at later time points. dMRI transient microstructural alterations were observed 7d after 90 dB noise exposure. Glutamate and GABA decreases 84d after 90 dB exposure were also detected. Moreover, correlation analysis between audiometric, histological and MRI datasets revealed scarce relationships between the investigated parameters. These findings advance our understanding of the CNS adaptations of NIHL and emphasizes the need for more sensitive and integrative approaches to identify robust biomarkers of central auditory dysfunction.

">Building the blood-brain barrier: a scalable self-assembling 3D model of the brain microvasculature under unidirectional flow</a></h4>

              
                The blood vessels of the central nervous (CNS) system form a tight, protective blood-brain barrier (BBB). This barrier is essential for healthy CNS function but also poses a hurdle in the treatment of increasingly common neurological disorders. Additionally, BBB dysfunction is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, further emphasizing a need for a better understanding of BBB function in health and disease. We present a human self-assembling 3D model of the BBB in a microfluidic cell culture platform that allows culture of 48 models in parallel on one tissue culture plate. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes form highly reproducible BBB vascular networks under unidirectional perfusion and remain viable for a minimum of 14 days. Immunostaining reveals close cell-cell interactions with pericytes and astrocyte end-feet in direct contact with the brain microvasculature. Compared to endothelial monocultures, co-culture with astrocytes or pericytes results in improved barrier function, lower vessel diameters, increased branching, and alignment of the vessels in the direction of fluid flow. These results were most pronounced in tri-cultures containing all three cell types. Unlike similar models previously reported, this brain microvasculature model allows for unidirectional perfusion without the need for pumps and syringes. Combined with its high-throughput nature, this feature renders the model suitable for studies of BBB function in health and disease, and assessment of potential BBB restorative therapies.

                This paper presents an approach of combining Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) signals to create a hybrid Brain Interface Computer (BCI) device for controlling a hand exoskeleton through classifying the flexion attempt and resting states of the subjects. We analyzed data of 51 healthy and patients with brain lesions that involved the motor cortex and different hand movement disorders. Their EMG and EEG activity were recorded while the subjects attempted to move their index finger. The signals are analyzed through deep neural network, restricted Boltzmann machine and LDA classifier methods to access a reliable accuracy. Further, to evaluate the proposed approach, we designed and implemented a robotic system for rehabilitation of the hand movement to show that it is able to derive assistive control, by detecting flexion movement from the signals as a command and send it to robot. The system is combined with control signals that determine the information of flexion according to measured EMG signals.

">Age-related inflammatory changes and perineuronal net dynamics: implications for neurodegenerative disorders.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthy aging alone can lead to cognitive decline, decreased brain size, protein aggregation, accumulation of senescent cells and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Age-related neuroinflammation, as known as inflammaging, is thought to restrict brain plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular matrix structures surrounding fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, regulate plasticity and protect neurons from oxidative stress. Given the known impact of inflammaging on neural circuits, this study examines age-associated changes in PNN homeostasis, glial activation, and neuroinflammation in two brain regions relevant to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: We analyzed young (4-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) C57BL/6J male mice for several behavioral phenotypes [hippocampal-dependent spatial learning using the Barnes maze; locomotion and anxiety-related behaviors using Open field and T-maze]. Using immunostaining, PNNs (Wisteria floribunda agglutinin and aggrecan), PV interneurons, and microglial activation (Iba1) were quantified in both the hippocampus and dorsal striatum. Glial morphology was examined using a battery of cell body, branching, and endpoint analyses. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze changes in the gene expression of inflammatory and extracellular matrix markers. Results: Aged mice exhibited hippocampal-dependent memory deficits without alterations in locomotion or anxiety-related behavior. PNN counts increased in the aged hippocampus, particularly in CA2, with a higher proportion of WFA and aggrecan PNNs. In contrast, PNN homeostasis was maintained in the dorsal striatum. In general, Aged mice showed increases in microglial activation and a subset of inflammatory markers. We report brain region- and age- specific gene expression changes in complement, matrix metalloproteinases, and other inflammatory markers. Aged striatal microglia displayed an activated morphology with larger cell bodies and reduced branching, as well as increased expression of markers for microgliosis (Iba1, TREM2, CD68). Conclusions: These findings suggest that aging differentially affects neuroinflammation and PNN integrity across brain regions. The hippocampus exhibits PNN accumulation, neuroinflammation, and behavioral changes, whereas the striatum maintains PNN homeostasis concurrent with increased microglial activation. This work suggests that neuroinflammation contributes to age-related changes in PNNs and behavior underscoring the importance of region-specific therapeutic strategies targeting PNN regulation.

">SFRP1 drives glycolytic activation in astrocytes during neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes and microglia maintain brain homeostasis and respond to inflammation through functions coordinated by molecular mediators they produce. Growing evidence shows that cellular metabolism is key to how these cells adapt to challenges. However, little is known about what drives glial metabolic reprogramming or whether molecules involved in astrocyte microglia crosstalk also regulate this process. Here, we explored this question focusing on Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 1 (SFRP1). SFRP1 is an astrocyte-derived factor induced by inflammatory cues and overexpressed in neurodegeneration, which fosters microglial response to inflammation through NFkappaB and HIF dependent programs. We combined mitochondrial morphometry (MitoTracker Red and MiNA analysis) with Seahorse extracellular flux assays (Mito Stress Test) to determine whether SFRP1 modulates glial bioenergetics in primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia from wild-type and Sfrp1-/- mice. We report that SFRP1 acts as a driver of astrocytic metabolic activation, preferentially enhancing glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. This effect is most pronounced during inflammation, when oxidative phosphorylation is restricted and SFRP1 enhances glycolytic flexibility to sustain energy demands. By contrast, microglia showed the expected LPS-driven glycolytic shift with minimal dependence on SFRP1 under monoculture conditions. These findings position SFRP1 as a candidate regulator of astrocyte-centered metabolic tuning during neuroinflammation, with implications for disorders such as Alzheimer s disease, in which SFRP1 is elevated.

">From Chewing to Chirping: The Misophonia Audiovisual Trigger Archive (MATA)</a></h4>

              
                Misophonia is an emerging condition in which everyday sounds, such as chewing, sniffing, or tapping, evoke disproportionately intense emotional and physiological responses. Despite growing recognition of its clinical significance, progress in understanding misophonia has been hindered by the limited availability of standardized and ecologically valid stimulus sets. Here, we present a large, open-access archive of 1,300 five-second audiovisual clips spanning 12 empirically validated categories of misophonic triggers. This resource extends beyond orofacial movement-related sounds to include a diverse array of real-world triggers, and its audiovisual format enables systematic investigation of how visual context shapes responses to misophonic sounds. The archive lowers the barrier for laboratories to study misophonia, promotes reproducibility across sites, and offers applications ranging from crowdsourced assessments of population-level sensitivities to machine learning approaches for automated trigger detection. By providing the largest and most diverse audiovisual misophonia stimulus repository to date, this resource is designed to accelerate mechanistic, clinical, and translational research on misophonia and related sensory-emotional phenomena.

">Claustrum volume in human lifespan trajectory and effect of age, hemisphere, and sex</a></h4>

              
                The human claustrum is a bilateral, thin, irregularly shaped gray matter structure located between the striatum and insula. While previous research demonstrated the effect of distinct medical conditions, such as prematurity, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease, on claustrum function and structure, it is poorly understood how non-pathologic biological conditions effect the claustrum. This study aimed to investigate the effect of age, hemisphere, and sex on claustrum volume. We used T1-weighted 3 Tesla MRI scans of 3,474 healthy participants ranging from 1 to 80 years of age, deep learning-based automated claustrum segmentation, and a normative modelling approach to delineate lifespan trajectories of claustrum volumes for both hemispheres and sexes. Additionally, ordinary least squares regression analyses were applied to further characterize age, hemisphere, and sex effect. Lifespan analysis revealed a trajectory of rapid claustrum volume increase from infancy to adolescence (~ 1 - 15 years, annual growth 39.300 mm3/year), a plateau phase from early to middle adulthood (~ 15 - 40 years, annual change 0.153 mm3/year), and a subsequent decline from middle adulthood to old age (~ 40 - 80 years, annual decrease 10.325 mm3/year). The right claustrum was on average larger than the left one across all ages. Finally, overall, females had larger total intracranial volume-adjusted claustrum volumes than males across the lifespan. Results demonstrate a distinct effect of age, hemisphere, and sex on claustrum volume. Data provide a comprehensive framework for sex- and hemisphere-sensitive claustrum structure lifespan trajectories relevant for studying neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative effects on the claustrum.

">Interareal and interlaminar differences in sound envelope encoding in core and parabelt auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Amplitude-modulation (AM) plays an important role in the perception of complex sounds, and transformations in AM encoding may underlie aspects of complex sound perception. Previous studies have described a hierarchical progression across the auditory pathway, characterized by a decrease in the temporal precision of AM encoding. In human and nonhuman primates (NHP), the left hemisphere exhibits enhanced temporal encoding relative to the right hemisphere. The NHP model provides an opportunity to understand what circuit mechanisms generate these transformations in encoding by characterizing AM encoding in different intracortical circuits, and across the cortical hierarchy. To address this, here we report the encoding of AM signals as a function of cortical layer and hemisphere in NHP core and parabelt auditory cortex (AC). We recorded electrophysiological activity using linear array multielectrodes positioned across cortical layers while AM noise and click trains were presented to awake NHPs. Core AC typically encoded all AM frequencies (1.6-200 Hz) with high ( > 90%) classification accuracy, while sites in the parabelt encoded a subset of lower (~1.6-25 Hz) frequencies. Across both areas, the granular and infragranular layers displayed enhanced AM encoding relative to the supragranular layers. Both areas displayed enhanced AM encoding in the left hemisphere, restricted to the supragranular layers. These results represent the first analysis of AM encoding in the parabelt, indicating that significant temporal encoding of AM is still present in tertiary auditory cortex, and the layer-specific hemispheric differences suggest a potential supragranular layer origin of previously documented left-hemisphere dominance in temporal encoding.

">Striatal spinophilin enhances D2R interaction with cytosolic proteins to mediate persistent D2R agonist-induced locomotor suppression.</a></h4>

              
                Loss of dopamine neurons in Parkinson disease (PD) leads to motor deficits. Dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonists treat PD-associated motor deficits by acting on postsynaptic receptors located within the striatum that have been upregulated due dopamine loss. However, mechanisms that contribute to increased D2R activity in PD that enhance D2R function are poorly described. Spinophilin is a protein phosphatase 1 targeting protein that is expressed in postsynaptic dendritic spines and interacts with postsynaptic D2Rs. However, how spinophilin regulates D2R function is unknown. In the current study, we found that genetic knockout of spinophilin limited the suppression of locomotion caused by the D2R agonist, quinpirole. Mechanistically, we found that spinophilin is required for quinpirole-induced increases in the interaction of the D2R with intracellular proteins, suggesting spinophilin mediates agonist-induced D2R internalization. Therefore, our data support future studies targeting the spinophilin/D2R interaction to enhance the efficacy of current PD therapeutics.

">A paradigm shift of SERPINA3N in neurobehavioral development and brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Murine serine protease inhibitor clade A member 3N (SERPINA3N) and its human ortholog SERPINA3 are dysregulated in neurological disorders. SERPINA3N has been proposed as a protective factor, enhancing neurobehavioral development under homeostasis and mitigating neuronal/glial and vascular damage under neurological conditions. Here, we employed powerful, non-invasive genetic tools to revisit the concept of SERPINA3N in brain development and injury. Brain-specific SERPINA3N overexpression neither alters neuronal or glial development nor improves cognitive ability under homeostasis. In stark contrast, SERPINA3N drives a pro-inflammatory response to brain injury and exacerbates blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Its overexpression promotes neurodegeneration through apoptosis-mediated neuronal loss and disrupts oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination following neonatal brain injury. Collectively, our findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of SERPINA3N in neurodevelopment and injury, revealing that while SERPINA3N is dispensable for neurobehavioral development, it aggravates neural injury and vascular damage under pathological conditions.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS), is a rare, poorly-understood epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep associated with mutations in <i>GRIN2A</i>, encoding the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2A subunit. Physicians rely on empirical treatments, with scarce information on treatment efficacy and outcomes. This study aims to improve the understanding and clinical management of LKS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-two patients with LKS were recruited via one quaternary referral center. Case-notes review delineated clinical features, long-term outcomes, and prognostic factors. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine the longitudinal association among electroencephalogram abnormalities, steroid therapy, and neuropsychological findings. After genetic screening, the impact of identified <i>GRIN2A</i> missense variants on NMDAR function was assessed using homology modeling, cell-surface trafficking assays, and electrophysiology in artificial synapses. Whole exome/genome sequencing was performed on <i>GRIN2A</i>-negative patients to identify novel gene associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LKS is complex with significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Besides speech and language impairment, many patients had other co-morbidities and almost half have long-term disability. Early age at disease onset was associated with worse outcomes. There was no reliable correlation between electroencephalogram findings and developmental scores. Steroid therapy improved language outcomes independently of electroencephalogram findings. <i>GRIN2A</i> mutations were identified in 15.5% of the cohort. Likely pathogenic variants in <i>GABBR2</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>TRPC1</i>, <i>ERRFI1</i>, <i>CTXN3</i>, <i>IRX6</i>, and <i>IQCA1</i> were identified in 7 <i>GRIN2A-</i>negative individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For LKS, early intervention is important for long-term outcomes. Furthermore, management should not be based solely on electroencephalogram findings. Genetic and functional investigations offer insights into disease pathophysiology and facilitate development of future targeted therapies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78031?af=R">Identification of New KCNT1‐Epilepsy Drugs by In Silico, Cell, and Drosophila Modeling</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hyperactive KCNT1 potassium channels, caused by gain-of-function mutations, are associated with a range of epilepsy disorders. Patients typically experience drug-resistant seizures and, in cases with infantile onset, developmental regression can follow. KCNT1-related disorders include epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. There are currently no effective treatments for KCNT1 epilepsies, but suppressing overactive channels poses a potential strategy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the KCNT1 channel structure we in silico screened a library of known drugs for those predicted to block the channel pore to inhibit channel activity. Cellular KCNT1 channel inhibition was analyzed using electrophysiology and <i>Drosophila</i> bang-sensitive assays were used to analyze seizure suppression. Brain penetration of one drug was analyzed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in a mouse.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eight known drugs were investigated in vitro for their effects on patient-specific mutant KCNT1 channels, with 4 drugs showing significant reduction of K<sup>+</sup> current amplitudes. The action of the 4 drugs was then analyzed in vivo and 2 were found to reduce the seizure phenotype in humanized <i>Drosophila</i> KCNT1 epilepsy models. One drug, antrafenine, was shown to cross the blood–brain barrier in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identified a known drug, antrafenine, that reduces KCNT1 channel activity, reduces seizure activity in <i>Drosophila</i>, and crosses the blood–brain barrier in the mouse, suggesting its potential applicability as a new treatment for KCNT1 epilepsy. The sequential in silico, in vitro, and in vivo mechanism-based drug selection strategy used here may have broader application for other human disorders where a disease mechanism has been identified.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78032?af=R">Behavior Decoding Delineates Seizure Microfeatures and Associated Sudden Death Risks in Mouse Models of Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Behavior and motor manifestations are distinctive yet often overlooked features of epileptic seizures. Seizures can result in transient disruptions in motor control, often organized into specific behavioral sequences that can inform seizure types, onset zones, and outcomes. However, refined analysis of behaviors in epilepsy remains challenging. Current manual video inspection approaches are subjective, time-consuming, and often overlook the intricate behavioral dynamics and action kinematics. This study investigates whether artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools can unravel complex behavior repertoire that can delineate seizure outcomes in a data-driven manner.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized two AI-aided tools, DeepLabCut (DLC) and Behavioral Segmentation of Open Field in DLC (B-SOiD), to decode underexplored behavior and action domains of induced seizures in a population of 32 inbred mouse strains that mimic human genetic diversity and a mouse model of Angelman syndrome.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our automated behavior classification tool identified 63 interpretable behavior groups. Analysis of these behavior groups demonstrates significant differential behavior usage and complexity that can delineate distinct seizure states, unravel intrinsic seizure progression over time, and inform mouse sex, strain backgrounds, and specific pathogenic mutations. We also identified seizure behavior transition dynamics and action/subaction kinematics, like hindlimb motions, that can determine the risks of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These behavior microfeatures can facilitate preclinical mechanistic studies and antiseizure medication screening at scales. These findings also underscore the translational potential of video-based seizure behavior decoding in both inpatient and outpatient settings, including analyzing videos captured by home surveillance devices and ubiquitous smartphones.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/9/ENEURO.0034-25.2025?rss=1">Depression Levels Are Associated with Reduced Capacity to Learn to Actively Avoid Aversive Events in Young Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Depression and anxiety are often characterized by altered reward-seeking and avoidance, respectively. Yet less is known about the relationship between depressive symptoms and specific avoidance behaviors. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. In Study 1, undergraduates and online workers completed an uninstructed go/no-go avoidance task (<I>N</I><SUB>Total</SUB> = 465) as a reverse translation of a rodent paradigm. Participants exhibited a wide range of symptom scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), ranging from low to severe. In Study 1, cues were used to signal the response type (go/active vs no-go/inhibitory) required to avoid an aversive sound. Higher depressive scores were associated with poorer acquisition of active avoidance in undergraduates. Overall participants showed lower accuracy for active than inhibitory avoidance. To examine whether the better no-go trial performance reflected a prepotent response to avoid aversive outcomes, in Study 2, undergraduates (<I>N</I><SUB>Total</SUB> = 330) completed a version of the task that included reward-seeking. Here all participants showed higher accuracy for active reward-seeking and inhibitory avoidance, consistent with a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid aversive consequences. These findings suggest that in young adults, depressive symptoms are associated with difficulty in overriding prepotent responses to actively avoid aversive outcomes in the absence of reward. This work bridges the gap between preclinical animal models and clinical research, offering insights that could guide the development of more targeted clinical interventions.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) imposes a significant global health burden, yet effective treatments remain limited. There are no well-characterized, AUD-relevant, rodent biological sample repositories to support research in this area. To address this gap, we established the Alcohol Biobank, a comprehensive resource containing thousands of samples from over 700 (half males, half females) genetically diverse heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. Modeled after two successful cocaine and oxycodone biobanks, this repository uses the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) model, paired with oral self-administration, to characterize AUD-like behaviors, including ethanol consumption, preference, motivation, and withdrawal symptoms such as allodynia and anxiety-like behavior. Longitudinal samples (blood, urine, and feces) are collected before, during, and after ethanol exposure, while tissue samples (brain, heart, kidneys, liver, cecum, reproductive organs, adrenal glands, blood) are obtained at intoxication, acute withdrawal, protracted abstinence, or from naive controls. Samples are preserved via snap-freezing or paraformaldehyde fixation to support diverse applications, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and neuroanatomy. Samples are freely available to nonprofit organizations at <A HREF="www.alcoholbiobank.org">www.alcoholbiobank.org</A>. Genetic and behavioral data about these rats are deposited in public repositories. The Alcohol Biobank facilitates collaborative research to uncover biomarkers and develop novel therapies for AUD, addressing a critical need in addiction science.</p>

                <p>Aversion modulation is a key component of hedonic processing, and its dysfunction is evident in psychiatric illnesses. The infralimbic cortex (IL) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) pathway is essential in hedonic processing in rodents but operates differentially across sex, with beta (20&nbsp;Hz) oscillatory activity involved in learned aversion in male but not female rats. In this study, we used taste reactivity (TR) and electrophysiology to examine the role of high gamma (80&nbsp;Hz) activity in affect modulation, specifically innate (quinine) and learned (conditioned taste aversion, CTA) aversion, in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Local field potential (LFP) recordings in males showed no changes in IL or NAcSh activity, or in IL-&gt;NAcSh functional connectivity, in the high gamma frequency band during innate or learned aversion. In contrast, in females, quinine elicited an increase in IL and NAcSh 80&nbsp;Hz LFP activity and IL-&gt;NAcSh functional connectivity. Interestingly, LFP directionality analyses in females indicated that top-down modulation from IL to NAcSh was associated with innate aversive behavior expression. To confirm a causal link of 80&nbsp;Hz activity in aversion processing in females, optogenetics was used. Here, optogenetic stimulation of the IL-&gt;NAcSh pathway did not affect learned (CTA) aversion but it selectively decreased innate (quinine) aversion. Collectively, these results highlight sex- and frequency-specific differences in aversion modulation by the IL-&gt;NAcSh pathway, with high gamma frequencies involved in modulating innate aversion, specifically in female rats.</p>

                Background Neuropathy is common in both Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Leprosy, often resulting in neuropathic ulcers. Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers are frequently misdiagnosed as DM-related, causing delays in appropriate care. We report a case which had been misdiagnosed at three different healthcare centers before receiving the correct diagnosis and management. Methods The case report adopt the CARE Guidelines and was conducted at the Wound Care Specialist Clinic. Data were collected using a Minimum Data Set (MDS) to capture demographics, health history, and history of treatments. A head-to-toe assessment focused on the eyes, hands, and feet, with neuropathy, confirmed using the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament test, and angiopathy was assessed by palpating the dorsal pedis and posterior tibialis pulse. Wound care interventions consisted of cleansing, debridement, and dressing. Given the similarities between Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers and DM-related neuropathic ulcers, the DMIST (depth, maceration, inflammation/infection, size, tissue type of the wound bed, type of wound edge, and tunnelling/undermining) tool was used to evaluate wound healing progress. Results Anamnesis indicated patient has no DM, with normal blood glucose; however, the patient had neuropathic wounds on her feet, asymmetrical eyebrow distribution, and rashes on her hands and calves, with neuropathy confirmed by a monofilament test—initial treatment involved Cadexomer Iodine powder to control bacterial growth and Honey-based gel to promote granulation. Over 62 days, 11 treatments were administered, with an average dressing change every 5.6 days, which improved the DMIST score from 12 to 4 by the end of observation day. Conclusions This case report highlights the significance of distinguishing leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers from those associated with DM to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. By employing comprehensive assessment tools and targeted wound care interventions, significant improvements in wound healing were achieved, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and clinical vigilance in managing Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers.

                Background Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent bacterial infection among women of reproductive age. Inappropriate and irrational prescribing of antibiotics—such as the use of unapproved fixed-dose combinations or empirical broad-spectrum therapy—has contributed to growing antimicrobial resistance. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) further complicate treatment outcomes, yet remain underreported, especially in routine outpatient practice. Therefore, an assessment of current prescribing patterns is essential to promote rational drug use. Additionally, evaluation of adverse drug reactions remains important for patient safety and pharmacovigilance. Objectives • To describe the prescribing patterns of drugs used for urinary tract infections (UTIs) among women of reproductive age (15–44 years). • To evaluate the incidence, type, and severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as documented in hospital records. • To assess the prescription of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) and combination antimicrobial therapy in relation to standard treatment guidelines (WHO, NLEM 2022). Methods This is a retrospective observational study based on outpatient department (OPD) prescriptions for women aged 15–44 years diagnosed with community-acquired, uncomplicated UTIs at a tertiary care hospital in Central India. Data from 139 prescription records will be retrieved from the medical record section and analyzed. Prescribing indicators, documented ADRs, and use of FDCs will be assessed against national guidelines using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis.

                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Background A. catechu (Areca catechu Linn.; A. catechu) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Dendrathema grandiflora (chrysanthemum; D. grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared A. catechu and D. grandiflora polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (20% A. catechu:80% D. grandiflora), F2 (50% A. catechu:50% D. grandiflora), F3 (80% A. catechu:20% D. grandiflora), and normal group. Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenase assay, high concentration of A. catechu (F3) induced the abundant of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions The combination of A. catechu and D. grandiflora extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background The conventional preanesthetic evaluation process can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Preanesthetic questionnaires have been proposed to alleviate the burden on clinical resources. This study aimed to assess the reliability and predictive accuracy of a pediatric preanesthetic screening questionnaire as a potential alternative to the standard preanesthetic consultation. Methods An evaluative, prospective, cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted from October 2022 to May 2023 in the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Anesthesiology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis. A 43-item bilingual (French/Arabic) paper-based questionnaire was completed for 300 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) scheduled for elective surgery. Responses were compared with standard preanesthetic evaluations by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) for agreement. Results All 300 patients completed the questionnaire (completion rate = 100%). Most were classified as ASA Physical Status I (78.3%). Agreement between questionnaire responses and physician assessments was excellent for 34 of 43 items (κ > 0.8; p < 0.001), with perfect agreement (κ = 1.000; p < 0.001) for item 10. Near-perfect agreement was observed for ASA classification (κ = 0.953; p < 0.001; concordance rate = 98.3%). Eight items had κ values between 0.397 and 0.798, and one item (myopathy) could not be analyzed due to uniformly negative responses. Conclusion The pediatric preanesthesia questionnaire demonstrated high reliability and strong agreement with physician assessments. It may serve as an effective triage tool to optimize outpatient workflows and reduce clinical workload, particularly for low-risk pediatric patients.

                Forest fires are becoming increasingly common worldwide, posing a threat to the environment, economy, and society. Spatiotemporal analysis of forest fires is important to understand their characteristics and causes and to inform decision-making. This type of analysis requires the availability of a number of factors that contribute to fire occurrence, such as land use, environment, climate, and human activities, at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The South American Amazon rainforest covers a large area, and acquiring a useful dataset for analysis requires extensive effort and computer-intensive processing. This study investigates potential data sources, establishes a methodology, and prepares a dataset of attributes useful for spatiotemporal fire analysis. We provide a raster-based dataset that includes fires, land use, environment, and climate factors at a spatial resolution of 500 m and monthly resolution from 2001 to 2020, which facilitates the analysis of forest fires in the Amazon. Moreover, because data sources and implementation procedures are detailed, this work also encourages similar research in other parts of the world.

                Background Synthetic cells have emerged as promising tools for targeted, efficient, and sustainable environmental cleanup, and there is a growing need to understand not only their technical potential but also the biosafety, biosecurity, and governance implications of their deployment in natural ecosystems. Despite their innovative promise, there are currently no standardized global frameworks to assess and manage their risks, particularly those concerning ecological disruption, misuse, and public acceptance. Therefore, this study explored the dual nature of synthetic cells as a tool for ecological restoration. Method This study conducted stakeholder perception analysis through seven expert interviews and surveys involving 70 respondents, primarily from academia and the environmental policy sector. Thematic analysis was used to extract the key concerns. Results Stakeholders highlighted the strong support for the potential of technology in pollutant degradation and climate mitigation. However, major concerns have emerged regarding unintended gene transfer, containment failure, dual-use risks, and a lack of international regulation. The thematic analysis revealed the need for risk assessment strategies, containment measures, and regulatory oversight. Conclusion Recommendations include the development of standardized risk assessment protocols, lifecycle containment strategies, transparent public engagement, and international collaboration. Policymakers must act early to ensure that the environmental benefits of this emerging technology can be realized while mitigating the associated risks.

                This paper’s main purpose is to systematically review both theoretical and empirical literature about the relationship between corporate governance variables and the performance of microfinance institutions. The theoretical reviews were: agency theory, stakeholders’ theory, resource dependency theory, stewardship theory, and social contract theory, which deal with corporate governance mechanism and their effect on the firm’s performance. Empirical studies carried out in different countries at different times together with other findings, were reviewed to compare the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of microfinance institutions and to establish areas of gaps for further studies. Board characteristics, which include size, education, meeting frequency, board composition, and board independence, and their effect on the financial performance of microfinance institutions were discussed. The findings of the study reveal that sound corporate governance improves the performance of Microfinance Institutions. The findings of different scholars show a lack of consistency on the effect of corporate governance variables on the financial performance of Microfinance Institutions, so further investigation is required from potential scholars. Finally, theoretical, measurement, and methodological drawbacks of previous studies were identified, and significant recommendations were forwarded for future studies in this area.

                Gamification has become relevant in the field of higher education, facilitating the teaching and learning process. There are studies that show a positive relationship between gamification and academic performance. A systematic literature review was developed, applying the prism method and using three databases: Scopus, WOS and Scielo. The results indicate a notorious orientation of the studies towards quantitative research. Ninety-two percent of the selected documents have students as their population, while 6% are oriented to teachers and 2% to both. In the more in-depth results, it can be demonstrated that gamification is linked to the generation of critical thinking and the improvement of academic performance in the context of higher education. The analysis of theoretical structures reveals that the most relevant approaches for the study of gamification are self-determination and gamified learning. It is also evident that there is a positive relationship between gamification and motivation in learning processes, which allows encouraging the development of critical thinking and the improvement of academic performance.

Instagram, by its geotag and hashtag features, provides a formidable database of the sort, in which user activity can strongly impact the salience of material loci. The study aimed at determining and calculating the Tehran Book Garden urban space’s popularity by using the #bookgarden hashtag and geolocations of the active Instagram userbase. Techniques The data were gathered on Instagram via the Application Programming Interface (API) and then analyzed via spatial networking on geographical mappings. Key variables included the geo-coordinate positions of posts, concentration of user activity, and time-based trends. The interpolation method was then used in determining regions that have unusual patterns of networking based on the hashtag and determining the area of influence most actively engaged. Results and Conclusions The study showed that central and southeastern regions of Tehran exhibited highest levels of virtual activity concerning the Book Garden. Using a triangulation-based interpolation method, the study traced a specific zone of influence, acknowledging the spatial location of the Book Garden and neighboring culture districts as a “hidden layer” having a significant impact (Level 4) on the space’s popularness. The study showed that peak activity was at 4 PM, and access issues were correlated with lower popularness during evening hours. This work presents a novel and reliable methodology for determining the attractiveness of cityscapes through social media data, thus providing a reproducible template for later research in the context of urban geography.

                Background this study examines the modernization of Saudi’s Commercial Agency Law the 2022–2023 reforms, with a focus on legal, economic, and comparative dimensions. For decades, the previous framework faced criticism for its rigid nationality restrictions, procedural inefficiencies, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The reforms form part of the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy, aiming to diversify the economy, strengthen private sector competitiveness, and integrate more fully with global trade systems. This research also evaluates how the reforms align with Shariah principles, balancing commercial flexibility with religious compliance. Methods the study adopts a doctrinal legal methodology, systematically analyzing statutory amendments and implementing regulations considering Saudi case law and policy statements. A comparative approach is employed to benchmark the reforms against best practices in jurisdictions such as the UAE and the UK, with particular emphasis on contract termination rules, registration systems, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Sources include secondary data such as official gazettes, ministerial circulars, judicial precedents, and academic literature. Results key legislative changes include the relaxation of nationality requirements for commercial agents, enabling broader foreign participation; the digitalization of agency registration and renewal processes, reducing administrative burdens; clarified termination and compensation provisions, enhancing contractual certainty; and formal recognition of arbitration clauses, offering greater dispute resolution flexibility. These reforms have the potential to significantly improve market transparency, reduce litigation and attract foreign direct investment (FDI). Conclusions although the reforms represent a significant advancement, challenges remain, including judicial consistency in interpreting the new provisions, resistance among entrenched market players, and the need for enhanced regulatory guidance. The paper recommends targeted judicial and practitioner training, proactive awareness campaigns, and GCC-wide legal harmonization to amplify reform benefits. Implemented effectively, these measures could solidify Saudi Arabia’s role as a regional leader in commercial agency regulation, strengthen investor confidence, and advance the Kingdom’s long-term economic diversification goals.

                <p>by Giacomo Severini, David Muñoz</p>

Predictive simulations based on explicit, physiologically inspired, control policies, can be used to test theories on motor control and to evaluate the effect of interventions on the different components of control. Several control architectures have been proposed for simulating locomotor tasks, based on fully feedback, reflex-based, controllers, or on feedforward architectures mimicking the Central Pattern Generators. Hybrid architectures integrating both feedback and feedforward components represent a viable alternative to fully feedback or feedforward controllers. Current literature on controller-based simulations almost exclusively presents task-specific controllers that do not generalize across different tasks. The task-specificity of current controllers limits the generalizability of the neurophysiological principles behind such controllers. Here we propose a hybrid controller for predictive simulations of cycling where the feedforward component is based on a well-known theoretical model, the Unit Burst Generation model, and the feedback component includes a limited set of reflex pathways, expected to be active during steady cycling. We show that this controller can simulate physiological stationary cycling patterns at different desired speeds and seat heights. We also show that the controller can generalize to walking behaviors by just adding an additional control component for accounting balance needs. The controller here proposed, although simple in design, represent an instance of physiologically inspired generalizable controller for cyclical lower limb tasks.

Despite the importance of memories in everyday life and the progress made in understanding how they are encoded and retrieved, the neural processes by which declarative memories are maintained or forgotten remain elusive. Part of the problem is that it is empirically difficult to measure the rate at which memories fade, even between repeated presentations of the source of the memory. Without such a ground-truth measure, it is hard to identify the corresponding neural correlates. This study addresses this problem by comparing individual patterns of functional connectivity against behavioral differences in forgetting speed derived from computational phenotyping. Specifically, the individual-specific values of the speed of forgetting in long-term memory (LTM) were estimated for 33 participants using a formal model fit to accuracy and response time data from an adaptive paired-associate learning task. Individual speeds of forgetting were then used to examine participant-specific patterns of resting-state fMRI connectivity, using machine learning techniques to identify the most predictive and generalizable features. Our results show that individual speeds of forgetting are associated with resting-state connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as well as between the DMN and cortical sensory areas. Cross-validation showed that individual speeds of forgetting were predicted with high accuracy (<i>r</i> = .78) from these connectivity patterns alone. These results support the view that DMN activity and the associated sensory regions are actively involved in maintaining memories and preventing their decline, a view that can be seen as evidence for the hypothesis that forgetting is a result of storage degradation, rather than of retrieval failure.

During encoding, stimuli are embedded into memory traces that allow for their later retrieval. However, we cannot remember every aspect of our experiences. Here, we show that memory traces consist of multidimensional representational spaces whose formats are flexibly strengthened or weakened during encoding and consolidation. In a series of behavioral experiments, participants compared pairs of natural images on either two conceptual or two perceptual dimensions, leading them to incorporate the images into representational ‘spaces’. We found that representations from deep neural networks relate to both behavioral similarity and memory confidence judgements. Furthermore, we found that distances in task-relevant but not irrelevant spaces affected memory strengths. Interestingly, conceptual encoding did not impair subsequent rejection of similar lures, suggesting that task-irrelevant perceptual information remained in the memory trace. However, targeted memory reactivation following conceptual encoding deteriorated perceptual discrimination, indicating that it weakened the accessibility of perceptual formats. Our results demonstrate that representational formats are flexibly incorporated into memory, and more generally show how the organization of information in cognitive representational spaces shapes behavior.

Face-to-face communication relies on the seamless integration of multisensory signals, including voice, gaze, and head movements, to convey meaning effectively. This poses a fundamental computational challenge: optimally binding signals sharing the same communicative intention (e.g., looking at the addressee while speaking) and segregating unrelated signals (e.g., looking away while coughing), all within the rapid turn-taking dynamics of conversation. Critically, the computational mechanisms underlying this extraordinary feat remain largely unknown. Here, we cast face-to-face communication as a Bayesian Causal Inference problem to formally test whether prior expectations arbitrate between the integration and segregation of vocal and bodily signals. Specifically, we asked whether there is a stronger prior tendency to integrate audiovisual signals that convey the same communicative intention, thus establishing a crossmodal pragmatic correspondence. Additionally, we evaluated whether observers solve causal inference by adopting optimal Bayesian decision strategies or non-optimal approximate heuristics. In a spatial localization task, participants watched audiovisual clips of a speaker where the audio (voice) and the video (bodily cues) were sampled either from congruent positions or at increasing spatial disparities. Crucially, we manipulated the pragmatic correspondence of the signals: in a communicative condition, the speaker addressed the participant with their head, gaze and speech; in a non-communicative condition, the speaker kept the head down and produced a meaningless vocalization. We measured audiovisual integration through the ventriloquist effect, which quantifies how much the perceived audio position is misplaced towards the video position. Combining psychophysics with computational modelling, we show that observers solved audiovisual causal inference using non-optimal heuristics that nevertheless approximate optimal Bayesian inference with high accuracy. Remarkably, participants showed a stronger tendency to integrate vocal and bodily information when signals conveyed congruent communicative intent, suggesting that pragmatic correspondences enhance multisensory integration. Collectively, our findings provide novel and compelling evidence that face-to-face communication is shaped by deeply ingrained expectations about how multisensory signals should be structured and interpreted.

                <p>by William L. Tong, Venkatesh N. Murthy, Gautam Reddy</p>

Dogs and laboratory mice are commonly trained to perform complex tasks by guiding them through a curriculum of simpler tasks (‘shaping’). What are the principles behind effective shaping strategies? Here, we propose a teacher-student framework for shaping behavior, where an autonomous teacher agent decides its student’s task based on the student’s transcript of successes and failures on previously assigned tasks. Using algorithms for Monte Carlo planning under uncertainty, we show that near-optimal shaping algorithms achieve a careful balance between reinforcement and extinction. Near-optimal algorithms track learning rate to adaptively alternate between simpler and harder tasks. Based on this intuition, we derive an adaptive shaping heuristic with minimal parameters, which we show is near-optimal on a sequence learning task and robustly trains deep reinforcement learning agents on navigation tasks that involve sparse, delayed rewards. Extensions to continuous curricula are explored. Our work provides a starting point towards a general computational framework for shaping behavior that applies to both animals and artificial agents.

                <p>by Joseph James Tharayil, Ciro Zinno, Filippo Agnesi, Bryn Lloyd, Silvia Farcito, Antonino Cassara, Niels Kuster, Michael Reimann, Silvestro Micera, Esra Neufeld</p>

We developed an extended reciprocity theorem approach to model neuron signals which handles heterogeneous dielectric environments and arbitrary electrode shapes, and use it to study analytically the single fiber action potential. We then established a semi-analytic model that also uses hybrid electromagnetic-electrophysiological simulations to model evoked compound action potential (eCAP) signals from multi-fascicular nerves populated with heterogeneous fiber populations. For validation, model predictions were compared with cuff electrode recordings of activity induced by vagus nerve stimulation in <i>in vivo</i> porcine experiments. The semi-analytic model produces signals that approximate the shape and amplitude of <i>in vivo</i> measurements. It can account for the important variation in the recorded eCAP due to changes in the shape and placement of the stimulus and recording electrodes. We find that partially activated fascicles contribute particularly to the signal, as eCAP contributions from smoothly varying fiber calibers in fully activated ones partially cancel. As a result, eCAP magnitude does not depend monotonically on the stimulation current and recruitment level. Our method can be used to rapidly assess new stimulation and recording setups involving complex nerves and neurovascular bundles, e.g., to maximize signal information content, for closed-loop control in bioelectronic medicine applications, and potentially to non-destructively reconstruct structural and functional nerve topologies through inverse problem solving. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that parameter optimization can recover the ground-truth distribution of fiber diameters in a simplifed variant of our model.

                <p>by Boluwatife Ikwunne, Jolie Parham, Erdem Pulcu</p>

Reinforcement-learning (RL) models have been pivotal to our understanding of how agents perform learning-based adaptions in dynamically changing environments. However, the exact nature of the relationship (e.g., linear, logarithmic etc.) between key components of RL models such as prediction errors (PEs; the difference between the agent’s expectation and the actual outcome) and learning rates (a coefficient used by agents to update their beliefs about the environment) has not been studied in detail. Here, across (i) simulations, (ii) reanalyses of readily available datasets and (iii) a novel experiment, we demonstrate that the relationship between PEs and learning rates is (i) nonlinear over the PE/ learning rates space, and (ii) it can be accounted for by an exponential-logarithmic function that can transform the magnitude of PEs instantaneously to learning rates in a novel RL model. In line with the temporal predictions of this model, we show that physiological correlates of learning rates accumulate while learners observe the outcome of their choices and update their beliefs about the environment.

Protein Language Models (PLMs) use transformer architectures to capture patterns within protein primary sequences, providing a powerful computational representation of the amino acid sequence. Through large-scale training on protein primary sequences, PLMs generate vector representations that encapsulate the biochemical and structural properties of proteins. At the core of PLMs is the attention mechanism, which facilitates the capture of long-range dependencies by computing pairwise importance scores across residues, thereby highlighting regions of biological interaction within the sequence. The attention matrices offer an untapped opportunity to uncover specific biological properties of proteins, particularly their functions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, using the Evolutionary Scale Modelling (ESM) , for identifying High Attention (HA) sites within protein primary sequences, corresponding to key residues that define protein families. By examining attention patterns across multiple layers, we pinpoint residues that contribute most to family classification and function prediction. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a method for identifying HA sites at critical residues from the middle layers of the PLM; (2) we demonstrate that these HA sites provide interpretable links to biological functions; and (3) we show that HA sites improve active site predictions for functions of unannotated proteins. We make available the HA sites for the human proteome. This work offers a broadly applicable approach to protein classification and functional annotation and provides a biological interpretation of the PLM’s representation.

                <p>by Ghislain St-Yves, Kendrick Kay, Thomas Naselaris</p>

Brain activity patterns in high-level visual cortex support accurate linear classification of visual concepts (e.g., objects or scenes). It has long been appreciated that the accuracy of linear classification in any brain area depends on the geometry of its concept manifolds—sets of brain activity patterns that encode images of a concept. However, it is unclear how the geometry of concept manifolds differs between regions of visual cortex that support accurate classification and those that don’t, or how it differs between visual cortex and deep neural networks (DNNs). We estimated geometric properties of concept manifolds that, per a recent theory, directly determine the accuracy of simple “few-shot” linear classifiers. Using a large fMRI dataset, we show that variation in classification accuracy across human visual cortex is driven by a variation in a single geometric property: the distance between manifold centers (“geometric Signal”). In contrast, variation in classification accuracy across early and mid DNN layers is driven by an increase in the effective number of manifold dimensions (“Dimensionality"). Despite this difference in the geometric properties that affect few-shot classification performance in the brain and DNNs, we find that Signal and Dimensionality are strongly, negatively correlated: when Signal increases across brain regions or DNN layers, Dimensionality decreases, and vice versa. We conclude that early visual cortical areas and DNN layers deploy different geometric strategies for accurate linear classification of concepts, even though both are subject to the same constraint.

Neural activity sequences are ubiquitous in the brain and play pivotal roles in functions such as long-term memory formation and motor control. While conditions for storing and reactivating individual sequences have been thoroughly characterized, it remains unclear how multiple sequences may interact when activated simultaneously in recurrent neural networks. This question is especially relevant for weak sequences, comprised of fewer neurons, competing against strong sequences. Using a non-linear rate -based and a spiking model with discrete, pre-configured assemblies, we demonstrate that weak sequences can compensate for their competitive disadvantage either by increasing excitatory connections between subsequent assemblies or by cooperating with other co-active sequences. Further, our models suggest that such cooperation can negatively affect sequence speed unless subsequently active assemblies are paired. Our analysis characterizes the conditions for successful sequence progression in isolated, competing, and cooperating assembly sequences, and identifies the distinct contributions of recurrent and feed-forward projections. This proof-of-principle study shows how even disadvantaged sequences can be prioritized for reactivation, a process which has recently been implicated in hippocampal memory processing.

Adaptive immunity is a targeted immune response that enables the body to identify and eliminate foreign pathogens, playing a critical role in the anti-tumor immune response. Tumor cell expression of antigens forms the foundation for inducing this adaptive response. However, the human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-restricted recognition of antigens by T-cell receptors (TCR) limits their ability to detect all neoantigens, with only a small subset capable of activating T-cells. Accurately predicting neoantigen binding to TCR is, therefore, crucial for assessing their immunogenic potential in clinical settings. We present THLANet, a deep learning model designed to predict the binding specificity of TCR to neoantigens presented by class I HLAs. THLANet employs evolutionary scale modeling-2 (ESM-2), replacing the traditional embedding methods to enhance sequence feature representation. Using scTCR-seq data, we obtained the TCR immune repertoire and constructed a TCR-pHLA binding database to validate THLANet’s clinical potential. The model’s performance was further evaluated using clinical cancer data across various cancer types. Additionally, by analyzing divided complementarity-determining region (CDR3) sequences and simulating alanine scanning of antigen sequences, we provided new insights into the 3D binding interactions of TCRs and antigens. Predicting TCR-neoantigen pairing remains a significant challenge in immunology, THLANet provides accurate predictions using only the TCR sequence (CDR3<i>β</i>), antigen sequence, and class I HLA, offering novel insights into TCR-antigen interactions.

                <p>by Asma Nouira, Chloé-Agathe Azencott</p>

A critical hurdle in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) involves population stratification, wherein differences in allele frequencies among subpopulations within samples are influenced by distinct ancestry. This stratification implies that risk variants may be distinct across populations with different allele frequencies. This study introduces Sparse Multitask Group Lasso (SMuGLasso) to tackle this challenge. SMuGLasso is based on MuGLasso, which formulates this problem using a multitask group lasso framework in which tasks are subpopulations, and groups are population-specific Linkage-Disequilibrium (LD)-groups of strongly correlated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The novelty in SMuGLasso is the incorporation of an additional ℓ1-norm regularization for the selection of population-specific genetic variants. As MuGLasso, SMuGLasso uses a stability selection procedure to improve robustness and gap-safe screening rules for computational efficiency. We evaluate MuGLasso and SMuGLasso on simulated data sets as well as on a case-control breast cancer data set and a quantitative GWAS in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We show that SMuGLasso is well suited to addressing linkage disequilibrium and population stratification in GWAS data, and show the superiority of SMuGLasso over MuGLasso in identifying population-specific SNPs. On real data, we confirm the relevance of the identified loci through pathway and network analysis, and observe that the findings of SMuGLasso are more consistent with the literature than those of MuGLasso. All in all, SMuGLasso is a promising tool for analyzing GWAS data and furthering our understanding of population-specific biological mechanisms.

                <p>by Md. Faruk Hossain, Sydney Popsuj, Burcu Vitrinel, Nicole A. Kaplan, Alberto Stolfi, Lionel Christiaen, Matteo Ruggiu</p>

In mammals, neuromuscular synapses rely on clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the muscle plasma membrane, ensuring optimal stimulation by motor neuron-released acetylcholine neurotransmitter. This clustering depends on a complex pathway based on alternative splicing of <i>Agrin</i> pre-mRNAs by the RNA-binding proteins Nova1/2. Neuron-specific expression of Nova1/2 ensures the inclusion of small “Z” exons in <i>Agrin</i>, resulting in a neural-specific form of this extracellular proteoglycan carrying a short peptide motif that is required for binding to Lrp4 receptors on the muscle side, which in turn stimulate AChR clustering. Here we show that this intricate pathway is remarkably conserved in <i>Ciona robusta,</i> a non-vertebrate chordate in the tunicate subphylum. We use in vivo tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and heterologous “minigene” alternative splicing assays in cultured mammalian cells to show that <i>Ciona</i> Nova is also necessary and sufficient for <i>Agrin</i> Z exon inclusion and downstream Lrp4-mediated AChR clustering. We present evidence that, although the overall pathway is well conserved, there are unexpected differences in Nova structure-function between <i>Ciona</i> and mammals. We further show that, in <i>Ciona</i> motor neurons, the transcription factor Ebf is a key activator of <i>Nova</i> expression, thus ultimately linking this RNA switch to a conserved, motor neuron-specific transcriptional regulatory network.

                <p>by Haiyang Dong, Lili Wu, Zhechao Wang, Huiru Qu, Jinpeng Xie, Yaoqi Liu, Jingsong Lv, Nengcheng Bao, Jian Zhang, Pengjuan Guo, Ru Yan, Jiayan Fu, Jilong Shi, Ying Fu, Lei Li, Yiwen Du, Hongru Ma, Feng Shi, Jianhua Huang, Yongfeng Jin</p>

<i>Drosophila melanogaster Down Syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1</i> (<i>Dscam1</i>) gene encodes 38,016 diverse cell surface receptor proteins via alternative splicing, which have both nervous and immune functions. However, it remains elusive why organisms have evolved such an astonishing diversity of isoforms. Here, we show that fitness and immunity properties have driven the modern evolution of <i>Dscam1</i> isoform diversity. We assess multiple aspects of fly fitness in deletion mutants harboring exon 4, 6, or 9 clusters, respectively, reducing ectodomain isoform diversity stepwise from 18,612 to 396. All fitness-related traits generally improved as the potential number of isoforms increased; however, the magnitude of the changes varied remarkably in a variable cluster-specific manner. Correlation analysis revealed that fitness-related traits were much more sensitive to reductions in Dscam1 diversity compared to canonical neuronal self/non-self discrimination. We conclude that the role of Dscam1 isoforms in canonical neuronal self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination is mediated by a small fraction of all isoforms (<1/10), whereas a separate role essential for other developmental contexts and resistances, likely in fitness and immunity, requires almost full isoform diversity. Thus, fitness and immunity properties, rather than canonical neuronal functions, are the dominant drivers during the modern diversification of the Dscam1 isoform. Our findings suggest that Dscam1 diversity is closely linked to adaptation and species diversification in arthropods.

                <p>by Sarfraz Shafiq, Alireza Ghahramani, Kasha Mansour, Miguel Pena-Ortiz, Julia K. Sunstrum, Milica Pavlovic, Yan Jiang, Megan E. Rowland, Wataru Inoue, Nathalie G. Bérubé</p>

The importance of chromatin-mediated processes in neurodevelopmental and intellectual disability disorders is well recognized. However, how chromatin dysregulation in glial cells impacts cognitive abilities is less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that targeted loss of the ATRX chromatin remodeler targeted to microglia leads to altered cell morphology, increased chromatin accessibility profiles, and de-repression of endogenous retroelements, triggering viral mimicry. In mice that lack ATRX in microglia, CA1 hippocampal neuron morphology and electrophysiological properties are affected, and the mice display specific behavioral deficits. These findings demonstrate that ATRX is required in microglia to preserve chromatin structure and maintain microglial homeostasis. Disruption of these functions elicits neuroinflammation and may contribute to the pathology of human neurological disorders caused by <i>ATRX</i> mutations.

                Background Over the years, the dynamics of workplace design have changed in varying ways, with the pandemic being a notable change. Awareness surrounding the built environment’s impact on occupants’ well-being has increased after the pandemic. As a result, a substantial increase in the demand for a design that prioritizes humans, such as Biophilic Design, has been observed. Biophilic Design can enhance the quality of interior workspaces, where employees can work, collaborate, socialize, and restore. Methods This paper explores the implementation of biophilic design strategies in workplace interiors and presents the findings in a proposed matrix to record the presence of biophilic patterns. The matrix is designed according to Browning’s list of fifteen biophilic design patterns under the categories of “Nature in Space”, “Natural Analogues,” and “Nature of Space”. The workplace zones of two international examples and two local case studies were examined through photographic methodology. Results The matrix results illustrated the presence of biophilic patterns across the 52 studied zones. The total percentages of biophilic patterns availability recorded in the analysed workplaces were 71%, 66%, 63%, and 58%, respectively. The patterns under the “Natural Analogues” category recorded the highest average presence by 75%, followed by the “Nature in Space” category, achieving 69%, and the “Nature of Space” category recording 52%. The patterns records ranged from 2 to 13 for each zone, emphasizing the various biophilic design implementations within the four studied examples. The patterns that tend to be integrated the most in the analysed workplaces were dynamic and diffused light, connection to natural systems, complexity and order, and prospect patterns. Conclusions In the end, several design strategies were recommended for enhancing biophilic design integration in the local case studies. The paper encourages designers and architects to create biophilic workplaces with the purpose of positively affecting employees’ well-being and performance.

                Background Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic infectious inflammatory disease that affects the tissues supporting teeth and results in a progressive deterioration of the alveolar bone. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic autoimmune disease that has been associated with increased severity of periodontal disease. This study aimed to assess the clinical and immunological characteristics of PD in individuals with and without RA and to compare these characteristics with a healthy control group. Methods The study included three groups; thirty patients with PD, thirty patients with PD and RA, and twenty healthy control participants. Clinical periodontal parameters [plaque Index (PLI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)] were assessed. Salivary biomarkers, including human leukocyte antigen-DR4 (HLA-DR4), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the microbial load of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Our findings showed that salivary HLA-DR4 levels were significantly lower in patient groups compared with healthy controls (P = 0.000), whereas salivary MMP-8 and ACPA levels were significantly elevated in patients (P = 0.034) and (P = 0.001) respectively, with no significant differences between the patient groups(P > 0.05). On the other hand, microbial load was significantly higher in the PD with and without RA groups than that in controls (P = 0.001), with a positive correlation between microbial load and CAL in the PD-RA group.

                In Croce et al. the discovery of a rare SNP in the Venezuelan HD kindreds that is associated with a delayed age of onset of up to 23 years reveals how preventing aberrant protein accumulation is protective not only against polyglutamine toxicity but also against α-synuclein- and tau-mediated toxicity.

                Huo et al. report that opioid-withdrawn mice prefer socializing with opioid-experienced peers, driven by heightened social motivation and mediated by a specific brain circuit, APIRCRH-BMA, activated by peer odor. This social homophily promotes relapse by strengthening addiction-related memories. Social support from non-addicted peers or blocking this pathway aids recovery.
