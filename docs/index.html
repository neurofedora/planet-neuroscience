                <p>Formation and retrieval of remote contextual memory depends on cortical engram neurons that are defined during learning. Manipulation of astrocytic G<SUB>q</SUB> and G<SUB>i</SUB> associated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling has been shown to affect memory processing, but little is known about the role of cortical astrocytic G<SUB>s</SUB>-GPCR signaling in remote memory acquisition and the functioning of cortical engram neurons. We assessed this by chemogenetic manipulation of astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male mice, during either encoding or consolidation of a contextual fear memory, while simultaneously labeling cortical engram neurons. We found that stimulation of astrocytic G<SUB>s</SUB> signaling during memory encoding and consolidation did not alter remote memory expression. In line with this, the size of the mPFC engram population and the recall-induced reactivation of these neurons was unaffected. Hence, our data indicate that activation of G<SUB>s</SUB>-GPCR signaling in cortical astrocytes is not sufficient to alter memory performance and functioning of cortical engram neurons.</p>

                <p>How features of complex visual patterns are combined to drive perception and eye movements is not well understood. Here we simultaneously assessed human observers&rsquo; perceptual direction estimates and ocular following responses (OFR) evoked by moving plaids made from two summed gratings with varying contrast ratios. When the gratings were of equal contrast, observers&rsquo; eye movements and perceptual reports followed the motion of the plaid pattern. However, when the contrasts were unequal, eye movements and reports during early phases of the OFR were biased toward the direction of the high-contrast grating component; during later phases, both responses followed the plaid pattern direction. The shift from component- to pattern-driven behavior resembles the shift in tuning seen under similar conditions in neuronal responses recorded from monkey MT. Moreover, for some conditions, pattern tracking and perceptual reports were correlated on a trial-by-trial basis. The OFR may therefore provide a precise behavioral readout of the dynamics of neural motion integration for complex visual patterns.</p>

                <p>by Soraya Mirzaei, Mojtaba Tefagh</p>

Microbial communities play fundamental roles in every complex ecosystem, such as soil, sea and the human body. The stability and diversity of the microbial community depend precisely on the composition of the microbiota. Any change in the composition of these communities affects microbial functions. An important goal of studying the interactions between species is to understand the behavior of microbes and their responses to perturbations. These interactions among species are mediated by the exchange of metabolites within microbial communities. We developed a computational model for the microbial community that has a separate compartment for exchanging metabolites. This model can predict possible metabolites that cause competition, commensalism, and mutual interactions between species within a microbial community. Our constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach provides insights to elucidate the pattern of metabolic interactions for each common metabolite between two microbes. To validate our approach, we used a toy model and a syntrophic co-culture of <i>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</i> and <i>Methanococcus maripaludis</i>, as well as another in co-culture between <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> and <i>Rhodoferax ferrireducens</i>. For a more general evaluation, we applied our algorithm to the honeybee gut microbiome, composed of seven species, and the epiphyte strain <i>Pantoea eucalypti 299R</i>. The epiphyte strain Pe299R has been previously studied and cultured with six different phyllosphere bacteria. Our algorithm successfully predicts metabolites, which imply mutualistic, competitive, or commensal interactions. In contrast to OptCom, MRO, and MICOM algorithms, our COMMA algorithm shows that the potential for competitive interactions between an epiphytic species and Pe299R is not significant. These results are consistent with the experimental measurements of population density and reproductive success of the Pe299R strain.

                <p>by Tina Yao, Endrit Pajaziti, Michael Quail, Silvia Schievano, Jennifer Steeden, Vivek Muthurangu</p>

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used for non-invasive evaluation of hemodynamics. However, its routine use is limited by labor-intensive manual segmentation, CFD mesh creation, and time-consuming simulation. This study aims to train a deep learning model to both generate patient-specific volume-meshes of the pulmonary artery from 3D cardiac MRI data and directly estimate CFD flow fields. This proof-of-concept study used 135 3D cardiac MRIs from both a public and private dataset. The pulmonary arteries in the MRIs were manually segmented and converted into volume-meshes. CFD simulations were performed on ground truth meshes and interpolated onto point-point correspondent meshes to create the ground truth dataset. The dataset was split 110/10/15 for training, validation, and testing. Image2Flow, a hybrid image and graph convolutional neural network, was trained to transform a pulmonary artery template to patient-specific anatomy and CFD values, taking a specific inlet velocity as an additional input. Image2Flow was evaluated in terms of segmentation, and the accuracy of predicted CFD was assessed using node-wise comparisons. In addition, the ability of Image2Flow to respond to increasing inlet velocities was also evaluated. Image2Flow achieved excellent segmentation accuracy with a median Dice score of 0.91 (IQR: 0.86–0.92). The median node-wise normalized absolute error for pressure and velocity magnitude was 11.75% (IQR: 9.60–15.30%) and 9.90% (IQR: 8.47–11.90), respectively. Image2Flow also showed an expected response to increased inlet velocities with increasing pressure and velocity values. This proof-of-concept study has shown that it is possible to simultaneously perform patient-specific volume-mesh based segmentation and pressure and flow field estimation using Image2Flow. Image2Flow completes segmentation and CFD in ~330ms, which is ~5000 times faster than manual methods, making it more feasible in a clinical environment.

                <p>by Lars D’Hondt, Friedl De Groote, Maarten Afschrift</p>

The unique structure of the human foot is seen as a crucial adaptation for bipedalism. The foot’s arched shape enables stiffening the foot to withstand high loads when pushing off, without compromising foot flexibility. Experimental studies demonstrated that manipulating foot stiffness has considerable effects on gait. In clinical practice, altered foot structure is associated with pathological gait. Yet, experimentally manipulating individual foot properties (e.g. arch height or tendon and ligament stiffness) is hard and therefore our understanding of how foot structure influences gait mechanics is still limited. Predictive simulations are a powerful tool to explore causal relationships between musculoskeletal properties and whole-body gait. However, musculoskeletal models used in three-dimensional predictive simulations assume a rigid foot arch, limiting their use for studying how foot structure influences three-dimensional gait mechanics. Here, we developed a four-segment foot model with a longitudinal arch for use in predictive simulations. We identified three properties of the ankle-foot complex that are important to capture ankle and knee kinematics, soleus activation, and ankle power of healthy adults: (1) compliant Achilles tendon, (2) stiff heel pad, (3) the ability to stiffen the foot. The latter requires sufficient arch height and contributions of plantar fascia, and intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles. A reduced ability to stiffen the foot results in walking patterns with reduced push-off power. Simulations based on our model also captured the effects of walking with anaesthetised intrinsic foot muscles or an insole limiting arch compression. The ability to reproduce these different experiments indicates that our foot model captures the main mechanical properties of the foot. The presented four-segment foot model is a potentially powerful tool to study the relationship between foot properties and gait mechanics and energetics in health and disease.

The apicomplexan intracellular parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a major food borne pathogen that is highly prevalent in the global population. The majority of the <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i> proteome remains uncharacterized and the organization of proteins into complexes is unclear. To overcome this knowledge gap, we used a biochemical fractionation strategy to predict interactions by correlation profiling. To overcome the deficit of high-quality training data in non-model organisms, we complemented a supervised machine learning strategy, with an unsupervised approach, based on similarity network fusion. The resulting combined high confidence network, ToxoNet, comprises 2,063 interactions connecting 652 proteins. Clustering identifies 93 protein complexes. We identified clusters enriched in mitochondrial machinery that include previously uncharacterized proteins that likely represent novel adaptations to oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, complexes enriched in proteins localized to secretory organelles and the inner membrane complex, predict additional novel components representing novel targets for detailed functional characterization. We present ToxoNet as a publicly available resource with the expectation that it will help drive future hypotheses within the research community.

OCD has been conceptualized as a disorder arising from dysfunctional beliefs, such as overestimating threats or pathological doubts. Yet, how these beliefs lead to compulsions and obsessions remains unclear. Here, we develop a computational model to examine the specific beliefs that trigger and sustain compulsive behavior in a simple symptom-provoking scenario. Our results demonstrate that a single belief disturbance–a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of one’s preventive (harm-avoiding) actions–can trigger and maintain compulsions and is directly linked to compulsion severity. This distrust can further explain a number of seemingly unrelated phenomena in OCD, including the role of not-just-right feelings, the link to intolerance to uncertainty, perfectionism, and overestimation of threat, and deficits in reversal and state learning. Our simulations shed new light on which underlying beliefs drive compulsive behavior and highlight the important role of perceived ability to exert control for OCD.

Computable biomedical knowledge (CBK) is: “the result of an analytic and/or deliberative process about human health, or affecting human health, that is explicit, and therefore can be represented and reasned upon using logic, formal standards, and mathematical approaches.” Representing biomedical knowledge in a machine-interpretable, computable form increases its ability to be discovered, accessed, understood, and deployed. Computable knowledge artifacts can greatly advance the potential for implementation, reproducibility, or extension of the knowledge by users, who may include practitioners, researchers, and learners. Enriching computable knowledge artifacts may help facilitate reuse and translation into practice. Following the examples of 10 Simple Rules papers for scientific code, software, and applications, we present 10 Simple Rules intended to make shared computable knowledge artifacts more useful and reusable. These rules are mainly for researchers and their teams who have decided that sharing their computable knowledge is important, who wish to go beyond simply describing results, algorithms, or models via traditional publication pathways, and who want to both make their research findings more accessible, and to help others use their computable knowledge. These rules are roughly organized into 3 categories: planning, engineering, and documentation. Finally, while many of the following examples are of computable knowledge in biomedical domains, these rules are generalizable to computable knowledge in any research domain.

Computational biologists are frequently engaged in collaborative data analysis with wet lab researchers. These interdisciplinary projects, as necessary as they are to the scientific endeavor, can be surprisingly challenging due to cultural differences in operations and values. In this Ten Simple Rules guide, we aim to help dry lab researchers identify sources of friction and provide actionable tools to facilitate respectful, open, transparent, and rewarding collaborations.

                <p>by Genís Bayarri, Pau Andrio, Josep Lluís Gelpí, Adam Hospital, Modesto Orozco</p>

Interactive Jupyter Notebooks in combination with Conda environments can be used to generate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable/Reproducible) biomolecular simulation workflows. The interactive programming code accompanied by documentation and the possibility to inspect intermediate results with versatile graphical charts and data visualization is very helpful, especially in iterative processes, where parameters might be adjusted to a particular system of interest. This work presents a collection of FAIR notebooks covering various areas of the biomolecular simulation field, such as molecular dynamics (MD), protein–ligand docking, molecular checking/modeling, molecular interactions, and free energy perturbations. Workflows can be launched with myBinder or easily installed in a local system. The collection of notebooks aims to provide a compilation of demonstration workflows, and it is continuously updated and expanded with examples using new methodologies and tools.

                <p>by Bartosz A. Gren, Maciej Antczak, Tomasz Zok, Joanna I. Sulkowska, Marta Szachniuk</p>

Unlike proteins, RNAs deposited in the Protein Data Bank do not contain topological knots. Recently, admittedly, the first trefoil knot and some lasso-type conformations have been found in experimental RNA structures, but these are still exceptional cases. Meanwhile, algorithms predicting 3D RNA models have happened to form knotted structures not so rarely. Interestingly, machine learning-based predictors seem to be more prone to generate knotted RNA folds than traditional methods. A similar situation is observed for the entanglements of structural elements. In this paper, we analyze all models submitted to the CASP15 competition in the 3D RNA structure prediction category. We show what types of topological knots and structure element entanglements appear in the submitted models and highlight what methods are behind the generation of such conformations. We also study the structural aspect of susceptibility to entanglement. We suggest that predictors take care of an evaluation of RNA models to avoid publishing structures with artifacts, such as unusual entanglements, that result from hallucinations of predictive algorithms.

                <p>by Yu-Ying Phoebe Hsieh, Wanting Sun, Janet M. Young, Robin Cheung, Deborah A. Hogan, Ajai A. Dandekar, Harmit S. Malik</p>

Fungi and bacteria coexist in many polymicrobial communities, yet the molecular basis of their interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the fungus <i>Candida albicans</i> sequesters essential magnesium ions from the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. To counteract fungal Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> expresses the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter MgtA when Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels are low. Thus, loss of MgtA specifically impairs <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> in co-culture with <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>, but fitness can be restored by supplementing Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a panel of fungi and bacteria, we show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration is a general mechanism of fungal antagonism against gram-negative bacteria. Mg<sup>2+</sup> limitation enhances bacterial resistance to polymyxin antibiotics like colistin, which target gram-negative bacterial membranes. Indeed, experimental evolution reveals that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> evolves <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>-dependent colistin resistance via non-canonical means; antifungal treatment renders resistant bacteria colistin-sensitive. Our work suggests that fungal–bacterial competition could profoundly impact polymicrobial infection treatment with antibiotics of last resort.

                <p>by Sophie Bavard, Erik Stuchlý, Arkady Konovalov, Sebastian Gluth</p>

Humans are known to be capable of inferring hidden preferences and beliefs of their conspecifics when observing their decisions. While observational learning based on choices has been explored extensively, the question of how response times (RT) impact our learning of others’ social preferences has received little attention. Yet, while observing choices alone can inform us about the direction of preference, they reveal little about the strength of this preference. In contrast, RT provides a continuous measure of strength of preference with faster responses indicating stronger preferences and slower responses signaling hesitation or uncertainty. Here, we outline a preregistered orthogonal design to investigate the involvement of both choices and RT in learning and inferring other’s social preferences. Participants observed other people’s behavior in a social preferences task (Dictator Game), seeing either their choices, RT, both, or no information. By coupling behavioral analyses with computational modeling, we show that RT is predictive of social preferences and that observers were able to infer those preferences even when receiving only RT information. Based on these findings, we propose a novel observational reinforcement learning model that closely matches participants’ inferences in all relevant conditions. In contrast to previous literature suggesting that, from a Bayesian perspective, people should be able to learn equally well from choices and RT, we show that observers’ behavior substantially deviates from this prediction. Our study elucidates a hitherto unknown sophistication in human observational learning but also identifies important limitations to this ability.

                <p>by Jiao Li, Chao Zhang, Yao Meng, Siqi Yang, Jie Xia, Huafu Chen, Wei Liao</p>

The human brain is organized as segregation and integration units and follows complex developmental trajectories throughout life. The cortical manifold provides a new means of studying the brain’s organization in a multidimensional connectivity gradient space. However, how the brain’s morphometric organization changes across the human lifespan remains unclear. Here, leveraging structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 1,790 healthy individuals aged 8 to 89 years, we investigated age-related global, within- and between-network dispersions to reveal the segregation and integration of brain networks from 3D manifolds based on morphometric similarity network (MSN), combining multiple features conceptualized as a “fingerprint” of an individual’s brain. Developmental trajectories of global dispersion unfolded along patterns of molecular brain organization, such as acetylcholine receptor. Communities were increasingly dispersed with age, reflecting more disassortative morphometric similarity profiles within a community. Increasing within-network dispersion of primary motor and association cortices mediated the influence of age on the cognitive flexibility of executive functions. We also found that the secondary sensory cortices were decreasingly dispersed with the rest of the cortices during aging, possibly indicating a shift of secondary sensory cortices across the human lifespan from an extreme to a more central position in 3D manifolds. Together, our results reveal the age-related segregation and integration of MSN from the perspective of a multidimensional gradient space, providing new insights into lifespan changes in multiple morphometric features of the brain, as well as the influence of such changes on cognitive performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1367/v3?src=rss">Prevalence, serovars, and risk factors associated with the presence of Salmonella in pork sold in public markets in Quito, Ecuador [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Salmonella enterica are bacteria that include more than 2,500 serovars. Most of these serovars have been linked to human foodborne illnesses, mainly related to poultry and pigs. Thus, these animals are considered the reservoirs of many Salmonella serovars and strains related to antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, serovars, β-lactam resistance genes, and the risk factors associated with Salmonella enterica in pork commercialized in open markets of Quito city. Methods For this, 165 pork meat samples were taken from municipal markets in three areas in the city. These samples were microbiologically processed following the ISO 6579-2014 standardized method. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was used to identify Salmonella serotyping and resistance genes. Strains not identified by PCR were typed by the Kauffman White Le Minor scheme. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with the presence of the microorganism. Results Salmonella prevalence in pork was 9.1%. Identified serovars were 4, [5], 12: i:- (53.3%), Infantis (33.3%), and Derby (13.4%). Furthermore, the β-lactam resistance genes bla CTX-M-65 could be identified in three S. infantis isolates. Multivariate analysis showed that temperature (above 8°C) and cutting surfaces (wood) presented significant association values. Conclusions In conclusion, pork in traditional markets of Quito is contaminated with Salmonella enterica, whose main serovars pose a public health concern, and shows beta-lactam resistance.

                Background Every year, 15% of the global population suffers from migraines, making it a substantial social burden with a significant negative impact on quality of life. This systematic review aims to evaluate the comparative efficacy, safety profiles, cost-effectiveness, and additional dimensions of two prominent chronic migraine (CM) prophylactics: OnabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Methods Using specific keywords related to onabotulinumtoxinA and anti-CGRP treatments for migraines, we conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed and the Cochrane Library, spanning from 2015 to 2024. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Our analysis included 13 publications that revealed notable decreases in migraine frequency and severity with both treatment modalities. While CGRP mAbs demonstrated significant reductions in migraine days with minimal adverse effects, BoNT-A emerged as a superior option due to its cost-efficiency and higher patient satisfaction. Both treatments exhibited mild short-term side effects; however, CGRP mAbs were occasionally associated with extended periods of constipation. The simplicity of adherence, with either monthly self-administered injections of CGRP mAbs or quarterly physician-administered BoNT-A injections, further distinguished these treatments. BoNT-A, in particular, was recognized for enhancing overall quality of life and performance metrics. Conclusions BoNT-A stands out as a low-cost intervention effective across various migraine categories, including chronic, episodic, unilateral, and vestibular types, significantly alleviating pain severity and reducing migraine episode frequency. The findings underscore that both CGRP mAbs and BoNT-A are comparably effective for CM prophylaxis. However, BoNT-A is especially beneficial for patients ineligible for CGRP mAb therapy or those requiring localized treatment with minimal systemic exposure risk. For patients resistant or refractory to BoNT-A, combining it with CGRP mAbs may maximize therapeutic benefits due to their distinct modes of action. The efficacy, safety, and cost-benefit analyses of these medications may help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions based on the study's findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-664/v1?src=rss">(Semi)automated approaches to data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social sciences: A living review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23608?af=R">In vivo structural connectivity of the reward system along the hippocampal long axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent work has identified a critical role for the hippocampus in reward-sensitive behaviors, including motivated memory, reinforcement learning, and decision-making. Animal histology and human functional neuroimaging have shown that brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation are more interconnected with the ventral/anterior hippocampus. However, direct evidence examining gradients of structural connectivity between reward regions and the hippocampus in humans is lacking. The present study used diffusion MRI (dMRI) and probabilistic tractography to quantify the structural connectivity of the hippocampus with key reward processing regions in vivo. Using a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i> = 628) from the human connectome dMRI data release, we found that connectivity profiles with the hippocampus varied widely between different regions of the reward circuit. While the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental area) showed stronger connectivity with the anterior versus posterior hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. The limbic (ventral) striatum demonstrated a more homogeneous connectivity profile along the hippocampal long axis. This is the first study to generate a probabilistic atlas of the hippocampal structural connectivity with reward-related networks, which is essential to investigating how these circuits contribute to normative adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors in psychiatric illness. These findings describe nuanced structural connectivity that sets the foundation to better understand how the hippocampus influences reward-guided behavior in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23607?af=R">The well‐worn route revisited: Striatal and hippocampal system contributions to familiar route navigation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Classic research has shown a division in the neuroanatomical structures that support flexible (e.g., short-cutting) and habitual (e.g., familiar route following) navigational behavior, with hippocampal–caudate systems associated with the former and putamen systems with the latter. There is, however, disagreement about whether the neural structures involved in navigation process particular forms of spatial information, such as associations between constellations of cues forming a cognitive map, versus single landmark-action associations, or alternatively, perform particular reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the use of different spatial strategies, so-called model-based (flexible) or model-free (habitual) forms of learning. We sought to test these theories by asking participants (<i>N</i> = 24) to navigate within a virtual environment through a previously learned, 9-junction route with distinctive landmarks at each junction while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a series of probe trials, we distinguished knowledge of individual landmark-action associations along the route versus knowledge of the correct <i>sequence</i> of landmark-action associations, either by having absent landmarks, or “out-of-sequence” landmarks. Under a map-based perspective, sequence knowledge would not require hippocampal systems, because there are no constellations of cues available for cognitive map formation. Within a learning-based model, however, responding based on knowledge of sequence <i>would</i> require hippocampal systems because prior context has to be utilized. We found that hippocampal–caudate systems were more active in probes requiring sequence knowledge, supporting the learning-based model. However, we also found greater putamen activation in probes where navigation based purely on sequence memory could be planned, supporting models of putamen function that emphasize its role in action sequencing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the phenomenon of memory formation and recall associated with the use of psychotropic drugs has been extensively studied, mechanisms underlying memories for natural reward have not been clarified. Herein, we test the hypothesis that glutamatergic receptors in the dentate gyrus play a role in memories associated with sucrose. We used pellet self-administration protocol to generate memories in two-port nose-poke discrimination task using male Wistar rats. During non-rewarded probe trial, the conditioned animals readily discriminated the active port versus inactive port and showed massive increase in mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subunit genes (gria2, gria3) as well as c-Fos protein in the DG. Access to sweet pellet further enhanced c-Fos expression in the DG. However, animals pre-treated with AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (intra-DG), on exposure to operant chamber (no pellet), showed decreased discrimination as well as c-Fos expression. We suggest that AMPA receptors in DG mediate recall and consolidation of memories associated with sucrose consumption. CNQX pre-treated animals, if presented with sweet pellet on nose poke, exhibited high discrimination index coupled with increased c-Fos expression. In these CNQX treated rats, the DI was again decreased following administration of NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. We suggest that, although AMPA receptors are blocked, the access to sweet pellet may induce surge of glutamate in the DG, which in turn may reinstate memories via activation of erstwhile silent synapses in NMDA dependant manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23610?af=R">A comparison of hippocampal and retrosplenial cortical spatial and contextual firing patterns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) are key components of the brain's memory and navigation systems. Lesions of either region produce profound deficits in spatial cognition and HPC neurons exhibit well-known spatial firing patterns (place fields). Recent studies have also identified an array of navigation-related firing patterns in the RSC. However, there has been little work comparing the response properties and information coding mechanisms of these two brain regions. In the present study, we examined the firing patterns of HPC and RSC neurons in two tasks which are commonly used to study spatial cognition in rodents, open field foraging with an environmental context manipulation and continuous T-maze alternation. We found striking similarities in the kinds of spatial and contextual information encoded by these two brain regions. Neurons in both regions carried information about the rat's current spatial location, trajectories and goal locations, and both regions reliably differentiated the contexts. However, we also found several key differences. For example, information about head direction was a prominent component of RSC representations but was only weakly encoded in the HPC. The two regions also used different coding schemes, even when they encoded the same kind of information. As expected, the HPC employed a sparse coding scheme characterized by compact, high contrast place fields, and information about spatial location was the dominant component of HPC representations. RSC firing patterns were more consistent with a distributed coding scheme. Instead of compact place fields, RSC neurons exhibited broad, but reliable, spatial and directional tuning, and they typically carried information about multiple navigational variables. The observed similarities highlight the closely related functions of the HPC and RSC, whereas the differences in information types and coding schemes suggest that these two regions likely make somewhat different contributions to spatial cognition.</p>

                Functional network (FN) analyses play a pivotal role in uncovering insights into brain function and understanding the pathophysiology of various brain disorders. This paper focuses on classical and advanced methods for deriving brain FNs from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We systematically review their foundational principles, advantages, shortcomings, and interrelations, encompassing both static and dynamic FN extraction approaches. In the context of static FN extraction, we present hypothesis-driven methods such as region of interest (ROI)-based approaches as well as data-driven methods including matrix decomposition, clustering, and deep learning. For dynamic FN extraction, both window-based and windowless methods are surveyed with respect to the estimation of time-varying FN and the subsequent computation of FN states. We also discuss the scope of application of the various methods and avenues for future improvements.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93694">Boosting biodiversity monitoring using smartphone-driven, rapidly accumulating community-sourced data</a></h4>

              
                Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection. The <i>Biome</i> mobile app, launched in Japan, efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements. The app has amassed &gt;6 million observations since 2019. Nonetheless, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. Here, we investigated the quality of <i>Biome</i> data and its impact on SDM performance. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating <i>Biome</i> data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required &gt;2000 records for accurate models (Boyce index ≥ 0.9), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by <i>Biome</i> data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90505">Cyclic muscle contractions reinforce the actomyosin motors and mediate the full elongation of C. elegans embryo</a></h4>

              
                The paramount importance of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and embryogenesis is widely recognized, but understanding the mechanism at the cellular and molecular level remains challenging. Because of its simple internal organization, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a rewarding system of study. As demonstrated experimentally, after an initial period of steady elongation driven by the actomyosin network, muscle contractions operate a quasi-periodic sequence of bending, rotation, and torsion, that leads to the final fourfold size of the embryos before hatching. How actomyosin and muscles contribute to embryonic elongation is investigated here theoretically. A filamentary elastic model that converts stimuli generated by biochemical signals in the tissue into driving forces, explains embryonic deformation under actin bundles and muscle activity, and dictates mechanisms of late elongation based on the effects of energy conversion and dissipation. We quantify this dynamic transformation by stretches applied to a cylindrical structure that mimics the body shape in finite elasticity, obtaining good agreement and understanding of both wild-type and mutant embryos at all stages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93662">Identification of a third myosin-5a-melanophilin interaction that mediates the association of myosin-5a with melanosomes</a></h4>

              
                Transport and localization of melanosome at the periphery region of melanocyte are depended on myosin-5a (Myo5a), which associates with melanosome by interacting with its adaptor protein melanophilin (Mlph). Mlph contains four functional regions, including Rab27a-binding domain, Myo5a GTD-binding motif (GTBM), Myo5a exon F-binding domain (EFBD), and actin-binding domain (ABD). The association of Myo5a with Mlph is known to be mediated by two specific interactions: the interaction between the exon-F-encoded region of Myo5a and Mlph-EFBD and that between Myo5a-GTD and Mlph-GTBM. Here, we identify a third interaction between Myo5a and Mlph, that is, the interaction between the exon-G-encoded region of Myo5a and Mlph-ABD. The exon-G/ABD interaction is independent from the exon-F/EFBD interaction and is required for the association of Myo5a with melanosome. Moreover, we demonstrate that Mlph-ABD interacts with either the exon-G or actin filament, but cannot interact with both of them simultaneously. Based on above findings, we propose a new model for the Mlph-mediated Myo5a transportation of melanosomes.

                Autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are only partially represented in current experimental models and the development of humanized immune mice is crucial for better understanding of immunopathogenesis and testing of therapeutics. We describe a humanized mouse model with several key features of MS. Severely immunodeficient B2m-NOG mice were transplanted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-DRB1-typed MS and healthy (HI) donors and showed rapid engraftment by human T and B lymphocytes. Mice receiving cells from MS patients with recent/ongoing Epstein–Barr virus reactivation showed high B cell engraftment capacity. Both HLA-DRB1*15 (DR15) MS and DR15 HI mice, not HLA-DRB1*13 MS mice, developed human T cell infiltration of CNS borders and parenchyma. DR15 MS mice uniquely developed inflammatory lesions in brain and spinal cord gray matter, with spontaneous, hCD8 T cell lesions, and mixed hCD8/hCD4 T cell lesions in EAE immunized mice, with variation in localization and severity between different patient donors. Main limitations of this model for further development are poor monocyte engraftment and lack of demyelination, lymph node organization, and IgG responses. These results show that PBMC humanized mice represent promising research tools for investigating MS immunopathology in a patient-specific approach.

                The Wnt/Wg pathway controls myriads of biological phenomena throughout the development and adult life of all organisms across the phyla. Thus, an aberrant Wnt signaling is associated with a wide range of pathologies in humans. Tight regulation of Wnt/Wg signaling is required to maintain proper cellular homeostasis. Here, we report a novel role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex in Wg signaling regulation. <i>Drosophila dx</i> genetically interacts with <i>wg a</i>nd its pathway components. Furthermore, Dx LOF results in a reduced spreading of Wg while its over-expression expands the diffusion gradient of the morphogen. We attribute this change in Wg gradient to the endocytosis of Wg through Dx which directly affects the short- and long-range Wg targets. We also demonstrate the role of Dx in regulating Wg effector Armadillo where Dx down-regulates Arm through proteasomal degradation. We also showed the conservation of Dx function in the mammalian system where DTX1 is shown to bind with β-catenin and facilitates its proteolytic degradation, spotlighting a novel step that potentially modulates Wnt/Wg signaling cascade.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87518">Metabolic regulation of misfolded protein import into mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are the cellular energy hub and central target of metabolic regulation. Mitochondria also facilitate proteostasis through pathways such as the ‘mitochondria as guardian in cytosol’ (MAGIC) whereby cytosolic misfolded proteins (MPs) are imported into and degraded inside mitochondria. In this study, a genome-wide screen in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> uncovered that Snf1, the yeast AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibits the import of MPs into mitochondria while promoting mitochondrial biogenesis under glucose starvation. We show that this inhibition requires a downstream transcription factor regulating mitochondrial gene expression and is likely to be conferred through substrate competition and mitochondrial import channel selectivity. We further show that Snf1/AMPK activation protects mitochondrial fitness in yeast and human cells under stress induced by MPs such as those associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85560">Multimodal HLA-I genotype regulation by human cytomegalovirus US10 and resulting surface patterning</a></h4>

              
                Human leucocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules play a central role for both NK and T-cell responses that prevent serious human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) disease. To create opportunities for viral spread, several HCMV-encoded immunoevasins employ diverse strategies to target HLA-I. Among these, the glycoprotein US10 is so far insufficiently studied. While it was reported that US10 interferes with HLA-G expression, its ability to manipulate classical HLA-I antigen presentation remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that US10 recognizes and binds to all HLA-I (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -G) heavy chains. Additionally, impaired recruitment of HLA-I to the peptide loading complex was observed. Notably, the associated effects varied significantly dependending on HLA-I genotype and allotype: (i) HLA-A molecules evaded downregulation by US10, (ii) tapasin-dependent HLA-B molecules showed impaired maturation and cell surface expression, and (iii) β<sub>2</sub>m-assembled HLA-C, in particular HLA-C*05:01 and -C*12:03, and HLA-G were strongly retained in complex with US10 in the endoplasmic reticulum. These genotype-specific effects on HLA-I were confirmed through unbiased HLA-I ligandome analyses. Furthermore, in HCMV-infected fibroblasts inhibition of overlapping US10 and US11 transcription had little effect on HLA-A, but induced HLA-B antigen presentation. Thus, the US10-mediated impact on HLA-I results in multiple geno- and allotypic effects in a so far unparalleled and multimodal manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93325">Spatial and temporal pattern of structure–function coupling of human brain connectome with development</a></h4>

              
                Brain structural circuitry shapes a richly patterned functional synchronization, supporting for complex cognitive and behavioural abilities. However, how coupling of structural connectome (SC) and functional connectome (FC) develops and its relationships with cognitive functions and transcriptomic architecture remain unclear. We used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data from 439 participants aged 5.7–21.9 years to predict functional connectivity by incorporating intracortical and extracortical structural connectivity, characterizing SC–FC coupling. Our findings revealed that SC–FC coupling was strongest in the visual and somatomotor networks, consistent with evolutionary expansion, myelin content, and functional principal gradient. As development progressed, SC–FC coupling exhibited heterogeneous alterations dominated by an increase in cortical regions, broadly distributed across the somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. Moreover, we discovered that SC–FC coupling significantly predicted individual variability in general intelligence, mainly influencing frontoparietal and default mode networks. Finally, our results demonstrated that the heterogeneous development of SC–FC coupling is positively associated with genes in oligodendrocyte-related pathways and negatively associated with astrocyte-related genes. This study offers insight into the maturational principles of SC–FC coupling in typical development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90908">The trunk replaces the longer mandible as the main feeding organ in elephant evolution</a></h4>

              
                The long-trunked elephantids underwent a significant evolutionary stage characterized by an exceptionally elongated mandible. The initial elongation and subsequent regression of the long mandible, along with its co-evolution with the trunk, present an intriguing issue that remains incompletely understood. Through comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as feeding preference analysis, we reconstructed the feeding behavior of major groups of longirostrine elephantiforms. In the <i>Platybelodon</i> clade, the rapid evolutionary changes observed in the narial region, strongly correlated with mandible and tusk characteristics, suggest a crucial evolutionary transition where feeding function shifted from the mandible to the trunk, allowing proboscideans to expand their niches to more open regions. This functional shift further resulted in elephantids relying solely on their trunks for feeding. Our research provides insights into how unique environmental pressures shape the extreme evolution of organs, particularly in large mammals that developed various peculiar adaptations during the late Cenozoic global cooling trends.

                The autophagy-lysosome pathway plays an indispensable role in the protein quality control by degrading abnormal organelles and proteins including a-synuclein (aSyn) associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the activation of this pathway is mainly by targeting lysosomal enzymic activity. Here, we focused on the autophagosome-lysosome fusion process around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) regulated by lysosomal positioning. Through high-throughput chemical screening, we identified 6 out of 1,200 clinically approved drugs enabling the lysosomes to accumulate around the MTOC with autophagy flux enhancement. We further demonstrated that these compounds induce the lysosomal clustering through a JIP4-TRPML1-dependent mechanism. Among them, the lysosomal-clustering compound albendazole promoted the autophagy-dependent degradation of Triton-X-insoluble, proteasome inhibitor-induced aggregates. In a cellular PD model, albendazole boosted insoluble aSyn degradation. Our results revealed that lysosomal clustering can facilitate the breakdown of protein aggregates, suggesting that lysosome-clustering compounds may offer a promising therapeutic strategy against neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregate-prone proteins.

                Animals can use a repertoire of strategies to navigate in an environment, and it remains an intriguing question how these strategies are selected based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate towards a goal vestibule from a random start vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial, and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions. They closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences, revealing a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every six vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.

">Theta-phase locking of single neurons during human spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                The precise timing of single-neuron activity in relation to local field potentials may support various cognitive functions. Extensive research in rodents, along with some evidence in humans, suggests that single-neuron activity at specific phases of theta oscillations plays a crucial role in memory processes. Our fundamental understanding of such theta-phase locking in humans and its dependency on basic electrophysiological properties of the local field potential is still limited, however. Here, using single-neuron recordings in epilepsy patients performing a spatial memory task, we thus aimed at improving our understanding of factors modulating theta-phase locking in the human brain. Combining a generalized-phase approach for frequency-adaptive theta-phase estimation with time-resolved spectral parameterization, our results show that theta-phase locking is a strong and prevalent phenomenon across human medial temporal lobe regions, both during spatial memory encoding and retrieval. Neuronal theta-phase locking increased during periods of elevated theta power, when clear theta oscillations were present, and when aperiodic activity exhibited steeper slopes. Theta-phase locking was similarly strong during successful and unsuccessful memory, and most neurons activated at similar theta phases between encoding and retrieval. Some neurons changed their preferred theta phases between encoding and retrieval, in line with the idea that different memory processes are separated within the theta cycle. Together, these results help disentangle how different properties of local field potentials and memory states influence theta-phase locking of human single neurons. This contributes to a better understanding of how interactions between single neurons and local field potentials may support human spatial memory.

">A low-activity cortical network selectively encodes syntax</a></h4>

              
                Syntax, the abstract structure of language, is a hallmark of human cognition. Despite its importance, its neural underpinnings remain obscured by inherent limitations of non-invasive brain measures and a near total focus on comprehension paradigms. Here, we address these limitations with high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (electrocorticography) and a controlled sentence production experiment. We uncover three syntactic networks that are broadly distributed across traditional language regions, but with focal concentrations in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks process syntax mostly to the exclusion of words and meaning, supporting a cognitive architecture with a distinct syntactic system. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of syntax: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. We propose that this "low-activity coding" scheme represents a novel mechanism for encoding information, reserved for higher-order cognition more broadly.

                Quantitative comparison of the white matter organization of the human neocortex with that of the chimpanzee and macaque shows a wide distribution of areas with a uniquely human connectivity profile, including the frontal-parietal fiber systems and the temporal visual pathway. Functional decoding of these areas shows their involvement in language, abstract reasoning, and social information processing. Overall, these results counter models that assign primacy to prefrontal cortex for human uniqueness.

">Privileged representational axes in biological and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                How do neurons code information? Recent work emphasizes properties of population codes, such as their geometry and decodable information, using measures that are blind to the native tunings (or 'axes') of neural responses. But might these representational axes matter, with some privileged systematically over others? To find out, we developed methods to test for alignment of neural tuning across brains and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Across both vision and audition, both brains and DCNNs consistently favored certain axes for representing the natural world. Moreover, the representational axes of DCNNs trained on nat- ural inputs were aligned to those in perceptual cortices, such that axis-sensitive model-brain similarity metrics better differentiated competing models of biological sensory systems. We further show that coding schemes that privilege certain axes can reduce downstream wiring costs and improve generalization. These results motivate a new framework for understanding neural tuning in biological and artificial networks and its computational benefits.

">The transcriptomic architecture of the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                For over a century, scientists have been attempting to map the human cerebral cortex, however, they have not taken into account the complex molecular structure of the cortex, which is only beginning to be understood. Here, we parcellate the human cerebral cortex using a machine learning (ML) approach to define its transcriptomic architecture, revealing a multi-resolution organization across individuals. The transcriptomically-derived spatial patterns of gene expression separate the cortex into three major regions, frontal, temporal and parietooccipital, with smaller subregions appearing at lower levels of the transcriptomic hierarchy. The core regions, which remain stable across different hierarchical levels, are physiologically associated with language, emotion regulation, social cognition, motor and visuospatial processing and planning. Importantly, some core regions cross structural and anatomical boundaries identified in previous parcellations of the cortex, revealing that the transcriptomic architecture of the cortex is closely linked to human-specific higher cognitive function.

">Sex Differences in Human Brain Structure at Birth</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in human brain anatomy have been well-documented; however, their underlying causes remain controversial. Neonatal research offers a pivotal opportunity to address this long-standing debate. Given that postnatal environmental influences (e.g., gender socialisation) are minimal at birth, any sex differences observed at this stage can be more readily attributed to prenatal influences. Here, we assessed on-average sex differences in global and regional brain volumes in 514 newborns (236 birth-assigned females and 278 birth-assigned males) using data from the developing Human Connectome Project. On average, males had significantly larger intracranial and total brain volumes, even after controlling for birth weight. After controlling for total brain volume, females showed higher total cortical gray matter volumes, whilst males showed higher total white matter volumes. After controlling for total brain volume in regional comparisons, females had increased white matter volumes in the corpus callosum and increased gray matter volumes in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri (posterior parts), left anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral parietal lobes, and right caudate nucleus. Males had increased gray matter volumes in the right medial and inferior temporal gyrus (posterior part) and right subthalamic nucleus. Effect sizes ranged from small for regional comparisons to large for global comparisons. While postnatal experiences likely amplify sex differences in the brain, our findings demonstrate that several global and regional on-average sex differences are already present at birth.

">An Open-Source Deep Learning-Based GUI Toolbox For Automated Auditory Brainstem Response Analyses (ABRA)</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we introduce a new, open-source software developed in Python for analyzing Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) waveforms. ABRs are a far-field recording of synchronous neural activity generated by the auditory fibers in the ear in response to sound, and used to study acoustic neural information traveling along the ascending auditory pathway. Common ABR data analysis practices are subject to human interpretation and are labor-intensive, requiring manual annotations and visual estimation of hearing thresholds. The proposed new Auditory Brainstem Response Analyzer (ABRA) software is designed to facilitate the analysis of ABRs by supporting batch data import/export, waveform visualization, and statistical analysis. Techniques implemented in this software include algorithmic peak finding, threshold estimation, latency estimation, time warping for curve alignment, and 3D plotting of ABR waveforms over stimulus frequencies and decibels. The excellent performance on a large dataset of ABR collected from three labs in the field of hearing research that use different experimental recording settings illustrates the efficacy, flexibility, and wide utility of ABRA.

">Feedback Control of Neuronal Excitability and Epileptiform Bursting using a Photocaged Adenosine A1 Agonist</a></h4>

              
                Adenosine is a potent regulator of neurotransmission and neuronal excitability through activation of Gi protein-coupled adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs). It has gained interest as a potential anticonvulsant due to its endogenous involvement in ending ongoing seizure activity. A recently developed coumarin-caged derivative of the A1R agonist N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CPA), cCPA, was used for photo-uncaging of CPA with millisecond flashes of 405 nm light. At population level, CPA reduces Schaffer Collateral stimulated extracellular dendritic field potentials (FPs) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus with an ED50 of 44.1{+/-}2.8 nM and a Hill coefficient of 3. Response onset is CPA dependent and takes less than seconds, while recovery is CPA independent with a time constant of around 20 minutes. A closed-loop feedback system used the amplitude of evoked dendritic FPs to photorelease CPA and was able to control FP amplitude to user defined levels between 10% and 90% of baseline level. In the acute elevated potassium model of epilepsy raising extracellular K+ to 8.5 mM enhances neuronal excitability and induces regularly occurring epileptiform bursts, but FPs evoked with low intensity could still continuously monitor excitability without interfering with bursting. In this model the closed-loop system that controlled CPA release, was able to suppress epileptiform bursting, while maintaining an acceptable level of functional neurotransmission. Including in the control algorithm a second parameter that combined population spike amplitude and number of population spikes, enabled the system to automatically find a level of functional neurotransmission that was just below the threshold for multiple spiking and epileptiform bursting. The combination of photopharmacological adenosinergic modulation with real-time FP monitoring provides a first step towards closed-loop precision treatment for diseases related to neuronal hyperexcitability such as epilepsy.

	<p>Recent evidence shows that it is possible to identify the elements responsible for sensorineural hearing loss, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophages, by performing perilymph sampling. However, current studies have only focused on the diagnosis of such as otologic conditions. Hearing loss is a feature of certain neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is widely detected in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Although the environment of the inner ear is highly regulated, there are several communication pathways between the perilymph of the inner ear and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus, examination of the perilymph may help understand the mechanism behind the hearing loss observed in certain neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we review the constituents of CSF and perilymph, the anatomy of the inner ear and its connection with the brain. Then, we discuss the relevance of perilymph sampling in neurology. Currently, perilymph sampling is only performed during surgical procedures, but we hypothesize a simplified and low-invasive technique that could allow sampling in a clinical setting with the same ease as performing an intratympanic injection under direct visual check. The use of this modified technique could allow for perilymph sampling in people with hearing loss and neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative disorders and clarify the relationship between these conditions; in fact, by measuring the concentration of neuroinflammatory and/or neurodegenerative biomarkers and those typically expressed in the inner ear in aging SNHL, it could be possible to understand if SNHL is caused by aging or neuroinflammation.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that is typically characterized by a range of motor dysfunctions, and its impact extends beyond physical abnormalities into emotional well-being and cognitive symptoms. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) leads to an array of dysfunctions in the functioning of the basal ganglia (BG) circuitry that manifests into PD. While active research is being carried out to find the root cause of SNc cell death, various therapeutic techniques are used to manage the symptoms of PD. The most common approach in managing the symptoms is replenishing the lost dopamine in the form of taking dopaminergic medications such as levodopa, despite its long-term complications. Another commonly used intervention for PD is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is most commonly used when levodopa medication efficacy is reduced, and, in combination with levodopa medication, it helps reduce the required dosage of medication, prolonging the therapeutic effect. DBS is also a first choice option when motor complications such as dyskinesia emerge as a side effect of medication. Several studies have also reported that though DBS is found to be effective in suppressing severe motor symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, it has an adverse effect on cognitive capabilities. Henceforth, it is important to understand the exact mechanism of DBS in alleviating motor symptoms. A computational model of DBS stimulation for motor symptoms will offer great insights into understanding the mechanisms underlying DBS, and, along this line, in our current study, we modeled a cortico-basal ganglia circuitry of arm reaching, where we simulated healthy control (HC) and PD symptoms as well as the DBS effect on PD tremor and bradykinesia. Our modeling results reveal that PD tremors are more correlated with the theta band, while bradykinesia is more correlated with the beta band of the frequency spectrum of the local field potential (LFP) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. With a DBS current of 220 pA, 130 Hz, and a 100 microsecond pulse-width, we could found the maximum therapeutic effect for the pathological dynamics simulated using our model using a set of parameter values. However, the exact DBS characteristics vary from patient to patient, and this can be further studied by exploring the model parameter space. This model can be extended to study different DBS targets and accommodate cognitive dynamics in the future to study the impact of DBS on cognitive symptoms and thereby optimize the parameters to produce optimal performance effects across modalities. Combining DBS with rehabilitation is another frontier where DBS can reduce symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, enabling patients to participate in their therapy. With DBS providing instant relief to patients, a combination of DBS and rehabilitation can enhance neural plasticity. One of the key motivations behind combining DBS with rehabilitation is to expect comparable results in motor performance even with milder DBS currents.</p>

	<p>Both chronic and recurrent spinal pain alter sensorimotor integration (SMI), which is demonstrated using complex neurophysiological techniques. Currently, there is no patient-reported outcome measure that documents and/or assesses SMI in populations with spinal problems. The purpose of this study was to develop the Sensory&amp;amp;ndash;Motor Dysfunction Questionnaire (SMD-Q) and assess its test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability and internal consistency in individuals with recurrent spinal pain. The SMD-Q was developed based on the existing literature on motor control disturbances associated with disordered SMI. The initial SMD-Q drafts underwent review by two separate panels of subject matter experts and a focus group with subclinical spine pain. Their suggestions were incorporated into the questionnaire prior to reliability testing. The questionnaire was administered twice at a seven-day interval using QualtricsTM. A total of 20 participants (14 females and 6 males; 20.95 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.46 years of age) completed the study. Quadratic weighted kappa (Kw) was used to assess test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability and Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha (&amp;amp;alpha;) was used to assess internal consistency. Four items had a Kw &amp;amp;lt; 0.40, seven had a 0.40 &amp;amp;lt; Kw &amp;amp;lt; 0.75, and one had a Kw &amp;amp;gt; 0.75 (excellent agreement), with excellent internal consistency (&amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;gt; 0.90). The pilot SMD-Q appears to reliably measure altered SMI, suggesting that revisions and testing with a larger sample are worth pursuing.</p>

	<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical condition characterized by a high prevalence, substantial mortality rates, and unpredictable clinical outcomes, which results in a serious threat to human health. Improving the timeliness and accuracy of prognosis assessment is crucial to minimizing mortality and long-term disability associated with ICH. Due to the complexity of ICH, the diagnosis of ICH in clinical practice heavily relies on the professional expertise and clinical experience of physicians. Traditional prognostic methods largely depend on the specialized knowledge and subjective judgment of healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, existing artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, which predominantly utilize features derived from computed tomography (CT) scans, fall short of capturing the multifaceted nature of ICH. Although existing methods are capable of integrating clinical information and CT images for prognosis, the effectiveness of this fusion process still requires improvement. To surmount these limitations, the present study introduces a novel AI framework, termed the ICH Network (ICH-Net), which employs a joint-attention cross-modal network to synergize clinical textual data with CT imaging features. The architecture of ICH-Net consists of three integral components: the Feature Extraction Module, which processes and abstracts salient characteristics from the clinical and imaging data, the Feature Fusion Module, which amalgamates the diverse data streams, and the Classification Module, which interprets the fused features to deliver prognostic predictions. Our evaluation, conducted through a rigorous five-fold cross-validation process, demonstrates that ICH-Net achieves a commendable accuracy of up to 87.77%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods detailed within our research. This evidence underscores the potential of ICH-Net as a formidable tool in prognosticating ICH, promising a significant advancement in clinical decision-making and patient care.</p>

	<p>Background: Automated pupillometry (AP) is a handheld, non-invasive tool that is able to assess pupillary light reflex dynamics and is useful for the detection of intracranial hypertension. Limited evidence is available on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the ability of AP to discriminate AIS patients from healthy subjects (HS). Secondly, we aimed to compute a predictive score for AIS diagnosis based on clinical, demographic, and AP variables. Methods: We included 200 consecutive patients admitted to a comprehensive stroke center who underwent AP assessment through NPi-200 (NeurOptics&amp;amp;reg;) within 72 h of stroke onset and 200 HS. The mean values of AP parameters and the absolute differences between the AP parameters of the two eyes were considered in the analyses. Predictors of stroke diagnosis were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regressions; we then computed a nomogram based on each variable&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;beta; coefficient. Finally, we developed a web app capable of displaying the probability of stroke diagnosis based on the predictive algorithm. Results: A high percentage of pupil constriction (CH, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), a low constriction velocity (CV, p = 0.002), and high differences between these two parameters (p = 0.036 and p = 0.004, respectively) were independent predictors of AIS. The highest contribution in the predictive score was provided by CH, the Neurological Pupil Index, CV, and CV absolute difference, disclosing the important role of AP in the discrimination of stroke patients. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that AP parameters, and in particular, those concerning pupillary constriction, may be useful for the early diagnosis of AIS.</p>

	<p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is involved in a range of central and peripheral pathways related to appetitive behavior. Hence, this study explored the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on substance and behavioral addictions, including alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, cannabis, psychostimulants, compulsive shopping, and sex drive/libido. Data were collected from various social platforms. Keywords related to GLP-1 RAs and substance/behavioral addiction were used to extract relevant comments. The study employed a mixed-methods approach to analyze online discussions posted from December 2019 to June 2023 and collected using a specialized web application. Reddit entries were the focus here due to limited data from other platforms, such as TikTok and YouTube. A total of 5859 threads and related comments were extracted from six subreddits, which included threads about GLP-1 RAs drugs and associated brand names. To obtain relevant posts, keywords related to potential substance use and compulsive behavior were selected. Further analysis involved two main steps: (1) manually coding posts based on users&amp;amp;rsquo; references to the potential impact of GLP-1 RAs on substance use and non-substance habits, excluding irrelevant or unclear comments; (2) performing a thematic analysis on the dataset of keywords, using AI-assisted techniques followed by the manual revision of the generated themes. Second, a thematic analysis was performed on the keyword-related dataset, using AI-assisted techniques followed by the manual revision of the generated themes. In total, 29.75% of alcohol-related; 22.22% of caffeine-related; and 23.08% of nicotine-related comments clearly stated a cessation of the intake of these substances following the start of GLP-1 RAs prescription. Conversely, mixed results were found for cannabis intake, and only limited, anecdotal data were made available for cocaine, entactogens, and dissociative drugs&amp;amp;rsquo; misuse. Regarding behavioral addictions, 21.35% of comments reported a compulsive shopping interruption, whilst the sexual drive/libido elements reportedly increased in several users. The current mixed-methods approach appeared to be a useful tool in gaining insight into complex topics such as the effects of GLP-1 RAs on substance and non-substance addiction-related disorders; some GLP-1 RA-related mental health benefits could also be inferred from here. Overall, it appeared that GLP-1 RAs may show the potential to target both substance craving and maladaptive/addictive behaviors, although further empirical research is needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0244-23.2024?rss=1">Experiencing an Elongated Limb in Virtual Reality Modifies the Tactile Distance Perception of the Corresponding Real Limb</a></h4>

              
                <p>In measurement, a reference frame is needed to compare the measured object to something already known. This raises the neuroscientific question of which reference frame is used by humans when exploring the environment. Previous studies suggested that, in touch, the body employed as measuring tool also serves as reference frame. Indeed, an artificial modification of the perceived dimensions of the body changes the tactile perception of external object dimensions. However, it is unknown if such a change in tactile perception would occur when the body schema is modified through the illusion of owning a limb altered in size. Therefore, employing a virtual hand illusion paradigm with an elongated forearm of different lengths, we systematically tested the subjective perception of distance between two points [tactile distance perception (TDP) task] on the corresponding real forearm following the illusion. Thus, the TDP task is used as a proxy to gauge changes in the body schema. Embodiment of the virtual arm was found significantly greater after the synchronous visuotactile stimulation condition compared with the asynchronous one, and the forearm elongation significantly increased the TDP. However, we did not find any link between the visuotactile-induced ownership over the elongated arm and TDP variation, suggesting that vision plays the main role in the modification of the body schema. Additionally, significant effect of elongation found on TDP but not on proprioception suggests that these are affected differently by body schema modifications. These findings confirm the body schema malleability and its role as a reference frame in touch.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/25/e0069242024?rss=1">Erroneous Compensation for Long-Latency Feedback Delays as Origin of Essential Tremor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Essential tremor (ET), a movement disorder characterized by involuntary oscillations of the limbs during movement, remains to date not well understood. It has been recently suggested that the tremor originates from impaired delay compensation, affecting movement representation and online control. Here we tested this hypothesis directly with 24 ET patients (14 female; 10 male) and 28 neurologically intact (NI) human volunteers (17 female; 11 male) in an upper limb postural perturbation task. After maintaining their hand in a visual target, participants experienced perturbations of unpredictable direction and magnitude and were instructed to counter the perturbation and steer their hand back to the starting position. In comparison with NI volunteers, ET patients&rsquo; early muscular responses (short and long-latency responses, 20&ndash;50 and 50&ndash;100&nbsp;ms, respectively) were preserved or even slightly increased. However, they exhibited perturbation-dependent deficits when stopping and stabilizing their hand in the final target supporting the hypothesis that the tremor was generated by the feedback controller. We show in a computational model that errors in delay compensation accumulating over time produced the same small increase in initial feedback response followed by oscillations that scaled with the perturbation magnitude as observed in ET population. Our experimental results therefore validate the computational hypothesis that inaccurate delay compensation in long-latency pathways could be the origin of the tremor.</p>

                <p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, also referred to as paradoxical sleep for the striking resemblance of its electroencephalogram (EEG) to the one observed in wakefulness, is characterized by the occurrence of transient events such as limb twitches or facial and rapid eye movements. Here, we investigated the local activity of the primary somatosensory or barrel cortex (S1) in naturally sleeping head-fixed male mice during REM. Through local field potential recordings, we uncovered local appearances of spindle waves in the barrel cortex during REM concomitant with strong delta power, challenging the view of a wakefulness-like activity in REM. We further performed extra- and intracellular recordings of thalamic cells in head-fixed mice. Our data show high-frequency thalamic bursts of spikes and subthreshold spindle oscillations in approximately half of the neurons of the ventral posterior medial nucleus which further confirmed the thalamic origin of local cortical spindles in S1 in REM. Cortical spindle oscillations were suppressed, while thalamus spike firing increased, associated with rapid mouse whisker movements and S1 cortical activity transitioned to an activated state. During REM, the sensory thalamus and barrel cortex therefore alternate between high (wake-like) and low (non-REM sleep-like) activation states, potentially providing a neuronal substrate for mnemonic processes occurring during this paradoxical sleep stage.</p>

                <p>Even in the absence of specific sensory input or a behavioral task, the brain produces structured patterns of activity. This organized activity is modulated by changes in arousal. Here, we use wide-field voltage imaging to establish how arousal relates to cortical network voltage and hemodynamic activity in spontaneously behaving head-fixed male and female mice expressing the voltage-sensitive fluorescent FRET sensor Butterfly 1.2. We find that global voltage and hemodynamic signals are both positively correlated with changes in arousal with a maximum correlation of 0.5 and 0.25, respectively, at a time lag of 0&nbsp;s. We next show that arousal influences distinct cortical regions for both voltage and hemodynamic signals. These include a broad positive correlation across most sensory-motor cortices extending posteriorly to the primary visual cortex observed in both signals. In contrast, activity in the prefrontal cortex is positively correlated to changes in arousal for the voltage signal while it is a slight net negative correlation observed in the hemodynamic signal. Additionally, we show that coherence between voltage and hemodynamic signals relative to arousal is strongest for slow frequencies below 0.15&nbsp;Hz and is near zero for frequencies &gt;1&nbsp;Hz. We finally show that coupling patterns are dependent on the behavioral state of the animal with correlations being driven by periods of increased orofacial movement. Our results indicate that while hemodynamic signals show strong relations to behavior and arousal, these relations are distinct from those observed by voltage activity.</p>

                <p>Vertebrate vision begins with light absorption by rod and cone photoreceptors, which transmit signals from their synaptic terminals to second-order neurons: bipolar and horizontal cells. In mouse rods, there is a single presynaptic ribbon-type active zone at which the release of glutamate occurs tonically in the dark. This tonic glutamatergic signaling requires continuous exo- and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. At conventional synapses, endocytosis commonly requires dynamins: GTPases encoded by three genes (<I>Dnm1&ndash;3</I>), which perform membrane scission. Disrupting endocytosis by dynamin deletions impairs transmission at conventional synapses, but the impact of disrupting endocytosis and the role(s) of specific dynamin isoforms at rod ribbon synapses are understood incompletely. Here, we used cell-specific knock-outs (KOs) of the neuron-specific <I>Dnm1</I> and <I>Dnm3</I> to investigate the functional roles of dynamin isoforms in rod photoreceptors in mice of either sex. Analysis of synaptic protein expression, synapse ultrastructure, and retinal function via electroretinograms (ERGs) showed that dynamins 1 and 3 act redundantly and are essential for supporting the structural and functional integrity of rod ribbon synapses. Single <I>Dnm3</I> KO showed no phenotype, and single <I>Dnm1</I> KO only modestly reduced synaptic vesicle density without affecting vesicle size and overall synapse integrity, whereas double <I>Dnm1/Dnm3</I> KO impaired vesicle endocytosis profoundly, causing enlarged vesicles, reduced vesicle density, reduced ERG responses, synaptic terminal degeneration, and disassembly and degeneration of postsynaptic processes. Concurrently, cone function remained intact. These results show the fundamental redundancy of dynamins 1 and 3 in regulating the structure and function of rod ribbon synapses.</p>

                <p>Research on selective attention has largely focused on the enhancement of behaviorally important information, with less focus on the suppression of distracting information. Enhancement and suppression can operate through a push&ndash;pull relationship attributable to competitive interactions among neural populations. There has been considerable debate, however, regarding (1) whether suppression can be voluntarily deployed, independent of enhancement, and (2) whether voluntary deployment of suppression is associated with neural processes occurring prior to the distractor onset. Here, we investigated the interplay between pre- and post-distractor neural processes, while male and female human subjects performed a visual search task with a cue that indicated the location of an upcoming distractor. We utilized two established EEG markers of suppression: the distractor positivity (P<SUB>D</SUB>) and alpha power (~8&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz). The P<SUB>D</SUB>&mdash;a component of event-related potentials&mdash;has been linked with successful distractor suppression, and increased alpha power has been linked with attenuated sensory processing. Cueing the location of an upcoming distractor speeded responses and led to an earlier P<SUB>D</SUB>, consistent with earlier suppression due to strategic use of a spatial cue. In comparison, higher predistractor alpha power contralateral to distractors led to a later P<SUB>D</SUB>, consistent with later suppression. Lower alpha power contralateral to distractors instead led to distractor-related attentional capture. Lateralization of alpha power was not linked to the spatial cue. This observation, combined with differences in the timing of suppression&mdash;as indexed by earlier and later P<SUB>D</SUB> components&mdash;demonstrates that cue-related, voluntary suppression can occur separate from alpha-related gating of sensory processing.</p>

                <p>Attentional control over sensory processing has been linked to neural alpha oscillations and related inhibition of cerebral cortex. Despite the wide consensus on the functional relevance of alpha oscillations for attention, precise neural mechanisms of how alpha oscillations shape perception and how this top-down modulation is implemented in cortical networks remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that alpha oscillations in frontal eye fields (FEFs) are causally involved in the top-down regulation of visual processing in humans (male and female). We applied sham-controlled, intermittent transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over bilateral FEF at either 10&nbsp;Hz (alpha) or 40&nbsp;Hz (gamma) to manipulate attentional preparation in a visual discrimination task. Under each stimulation condition, we measured psychometric functions for contrast perception and introduced a novel linear mixed modeling approach for statistical control of neurosensory side effects of the electric stimulation. tACS at alpha frequency reduced the slope of the psychometric function, resulting in improved subthreshold and impaired superthreshold contrast perception. Side effects on the psychometric functions were complex and showed large interindividual variability. Controlling for the impact of side effects on the psychometric parameters by using covariates in the linear mixed model analysis reduced this variability and strengthened the perceptual effect. We propose that alpha tACS over FEF mimicked a state of endogenous attention by strengthening a fronto-occipitoparietal network in the alpha band. We speculate that this network modulation enhanced phasic gating in occipitoparietal cortex leading to increased variability of single-trial psychometric thresholds, measurable as a reduction of psychometric slope.</p>

                <p>Decreased neuronal specificity of the brain in response to cognitive demands (i.e., neural dedifferentiation) has been implicated in age-related cognitive decline. Investigations into functional connectivity analogs of these processes have focused primarily on measuring segregation of nonoverlapping networks at rest. Here, we used an edge-centric network approach to derive entropy, a measure of specialization, from spatially overlapping communities during cognitive task fMRI. Using Human Connectome Project Lifespan data (713 participants, 36&ndash;100&nbsp;years old, 55.7% female), we characterized a pattern of nodal despecialization differentially affecting the medial temporal lobe and limbic, visual, and subcortical systems. At the whole-brain level, global entropy moderated declines in fluid cognition across the lifespan and uniquely covaried with age when controlling for the network segregation metric modularity. Importantly, relationships between both metrics (entropy and modularity) and fluid cognition were age dependent, although entropy's relationship with cognition was specific to older adults. These results suggest entropy is a potentially important metric for examining how neurological processes in aging affect functional specialization at the nodal, network, and whole-brain level.</p>

                <p>Inhibitory neurons embedded within mammalian neural circuits shape breathing, walking, and other rhythmic motor behaviors. At the core of the neural circuit controlling breathing is the preBo&#x0308;tzinger Complex (preBo&#x0308;tC), where GABAergic (GAD1/2<sup>+</sup>) and glycinergic (GlyT2<sup>+</sup>) neurons are functionally and anatomically intercalated among glutamatergic Dbx1-derived (Dbx1<sup>+</sup>) neurons that generate rhythmic inspiratory drive. The roles of these preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory neurons in breathing remain unclear. We first characterized the spatial distribution of molecularly defined preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory subpopulations in male and female neonatal double reporter mice expressing either tdTomato or EGFP in GlyT2<sup>+</sup>, GAD1<sup>+</sup>, or GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons. We found that the majority of preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory neurons expressed both GlyT2 and GAD2 while a much smaller subpopulation also expressed GAD1. To determine the functional role of these subpopulations, we used holographic photostimulation, a patterned illumination technique, in rhythmically active medullary slices from neonatal Dbx1<sup>tdTomato</sup>;GlyT2<sup>EGFP</sup> and Dbx1<sup>tdTomato</sup>;GAD1<sup>EGFP</sup> double reporter mice of either sex. Stimulation of 4 or 8 preBo&#x0308;tC GlyT2<sup>+</sup> neurons during endogenous rhythm prolonged the interburst interval in a phase-dependent manner and increased the latency to burst initiation when bursts were evoked by stimulation of Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons. In contrast, stimulation of 4 or 8 preBo&#x0308;tC GAD1<sup>+</sup> neurons did not affect interburst interval or latency to burst initiation. Instead, photoactivation of GAD1<sup>+</sup> neurons during the inspiratory burst prolonged endogenous and evoked burst duration and decreased evoked burst amplitude. We conclude that GlyT2<sup>+</sup>/GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons modulate breathing rhythm by delaying burst initiation while a smaller GAD1<sup>+</sup> subpopulation shapes inspiratory patterning by altering burst duration and amplitude.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of seniors in the United States. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study neurophysiology in AD and its prodromal condition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which can be estimated through the magnitude of the autocorrelation of neural signals from rs-fMRI, is thought to quantify the duration that neural information is stored in a local circuit. Such heterogeneity of the timescales forms a basis of the brain functional hierarchy and captures an aspect of circuit dynamics relevant to excitation/inhibition balance, which is broadly relevant for cognitive functions. Given that, we applied rs-fMRI to test whether distinct changes of INT at different hierarchies are present in people with MCI, those progressing to AD (called Converter), and AD patients of both sexes. Linear mixed-effect model was implemented to detect altered hierarchical gradients across populations followed by pairwise comparisons to identify regional differences. High similarities between AD and Converter were observed. Specifically, the inferior temporal, caudate, and pallidum areas exhibit significant alterations in both AD and Converter. Distinct INT-related pathological changes in MCI and AD were found. For AD/Converter, neural information is stored for a longer time in lower hierarchical areas, while higher levels of hierarchy seem to be preferentially impaired in MCI leading to a less pronounced hierarchical gradient. These results inform that the INT holds great potential as an additional measure for AD prediction, even a stable biomarker for clinical diagnosis.</p>

                <p>Superagers are elderly individuals with the memory ability of people 30 years younger and provide evidence that age-related cognitive decline is not inevitable. In a sample of 64 superagers (mean age, 81.9; 59% women) and 55 typical older adults (mean age, 82.4; 64% women) from the Vallecas Project, we studied, cross-sectionally and longitudinally over 5&nbsp;years with yearly follow-ups, the global cerebral white matter status as well as region-specific white matter microstructure assessment derived from diffusivity measures. Superagers and typical older adults showed no difference in global white matter health (total white matter volume, Fazekas score, and lesions volume) cross-sectionally or longitudinally. However, analyses of diffusion parameters revealed the better white matter microstructure in superagers than in typical older adults. Cross-sectional differences showed higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in superagers mostly in frontal fibers and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in most white matter tracts, expressed as an anteroposterior gradient with greater group differences in anterior tracts. FA decrease over time is slower in superagers than in typical older adults in all white matter tracts assessed, which is mirrored by MD increases over time being slower in superagers than in typical older adults in all white matter tracts except for the corticospinal tract, the uncinate fasciculus, and the forceps minor. The better preservation of white matter microstructure in superagers relative to typical older adults supports resistance to age-related brain structural changes as a mechanism underpinning the remarkable memory capacity of superagers, while their regional aging pattern is in line with the last-in-first-out hypothesis.</p>

                <p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions within the gene <I>C9ORF72</I> are the most common cause of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This disease-causing expansion leads to a reduction in C9ORF72 expression levels in patients, suggesting loss of C9ORF72 function could contribute to disease. To further understand the consequences of C9ORF72 deficiency in vivo, we generated a <I>c9orf72</I> mutant zebrafish line. Analysis of the adult female spinal cords revealed no appreciable neurodegenerative pathology such as loss of motor neurons or increased levels of neuroinflammation. However, detailed examination of adult female <I>c9orf72<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> retinas showed prominent neurodegenerative features, including a decrease in retinal thickness, gliosis, and an overall reduction in neurons of all subtypes. Analysis of rod and cone cells within the photoreceptor layer showed a disturbance in their outer segment structure and rhodopsin mislocalization from rod outer segments to their cell bodies and synaptic terminals. Thus, C9ORF72 may play a previously unappreciated role in retinal homeostasis and suggests C9ORF72 deficiency can induce tissue specific neuronal loss.</p>

                <p>The olfactory tubercle (TUB), also called the tubular striatum, receives direct input from the olfactory bulb and, along with the nucleus accumbens, is one of the two principal components of the ventral striatum. As a key component of the reward system, the ventral striatum is involved in feeding behavior, but the vast majority of research on this structure has focused on the nucleus accumbens, leaving the TUB's role in feeding behavior understudied. Given the importance of olfaction in food seeking and consumption, olfactory input to the striatum should be an important contributor to motivated feeding behavior. Yet the TUB is vastly understudied in humans, with very little understanding of its structural organization and connectivity. In this study, we analyzed macrostructural variations between the TUB and the whole brain and explored the relationship between TUB structural pathways and feeding behavior, using body mass index (BMI) as a proxy in females and males. We identified a unique structural covariance between the TUB and the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which has recently been implicated in the suppression of feeding. We further show that the integrity of the white matter tract between the two regions is negatively correlated with BMI. Our findings highlight a potential role for the TUB&ndash;PAG pathway in the regulation of feeding behavior in humans.</p>

Methods A quantitative methodology was employed through an online questionnaire, using a random sampling strategy involving 250 respondents. Furthermore, data analysis was performed using structural equation modelling. Results The findings indicate that job motivation and transformational leadership did not have a direct impact on innovation work behavior. However, they did have an indirect beneficial influence mediated by absorptive capability. This study revealed that absorptive skills play a vital role in facilitating the translation of job drive and transformational leadership into innovative work behaviors. Conclusions The practical consequences involve firms embracing transformational leadership and establishing training programs to enhance employees' absorptive potential, thereby promoting innovation. Ultimately, cultivating absorptive skills is crucial for leadership styles and motivational elements to be evident in innovative work behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-662/v1?src=rss">Satisfaction of patients treated in a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation department during the Covid-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Patients treated in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) departments benefit from global and multidisciplinary long-term care. The study of satisfaction represents an important element in the evaluation of the quality of the healthcare provided. The aim of this study is to assess the level of satisfaction of patients treated in the PM&R department of Sahloul university hospital of Sousse Tunisia as well as the associated factors during the year 2020. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study, including patients treated in the hospitalization and the outpatient units of the PM&R department. Monnin and Perneger scale validated in Arabic was used to measure satisfaction in its different dimensions. Medical data were completed from patients’ records. Results A total of 240 patients were included in our study. The level of satisfaction was significantly higher with the admission procedures for inpatients compared to outpatients (87.9% vs. 60.0%, p<0.001). Regarding the global assessment, 82.1% of patients were satisfied. Multivariate analysis showed that for administrative procedures, consultation for outpatients was a factor of dissatisfaction (aOR=0.18, p<0.001). Patients’ physiotherapy treatment during the Covid-19 period was negatively associated with satisfaction for logistics (aOR= 0.44, p=0.011) and for the global assessment of health care provided in our department (aOR= 0.46, p=0.04). Conclusion Our study showed overall good levels of satisfaction in the department of PM&R of Sahloul. However, more studies should follow to determine other factors that can influence satisfaction.

                Background Lassa fever is an endemic and immediately notifiable disease in Liberia, and one laboratory confirmed case constitutes an outbreak. We described the epidemiological characteristics and hospital outcome of Lassa fever cases hospitalized during the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Methods A cohort study was conducted using routine Lassa fever surveillance data from the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and log binomial regression to assess the association between epidemiological characteristics and mortality. Results A total of 439 suspected Lassa fever cases were reported. The median age was 22 (interquartile range: 10-33) years and 233 (53%) were women. The median number of days between symptom onset and admission was 4 (IQR 2-7). Of the 439 cases, 416 (95%) were tested for Lassa fever and 138 were confirmed with 33% positivity rate. The majority, 290 (69%), of confirmed cases were <30 years, 78 (57%) were females, and 81 (59%) were reported during the dry season (October – March). Contact with rodents, 94 (68%), was the commonest mode of exposure. Fever, 128 (93%), malaise, 121 (88%), headache, 114 (83%) and myalgia, 114 (83%) were the most common clinical characteristics. There were 83 (19%) deaths among hospitalized suspected Lassa fever cases - 42 deaths (15%) among 278 individuals who tested negative and 41 among confirmed cases with 30% case fatality rate (CFR). The highest CFR was recorded among those aged 40-49 years, 8 (67%) and those aged≥50, 5 (63%). There was no significant association between epidemiological characteristics and Lassa fever mortality. Conclusions The outbreak highlighted a high disease burden of Lassa fever with young adults disproportionately infected, and substantial mortality, even among those who tested negative for the virus. This underscores the urgent need for preventive measures like vaccines and health education campaigns.

                Introduction Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe condition that causes severe pain and emotional distress in the brain. It can significantly impact the quality of a person's life and lead to daily withdrawal and emotional instability. Despite extensive research, there is still a need for comprehensive bibliometric studies to understand the literature on TN. This study is particularly important as there are no existing bibliometric studies on TN on Scopus, providing new opportunities for research and innovation in TN treatment. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords “trigeminal neuralgia”, current and therapy. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, factorial map of the documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by affiliation, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, and qualitative analysis. Conclusions The study focuses on trigeminal neuralgia, a topic of research and a recent topic involving periferal nerve stimulation and the use of karbamazepin, a new topic in the field of therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-659/v1?src=rss">Marital Bargaining and Assortative Matching on Fertility Preference : Evidence based on Cross-sectional Data in China [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the relaxation of fertility restrictions, China’s birth rate continues to decline. The Universal Two-Child Policy encourages couples to consider having a second child, often leading to a bargaining process between spouses with differing preferences. Additionally, the skewed sex ratio has increased Chinese women’s bargaining power, highlighting the importance of analyzing fertility decisions through marital bargaining. Methods This paper investigates second-child fertility decisions using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies and employs Ordinary Least Squares regression. The study examines assortative matching based on fertility preferences and uses the 2020 provincial-level sex ratio for individuals aged 20–39 as a proxy for women’s bargaining power in the marriage market. Results The study shows that achieving consensus on having a second child requires cooperation between spouses, particularly when their fertility preferences differ. The study also reveals that marriage matching is not random; individuals are more likely to partner with those who share the same second-child preference. Additionally, women with greater bargaining power positively influence their husbands’ desired family size, a correlation not observed in males. Conclusion The study concludes that second-child fertility decisions in China are significantly influenced by marital bargaining and the increased bargaining power of women due to the skewed sex ratio. Cooperation between spouses with differing fertility preferences is crucial for reaching a consensus on having a second child.

     alt="Extensive soma-soma plate-like contact sites (ephapses) connect suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons"/><p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus comprises cell-autonomous neuronal oscillators with divergent intrinsic circadian periods that maintain coordinated oscillations even when chemical synapses or gap junctions are blocked. To investigate ultrastructural features enabling such synchronization, a three-dimensional reconstruction of SCN core neurons was performed from 805 ultrathin sections imaged with electron microscopy. We found that clustered SCN core neurons were physically connected via multiple large soma-to-soma plate-like contacts.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central pacemaker for mammalian circadian rhythms. As such, this ensemble of cell-autonomous neuronal oscillators with divergent periods must maintain coordinated oscillations. To investigate ultrastructural features enabling such synchronization, 805 coronal ultrathin sections of mouse SCN tissue were imaged with electron microscopy and aligned into a volumetric stack, from which selected neurons within the SCN core were reconstructed <i>in silico</i>. We found that clustered SCN core neurons were physically connected to each other via multiple large soma-to-soma plate-like contacts. In some cases, a sliver of a glial process was interleaved. These contacts were large, covering on average ∼21% of apposing neuronal somata. It is possible that contacts may be the electrophysiological substrate for synchronization between SCN neurons. Such plate-like contacts may explain why the synchronization of SCN neurons is maintained even when chemical synaptic transmission or electrical synaptic transmission via gap junctions is blocked. Such ephaptic contact-mediated synchronization among nearby neurons may therefore contribute to the wave-like oscillations of circadian core clock genes and calcium signals observed in the SCN.</p>
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>Three-dimensional reconstruction of SCN tissue via serial electron microscopy revealed a novel structural feature of SCN neurons that may account for interneuronal synchronization that persists even when the predominant mechanisms of neuronal communication are blocked. We found that SCN core neurons are connected by multiple soma–soma contact specializations, ultrastructural elements that could enable synchronization of tightly packed neurons organized in clustered networks. This extensive network of plate-like soma–soma contacts among clustered SCN neurons may provide insight into how ∼20,000 autonomous neuronal oscillators with a broad range of intrinsic periods remain synchronized in the absence of ordinary communication modalities, thereby conferring the resilience required for the SCN to function as the mammalian circadian pacemaker.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This work attempted to clarify the interaction of cognition and pain sensitization during a paradigm of Temporal Summation of Second Pain (TSSP). We analyzed pain ratings and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity obtained from 21 healthy participants during the presentation of four experimental conditions that differed in the manipulation of attention to painful stimuli or working memory load (Attention to hand &amp; TSSP; 0-back &amp; TSSP (low cognitive load); 2-back &amp; TSSP (high cognitive load); 2-back (without pain)). We found that the TSSP was reduced when the attention was diverted and the cognitive load increased, and this reduction was accompanied by higher midfrontal theta activity and lower posterior alpha and central beta activity. Although it is well established that TSSP is a phenomenon that occurs at the spinal level, here we show that it is also affected by supraspinal attentional mechanisms. Delivery of painful repeated stimuli did not affect the performance of the 2-back task but was associated with smaller amplitudes of attentional event-related potentials (ERPs) after standard stimuli (not the target). The study of brain activity during TSSP allowed to clarify the role of top-down attentional modulation in pain sensitization processes. Results contribute to a better understanding of cognitive dysfunction in pain conditions and reinforce the use of therapeutic strategies based on distracting attention away from pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25362?af=R">Newborn auditory brainstem response and sudden infant death syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)—the sudden and unexplained death of a seemingly healthy infant, &lt;1 year old—may be associated with abnormalities in the brain regions that underlie breathing and arousal during sleep. While post-mortem studies suggest abnormalities in SIDS infants' brainstems, there are no studies of these infants' brainstem function before death. One way to assess the function of the brainstem is with auditory brainstem response (ABR), a routine hearing-screening method that noninvasively measures the brainstem's response to sound. We hypothesize that anomalies in newborns' ABR measures may predict SIDS. Indeed, previous studies identified abnormalities in ABR characteristics in small samples of near-miss SIDS infants hospitalized for infant apnea syndrome. However, there is a need to examine the ABRs of infants who died of SIDS. Therefore, in the current study, we propose integrating two secondary datasets to examine newborns' ABRs (<i>N</i> = 156,972), including those who later died of SIDS (<i>n</i> = ~42; .27 out of every 1000 infants), using existing archived records of neonatal ABR results from a sample of newborns born in Florida. We hypothesize that infants who die from SIDS are more likely than non-SIDS infants to have abnormal ABRs as newborns. Understanding the association between SIDS and ABR may facilitate more accurate identification of an infant's risk for SIDS at birth, enabling increased monitoring, which may facilitate interventions and improve survivorship.</p>

                <p>Clinical, pathological, and imaging evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that a smoldering inflammatory activity is present from the earliest stages of the disease and underlies the progression of disability, which proceeds relentlessly and independently of clinical and radiological relapses (PIRA). The complex system of pathological events driving “chronic” worsening is likely linked with the early accumulation of compartmentalized inflammation within the central nervous system as well as insufficient repair phenomena and mitochondrial failure. These mechanisms are partially lesion-independent and differ from those causing clinical relapses and the formation of new focal demyelinating lesions; they lead to neuroaxonal dysfunction and death, myelin loss, glia alterations, and finally, a neuronal network dysfunction outweighing central nervous system (CNS) compensatory mechanisms. This review aims to provide an overview of the state of the art of neuropathological, immunological, and imaging knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the smoldering disease activity, focusing on possible early biomarkers and their translation into clinical practice.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to characterize quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) features in participants from the Natural history study of RTT and Related Disorders and to assess the potential for these features to act as objective measures of cortical function for Rett syndrome (RTT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>EEG amplitude and power features were derived from the resting EEG of 60 females with RTT (median age = 10.7 years) and 26 neurotypical females (median age = 10.6 years). Analyses focus on group differences and within the RTT group, associations between the EEG parameters and clinical severity. For a subset of participants (n = 20), follow-up data were available for assessing the reproducibility of the results and the stability in the parameters over 1 year.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to neurotypical participants, participants with RTT had greater amplitude variability and greater low-frequency activity as reflected by greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower theta/delta, alpha/delta, beta/delta, alpha/theta, and beta/theta ratios. Greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower power ratios were associated with greater severity. Analyses of year 1 data replicated the associations between 1/f slope and power ratios and clinical severity and demonstrated good within-subject consistency in these measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, group comparisons reflected a greater predominance of lower versus higher frequency activity in participants with RTT, which is consistent with prior clinical interpretations of resting EEG in this population. The observed associations between the EEG power measures and clinical assessments and the repeatability of these measures underscore the potential for EEG to provide an objective measure of cortical function and clinical severity for RTT.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the association between the preoperative Bioenergetic Health Index (BHI) of platelets and the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Elderly patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia were included. The presence of POD was assessed within the 3 days after surgery. Seahorse XF analysis and transmission electron microscopy were utilized to evaluate the mitochondrial metabolism and morphology of platelets.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 20 out of 162 participants developed POD. Participants with POD showed lower preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination scores and total protein levels, fewer educational years, longer surgery duration, higher mean platelet volume, and lower platelet BHI compared with those without POD. Damaged mitochondria with swollen appearance and distorted cristae was detected in platelets from participants with POD. Preoperative platelet BHI was independently associated with the occurrence of POD after adjusting for age, education, preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination score, preoperative mean platelet volume and total protein levels, surgical type and duration, and lymphocyte counts on the first postoperative day (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.37, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The areas under the receiver operating curves for predicting POD were 0.83 (95% CI 0.76–0.88) for platelet BHI. It showed a sensitivity of 85.00% and specificity of 73.24%, with an optimal cutoff value of 1.61. Using a serial combination (mean platelet volume followed by BHI) yielded a sensitivity of 80.00% and specificity of 82.39%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Preoperative platelet BHI was independently associated with the occurrence of POD in elderly patients and has the potential as a screening biomarker for POD risk. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:74–86</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>While the cognitive-behavioral characteristics of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients carrying <i>C9orf72</i> pathological repeat expansion have been extensively studied, our understanding of those carrying <i>SOD1</i> variants is mostly based on case reports. The aim of this paper is to extensively explore the cognitive-behavioral characteristics of a cohort of ALS patients carrying pathogenetic variants of <i>SOD1</i> gene, comparing them to patients without pathogenetic variants of 46 ALS-related genes (wild-type [WT]-ALS) and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All ALS patients seen at the Turin ALS expert center in the 2009–2021 period who underwent both cognitive/behavioral and extensive genetic testing were eligible to be included in the study. Only patients with <i>SOD1</i> pathogenetic variants (<i>n</i> = 28) (SOD1-ALS) and WT-ALS (<i>n</i> = 829) were enrolled in the study. A series of 129 controls was also included.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 28 SOD1-ALS patients, 16 (57.1%) had normal cognitive function, 5 (17.9%) isolated cognitive impairment (ALSci) (17.9%), 6 (21.4%) isolated behavioral impairment (ALSbi), 1 (3.6%) cognitive and behavioral impairment (ALScbi), and no one ALS-FTD. SOD1-ALS performed worse than controls in all explored domains, in particular Social Cognition and Language domains. SOD1-ALS patients had similar scores in all tests compared to WT-ALS, except the Story-based Empathy Task (SET), where they performed worse.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral impairment is much more common in <i>SOD1</i> patients than previously assumed. SOD1-ALS are characterized by a more frequent impairment of Social Cognition and, less markedly, of Language domains. These findings have relevant implication both in the clinical and in the research setting, also considering recently approved treatment for SOD1-ALS. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:150–158</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The adult-onset focal dystonias are characterized by over-active muscles leading to abnormal movements. For most cases, the etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. In the current study, unbiased proteomics methods were used to identify potential changes in blood plasma proteins.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A large-scale unbiased proteomics screen was used to compare proteins (<i>N</i> = 6,345) in blood plasma of normal healthy controls (<i>N</i> = 49) with adult-onset focal dystonia (<i>N</i> = 143) consisting of specific subpopulations of cervical dystonia (<i>N</i> = 45), laryngeal dystonia (<i>N</i> = 49), and blepharospasm (<i>N</i> = 49). Pathway analyses were conducted to identify relevant biological pathways. Finally, protein changes were used to build a prediction model for dystonia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After correction for multiple comparisons, 15 proteins were associated with adult-onset focal dystonia. Subgroup analyses revealed some proteins were shared across the dystonia subgroups while others were unique to 1 subgroup. The top biological pathways involved changes in the immune system, metal ion transport, and reactive oxygen species. A 4-protein model showed high accuracy in discriminating control individuals from dystonia cases [average area under the curve (AUC) = 0.89].</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To evaluate the effect of Alzheimer's disease (AD) -related biomarker change on clinical features, brain atrophy and functional connectivity of patients with corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from patients with a clinical diagnosis of CBS, PSP, and AD and healthy controls were obtained from the 4-R-Tauopathy Neuroimaging Initiative 1 and 2, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and a local cohort from the Toronto Western Hospital. Patients with CBS and PSP were divided into AD-positive (CBS/PSP-AD) and AD-negative (CBS/PSP-noAD) groups based on fluid biomarkers and amyloid PET scans. Cognitive, motor, and depression scores; AD fluid biomarkers (cerebrospinal p-tau, t-tau, and amyloid-beta, and plasma ptau-217); and neuroimaging data (amyloid PET, MRI and fMRI) were collected. Clinical features, whole-brain gray matter volume and functional networks connectivity were compared across groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data were analyzed from 87 CBS/PSP-noAD and 23 CBS/PSP-AD, 18 AD, and 30 healthy controls. CBS/PSP-noAD showed worse performance in comparison to CBS/PSP-AD in the PSPRS [mean(SD): 34.8(15.8) vs 23.3(11.6)] and the UPDRS scores [mean(SD): 34.2(17.0) vs 21.8(13.3)]. CBS/PSP-AD demonstrated atrophy in AD signature areas and brainstem, while CBS/PSP-noAD patients displayed atrophy in frontal and temporal areas, globus pallidus, and brainstem compared to healthy controls. The default mode network showed greatest disconnection in CBS/PSP-AD compared with CBS/PSP-no AD and controls. The thalamic network connectivity was most affected in CBS/PSP-noAD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AD biomarker positivity may modulate the clinical presentation of CBS/PSP, with evidence of distinctive structural and functional brain changes associated with the AD pathology/co-pathology. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:99–109</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26931?af=R">Diagnostic Utility of MOG Antibody Testing in Cerebrospinal Fluid</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic utility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG-IgG) testing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively identified patients for CSF MOG-IgG testing from January 1, 1996, to May 1, 2023, at Mayo Clinic and other medical centers that sent CSF MOG-IgG for testing including: controls, 282; serum MOG-IgG positive MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), 74; serum MOG-IgG negative high-risk phenotypes, 73; serum false positive MOG-IgG with alternative diagnoses, 18. A live cell-based assay assessed CSF MOG-IgG positivity (IgG-binding-index [IBI], ≥2.5) using multiple anti-human secondary antibodies and end-titers were calculated if sufficient sample volume. Correlation of CSF MOG-IgG IBI and titer was assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The pan-IgG Fc-specific secondary was optimal, yielding CSF MOG-IgG sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 98% (Youden's index 0.88). CSF MOG-IgG was positive in: 4/282 (1.4%) controls; 66/74 (89%) serum MOG-IgG positive MOGAD patients; and 9/73 (12%) serum MOG-IgG negative patients with high-risk phenotypes. Serum negative but CSF positive MOG-IgG accounted for 9/83 (11%) MOGAD patients, and all fulfilled 2023 MOGAD diagnostic criteria. Subgroup analysis of serum MOG-IgG low-positives revealed CSF MOG-IgG positivity more in MOGAD (13/16[81%]) than other diseases with false positive serum MOG-IgG (3/15[20%]) (<i>p</i> = 0.01). CSF MOG-IgG IBI and CSF MOG-IgG titer (both available in 29 samples) were correlated (Spearman's <i>r</i> = 0.64, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CSF MOG-IgG testing has diagnostic utility in patients with a suspicious phenotype but negative serum MOG-IgG, and those with low positive serum MOG-IgG results and diagnostic uncertainty. These findings support a role for CSF MOG-IgG testing in the appropriate clinical setting. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:34–45</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26933?af=R">Sex Differences in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Survival and Progression: A Multidimensional Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate sex-related differences in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) prognosis and their contributing factors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Our primary cohort was the Piemonte and Aosta Register for ALS (PARALS); the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) and the Answer ALS databases were used for validation. Survival analyses were conducted accounting for age and onset site. The roles of forced vital capacity and weight decline were explored through a causal mediation analysis. Survival and disease progression rates were also evaluated after propensity score matching.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The PARALS cohort included 1,890 individuals (44.8% women). Men showed shorter survival when stratified by onset site (spinal onset HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00–1.44, <i>p</i> = 0.0439; bulbar onset HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09–1.70, <i>p</i> = 0.006917), although women had a steeper functional decline (+0.10 ALSFRS-R points/month, 95% CI 0.07–0.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001) regardless of onset site. Instead, men showed worse respiratory decline (−4.2 forced vital capacity%/month, 95% CI −6.3 to −2.2, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and faster weight loss (−0.15 kg/month, 95% CI −0.25 to −0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.0030). Causal mediation analysis showed that respiratory function and weight loss were pivotal in sex-related survival differences. Analysis of patients from PRO-ACT (<i>n</i> = 1,394, 40.9% women) and Answer ALS (<i>n</i> = 849, 37.2% women) confirmed these trends.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The shorter survival in men is linked to worse respiratory function and weight loss rather than a faster disease progression. These findings emphasize the importance of considering sex-specific factors in understanding ALS pathophysiology and designing tailored therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26935?af=R">Divergent Associations of Slow‐Wave Sleep versus Rapid Eye Movement Sleep with Plasma Amyloid‐Beta</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent evidence shows that during slow-wave sleep (SWS), the brain is cleared from potentially toxic metabolites, such as the amyloid-beta protein. Poor sleep or elevated cortisol levels can worsen amyloid-beta clearance, potentially leading to the formation of amyloid plaques, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease. Here, we explored how nocturnal neural and endocrine activity affects amyloid-beta fluctuations in the peripheral blood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We acquired simultaneous polysomnography and all-night blood sampling in 60 healthy volunteers aged 20–68 years. Nocturnal plasma concentrations of amyloid-beta-40, amyloid-beta-42, cortisol, and growth hormone were assessed every 20 minutes. Amyloid-beta fluctuations were modeled with sleep stages, (non)oscillatory power, and hormones as predictors while controlling for age and participant-specific random effects.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Amyloid-beta-40 and amyloid-beta-42 levels correlated positively with growth hormone concentrations, SWS proportion, and slow-wave (0.3–4Hz) oscillatory and high-band (30–48Hz) nonoscillatory power, but negatively with cortisol concentrations and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) proportion measured 40–100 minutes previously (all <i>t</i> values &gt; |3|, <i>p</i> values &lt; 0.003). Older participants showed higher amyloid-beta-40 levels.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Slow-wave oscillations are associated with higher plasma amyloid-beta levels, whereas REM sleep is related to decreased amyloid-beta plasma levels, possibly representing changes in central amyloid-beta production or clearance. Strong associations between cortisol, growth hormone, and amyloid-beta presumably reflect the sleep-regulating role of the corresponding releasing hormones. A positive association between age and amyloid-beta-40 may indicate that peripheral clearance becomes less efficient with age. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:46–60</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare vasculitis restricted to the brain, spinal cord, and leptomeninges. This study aimed to describe the imaging characteristics of patients with small vessel PACNS (SV-PACNS) using 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This ongoing prospective observational cohort study included patients who met the Calabrese and Mallek criteria and underwent 7 T MRI scan. The MRI protocol includes T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo imaging, T2 star weighted imaging, and susceptibility-weighted imaging. Two experienced readers independently reviewed the neuroimages. Clinical data were extracted from the electronic patient records. The findings were then applied to a cohort of patients with large vessel central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 21 patients with SV-PACNS from December 2021 to November 2023. Of these, 12 (57.14%) had cerebral cortical microhemorrhages with atrophy. The pattern with microhemorrhages was described in detail based on the gradient echo sequence, leading to the identification of what we have termed the “coral-like sign.” The onset age of patients with coral-like sign (33.83 ± 9.93 years) appeared younger than that of patients without coral-like sign (42.11 ± 14.18 years) (<i>P</i> = 0.131). Furthermore, the cerebral lesions in patients with cortical microhemorrhagic SV-PACNS showed greater propensity toward bilateral lesions (<i>P</i> = 0.03). The coral-like sign was not observed in patients with large vessel CNS vasculitis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The key characteristics of the coral-like sign represent cerebral cortical diffuse microhemorrhages with atrophy, which may be an important MRI pattern of SV-PACNS. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:194–203</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Exposure to heavy metals has been reported to be associated with impaired cognitive function, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This pilot study aimed to identify key heavy metal elements associated with cognitive function and further explore the potential mediating role of metal-related DNA methylation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Blood levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead, copper, manganese, and zinc and genome-wide DNA methylations were separately detected in peripheral blood in 155 older adults. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression were used to identify metals associated with cognitive function. An epigenome-wide association study examined the DNA methylation profile of the identified metal, and mediation analysis investigated its mediating role.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The MMSE scores showed a significant decrease of 1.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −2.64, −0.59) with each 1 standard deviation increase in ln-transformed arsenic level; this association was significant in multiple-metal models and dominated the overall negative effect of 6 heavy metal mixture on cognitive function. Seventy-three differentially methylated positions were associated with blood arsenic (<i>p</i> &lt; 1.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). The methylation levels at cg05226051 (annotated to <i>TDRD3</i>) and cg18886932 (annotated to <i>GAL3ST3</i>) mediated 24.8% and 25.5% of the association between blood arsenic and cognitive function, respectively (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Blood arsenic levels displayed a negative association with the cognitive function of older adults. This finding shows that arsenic-related DNA methylation alterations are critical partial mediators that may serve as potential biomarkers for further mechanism-related studies.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To report an autoimmune paraneoplastic encephalitis characterized by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody targeting synaptic protein calmodulin kinase-like vesicle-associated (CAMKV).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples harboring unclassified antibodies on murine brain-based indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were screened by human protein microarray. In 5 patients with identical cerebral IFA staining, CAMKV was identified as top-ranking candidate antigen. Western blots, confocal microscopy, immune-absorption, and mass spectrometry were performed to substantiate CAMKV specificity. Recombinant CAMKV-specific assays (cell-based [fixed and live] and Western blot) provided additional confirmation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 5 CAMKV-IgG positive patients, 3 were women (median symptom-onset age was 59 years; range, 53–74). Encephalitis-onset was subacute (4) or acute (1) and manifested with: altered mental status (all), seizures (4), hyperkinetic movements (4), psychiatric features (3), memory loss (2), and insomnia (2). Paraclinical testing revealed CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (all 4 tested), electrographic seizures (3 of 4 tested), and striking MRI abnormalities in all (mesial temporal lobe T2 hyperintensities [all patients], caudate head T2 hyperintensities [3], and cortical diffusion weighted hyperintensities [2]). None had post-gadolinium enhancement. Cancers were uterine adenocarcinoma (3 patients: poorly differentiated or neuroendocrine-differentiated in 2, both demonstrated CAMKV immunoreactivity), bladder urothelial carcinoma (1), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1). Two patients developed encephalitis following immune checkpoint inhibitor cancer therapy (atezolizumab [1], pembrolizumab [1]). All treated patients (4) demonstrated an initial response to immunotherapy (corticosteroids [4], IVIG [2]), though 3 died from cancer.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CAMKV-IgG is a biomarker of immunotherapy-responsive paraneoplastic encephalitis with temporal and extratemporal features and uterine cancer as a prominent oncologic association. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:21–33</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Brain networks mediating vestibular perception of self-motion overlap with those mediating balance. A systematic mapping of vestibular perceptual pathways in the thalamus may reveal new brain modulation targets for improving balance in neurological conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we systematically report how magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery of the nucleus ventralis intermedius of the thalamus commonly evokes transient patient-reported illusions of self-motion. In 46 consecutive patients, we linked the descriptions of self-motion to sonication power and 3-dimensional (3D) coordinates of sonication targets. Target coordinates were normalized using a standard atlas, and a 3D model of the nucleus ventralis intermedius and adjacent structures was created to link sonication target to the illusion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 63% of patients reported illusions of self-motion, which were more likely with increased sonication power and with targets located more inferiorly along the rostrocaudal axis. Higher power and more inferiorly targeted sonications increased the likelihood of experiencing illusions of self-motion by 4 and 2 times, respectively (odds ratios = 4.03 for power, 2.098 for location).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of magnetic vestibular stimulation is the most plausible explanation for these illusions of self-motion. Temporary unilateral modulation of vestibular pathways (via magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound) unveils the central adaptation to the magnetic field-induced peripheral vestibular bias, leading to an explicable illusion of motion. Consequently, systematic mapping of vestibular perceptual pathways via magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound may reveal new intracerebral targets for improving balance in neurological conditions.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Irisin, released by muscles during exercise, was recently identified as a neuroprotective factor in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD). In a cohort of AD patients, we studied cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma irisin levels, sex interactions, and correlations with disease biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Correlations between CSF and plasma irisin levels and AD biomarkers (amyloid β 1-42, hyperphosphorylated tau, and total tau [t-tau]) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) were analyzed in a cohort of patients with Alzheimer dementia (n = 82), mild cognitive impairment (n = 44), and subjective memory complaint (n = 20) biologically characterized according to the recent amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration classification.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CSF irisin was reduced in Alzheimer dementia patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), with lower levels in female patients. Moreover, CSF irisin correlated positively with Aβ42 in both female (<i>r</i> = 0.379, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and male (<i>r</i> = 0.262, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) patients, and negatively with CDR-SOB (<i>r</i> = −0.234, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) only in female patients. A negative trend was also observed between CSF irisin and t-tau levels in all patients (<i>r</i> = −0.144, <i>p</i> = 0.082) and in the female subgroup (<i>r</i> = −0.189, <i>p</i> = 0.084).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results highlight the relationship between irisin and biomarkers of AD pathology, especially in females. Our findings also offer perspectives toward the use of irisin as a marker of the AD continuum. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:61–73</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of our study is to better understand the genetic architecture and pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). We hypothesized that a fraction of iPD patients may harbor a combination of common variants in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used mitochondria-specific polygenic risk scores (mitoPRSs) and created pathway-specific mitoPRSs using genotype data from different iPD case–control datasets worldwide, including the Luxembourg Parkinson's Study (412 iPD patients and 576 healthy controls) and COURAGE-PD cohorts (7,270 iPD cases and 6,819 healthy controls). Cellular models from individuals stratified according to the most significant mitoPRS were subsequently used to characterize different aspects of mitochondrial function.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Common variants in genes regulating <i>Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS</i>-PRS<i>)</i> were significantly associated with a higher PD risk in independent cohorts (Luxembourg Parkinson's Study odds ratio, OR = 1.31[1.14–1.50], <i>p</i>-value = 5.4e-04; COURAGE-PD OR = 1.23[1.18–1.27], <i>p</i>-value = 1.5e-29). Functional analyses in fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neuronal progenitors revealed significant differences in mitochondrial respiration between iPD patients with high or low <i>OXPHOS</i>-PRS (<i>p</i>-values &lt; 0.05). Clinically, iPD patients with high <i>OXPHOS</i>-PRS have a significantly earlier age at disease onset compared to low-risk patients (false discovery rate [FDR]-adj <i>p</i>-value = 0.015), similar to prototypic monogenic forms of PD. Finally, iPD patients with high <i>OXPHOS</i>-PRS responded more effectively to treatment with mitochondrially active ursodeoxycholic acid.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>OXPHOS</i>-PRS may provide a precision medicine tool to stratify iPD patients into a pathogenic subgroup genetically defined by specific mitochondrial impairment, making these individuals eligible for future intelligent clinical trial designs. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:133–149</p>

                The chemical composition of foods is complex, variable, and dependent on many factors. This has a major impact on nutrition research as it foundationally aﬀects our ability to adequately assess the actual intake of nutrients and other compounds. In spite of this, accurate data on nutrient intake are key for investigating the associations and causal relationships between intake, health, and disease risk at the service of developing evidence-based dietary guidance that enables improvements in population health. Here, we exemplify the importance of this challenge by investigating the impact of food content variability on nutrition research using three bioactives as model: ﬂavan-3-ols, (–)-epicatechin, and nitrate. Our results show that common approaches aimed at addressing the high compositional variability of even the same foods impede the accurate assessment of nutrient intake generally. This suggests that the results of many nutrition studies using food composition data are potentially unreliable and carry greater limitations than commonly appreciated, consequently resulting in dietary recommendations with signiﬁcant limitations and unreliable impact on public health. Thus, current challenges related to nutrient intake assessments need to be addressed and mitigated by the development of improved dietary assessment methods involving the use of nutritional biomarkers.

                Spinal pain affects individuals of all ages and is the most common musculoskeletal problem globally. Its clinical management remains a challenge as the underlying mechanisms leading to it are still unclear. Here, we report that significantly increased numbers of senescent osteoclasts (SnOCs) are observed in mouse models of spinal hypersensitivity, like lumbar spine instability (LSI) or aging, compared to controls. The larger population of SnOCs is associated with induced sensory nerve innervation, as well as the growth of H-type vessels, in the porous endplate. We show that deletion of senescent cells by administration of the senolytic drug Navitoclax (ABT263) results in significantly less spinal hypersensitivity, spinal degeneration, porosity of the endplate, sensory nerve innervation, and H-type vessel growth in the endplate. We also show that there is significantly increased SnOC-mediated secretion of Netrin-1 and NGF, two well-established sensory nerve growth factors, compared to non-senescent OCs. These findings suggest that pharmacological elimination of SnOCs may be a potent therapy to treat spinal pain.

                We present open-source tools for three-dimensional (3D) analysis of photographs of dissected slices of human brains, which are routinely acquired in brain banks but seldom used for quantitative analysis. Our tools can: (1) 3D reconstruct a volume from the photographs and, optionally, a surface scan; and (2) produce a high-resolution 3D segmentation into 11 brain regions per hemisphere (22 in total), independently of the slice thickness. Our tools can be used as a substitute for ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which requires access to an MRI scanner, ex vivo scanning expertise, and considerable ﬁnancial resources. We tested our tools on synthetic and real data from two NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers. The results show that our methodology yields accurate 3D reconstructions, segmentations, and volumetric measurements that are highly correlated to those from MRI. Our method also detects expected diﬀerences between <i>post mortem</i> conﬁrmed Alzheimer’s disease cases and controls. The tools are available in our widespread neuroimaging suite ‘FreeSurfer’ (<a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools</a>).

                Microbes strongly affect invasive plant growth. However, how phyllosphere and rhizosphere soil microbes distinctively affect seedling mortality and growth of invaders across ontogeny under varying soil nutrient levels remains unclear. In this study, we used the invader <i>Ageratina adenophora</i> to evaluate these effects. We found that higher proportions of potential pathogens were detected in core microbial taxa in leaf litter than rhizosphere soil and thus leaf inoculation had more adverse effects on seed germination and seedling survival than soil inoculation. Microbial inoculation at different growth stages altered the microbial community and functions of seedlings, and earlier inoculation had a more adverse effect on seedling survival and growth. The soil nutrient level did not affect microbe-mediated seedling growth and the relative abundance of the microbial community and functions involved in seedling growth. The effects of some microbial genera on seedling survival are distinct from those on growth. Moreover, the <i>A. adenophora</i> seedling-killing effects of fungal strains isolated from dead seedlings by non-sterile leaf inoculation exhibited significant phylogenetic signals, by which strains of <i>Allophoma</i> and <i>Alternaria</i> generally caused high seedling mortality. Our study stresses the essential role of <i>A. adenophora</i> litter microbes in population establishment by regulating seedling density and growth.

                Extrachromosomal DNA is a common cause of oncogene amplification in cancer. The non-chromosomal inheritance of ecDNA enables tumors to rapidly evolve, contributing to treatment resistance and poor outcome for patients. The transcriptional context in which ecDNAs arise and progress, including chromosomally-driven transcription, is incompletely understood. We examined gene expression patterns of 870 tumors of varied histological types, to identify transcriptional correlates of ecDNA. Here, we show that ecDNA-containing tumors impact four major biological processes. Specifically, ecDNA-containing tumors up-regulate DNA damage and repair, cell cycle control, and mitotic processes, but down-regulate global immune regulation pathways. Taken together, these results suggest profound alterations in gene regulation in ecDNA-containing tumors, shedding light on molecular processes that give rise to their development and progression.

">Spine loss in depression impairs dendritic signal integration in human cortical microcircuit models</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (depression) is associated with altered dendritic structure and function in excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons, due to decreased inhibition from somatostatin interneurons and loss of spines and associated synapses, as indicated in postmortem human studies. Dendrites play an important role in signal processing as they receive the majority of synaptic inputs and exhibit nonlinear properties including backpropagating action potentials and dendritic Na+ spikes that enhance the computational power of the neuron. However, it is currently unclear how depression-related dendritic changes impact the integration of signals. Here, we expanded our previous data-driven detailed computational models of human cortical microcircuits in health and depression to include active dendritic properties that enable backpropagating action potentials as measured in human neurons, and spine loss in depression in terms of synapse loss and altered intrinsic property. We show that spine loss dampens signal response and thus results in a larger impairment of cortical function such as signal detection than due to reduced somatostatin interneuron inhibition alone. We further show that the altered intrinsic properties due to spine loss abolish nonlinear dendritic integration of signals and impair recurrent microcircuit activity. Our study thus mechanistically links cellular changes in depression to impaired dendritic processing in human cortical microcircuits.

Here, we show somatostatin (SOM) INs provide inhibition onto, and are excited by, local PCs, whereas vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) INs are driven by extrinsic afferents. Parvalbumin (PV) INs inhibit PCs and are activated by local and extrinsic inputs. Thus, SOM and VIP INs exhibit complementary roles in feedback and feedforward inhibition, respectively, while PV INs contribute to both microcircuit motifs. Functionally, each IN subtype reveals unique activity patterns across fear- and extinction learning with SOM and VIP INs showing most divergent characteristics, and PV INs display an intermediate phenotype parallelling synaptic data. Finally, SOM and PV INs dynamically track behavioral state transitions across learning. These data provide insight into the synaptic microcircuit organization-function relationships of distinct BLA IN classes.

">A failure to discriminate social from non-social touch at the circuit level may underlie social avoidance in autism</a></h4>

              
                Social touch is critical for communication and to impart emotions and intentions. However, certain autistic individuals experience aversion to social touch, especially when it is unwanted. We used a novel social touch assay and Neuropixels probes to compare neural responses to social vs. non-social interactions in three relevant brain regions: vibrissal somatosensory cortex, tail of striatum, and basolateral amygdala. We find that wild type (WT) mice showed aversion to repeated presentations of an inanimate object but not of another mouse. Cortical neurons cared most about touch context (social vs. object) and showed a preference for social interactions, while striatal neurons changed their preference depending on whether mice could choose or not to interact. Amygdalar and striatal neurons were preferentially modulated by forced object touch, which was the most aversive. In contrast, the Fmr1 knockout (KO) model of autism found social and non-social interactions equally aversive and displayed more aversive facial expressions to social touch when it invaded their personal space. Importantly, when Fmr1 KO mice could choose to interact, neurons in all three regions did not discriminate social valence. Thus, a failure to differentially encode social from non-social stimuli at the circuit level may underlie social avoidance in autism.

">Partially dissociable roles of the Orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal Hippocampus in context-dependent (hierarchical) reward predictions and contextual inference in learning</a></h4>

              
                Reward cues are often ambiguous; what is good in one context is not necessarily good in another context. To solve this ambiguity, animals form hierarchical associations in which the context acts as a gatekeeper in the retrieval of the appropriate cue-evoked memory, ensuring context-appropriate behavior. These hierarchical associative structures also influence future learning by promoting the formation of new context-dependent associations (leading to the inference of context-dependency for new associations). The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH) are both proposed to encode a "cognitive map" that includes the representation of hierarchical, context-dependent, associations. However the causal role of the OFC and DH in the different functional properties of hierarchical associations remains controversial. Here we used chemogenetic inactivations, in rats, to examine the role of OFC and DH in 1) the contextual regulation of performance, and 2) the contextual learning bias conferred by hierarchical associations. We show that OFC is required for both manifestations of hierarchical associations. In contrast, DH contribution appears limited to the contextual learning bias. This study provides novel insight into the different functional properties of context-dependent hierarchical associations, and establishes the OFC as a critical orchestrator of these different contextual effects.

">A computational approach to understanding effort-based decision-making in depression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motivational dysfunction is a core feature of depression, and can have debilitating effects on everyday function. However, it is unclear which disrupted cognitive processes underlie impaired motivation, and whether impairments persist following remission. Decision-making concerning exerting effort to collect rewards offers a promising framework for understanding motivation, especially when examined with computational tools which can offer precise quantification of latent processes. Methods: Effort-based decision-making was assessed using the Apple Gathering Task, in which participants decide whether to exert effort via a grip-force device to obtain varying levels of reward; effort levels were individually calibrated and varied parametrically. We present a comprehensive computational analysis of decision-making, initially validating our model in healthy volunteers (N=67), before applying it in a case-control study including current (N=41) and remitted (N=46) unmedicated depressed individuals, and healthy volunteers with (N=36) and without (N=57) a family history of depression. Results: Four fundamental computational mechanisms that drive patterns of effort-based decisions, which replicated across samples, were identified: an overall bias to accept effort challenges; reward sensitivity; and linear and quadratic effort sensitivity. Traditional model-agnostic analyses showed that both depressed groups showed lower willingness to exert effort. In contrast with previous findings, computational analysis revealed that this difference was driven by lower effort acceptance bias, but not altered effort or reward sensitivity. Conclusions: This work provides insight into the computational mechanisms underlying motivational dysfunction in depression. Lower willingness to exert effort could represent a trait-like factor contributing to symptoms, and might represent a fruitful target for treatment and prevention.

">Multimodal Precision Neuroimaging of the Individual Human Brain at Ultra-high fields</a></h4>

              
                Multimodal neuroimaging allows for non-invasive examination of human brain structure and function across multiple scales. Precision neuroimaging builds upon this foundation, enabling the mapping of brain structure, function, and connectivity patterns with high fidelity in single individuals. Ultra-high field (UHF) neuroimaging, operating at magnetic field strengths of 7 Tesla or higher, increases signal-to-noise ratio and offers even higher spatial resolution. Here, we provide a multimodal Precision Neuroimaging and Connectomics (PNI) dataset, utilizing UHF 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ten healthy individuals underwent a comprehensive MRI protocol, including T1 relaxometry, magnetization transfer imaging, T2*-weighted imaging, diffusion MRI, and multi-state functional MRI paradigms, aggregated across three imaging sessions. Alongside anonymized raw imaging data, we release cortex-wide connectomes from different modalities across multiple parcellation scales, and supply gradients that compactly characterize spatial patterning of cortical organization. Our precision imaging dataset will advance our understanding of structure-function relationships in the individual human brain and is publicly available via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/mhq3f/) and the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform data portal (https://portal.conp.ca).

	<p>(1) Background: Neurodynamic tests are recommended for the diagnosis of entrapment neuropathies such as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). However, their association with clinical variables in severe patients or patients with associated comorbidities is poorly documented. This study aims to analyze the association between the mechanosensitivity of the median nerve and symptoms, function and psycho-social variables in moderate and severe carpal tunnel syndrome patients with comorbidities; (2) Methods: Correlational study. In total, 42 pre-surgical patients (24 females; 59.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.7 years) included in the Spanish Public Healthcare System with an electrodiagnostic of CTS were selected. Sociodemographic variables and clinical features (symptoms, function, sensitivity and quality of life evaluated with the 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-sleep) were recorded. Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test 1 was used to evaluate neural mechanosensitivity; (3) Results: The 81% had a severe CTS and 78.6% had some comorbidity. The average time from the first medical visit to the surgeon&amp;amp;rsquo;s visit was 365.5 days. Median nerve mechanosensitivity correlated weakly with the SF-36 subscale, General Health, (Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rho = 0.367) and MOS sleep scale, Awaken Short of Breath or with headache dimension (Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rho = &amp;amp;minus;0.353) and moderately with SF-36 subscale, Social Functioning (Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rho = 0.553); (4) Conclusions: No associations were observed for median nerve mechanosensitivity, except for quality of life and sleep. Both social determinants and clinical variables should be considered when examining and treating these patients.</p>

	<p>Post-stroke cognitive impairment is a common and disabling condition with few effective therapeutic options. After stroke, neural reorganization and other neuroplastic processes occur in response to ischemic injury, which can result in clinical improvement through spontaneous recovery. Neuromodulation through transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising intervention to augment underlying neuroplasticity in order to improve cognitive function. This form of neuromodulation leverages mechanisms of neuroplasticity post-stroke to optimize neural reorganization and improve function. In this review, we summarize the current state of cognitive neurorehabilitation post-stroke, the practical features of tDCS, its uses in stroke-related cognitive impairment across cognitive domains, and special considerations for the use of tDCS in the post-stroke patient population.</p>

	<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the cerebrovascular disease with the highest disability and mortality rates, causing severe damage to the health of patients and imposing a significant socioeconomic burden. Aging stands as a foremost risk factor for ICH, with a significant escalation in ICH incidence within the elderly demographic, highlighting a close association between ICH and aging. In recent years, with the acceleration of the &amp;amp;ldquo;aging society&amp;amp;rdquo; trend, exploring the intricate relationship between aging and ICH has become increasingly urgent and worthy of in-depth attention. We have summarized the characteristics of ICH in the elderly, reviewing how aging influences the onset and development of ICH by examining its etiology and the mechanisms of damage via ICH. Additionally, we explored the potential impacts of ICH on accelerated aging, including its effects on cognitive abilities, quality of life, and lifespan. This review aims to reveal the connection between aging and ICH, providing new ideas and insights for future ICH research.</p>

	<p> Cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage due to electrode implantation (CIPHEI) is a rare but serious complication of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. This study retrospectively investigated a large single-center cohort of DBS implantations to calculate the frequency of CIPHEI and identify patient- and procedure-related risk factors for CIPHEI and their potential interactions. We analyzed all DBS implantations between January 2013 and December 2021 in a generalized linear model for binomial responses using bias reduction to account for sparse sampling of CIPHEIs. As potential risk factors, we considered age, gender, history of arterial hypertension, level of invasivity, types of micro/macroelectrodes, and implanted DBS electrodes. If available, postoperative coagulation and platelet function were exploratorily assessed in CIPHEI patients. We identified 17 CIPHEI cases across 839 electrode implantations in 435 included procedures in 418 patients (3.9%). Exploration and cross-validation analyses revealed that the three-way interaction of older age (above 60 years), high invasivity (i.e., use of combined micro/macroelectrodes), and implantation of directional DBS electrodes accounted for 82.4% of the CIPHEI cases. Acquired platelet dysfunction was present only in one CIPHEI case. The findings at our center suggested implantation of directional DBS electrodes as a new potential risk factor, while known risks of older age and high invasivity were confirmed. However, CIPHEI risk is not driven by the three factors alone but by their combined presence. The contributions of the three factors to CIPHEI are hence not independent, suggesting that potentially modifiable procedural risks should be carefully evaluated when planning DBS surgery in patients at risk.</p>

	<p>Correct classification of irritability is extremely important to assess prognosis and treatment indications of juvenile mood disorders. We assessed factors associated with low versus high parent- and self-rated irritability using the affective reactivity index (ARI) in a sample of 289 adolescents diagnosed with a bipolar or a major depressive disorder. Bivariate analyses were followed by multilinear logistic regression model. Factors significantly and independently associated with high versus low parent-rated ARI score were: more severe emotional dysregulation and bipolar disorders diagnosis. Factors significantly and independently associated with high versus low self-rated ARI score were: lower children depression rating scale (CDRS-R) difficulty of having fun item score, greater children depression inventory (CDI-2) self-report score, more severe emotional dysregulation, and greater CDRS-R appetite disturbance item score. High parent-rated irritability was strictly related with a bipolar disorder diagnosis, whereas high youth-rated irritability was related to depressive phenotype characterized by appetite/food-intake dysregulation, mood lability, and less anhedonia and apathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0119-24.2024?rss=1">Neuronal Subtypes and Connectivity of the Adult Mouse Paralaminar Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <p>The paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala (PL) comprises neurons that exhibit delayed maturation. PL neurons are born during gestation but mature during adolescent ages, differentiating into excitatory neurons. These late-maturing PL neurons contribute to the increase in size and cell number of the amygdala between birth and adulthood. However, the function of the PL upon maturation is unknown, as the region has only recently begun to be characterized in detail. In this study, we investigated key defining features of the adult mouse PL; the intrinsic morpho-electric properties of its neurons, and its input and output circuit connectivity. We identify two subtypes of excitatory neurons in the PL based on unsupervised clustering of electrophysiological properties. These subtypes are defined by differential action potential firing properties and dendritic architecture, suggesting divergent functional roles. We further uncover major axonal inputs to the adult PL from the main olfactory network and basolateral amygdala. We also find that axonal outputs from the PL project reciprocally to these inputs and to diverse targets including the amygdala, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Thus, the adult mouse PL is centrally placed to play a major role in the integration of olfactory sensory information, to coordinate affective and autonomic behavioral responses to salient odor stimuli.</p>
