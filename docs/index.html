              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26952?af=R">Accelerated Aging after Traumatic Brain Injury: An ENIGMA Multi‐Cohort Mega‐Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on brain structure remain uncertain. Given evidence that a single significant brain injury event increases the risk of dementia, brain-age estimation could provide a novel and efficient indexing of the long-term consequences of TBI. Brain-age procedures use predictive modeling to calculate brain-age scores for an individual using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI (cmsTBI) is associated with a higher predicted age difference (PAD), but the progression of PAD over time remains unclear. We sought to examine whether PAD increases as a function of time since injury (TSI) and if injury severity and sex interacted to influence this progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Through the ENIGMA Adult Moderate and Severe (AMS)-TBI working group, we examine the largest TBI sample to date (n = 343), along with controls, for a total sample size of n = 540, to replicate and extend prior findings in the study of TBI brain age. Cross-sectional T1w-MRI data were aggregated across 7 cohorts, and brain age was established using a similar brain age algorithm to prior work in TBI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Findings show that PAD widens with longer TSI, and there was evidence for differences between sexes in PAD, with men showing more advanced brain age. We did not find strong evidence supporting a link between PAD and cognitive performance.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work provides evidence that changes in brain structure after cmsTBI are dynamic, with an initial period of change, followed by relative stability in brain morphometry, eventually leading to further changes in the decades after a single cmsTBI. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-538/v2?src=rss">Delta-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase enzyme activity and susceptibility to lead toxicity in Uganda’s urban children [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background With rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, the population has experienced increased exposure to environmental lead subsequently causing elevated blood lead levels. Mean blood levels of 332µg/dL,120µg/dʟ, 25µg/dL,11µg/dL, and 10µg/dL in children under 18 years of age in Nigeria, DR Congo, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda respectively. Susceptibility to lead toxicity correlates with one’s nutrition status, age, and genetics. This study expounded susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda aged between 6 and 60 months. Methods A total of 198 blood samples were analyzed for blood lead levels (BLL), on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer whereas hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity, were analyzed on a spectrophotometer before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism. Results Geometric means of BLL (10.55µg/dL, SD = 7.4), Hb (7.85g/dL, SD = 1.3) and ALAD enzyme activity (37.15 units/L BLL, S.D = 9.7), corresponded to samples that coded for ALAD1 allele (99.05%) compared to the 0.05% that coded for ALAD2 with BLL (14.5µg/ dL, SD = 4.7), Hb (6.1 g/ dL), ALAD enzyme activity (33.8 units/L, SD=1.45). There was a significant relationship with a negative linear correlation between BLL, Hb (status, and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2, and ALAD2-2) in the strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p-value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, effective size = 0.43, p-value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, effective size = 0.86, p-value = ˂ 0.001). Conclusions Most of the study participants coded for the ALAD1 allele hence hoarded blood lead, which could result in delayed exposure and adverse effects later in their lives.

                Objective To determine gender gaps in Emeritus researchers in Colombia. Methods Oaxaca-Blinder-Kitakagwa decomposition model, correcting the sample selection bias with the inclusion of Mills’ inverse ratio (Heckman’s Lambda) through an ordered probit model. Data: Information available in the ScienTI Platform – Colombia during the period 2015-2021. Results The results show that the gender gap between female and male researchers is 5.8%. To achieve Emeritus status, one must be over 65 years old, and the possibility of achieving Emeritus status is 5.1% higher for female researchers than for their male counterparts. These differences can be explained by the time constraints that female researchers face in being productive, as they spend more time than male researchers on caregiving responsibilities, either due to motherhood or the care of other dependent family members. Conclusions The results obtained allow us to affirm that there is a gender gap in scientific research in Colombia in the Emeritus research category in the calls for proposals for the period 2015-2021. Moreover, the existing gap cannot be explained by factors associated with attributes of education and academic productivity that are part of the regulatory requirements, insofar as not being explained by them, it evidences the existence of discrimination against women researchers to access the highest research category.

                Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease that affects premature infants and is characterized by disrupted alveolar and vascular development. Pulmonary complications significantly affect morbidity and mortality rates in neonates with BPD. Aim This systematic review aimed to outline a protocol for investigating the effects of pulmonary complications in neonates diagnosed with BPD. Methods A comprehensive search strategy will be implemented across electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies will include primary research articles reporting pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, respiratory infections, ventilator-associated events, and airway abnormalities among neonates diagnosed with BPD. Two independent reviewers screened the titles, abstracts, and full text of the identified articles for eligibility. Data extraction will be conducted using a predefined form, including study characteristics, participant demographics, types of pulmonary complications, and relevant outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using appropriate tools, such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials. Outcome measures The primary outcomes of interest will include the prevalence and incidence of pulmonary complications among neonates diagnosed with BPD. Secondary outcomes will encompass the impact of pulmonary complications on clinical outcomes, such as respiratory morbidity, mortality rates, length of hospital stay, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

                <p>by Seolah Shin, Seok Joo Chae, Seunggyu Lee, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

The Michaelis–Menten (MM) rate law has been a fundamental tool in describing enzyme-catalyzed reactions for over a century. When substrates and enzymes are homogeneously distributed, the validity of the MM rate law can be easily assessed based on relative concentrations: the substrate is in large excess over the enzyme-substrate complex. However, the applicability of this conventional criterion remains unclear when species exhibit spatial heterogeneity, a prevailing scenario in biological systems. Here, we explore the MM rate law’s applicability under spatial heterogeneity by using partial differential equations. In this study, molecules diffuse very slowly, allowing them to locally reach quasi-steady states at each time point. We find that the conventional criterion for the validity of the MM rate law cannot be readily extended to heterogeneous environments solely through spatial averages of molecular concentrations. That is, even when the conventional criterion for the spatial averages is satisfied, the MM rate law fails to capture the enzyme catalytic rate under spatial heterogeneity. In contrast, a slightly modified form of the MM rate law, based on the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA), is accurate. Specifically, the tQSSA-based modified form, but not the original MM rate law, accurately predicts the drug clearance via cytochrome P450 enzymes and the ultrasensitive phosphorylation in heterogeneous environments. Our findings shed light on how to simplify spatiotemporal models for enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the right context, ensuring accurate conclusions and avoiding misinterpretations in <i>in silico</i> simulations.

                <p>by Roberto Efraín Díaz, Stephanie A. Wankowicz</p>

Despite advances and social progress, the exclusion of diverse groups in academia, especially science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, across the US and Europe persists, resulting in the underrepresentation of diverse people in higher education. There is extensive literature about theory, observation, and evidence-based practices that can help create a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse learning environment. In this article, we propose the implementation of a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) journal club as a strategic initiative to foster education and promote action towards making academia a more equitable institution. By creating a space for people to engage with DEIJ theories* and strategize ways to improve their learning environment, we hope to normalize the practice and importance of analyzing academia through an equity lens. Guided by restorative justice principles, we offer 10 recommendations for fostering community cohesion through education and mutual understanding. This approach underscores the importance of appropriate action and self-education in the journey toward a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and just academic environment.
*Authors’ note: We understand that “DEIJ” is a multidisciplinary organizational framework that relies on numerous fields of study, including history, sociology, philosophy, and more. We use this term to refer to these different fields of study for brevity purposes.

                <p>by Pavel Sanda, Jaroslav Hlinka, Monica van den Berg, Antonin Skoch, Maxim Bazhenov, Georgios A. Keliris, Giri P. Krishnan</p>

Brain activity during the resting state is widely used to examine brain organization, cognition and alterations in disease states. While it is known that neuromodulation and the state of alertness impact resting-state activity, neural mechanisms behind such modulation of resting-state activity are unknown. In this work, we used a computational model to demonstrate that change in excitability and recurrent connections, due to cholinergic modulation, impacts resting-state activity. The results of such modulation in the model match closely with experimental work on direct cholinergic modulation of Default Mode Network (DMN) in rodents. We further extended our study to the human connectome derived from diffusion-weighted MRI. In human resting-state simulations, an increase in cholinergic input resulted in a brain-wide reduction of functional connectivity. Furthermore, selective cholinergic modulation of DMN closely captured experimentally observed transitions between the baseline resting state and states with suppressed DMN fluctuations associated with attention to external tasks. Our study thus provides insight into potential neural mechanisms for the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation on resting-state activity and its dynamics.

                <p>by Joshua M. Mitchell, Yuanye Chi, Maheshwor Thapa, Zhiqiang Pang, Jianguo Xia, Shuzhao Li</p>

To standardize metabolomics data analysis and facilitate future computational developments, it is essential to have a set of well-defined templates for common data structures. Here we describe a collection of data structures involved in metabolomics data processing and illustrate how they are utilized in a full-featured Python-centric pipeline. We demonstrate the performance of the pipeline, and the details in annotation and quality control using large-scale LC-MS metabolomics and lipidomics data and LC-MS/MS data. Multiple previously published datasets are also reanalyzed to showcase its utility in biological data analysis. This pipeline allows users to streamline data processing, quality control, annotation, and standardization in an efficient and transparent manner. This work fills a major gap in the Python ecosystem for computational metabolomics.

                <p>by Marco A. Coelho, Márcia David-Palma, Terrance Shea, Katharine Bowers, Sage McGinley-Smith, Arman W. Mohammad, Andreas Gnirke, Andrey M. Yurkov, Minou Nowrousian, Sheng Sun, Christina A. Cuomo, Joseph Heitman</p>

In exploring the evolutionary trajectories of both pathogenesis and karyotype dynamics in fungi, we conducted a large-scale comparative genomic analysis spanning the <i>Cryptococcus</i> genus, encompassing both global human fungal pathogens and nonpathogenic species, and related species from the sister genus <i>Kwoniella</i>. Chromosome-level genome assemblies were generated for multiple species, covering virtually all known diversity within these genera. Although <i>Cryptococcus</i> and <i>Kwoniella</i> have comparable genome sizes (about 19.2 and 22.9 Mb) and similar gene content, hinting at preadaptive pathogenic potential, our analysis found evidence of gene gain (via horizontal gene transfer) and gene loss in pathogenic <i>Cryptococcus</i> species, which might represent evolutionary signatures of pathogenic development. Genome analysis also revealed a significant variation in chromosome number and structure between the 2 genera. By combining synteny analysis and experimental centromere validation, we found that most <i>Cryptococcus</i> species have 14 chromosomes, whereas most <i>Kwoniella</i> species have fewer (11, 8, 5, or even as few as 3). Reduced chromosome number in <i>Kwoniella</i> is associated with formation of giant chromosomes (up to 18 Mb) through repeated chromosome fusion events, each marked by a pericentric inversion and centromere loss. While similar chromosome inversion–fusion patterns were observed in all <i>Kwoniella</i> species with fewer than 14 chromosomes, no such pattern was detected in <i>Cryptococcus</i>. Instead, <i>Cryptococcus</i> species with less than 14 chromosomes showed reductions primarily through rearrangements associated with the loss of repeat-rich centromeres. Additionally, <i>Cryptococcus</i> genomes exhibited frequent interchromosomal translocations, including intercentromeric recombination facilitated by transposons shared between centromeres. Overall, our findings advance our understanding of genetic changes possibly associated with pathogenicity in <i>Cryptococcus</i> and provide a foundation to elucidate mechanisms of centromere loss and chromosome fusion driving distinct karyotypes in closely related fungal species, including prominent global human pathogens.

                <p>by Edwin S. Dalmaijer</p>

Homing pigeons (<i>Columba livia</i>) navigate by solar and magnetic compass, and fly home in idiosyncratic but stable routes when repeatedly released from the same location. However, when experienced pigeons fly alongside naive counterparts, their path is altered. Over several generations of turnover (pairs in which the most experienced individual is replaced with a naive one), pigeons show cumulative improvements in efficiency. Here, I show that such cumulative route improvements can occur in a much simpler system by using agent-based simulation. Artificial agents are in silico entities that navigate with a minimal cognitive architecture of goal-direction (they know roughly where the goal is), social proximity (they seek proximity to others and align headings), route memory (they recall landmarks with increasing precision), and continuity (they avoid erratic turns). Agents’ behaviour qualitatively matched that of pigeons, and quantitatively fitted to pigeon data. My results indicate that naive agents benefitted from being paired with experienced agents by following their previously established route. Importantly, experienced agents also benefitted from being paired with naive agents due to regression to the goal: naive agents were more likely to err towards the goal from the perspective of experienced agents’ memorised paths. This subtly biased pairs in the goal direction, resulting in intergenerational improvements of route efficiency. No cumulative improvements were evident in control studies in which agents’ goal-direction, social proximity, or memory were lesioned. These 3 factors are thus necessary and sufficient for cumulative route improvements to emerge, even in the absence of sophisticated communication or thought.

                <p>by Yangfan Zhang, Hungtang Ko, Michael A. Calicchia, Rui Ni, George V. Lauder</p>

The ecological and evolutionary benefits of energy-saving in collective behaviors are rooted in the physical principles and physiological mechanisms underpinning animal locomotion. We propose a turbulence sheltering hypothesis that collective movements of fish schools in turbulent flow can reduce the total energetic cost of locomotion by shielding individuals from the perturbation of chaotic turbulent eddies. We test this hypothesis by quantifying energetics and kinematics in schools of giant danio (<i>Devario aequipinnatus</i>) and compared that to solitary individuals swimming under laminar and turbulent conditions over a wide speed range. We discovered that, when swimming at high speeds and high turbulence levels, fish schools reduced their total energy expenditure (TEE, both aerobic and anaerobic energy) by 63% to 79% compared to solitary fish (e.g., 228 versus 48 kj kg<sup>−1</sup>). Solitary individuals spend approximately 22% more kinematic effort (tail beat amplitude•frequency: 1.7 versus 1.4 BL s<sup>−1</sup>) to swim in turbulence at higher speeds than in laminar conditions. Fish schools swimming in turbulence reduced their three-dimensional group volume by 41% to 68% (at higher speeds, approximately 103 versus 33 cm<sup>3</sup>) and did not alter their kinematic effort compared to laminar conditions. This substantial energy saving highlights that schooling behaviors can mitigate turbulent disturbances by sheltering fish (within schools) from the eddies of sufficient kinetic energy that can disrupt locomotor gaits. Therefore, providing a more desirable internal hydrodynamic environment could be one of the ecological drivers underlying collective behaviors in a dense fluid environment.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Suis hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

                Foreign bodies are objects that do not typically belong in the human body but can be ingested, inserted, or entered due to injuries. This article presents various cases and examples of foreign bodies, including objects swallowed, objects inserted into the rectum, vagina, urethra, ear, and nose, or due to injuries caused by falls, puncture wounds, and gunshot wounds. Foreign bodies can be difficult to detect, particularly if they are not inherently radio-opaque, and may be overlooked by patients who cannot provide an adequate history. These foreign bodies may cause harm to the patient. Interpretation is done on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), Ultrasonography (USG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Most foreign objects pass through the gastrointestinal tract without problem; sharp and elongated objects can cause significant injury, and even if they only partially perforate the bowel wall, they can produce chronic inflammatory processes that produce symptoms months or years later. Hence, searching for foreign bodies should be done throughout the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in children and people with mental illness who are more likely to swallow multiple items more than once. Although rare, various materials can be left behind in the body of a patient after surgery, including large and small wire sutures, surgical drains, and retained sponges, which can cause potential complications and foreign body reactions. This article highlights the importance of being aware of the presence of foreign bodies in clinical practice, and a thorough search should be carried out using different modalities, especially CT. Great suspicion and early diagnosis of foreign bodies can avoid potential complications and morbidity. In general, it provides information on the diagnosis and treatment of various types of foreign bodies.

                Background Certain conditions can stimulate stem cells to produce secretory factors that differ from each condition, such as hypoxia. Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells have been known to have higher proliferation rates, plasticity, and better self-improvement ability than MSCs from other sources. The objective was to analyze the secreting proteins in the Conditioned Medium - Umbilical cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (CM-UCMSCs) which potentially has a role in the chondrogenesis of cartilage defect. Methods We used SDS PAGE combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using mass spectrometer to perform a proteomic analysis of CM-UCMSCs which conditioned in a state of fasting (without serum albumin). Then, we continue to analyze to identify proteins of interest using Mascot sequence matching software. Then Analyzed using in silico / molecular docking to know the interaction of each protein with the cartilage repair factor. Results SDS PAGE performed on all secreted products in CM-UCMSCs. We found one dominant band, then we used Mass Spectrometry continued Mascot sequencing protein that band, conclude that the protein was a D4A9T1/ RNF-111/ Arkadia Protein. And then using in silico/ molecular docking method analyzed that Arkadia Protein worked synergistically with TGF-β1 Protein through activation of TGF-β1 receptors to induce the chondrogenesis. Conclusions Our results show that the fasting state on CM-UCMSCs promoted secreted Arkadia protein. From in silico model prediction, this protein suspects to have an important role in the process of repairing cartilage defects. However, further research is needed before feasible and safe for the clinical application of CM-UCMSCs in cartilage repair.

                Background Tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic is a promising option for the treatment of single or multidrug resistant pathogens. The aim of the study was to evaluate the in-vitro Tigecycline susceptibility of various pathogens from clinical samples received at the tertiary care hospitals in South India. Methods The analysis of specimens from patients admitted were carried out in this prospective cross sectional study. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by semi-automated Vitek 2 systems and Kirby Bauer method. Pattern of data analysis was done by descriptive statistics. Results Among 2574 isolates, 812 isolates were Gram positive pathogens and 1762 isolates were Gram negative pathogens. Resistance to Tigecycline was more common among Gram negative pathogens (18.62%) in comparison to the Gram positive pathogens (0.49%). Among 740 Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases (ESBL) producers such as Klebsiella species & E coli, 629 isolates were susceptible, and 93 isolates were resistant to the tigecycline. All the methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. Conclusion Multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens like Acinetobacter species, and Klebsiella species were found to be highly effective in vitro to tigecycline for elimination of infections caused by both Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens. The use of combination therapy becomes crucial to prevent the development of Pan Drug resistance.

                Background This study investigates various surface treatment methods to assess shear bond strength between set Cention N (alkasite-based restorative material) and new alkasite based restorative material. Assessing different surface treatments provide insights in optimizing repair procedure that enables durability of the restoration, thus potentially benefitting clinical outcomes. Methods A total of 48 alkasite based restorative material blocks, measuring 4 mm in depth and 4 mm in diameter, were prepared. The samples were randomly divided into 8 groups (n = 6) according to the surface treatment done. Group I: Surface preparation by bur; Group II: Surface treatment by laser; Group III: Application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive (Adper Single Bond 2 adhesive),Group IV: Application of single step self-etch adhesive (Scotchbond Universal adhesive); Group V: Bur preparation followed by application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive; Group VI: Bur preparation followed by application of single step self-etch adhesive; Group VII: Laser preparation followed by application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive; and Group VIII: Laser preparation followed by application of single step self-etch adhesive. Post-surface preparation, all the specimens were restored with newly mixed alkasite material. Repair bond strength measurements were assessed with universal testing machine. Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's tests were used to check normality and Homogeneity of variance. ANOVA with post-hoc Games-Howell test and two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test was performed to evaluate the influence of surface preparation on the repair bond strength. Results Using a 2-step etch and rinse adhesive resulted in a higher repair bond strength (26.05±2.12) compared to other surface treatments. In contrast, roughening of the surface with burs led to lowest repair bond strength (17.06±3.29) (P=0.02). Conclusion Application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive to the existing alkasite based restorative material provides superior bonding with the newly added alkasite based restorative material.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The current study investigates the intricate connection between neurology and islands shedding light on the historical, epidemiological, and genetic aspects. Based on an elaborate literature review, we identified neurological conditions having a significant clustering in an island(s), confined to a particular island(s), named after an island, and described first in an island. The genetic factors played a crucial role, uncovering disorders like Cayman ataxia, Machado Joseph disease, SGCE-mediated dystonia-myoclonus syndrome, X-linked dystonia parkinsonism, hereditary transthyretinrelated amyloidosis, Charcot Marie Tooth 4F, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndromes, that exhibited remarkable clustering in diverse islands. Local customs also left enduring imprints. Practices such as cannibalism in Papua New Guinea led to Kuru, while cycad seed consumption in Guam triggered Lytico-Bodig disease. Toxin-mediated neurologic disorders exhibited intricate island connections, exemplified by Minamata disease in Kyushu islands and atypical parkinsonism in French Caribbean islands. Additionally, the Cuban epidemic of amblyopia and neuropathy was associated with severe nutritional deficiencies. This study pioneers a comprehensive review narrating the genetic, environmental, and cultural factors highlighting the spectrum of neurological disorders in island settings. It enriches the medical literature with a unique understanding of the diverse influences shaping neurological health in island environments.

                Branchial cleft cysts are frequently encountered congenital anomalies, arising from the first to fourth pharyngeal clefts and second branchial cleft anomalies are the most common. These anomalies, even though present from birth, become symptomatic only later in life. Majority of them are benign in nature. However, these cysts can get secondarily infected or can harbour secondary metastases and sometimes even primary malignancy in very rare cases. Here we discuss a case of a middle-aged female presenting with a gradually increasing branchial cleft cyst with incidental thyroid lesion on ultrasonography, later proven to be papillary thyroid carcinoma with metastatic spread to the brachial cleft cyst.

                Abstract* Attribution rules act as a tool to modify the terms of a contract by accepting pre-specified terms and conditions. This methodology ensures that the contractual relationship is protected while addressing potentially complex scenarios that may arise during contract execution due to evolving circumstances. To maintain the binding force of the contract, Parties expedite dispute resolution and protect the integrity of their contracts by choosing recourse and prior agreeing to remedies, which encourages continuity in enforcement. These clauses are intended to automatically amend the terms of the contract without requiring the parties to participate in the amendment process. These items adjust the amount of funds subject to the obligation according to changes observed by external indicators associated with the obligation. This is done by comparing the price of a particular currency with the price of a different commodity. In the case of payment in gold or foreign currency, it represents an assault on the binding legal force of the national currency by competing with it as a means of payment and considering it as one of them. Terms of payment in gold and foreign currency are excluded from the attribution requirement, which replaces legal means of payment with new means of payment. It does not constitute a basis for determining the extent of fulfillment of the obligation, and we conclude that the attribution clause is a distinct legal system that deals with amending contractual terms and the contractual imbalance they cause. Amendment is permitted in the event of circumstances occurring that would upset the balance throughout the contract implementation period, and we recommend adopting the attribution clause as an automatic adjustment tool.

                Flexible responses to sensory stimuli based on changing rules are critical for adapting to a dynamic environment. However, it remains unclear how the brain encodes and uses rule information to guide behavior. Here, we made single-unit recordings while head-fixed mice performed a cross-modal sensory selection task where they switched between two rules: licking in response to tactile stimuli while rejecting visual stimuli, or vice versa. Along a cortical sensorimotor processing stream including the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas, and the medial (MM) and anterolateral (ALM) motor areas, single-neuron activity distinguished between the two rules both prior to and in response to the tactile stimulus. We hypothesized that neural populations in these areas would show rule-dependent preparatory states, which would shape the subsequent sensory processing and behavior. This hypothesis was supported for the motor cortical areas (MM and ALM) by findings that (1) the current task rule could be decoded from pre-stimulus population activity; (2) neural subspaces containing the population activity differed between the two rules; and (3) optogenetic disruption of pre-stimulus states impaired task performance. Our findings indicate that flexible action selection in response to sensory input can occur via configuration of preparatory states in the motor cortex.

                The atypical cadherins Fat and Dachsous (Ds) signal through the Hippo pathway to regulate growth of numerous organs, including the <i>Drosophila</i> wing. Here, we find that Ds-Fat signaling tunes a unique feature of cell proliferation found to control the rate of wing growth during the third instar larval phase. The duration of the cell cycle increases in direct proportion to the size of the wing, leading to linear-like growth during the third instar. Ds-Fat signaling enhances the rate at which the cell cycle lengthens with wing size, thus diminishing the rate of wing growth. We show that this results in a complex but stereotyped relative scaling of wing growth with body growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Finally, we examine the dynamics of Fat and Ds protein distribution in the wing, observing graded distributions that change during growth. However, the significance of these dynamics is unclear since perturbations in expression have negligible impact on wing growth.

                Endothelial and skeletal muscle lineages arise from common embryonic progenitors. Despite their shared developmental origin, adult endothelial cells (ECs) and muscle stem cells (MuSCs) (satellite cells) have been thought to possess distinct gene signatures and signaling pathways. Here we shift this paradigm by uncovering how adult MuSC behavior is affected by the expression of a subset of EC transcripts. We used several computational analyses including single-cell RNAseq to show that MuSCs express low levels of canonical EC markers in mice. We demonstrate that MuSC survival is regulated by one such prototypic endothelial signaling pathway (VEGFA-FLT1). Using pharmacological and genetic gain- and loss-of-function studies, we identify the FLT1-AKT1 axis as the key effector underlying VEGFA-mediated regulation of MuSC survival. All together, our data support that the VEGFA-FLT1-AKT1 pathway promotes MuSC survival during muscle regeneration, and highlights how the minor expression of select transcripts is sufficient for affecting cell behavior.

">Co-agonist glycine controls the occurrence of bursts by activating extrasynaptic NMDARs in nigral dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine control of movement initiation is correlated in time to the phasic activity of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons. The participation of NMDARs to the generation of bursts is essential but the mechanisms regulating their level of activation are unknown. Here, we reveal that triheteromeric NMDARs composed of GluN2B and GluN2D subunits are expressed both at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites but are activated by distinct co-agonists. D-serine is predominant for the activation of synaptic NMDARs whereas glycine is for extrasynaptic NMDARs. The pattern of bursts is insensitive to enzymatic depletion of either D-serine or glycine but the latter controls their occurrence. The co-agonist glycine through the activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs plays a central role in the generation of bursts responsible for the enhanced release of dopamine in postsynaptic areas initiating downstream motor-related behavior.

">Vasopressin differentially modulates the excitability of rat olfactory bulb neuron subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Vasopressin (VP) is essential for social memory already at the level of the olfactory bulb (OB), and OB VP cells are activated by social interaction. However, it remains unclear how VP modulates olfactory processing to enable enhanced discrimination of very similar odors, e.g., rat body odors. So far, it has been shown that VP reduces firing rates in mitral cells (MCs) during odor presentation in-vivo and decreases the amplitudes of olfactory nerve-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (ON-evoked EPSPs) in external tufted cells in-vitro. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and population Ca2+ imaging on acute rat OB slices. We recorded ON-evoked EPSPs as well as spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from two types of projection neurons, middle tufted cells (mTCs) and MCs. VP bath-application reduced the amplitudes of ON-evoked EPSPs and the frequencies of spontaneous IPSCs in mTCs but did not change those in MCs. Therefore, we analyzed ON evoked-EPSPs in inhibitory interneurons, i.e., periglomerular cells (PGCs) and granule cells (GCs), to search for the origin of increased inhibition in mTCs. However, VP did not increase the amplitudes of evoked EPSPs in either type of interneurons. We next performed two-photon population Ca2+ imaging in the glomerular layer and the superficial GC layer of responses to stronger ON stimulation than during patch-clamp experiments that should evoke action potentials in the measured cells. We observed that VP application increased ON-evoked Ca2+ influx in juxtaglomerular cell and GC somata and decreased it in the intraglomerular neuropil. Thus, our findings indicate inhibition by VP on projection neurons via strong ON input-mediated inhibitory interneuron activity.

">Replay of procedural experience is independent of the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is critical for consolidating all forms of memory1-3, from episodic experience to the development of motor skills4-6. A core feature of the consolidation process is offline replay of neuronal firing patterns that occur during experience7,8. This replay is thought to originate in the hippocampus and trigger the reactivation of ensembles of cortical and subcortical neurons1,3,9-18. However, non-declarative memories do not require the hippocampus for learning or for sleep-dependent consolidation19-26 meaning what drives their consolidation is unknown. Here we show, using an unsupervised method, that replay occurs in the dorsal striatum of mice during offline consolidation of a non-declarative, procedural, memory and that this replay is generated independently of the hippocampus. Replay occurred at both real-world and time-compressed speeds and was also prioritised both at the level of the individual neurons and the type of neural sequence. Complete bilateral lesions of the hippocampus had no effect on any feature of this replay. Our results demonstrate that procedural replay during consolidation of a non-declarative memory is independent of the hippocampus. These results support the view that replay drives active consolidation of all types of memory during sleep but challenges the idea that the hippocampus is the source of this replay.

">Multiple distinct timescales of rapid sensory adaptation in the thalamocortical circuit</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have shown that neuronal representations in sensory pathways are far from static but are instead strongly shaped by the complex properties of the sensory inputs they receive. Adaptation dynamically shapes the neural signaling that underlies our perception of the world, yet remains poorly understood. We investigated rapid adaptation across timescales from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds through simultaneous multi-electrode recordings from the ventro-posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPm) and layer 4 of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in anesthetized mice in response to controlled, persistent whisker stimulation. Observations in VPm and S1 reveal a degree of adaptation that progresses through the pathway. Signatures of two distinct timescales of rapid adaptation in the firing rates of both thalamic and cortical neuronal populations were revealed, also reflected in the synchrony of the thalamic population and in the thalamocortical synaptic efficacy that was measured in putatively monosynaptically connected thalamocortical pairs. Controlled optogenetic activation of VPm further demonstrated that the longer timescale adaptation observed in S1 is likely inherited from slow decreases in thalamic firing rate and synchrony. Despite the degraded sensory responses, adaptation resulted in a shift in coding strategy that favors theoretical discrimination over detection across the observed timescales of adaptation. Overall, although multiple mechanisms contribute to rapid adaptation at distinct timescales, they support a unifying framework on the role of adaptation in sensory processing.

">Active enhancement of synapse driven depolarization of perisynaptic astrocytic processes</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological properties underlie the fundamental mechanisms of the brain. Although astrocytes have typically been considered not electrically excitable, recent studies have shown depolarization of astrocytes induced by local extracellular potassium changes caused by neuronal activity. Interestingly, astrocytic depolarization is only induced within the periphery of the astrocyte, where astrocytes contact neurons. This depolarization affects the brain's information processing, as depolarization alters astrocyte functionality and neurotransmitter dynamics. However, specific mechanisms causing astrocytic depolarization have remained unknown due to the limitations of experimental techniques. Here, we construct a computational whole-cell astrocyte model containing experimentally verified astrocytic channels relevant to depolarization. Using our model, we suggest that previously reported potassium channels alone are insufficient for astrocyte depolarization and additional mechanisms are required. Our simulations show that NMDARs contribute to this depolarization by cooperating with Kir 4.1 to actively enhance extracellular potassium concentration and, thus, sustain depolarization.

">Sensory-Behavioral Deficits in Parkinson's Disease: Insights from a 6-OHDA Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, predominantly associated with motor symptoms. However, non-motor deficits, particularly sensory symptoms, often precede motor manifestations, offering a potential early diagnostic window. The impact of non-motor deficits on sensation behavior and the underlying mechanisms remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined changes in tactile sensation within a Parkinsonian state by employing a mouse model of PD induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to deplete striatal dopamine (DA). Leveraging the conserved mouse whisker system as a model for tactile-sensory stimulation, we conducted psychophysical experiments to assess sensory-driven behavioral performance during a tactile detection task in both the healthy and Parkinson-like states. Our findings reveal that DA depletion induces pronounced alterations in tactile sensation behavior, extending beyond expected motor impairments. We observed diverse behavioral deficits, spanning detection performance, task engagement, and reward accumulation, among lesioned individuals. While subjects with extreme DA depletion consistently showed severe sensory behavioral deficits, others with substantial DA depletion displayed minimal changes in sensory behavior performance. Moreover, some exhibited moderate degradation of behavioral performance, likely stemming from sensory signaling loss rather than motor impairment. The implementation of a sensory detection task is a promising approach to quantify the extent of impairments associated with DA depletion in the animal model. This facilitates the exploration of early non-motor deficits in PD, emphasizing the importance of incorporating sensory assessments in understanding the diverse spectrum of PD symptoms.

">In-Scanner Thoughts shape Resting-state Functional Connectivity: how participants rest matters.</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scans--namely those lacking experimentally-controlled stimuli or cognitive demands--are often used to identify aberrant patterns of functional connectivity (FC) in clinical populations. To minimize interpretational uncertainty, researchers control for across-cohort disparities in age, gender, co-morbidities, and head motion. Yet, studies rarely, if ever, consider the possibility that systematic differences in inner experience (i.e., what subjects think and feel during the scan) may directly affect FC measures. Here we demonstrate that is the case using a rs-fMRI dataset comprising 471 scans annotated with experiential data. Wide-spread significant differences in FC are observed between scans that systematically differ in terms of reported in-scanner experience. Additionally, we show that FC can successfully predict specific aspects of in-scanner experience in a manner similar to how it predicts demographics, cognitive abilities, clinical outcomes and labels. Together, these results highlight the key role of in-scanner experience in shaping rs-fMRI estimates of FC.

">Refinement of efficient encodings of movement in the dorsolateral striatum throughout learning</a></h4>

              
                The striatum is required for normal action selection, movement, and sensorimotor learning. Although action-specific striatal ensembles have been well documented, it is not well understood how these ensembles are formed and how their dynamics may evolve throughout motor learning. Here we used longitudinal 2-photon Ca2+ imaging of dorsal striatal neurons in head-fixed mice as they learned to self-generate locomotion. We observed a significant activation of both direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively) during early locomotion bouts and sessions that gradually decreased over time. For dSPNs, onset- and offset-ensembles were gradually refined from active motion-nonspecific cells. iSPN ensembles emerged from neurons initially active during opponent actions before becoming onset- or offset-specific. Our results show that as striatal ensembles are progressively refined, the number of active nonspecific striatal neurons decrease and the overall efficiency of the striatum information encoding for learned actions increases.

">Uncoupling the CRMP2-CaV2.2 interaction reduces pain-like behavior in a preclinical osteoarthritis model</a></h4>

              
                Osteoarthritis (OA) represents a significant pain challenge globally, as current treatments are limited and come with substantial and adverse side effects. Voltage-gated calcium channels have proved to be pharmacologically effective targets, with multiple FDA-approved CaV2.2 modulators available for the treatment of pain. Although effective, drugs targeting CaV2.2 are complicated by the same obstacles facing other pain therapeutics- invasive routes of administration, narrow therapeutic windows, side effects, and addiction potential. We have identified a key regulator of CaV2.2 channels, collapsing response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), that allows us to indirectly regulate CaV2.2 expression and function. We developed a peptidomimetic modulator of CRMP2, CBD3063, that effectively reverses neuropathic and inflammatory pain without negative side effects by reducing membrane expression of CaV2.2. Using a rodent model of OA, we demonstrate the intraperitoneal administration of CBD3063 alleviates both evoked and non-evoked behavioral hallmarks of OA pain. Further, we reveal that CBD3063 reduces OA-induced increased neural activity in the parabrachial nucleus, a key supraspinal site modulating the pain experience. Together, these studies suggest CBD3063 is an effective analgesic for OA pain.

">Distinct roles of two thalamostriatal systems in learning processes of visual discrimination in common marmosets</a></h4>

              
                The thalamostriatal projections arising from the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (ILN) constitute the principal source of input information to specified subregions of the striatum, a key structure of the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry. However, the roles of primate ILN in cortico-basal ganglia circuit functions remain unclear. Here, we performed immunotoxin-induced selective targeting of two representative structures of the ILN, the parafascicular nucleus (Pf) and centre median nucleus (CM) projecting to the caudate nucleus (Cd) and putamen (Pu), respectively, in common marmosets. Elimination of Pf-Cd neurons resulted in impaired reversal learning of a two-choice visual discrimination task, whereas removal of CM-Pu neurons disturbed the task acquisition. No marked impact of such manipulations was observed on either motor skill learning or spontaneous locomotor activity. Our findings reveal that the two thalamostriatal systems play distinct roles in the learning processes of external cue-dependent decision-making in nonhuman primates.

">Tool use fine-tunes arm and tool maps</a></h4>

              
                There is evidence that the sensorimotor system builds fine-grained spatial maps of the limbs based on somatosensory signals. Can a hand-held tool be mapped in space with a comparable spatial resolution? Do spatial maps change following tool use? In order to address these questions, we used a spatial mapping task on healthy participants to measure the accuracy and precision of spatial estimates pertaining to several locations on their arm and on a hand-held tool. To study spatial accuracy, we first fitted linear regressions with real location as predictor and estimated location as dependent variables. Intercepts and slopes, representing constant offset and estimation error, were compared between arm and tool, and before to after tool use. We further investigated changes induced by tool use in terms of variable error associated with spatial estimates, representing their precision. We found that the spatial maps for the arm and tool were comparably accurate, suggesting that holding the tool provides enough information to the sensorimotor system to map it in space. Further, using the tool fine-tuned the user spatial maps, increasing the precision of the tool map to a greater extent than their arm map. Furthermore, this increased precision is focal to specific tool locations, i.e., the tool tip, which may work as a spatial anchor following tool use. Our results demonstrate that tool users possess dynamic maps of tool space that are comparable to body space.

">Inhibitory circuits coordinate leg movements during Drosophila grooming</a></h4>

              
                Limbs execute diverse actions coordinated by the nervous system through multiple motor programs. The basic architecture of motor neurons that activate muscles which articulate joints for antagonistic flexion and extension movements is conserved from flies to vertebrates. While excitatory premotor circuits are expected to establish sets of leg motor neurons that work together, our study uncovered an instructive role for inhibitory circuits. Using electron microscopy data for the Drosophila nerve cord, we categorized ~120 GABAergic inhibitory neurons from the 13A and 13B hemi-lineages into classes based on similarities in morphology and connectivity. By mapping their synaptic partners, we uncovered redundant pathways for inhibiting specific groups of motor neurons, disinhibiting antagonistic counterparts, or inducing alternation between flexion and extension. We tested the function of specific inhibitory neurons through optogenetic activation and silencing, using quantitative leg movement assays for coordination during grooming. Behavior experiments and modeling demonstrate that inhibition can induce rhythmic motion, highlighting the importance of inhibitory circuits in motor control.

">Excitatory-Inhibitory Homeostasis and Bifurcation Control in the Wilson-Cowan Model of Cortical Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Although the primary function of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) homeostasis is the maintenance of mean firing rates, the conjugation of multiple homeostatic mechanisms is thought to be pivotal to ensuring edge-of-bifurcation dynamics in cortical circuits. However, computational studies on E-I homeostasis have focused solely on the plasticity of inhibition, neglecting the impact of different modes of E-I homeostasis on cortical dynamics. Therefore, we investigate how oscillations and edge-of-bifurcation dynamics are shaped by the diverse mechanisms of E-I homeostasis employed by cortical networks. Using the Wilson-Cowan model, we explore how distinct modes of E-I homeostasis maintain stable firing rates in models with varying levels of input and how it affects circuit dynamics. Our results confirm that E-I homeostasis can be leveraged to control edge-of-bifurcation dynamics and that some modes of homeostasis maintain mean firing rates under higher levels of input by modulating the distance to the bifurcation. Additionally, relying on multiple modes of homeostasis ensures stable activity while keeping oscillation frequencies within a physiological range. Our findings tie relevant features of cortical networks, such as E-I balance, the generation of gamma oscillations, and edge-of-bifurcation dynamics, under the framework of firing-rate homeostasis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity in the distance to the bifurcation found across cortical areas. In addition, we reveal the functional benefits of relying upon different homeostatic mechanisms, providing a robust method to regulate network dynamics with minimal perturbation to the generation of gamma rhythms and explaining the correlation between inhibition and gamma frequencies found in cortical networks.

">Structural diversity of Arc oligomers within the excitatory synapse</a></h4>

              
                The Activity-Regulated Cytoskeleton-Associated protein (Arc) is pivotal in mediating synaptic plasticity responses in neuronal cells. In vitro studies suggest its ability to form high- and low-order oligomers, which are involved in neuronal trafficking. Despite its important functions, no direct observation of Arc oligomers in cells has been presented due to its highly regulated spatiotemporal expression, the small size of the structures, the lack of appropriate labelling strategies and the background associated to free diffusing cytosolic proteins. Here, we apply super resolution microscopy to observe Arc oligomeric states in cellular environment with focus on the excitatory synapse. In cells, we provide the first evidence of Arc high-order oligomers; we uncovered intermolecular interactions of Arc, its tendency to form liquid condensates and interaction with lipid bilayers. Arc high-order oligomers affect AMPA receptor surface levels. Together, our observations suggest a model by which Arc oligomerization mediates plasma membrane negative curvature favoring AMPA receptors endocytosis.

">Stimulus-specificity of surround-induced responses in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies in mice challenge the traditional notion of the V1 receptive field (RF) showing increases in V1 firing rates for stimuli presented in the surround, in the absence of a visual input into the classical RF. While this effect has been interpreted as a prediction of the occluded content or a prediction error, an alternative explanation is that it reflects the representation of the uniform achromatic (gray) surface itself. To study this, we systematically investigated the dependence of V1 rate increases on the properties of distal surround stimuli. We recorded V1 and LGN neurons using Neuropixels in awake mice and demonstrated surround-induced responses in V1. That is, V1 firing rates increase by presenting a grating stimulus in the distal surround, while the RF is covered by a large gray patch up to 90{degrees} of diameter. LGN firing rates decreased for the same stimuli. V1 response latencies showed a systematic increase with the size of the gray patch. Surround-induced responses did not require spatial continuity or motion coherence of the surround stimulus and generalized to noisy textures and black/white luminance surfaces. Responses to black/white surfaces on a gray background had a similar magnitude and response latency as surround-induced responses with a black/white background. Based on these findings, we suggest that surround-induced responses primarily reflect the representation of the achromatic surface itself, which can contribute to image segmentation.

                Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, is a common cause of intellectual disability. However, the mechanism by which elevated Phe levels causes cognitive impairment remains unclear. Here, we show that submillimolar Phe perturbs synaptic plasticity through the hyperactivation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs. L-Phe exhibited dose-dependent bidirectional effects on NMDA-induced currents, without affecting synaptic NMDARs in hippocampal CA1 neurons. L-Phe-induced hyperactivation of extrasynaptic GluN2B resulted in an activity-dependent downregulation of AMPARs during burst or sustained synaptic activity. Administration of L-Phe in mice decreased neural activity and impaired memory, which were blocked by pretreatment of GluN2B inhibitors. Furthermore, pharmacological and virus-mediated suppression of GluN2B reversed impaired learning in the PahEnu2 PKU model. Collectively, these results suggest that the concentration of Phe in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with PKU perturbs extrasynaptic NMDAR and synaptic plasticity, and that suppression of GluN2B may be a therapeutic strategy for improving cognitive function in patients with PKU.

">A chemically defined oviposition attractant and repellent of Black Soldier Flies (Hermetia illucens)</a></h4>

              
                Black Soldier Flies (BSF), Hermetia illucens, are industrially important species. They can consume large amounts of spoilt organic material as larvae and bio-convert it to more useful biomass. Female BSF lay eggs in crevices adjacent to spoilt organic materials that serve as an oviposition attractant. These kairomones are central to maximising rearing efforts, yet the composition and origin of oviposition cues remain undefined, and no synthetic oviposition attractants are currently available. This work aimed to identify key components of naturally occurring oviposition attractants and to formulate an effective synthetic alternative for BSF. We have developed a novel oviposition assay and found larval food- and frass-based attractants to be the most effective at centralizing egg laying. We have identified the volatile compounds in the headspaces of putative attractants and established that the antennae of the female flies respond to some of these compounds. Behavioural validation using synthetic compounds allowed us to generate a mixture of 5 compounds (p-cresol, decanal, sulcatone, pentanoic acid, acetophenone) that cues oviposition as efficiently as currently used natural oviposition attractants. We also identified a synthetic mixture that deters oviposition in BSF. The synthetic attractant and repellent we generated are likely to simplify BSF rearing in research and industrial settings.

">The disease-causing tau V337M mutation induces tau hypophosphorylation and perturbs axon morphology pathways</a></h4>

              
                Tau aggregation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. There are disease-causing variants of the tau-encoding gene, MAPT, and the presence of tau aggregates is highly correlated with disease progression. However, the molecular mechanisms linking pathological tau to neuronal dysfunction are not well understood due to our incomplete understanding of the normal functions of tau in development and aging and how these processes change in the context of causal disease variants of tau. To address these questions in an unbiased manner, we conducted multi-omic characterization of iPSC-derived neurons harboring the MAPT V337M mutation. RNA-seq and phosphoproteomics revealed that both V337M tau and tau knockdown consistently perturbed levels of transcripts and phosphorylation of proteins related to axonogenesis or axon morphology. Surprisingly, we found that neurons with V337M tau had much lower tau phosphorylation than neurons with WT tau. We conducted functional genomics screens to uncover regulators of tau phosphorylation in neurons and found that factors involved in axonogenesis modified tau phosphorylation in both MAPT WT and MAPT V337M neurons. Intriguingly, the p38 MAPK pathway specifically modified tau phosphorylation in MAPT V337M neurons. We propose that V337M tau might perturb axon morphology pathways and tau hypophosphorylation via a "loss of function" mechanism, which could contribute to previously reported cognitive changes in preclinical MAPT gene carriers.

">Play it by Ear: A perceptual algorithm for autonomous melodious piano playing with a bio-inspired robotic hand</a></h4>

              
                Perception shapes the learning and performance of motor behavior in animals. In contrast to this inherent biological and psychological connection between perception and action, traditional artificial intelligence methods for robotics emphasize reward-driven extensive trial-and-error or error-driven control techniques. Our study goes back to the perceptual roots of biological learning and behavior, and demonstrates a novel end-to-end perceptual experience-driven approach for autonomous piano playing. Our 'Play it by Ear' perceptual learning algorithm, coupled to a bio-inspired 4-finger robotic hand, can replicate melodies on a keyboard after hearing them once, without explicit or prior knowledge of notes, the hand, or the keyboard. Our key innovation is an end-to-end pipeline that, after a brief period of 'motor babbling' by the hand, converts the sound of a melody into native musical percepts (note sequences and intensities) that it replays as sequences of key presses. In this way, any new melody consisting of notes experienced during babbling can be reproduced by the robotic musician hand on the basis of its percepts. This playback includes capturing the qualitative and quantitative musical dynamics and tempo with a nuance comparable with that of four human pianists performing the same melody. These compelling results emphasize the perceptual underpinnings of artistic performance as an alternative to traditional control-theoretical emphasis on state estimation and error correction. Our approach opens avenues for the development of simple machines that can still execute artistic and physical tasks that approach the nuance inherent in human behavior.

">Role of microglia in stress-induced alcohol intake in female and male mice</a></h4>

              
                Rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have escalated in recent years, with a particular increase among women. Women are more susceptible to stress-induced alcohol drinking, and preclinical data suggest that stress can increase alcohol intake in female rodents; however, a comprehensive understanding of sex-specific neurobiological substrates underlying this phenomenon is still emerging. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, are essential for reshaping neuronal processes, and microglial activity contributes to overall neuronal plasticity. We investigated microglial dynamics and morphology in limbic brain structures of male and female mice following exposure to stress, alcohol or both challenges. In a modified paradigm of intermittent binge drinking (repeated drinking in the dark), we determined that female, but not male, mice increased their alcohol consumption after exposure to a physical stressor and re-exposure trials in the stress-paired context. Ethanol (EtOH) drinking and stress altered a number of microglial parameters, including overall number, in subregions of the amygdala and hippocampus, with effects that were somewhat more pronounced in female mice. We used the CSF1R antagonist PLX3397 to deplete microglia in female mice to determine whether microglia contribute to stress-induced escalation of EtOH intake. We observed that microglial depletion attenuated stress-induced alcohol intake with no effect in the unstressed group. These findings suggest that microglial activity can contribute to alcohol intake under stressful conditions, and highlight the importance of evaluating sex-specific mechanisms that could result in tailored interventions for AUD in women.

">Data rescue in high-motion youth cohorts for robust and reproducible brain-behavior relationships</a></h4>

              
                Recognition of the detrimental impact of participant motion on functional connectivity measures has led to the adoption of increasingly stringent quality control standards to minimize potential motion artifacts. These stringent standards can lead to the exclusion of many participants, creating a tension with a countervailing requirement for large sample sizes that can provide adequate statistical power, particularly for brain-behavior association studies. Here, we test and validate two techniques aimed at mitigating the impact of head motion on functional connectivity estimates, and show that these techniques enable the retention of a substantial proportion of participants who would otherwise be excluded based on motion criteria, such as a minimum mean framewise displacement (FD) threshold. Specifically, we first show that functional connectomes computed using time series data that have been ordered according to motion (i.e., framewise displacement - FD) and (1) subsetted to include the lowest-motion time points ("motion ordered") or (2) subsetted and resampled ("bagged") are reproducible, in that they enable the successful identification of an individual from a group using functional connectome fingerprinting. Second, we demonstrate that motion-ordered and bagged functional connectomes yield robust brain-behavior associations, which, when examined as a function of sample size, are comparable to those obtained using the standard full time series. Finally, we show that the utility of both approaches lies in maximizing participant inclusivity by allowing for the retention of high-motion participants that would otherwise be discarded. Given equivalent performance of the two approaches across these tests of reproducibility, validity, and utility, we conclude by recommending motion-ordering to enable data rescue, maximize inclusivity, and address the need for adequately powered samples in functional connectivity research, while maintaining stringent data quality standards. While our findings were reproducible across different head motion thresholds and edges in the functional connectome, we outline possibilities for further validation and assessment of generalization using other behavioral phenotypes and consortia datasets.

">Cell-type-specific cholinergic control of granular retrosplenial cortex with implications for angular velocity coding across brain states</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic receptor activation enables the persistent firing of cortical pyramidal neurons, providing a key cellular basis for theories of spatial navigation involving working memory, path integration, and head direction encoding. The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) is important for spatially-guided behaviors, but how acetylcholine impacts RSG neurons is unknown. Here, we show that a transcriptomically, morphologically, and biophysically distinct RSG cell-type - the low-rheobase (LR) neuron - has a very distinct expression profile of cholinergic muscarinic receptors compared to all other neighboring excitatory neuronal subtypes. LR neurons do not fire persistently in response to cholinergic agonists, in stark contrast to all other principal neuronal subtypes examined within the RSG and across midline cortex. This lack of persistence allows LR neuron models to rapidly compute angular head velocity (AHV), independent of cholinergic changes seen during navigation. Thus, LR neurons can consistently compute AHV across brain states, highlighting the specialized RSG neural codes supporting navigation.

">Abnormal local cortical functional connectivity due to interneuron dysmaturation after neonatal intermittent hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Premature infants often experience frequent hypoxic episodes due to immaturity of respiratory control that may result in disturbances of gray and white matter development and long-term cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. We hypothesize that neonatal intermittent hypoxia alters cortical maturation of excitatory and inhibitory circuits that can be detected early with functional MRI. Methods. C57BL/6 mouse pups were exposed to an intermittent hypoxia (IH) regimen consisting of 12 to 20 daily hypoxic episodes of 5% oxygen exposure for 2 min at 37C from P3 to P7, followed by MRI at P12 and electrophysiological recordings in cortical slices and in vivo at several time points between P7 and P13. Behavioral tests were conducted at P41-P50 to assess animal activity and motor learning. Results. Adult mice after neonatal IH exhibited hyperactivity in open field test and impaired motor learning in complex wheel tasks. Patch clamp and evoked field potential electrophysiology revealed increased glutamatergic transmission accompanied by elevation of tonic inhibition. A decreased synaptic inhibitory drive was evidenced by miniature IPSC frequency on pyramidal cells, multi-unit activity recording in vivo in the motor cortex with selective GABAA receptor inhibitor picrotoxin injection, as well as by the decreased interneuron density at P13. There was also an increased tonic depolarizing effect of picrotoxin after IH on principal cells' membrane potential on patch clamp and direct current potential in extracellular recordings. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation on resting-state fMRI was larger, with a larger increase after picrotoxin injection in the IH group. Conclusions. Increased excitatory glutamatergic transmission, decreased numbers, and activity of inhibitory interneurons after neonatal IH may affect the maturation of connectivity in cortical networks, resulting in long-term cognitive and behavioral changes, including impaired motor learning and hyperactivity. Functional MRI reveals increased intrinsic connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex, suggesting neuronal dysfunction in cortical maturation after neonatal IH. The increased tonic inhibition, presumably due to tonic extrasynaptic GABA receptor drive, may be compensatory to the elevated excitatory glutamatergic transmission.

">The Relationships of Resting-state Brain Entropy (BEN), Ovarian Hormones and Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS)</a></h4>

              
                Entropy measures the irregularity or complexity of a system. Recent research on brain entropy (BEN) based on resting-state fMRI has provided complementary information to other metrics such as low-frequency fluctuations and cerebral blood flow. It has been established that neural plasticity, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological, as well as brain stimulation can influence BEN. However, it remains unknown whether BEN can reflect the effects of hormones. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that ovarian hormones influence both the behavioral inhibition and activation systems. In our study, we utilized open-access available data from OpenNeuro to investigate the effects of ovarian hormones on BEN and their impact on BIS/BAS. Our results indicated a negative correlation between progesterone (PROG) and BEN in the frontal-parietal network and limbic system, while BEN showed a significant positive correlation with BAS-drive in the DLPFC. Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between PROG and BAS-drive. Further analysis revealed that DLPFC BEN mediates the negative correlation between PROG and BAS-drive. This suggests that PROG reduces BAS-drive by increasing the executive and inhibitory functions of DLPFC. We also analyzed the FC between DLPFC and the whole brain. DLPFC-IPL FC showed a significant positive correlation with BAS-drive, while DLPFC-LOFC FC exhibited a significant negative correlation with BAS-fun-seeking. Moreover, DLPFC-AG FC demonstrated a significant positive correlation with BAS-rewards. These results are consistent with the relationship between executive functions of the frontal-parietal network and impulsivity representation of BAS. Our study is the first to demonstrate that BEN can also reflect the impact of hormones on brain function. Additionally, we identified that the negative correlation between PROG and BAS-drive is mediated by left DLPFC BEN, providing new insights into our understanding of the effects of PROG on the brain and behavior.

">TYK2 as a novel therapeutic target in Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is a pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), raising the possibility of common therapeutic targets. We previously established that cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (cdsRNA) is spatially coincident with cytoplasmic pTDP-43 inclusions in neurons of patients with C9ORF72-mediated ALS4. CdsRNA triggers a type-I interferon (IFN-I)-based innate immune response in human neural cells, resulting in their death 4. Here, we report that cdsRNA is also spatially coincident with pTDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions in brain cells of patients with AD pathology and that type-I interferon response genes are significantly upregulated in brain regions affected by AD. We updated our machine-learning pipeline DRIAD-SP (Drug Repurposing In Alzheimer Disease with Systems Pharmacology) to incorporate cryptic exon (CE) detection as a proxy of pTDP-43 inclusions and demonstrated that the FDA-approved JAK inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib that block interferon signaling show a protective signal only in cortical brain regions expressing multiple CEs. Furthermore, the JAK family member TYK2 was a top hit in a CRISPR screen of cdsRNA-mediated death in differentiated human neural cells. The selective TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib, an FDA-approved drug for psoriasis, rescued toxicity elicited by cdsRNA. Finally, we identified CCL2, CXCL10, and IL-6 as candidate predictive biomarkers for cdsRNA-related neurodegenerative diseases. Together, we find parallel neuroinflammatory mechanisms between TDP-43 associated-AD and ALS and nominate TYK2 as a possible disease-modifying target of these incurable neurodegenerative diseases.

">The GABAA receptor RDL modulates the auditory sensitivity of malaria mosquitoes.</a></h4>

              
                Malaria mosquitoes mate in crowded, and noisy, swarms. A vital stage of their precopulatory behaviour involves detecting the faint flight tone of a mating partner amidst the noise from hundreds of other mosquitoes. This exquisite sensory performance is enabled by a complex auditory system with remarkable features. One such feature is their vast efferent control system, which provides the mosquito ear with the required plasticity to adapt to various external and internal changes. In this paper, we study the auditory role of GABA, one of the main efferent signalling molecules in the mosquito ear, and its interactions with octopamine, another neurotransmitter of the efferent network. We show that GABA is released in the malaria mosquito auditory nerve and that GABA receptors are expressed in the ear, including the GABAA receptor Resistance to Dieldrin (RDL), a target for the evolution of insecticide resistance. Using picrotoxin to antagonize RDL receptors, we discovered multiple auditory effects of GABA at the mechanical and electrical level. At the mechanical level, blocking RDL promotes the erection of antennal fibrillae and the cessation of flagellar self-sustained oscillations. These effects are not observed in knockouts of the octopamine receptor AgOctbeta2, suggesting that RDL auditory mechanical effects are mediated through octopamine release in the mosquito ear. Electrically, picrotoxin injection increases the spontaneous firing of auditory neurons and direct current (DC) responses of the nerve to mechanical stimulation both in wildtype and AgOctbeta2 mutants, indicating that RDL may also modulate auditory sensitivity via octopamine-independent pathways. In summary, our experiments uncover distinct auditory roles of GABA, as well as synergistic roles with octopamine. The data show a fundamental role of RDL in controlling the auditory function of malaria mosquitoes and implicate RDL signalling in mating of natural malaria mosquito populations.

">ALIGNING BRAINS INTO A SHARED SPACE IMPROVES THEIR ALIGNMENT TO LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict neural activity measured using electrocorticography (ECoG) during natural language processing. To predict word-by-word neural activity, most prior work has estimated and evaluated encoding models within each electrode and subject-without evaluating how these models generalize across individual brains. In this paper, we analyze neural responses in 8 subjects while they listened to the same 30-minute podcast episode. We use a shared response model (SRM) to estimate a shared information space across subjects. We show that SRM significantly improves LLM-based encoding model performance. We also show that we can use this shared space to denoise the individual brain responses by projecting back into the individualized electrode space, and this process achieves a mean 38% improvement in encoding performance. The strongest improvement was observed for brain areas specialized for language comprehension, specifically in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Critically, estimating a shared space allows us to construct encoding models that better generalize across individuals.

">The GnRH pulse generator activity in mouse models of polycystic ovary syndrome</a></h4>

              
                One in five women worldwide suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that, alongside subfertility and hyperandrogenism, typically presents with increased luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility. As such, it is suspected that the arcuate kisspeptin (ARNKISS) neurons that represent the GnRH pulse generator are dysfunctional in PCOS. We used here in vivo GCaMP fiber photometry and other approaches to examine the behavior of the GnRH pulse generator in two mouse models of PCOS. We began with the peripubertal androgen (PPA) mouse model of PCOS but found that it had a reduction in the frequency of ARNKISS neuron synchronization events (SEs) that drive LH pulses. Examining the prenatal androgen (PNA) model of PCOS, we observed highly variable patterns of pulse generator activity with no significant differences detected in ARNKISS neuron SEs, pulsatile LH secretion, or serum testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone concentrations. However, an unsupervised machine learning approach identified that the ARNKISS neurons of acyclic PNA mice continued to exhibit cyclical patterns of activity similar to that of normal mice. The frequency of ARNKISS neuron SEs was significantly increased in algorithm-identified diestrous-stage PNA mice compared to controls. In addition, ARNKISS neurons exhibited reduced feedback suppression to progesterone in PNA mice and their pituitary gonadotrophs were also less sensitive to GnRH. These observations demonstrate the importance of understanding GnRH pulse generator activity in mouse models of PCOS. The unexpected functional disassociation of cyclical GnRH pulse generator activity in the acyclic PNA mouse indicates the presence of a complex phenotype with deficits at multiple levels of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis.

">Prevention and treatment of noise-induced hearing loss and cochlear synapse degeneration by potassium channel blockers in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Noise can induce hearing loss. In particularly, noise can induce cochlear synapse degeneration leading to hidden hearing loss, which is the most common type of hearing disorders in the clinic. Currently, there is no pharmacological treatment, particularly, no post-exposure (i.e., therapeutic) treatment available in the clinic. Here, we report that systematic administration of K+ channel blockers before or after noise exposure could significantly attenuate NIHL and synapse degeneration. After systematic administration of a general K-channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), the elevation of auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds after noise-exposure significantly reduced, and the active cochlear mechanics significantly improved. The therapeutic effect was further improved as the post-exposure administration time extending to 3 days. BK channel is a predominant K+ channel in the inner hair cells. Systematic administration of a BK channel blocker GAL-021 after noise exposure also ameliorated hearing loss and improved hearing behavioral responses tested by acoustic startle response (ASR). Finally, both TEA and GAL-021 significantly attenuated noise-induced ribbon synapse degeneration. These data demonstrate that K+-channel blockers can prevent and treat NIHL and cochlear synapse degeneration. Our finding may aid in developing therapeutic strategies for post-exposure treatment of NIHL and synapse degeneration.

	<p>The present study explored whether, given the association of temporal alpha with fear circuitry (learning and conditioning), exposure to complex childhood trauma (CCT) is reflected in the temporal&amp;amp;ndash;posterior alpha power in resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) in complex trauma-exposed adolescents in a sample of 25 adolescents and similar controls aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;17 years. Both trauma and psychopathology were screened or assessed, and resting-state EEG was recorded following a preregistered protocol for data collection. Temporal&amp;amp;ndash;posterior alpha power, corresponding to the T5 and T6 electrode locations (international 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 system), was extracted from resting-state EEG in both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. We found that in the eyes-open condition, temporal&amp;amp;ndash;posterior alpha was significantly lower in adolescents exposed to CCT relative to healthy controls, suggesting that childhood trauma exposure may have a measurable impact on alpha oscillatory patterns. Our study highlights the importance of considering potential neural markers, such as temporal&amp;amp;ndash;posterior alpha power, to understanding the long-term consequences of CCT exposure in developmental samples, with possible important clinical implications in guiding neuroregulation interventions.</p>

	<p>Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is related to mental and somatic disorders that result in alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), with 30% of AWS cases leading to life-threatening delirium tremens (DTs). Currently, studies do not support using any one biomarker in DTs. Neurotrophins affect neuromodulation, playing a role in the pathogenesis of AUD, AWS, and DTs. Methods: This review aims to summarize experimental and clinical data related to neurotrophins and S100B in neuroplasticity, as well as neurodegeneration in the context of AUD, AWS, and DTs. This work used publications that were selected based on the protocol consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Results: The BDNF level could be a good candidate biomarker for relapse susceptibility, as it is significantly reduced during consumption and gradually increases during abstinence. GDNF influences AUD through its integral role in the function of dopaminergic neurons and ablates the return to alcohol-drinking behavior. NGF protects neurons from ethanol-induced cytotoxic damage and affects recovery from cognitive deficits after brain damage. The NT-3 level is decreased after alcohol exposure and is involved in compensatory mechanisms for cognitive decline in AUD. NT-4 affects oxidative stress, which is associated with chronic alcohol consumption. S100B is used as a biomarker of brain damage, with elevated levels in serum in AUD, and can protect 5-HT neurons from the damage caused by alcohol. Conclusions: BDNF, GDNF, NT-3, NT-4, NGF, and S100B may be valuable markers for withdrawal syndrome. In particular, the most relevant is their association with the development of delirium complications. However, there are few data concerning some neurotrophins in AWS and DTs, suggesting the need for further research.</p>

                <p>Drugs of abuse cause changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associated regions that impair inhibitory control over drug-seeking. Breaking the contingencies between drug-associated cues and the delivery of the reward during extinction learning reduces relapse. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has previously been shown to enhance extinction learning and reduce drug-seeking. Here we determined the effects of VNS-mediated release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on extinction and cue-induced reinstatement in male rats trained to self-administer cocaine. Pairing 10&nbsp;d of extinction training with VNS facilitated extinction and reduced drug-seeking behavior during reinstatement. Rats that received a single extinction session with VNS showed elevated BDNF levels in the medial PFC as determined via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Systemic blockade of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors during extinction, via the TrkB antagonist ANA-12, decreased the effects of VNS on extinction and reinstatement. Whole-cell recordings in brain slices showed that cocaine self-administration induced alterations in the ratio of AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents in Layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the infralimbic cortex (IL). Pairing extinction with VNS reversed cocaine-induced changes in glutamatergic transmission by enhancing AMPAR currents, and this effect was blocked by ANA-12. Our study suggests that VNS consolidates the extinction of drug-seeking behavior by reversing drug-induced changes in synaptic AMPA receptors in the IL, and this effect is abolished by blocking TrkB receptors during extinction, highlighting a potential mechanism for the therapeutic effects of VNS in addiction.</p>

                <p>Interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulate local neural activity to influence cognitive, motivated, and emotional behaviors. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons are the primary mediators of thalamus-evoked feed-forward inhibition across the mouse cortex, including the anterior cingulate cortex, where they are engaged by inputs from the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus. In contrast, in the adjacent prelimbic (PL) cortex, we find that PV+ interneurons are scarce in the principal thalamorecipient layer 3 (L3), suggesting distinct mechanisms of inhibition. To identify the interneurons that mediate MD-evoked inhibition in PL, we combine slice physiology, optogenetics, and intersectional genetic tools in mice of both sexes. We find interneurons expressing cholecystokinin (CCK+) are abundant in L3 of PL, with cells exhibiting fast-spiking (fs) or non&ndash;fast-spiking (nfs) properties. MD inputs make stronger connections onto fs-CCK+ interneurons, driving them to fire more readily than nearby L3 pyramidal cells and other interneurons. CCK+ interneurons in turn make inhibitory, perisomatic connections onto L3 pyramidal cells, where they exhibit cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) mediated modulation. Moreover, MD-evoked feed-forward inhibition, but not direct excitation, is also sensitive to CB1R modulation. Our findings indicate that CCK+ interneurons contribute to MD-evoked inhibition in PL, revealing a mechanism by which cannabinoids can modulate MD-PFC communication.</p>

                <p>Aggression is a crucial behavior that impacts access to limited resources in different environmental contexts. Androgens synthesized by the gonads promote aggression during the breeding season. However, aggression can be expressed during the non-breeding season, despite low androgen synthesis by the gonads. The brain can also synthesize steroids ("neurosteroids"), including androgens, which might promote aggression during the non-breeding season. Male song sparrows, <I>Melospiza melodia</I>, are territorial year-round and allow the study of seasonal changes in the steroid modulation of aggression. Here, we quantified steroids following a simulated territorial intrusion (STI) for 10&nbsp;min in wild adult male song sparrows during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we examined 11 steroids: pregnenolone, progesterone, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone, 17&beta;-estradiol, 17&alpha;-estradiol, estriol, and estrone. Steroids were measured in blood and 10 microdissected brain regions that regulate social behavior. In both seasons, STI increased corticosterone in the blood and brain. In the breeding season, STI had no rapid effects on androgens or estrogens. Intriguingly, in the non-breeding season, STI increased testosterone and androstenedione in several behaviorally relevant regions, but not in the blood, where androgens remained non-detectable. Also in the non-breeding season, STI increased progesterone in the blood and specific brain regions. Overall, rapid socially modulated changes in brain steroid levels are more prominent during the non-breeding season. Brain steroid levels vary with season and social context in a region-specific manner and suggest a role for neuroandrogens in aggression during the non-breeding season.</p>

                <p>Humans need social closeness to prosper. There is evidence that empathy can induce social closeness. However, it remains unclear how empathy-related social closeness is formed and how stable it is as time passes. We applied an acquisition&ndash;extinction paradigm combined with computational modeling and fMRI, to investigate the formation and stability of empathy-related social closeness. Female participants observed painful stimulation of another person with high probability (acquisition) and low probability (extinction) and rated their closeness to that person. The results of two independent studies showed increased social closeness in the acquisition block that resisted extinction in the extinction block. Providing insights into underlying mechanisms, reinforcement learning modeling revealed that the formation of social closeness is based on a learning signal (prediction error) generated from observing another&rsquo;s pain, whereas maintaining social closeness is based on a learning signal generated from observing another&rsquo;s pain relief. The results of a reciprocity control study indicate that this feedback recalibration is specific to learning of empathy-related social closeness. On the neural level, the recalibration of the feedback signal was associated with neural responses in anterior insula and adjacent inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral superior temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction. Together, these findings show that empathy-related social closeness generated in bad times, that is, empathy with the misfortune of another person, transfers to good times and thus may form one important basis for stable social relationships.</p>

                <p>The behavioral and neural effects of the endogenous release of acetylcholine following stimulation of the nucleus basalis (NB) of Meynert have been recently examined in two male monkeys (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B53">Qi et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Counterintuitively, NB stimulation enhanced behavioral performance while broadening neural tuning in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The mechanism by which a weaker mnemonic neural code could lead to better performance remains unclear. Here, we show that increased neural excitability in a simple continuous bump attractor model can induce broader neural tuning and decrease bump diffusion, provided neural rates are saturated. Increased memory precision in the model overrides memory accuracy, improving overall task performance. Moreover, we show that bump attractor dynamics can account for the nonuniform impact of neuromodulation on distractibility, depending on distractor distance from the target. Finally, we delve into the conditions under which bump attractor tuning and diffusion balance in biologically plausible heterogeneous network models. In these discrete bump attractor networks, we show that reducing spatial correlations or enhancing excitatory transmission can improve memory precision. Altogether, we provide a mechanistic understanding of how cholinergic neuromodulation controls spatial working memory through perturbed attractor dynamics in the PFC.</p>

                <p>Cocaine use disorder is a significant public health issue without an effective pharmacological treatment. Successful treatments are hindered in part by an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie long-lasting maladaptive plasticity and addiction-like behaviors. Here, we leverage a large RNA sequencing dataset to generate gene coexpression networks across six interconnected regions of the brain's reward circuitry from mice that underwent saline or cocaine self-administration. We identify phosphodiesterase 1b (<I>Pde1b</I>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent enzyme that increases cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis, as a central hub gene within a nucleus accumbens (NAc) gene module that was bioinformatically associated with addiction-like behavior. Chronic cocaine exposure increases <I>Pde1b</I> expression in NAc D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in male but not female mice. Viral-mediated <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression in NAc reduces cocaine self-administration in female rats but increases seeking in both sexes. In female mice, overexpressing <I>Pde1b</I> in D1 MSNs attenuates the locomotor response to cocaine, with the opposite effect in D2 MSNs. Overexpressing <I>Pde1b</I> in D1/D2 MSNs had no effect on the locomotor response to cocaine in male mice. At the electrophysiological level, <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression reduces sEPSC frequency in D1 MSNs and regulates the excitability of NAc MSNs. Lastly, <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression significantly reduced the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NAc following chronic cocaine, with discordant effects on gene transcription between sexes. Together, we identify novel gene modules across the brain's reward circuitry associated with addiction-like behavior and explore the role of <I>Pde1b</I> in regulating the molecular, cellular, and behavioral responses to cocaine.</p>

                <p>According to the predictive processing framework, perception emerges from the reciprocal exchange of predictions and prediction errors (PEs) between hierarchically organized neural circuits. The nonlemniscal division of the inferior colliculus (IC) is the earliest source of auditory PE signals, but their neuronal generators, properties, and functional relevance have remained mostly undefined. We recorded single-unit mismatch responses to auditory oddball stimulation at different intensities, together with activity evoked by two sequences of alternating tones to control frequency-specific effects. Our results reveal a differential treatment of the unpredictable "many-standards" control and the predictable "cascade" control by lemniscal and nonlemniscal IC neurons that is not present in the auditory thalamus or cortex. Furthermore, we found that frequency response areas of nonlemniscal IC neurons reflect their role in subcortical predictive processing, distinguishing three hierarchical levels: (1) nonlemniscal neurons with sharply tuned receptive fields exhibit mild repetition suppression without signaling PEs, thereby constituting the input level of the local predictive processing circuitry. (2) Neurons with broadly tuned receptive fields form the main, "spectral" PE signaling system, which provides dynamic gain compensation to near-threshold unexpected sounds. This early enhancement of saliency reliant on spectral features was not observed in the auditory thalamus or cortex. (3) Untuned neurons form an accessory, "nonspectral" PE signaling system, which reports all surprising auditory deviances in a robust and consistent manner, resembling nonlemniscal neurons in the auditory cortex. These nonlemniscal IC neurons show unstructured and unstable receptive fields that could result from inhibitory input controlled by corticofugal projections conveying top-down predictions.</p>

                <p>Behaviors and their execution depend on the context and emotional state in which they are performed. The contextual modulation of behavior likely relies on regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that multiplex information about emotional/autonomic states and behaviors. The objective of the present study was to understand how the representations of behaviors by ACC neurons become modified when performed in different emotional states. A pipeline of machine learning techniques was developed to categorize and classify complex, spontaneous behaviors in male rats from the video. This pipeline, termed Hierarchical Unsupervised Behavioural Discovery Tool (HUB-DT), discovered a range of statistically separable behaviors during a task in which motivationally significant outcomes were delivered in blocks of trials that created three unique "emotional contexts." HUB-DT was capable of detecting behaviors specific to each emotional context and was able to identify and segregate the portions of a neural signal related to a behavior and to emotional context. Overall, ~10<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> as many neurons responded to behaviors in a contextually dependent versus a fixed manner, highlighting the extreme impact of emotional state on representations of behaviors that were precisely defined based on detailed analyses of limb kinematics. This type of modulation may be a key mechanism that allows the ACC to modify the behavioral output based on emotional states and contextual demands.</p>

                <p>The hippocampus is a brain structure that plays key roles in a variety of cognitive processes. Critically, a wide range of neurological disorders are associated with degeneration of the hippocampal microstructure, defined as neurons, dendrites, glial cells, and more. Thus, the hippocampus is a key target for methods that are sensitive to these microscale properties. Diffusion MRI is one such method, which can noninvasively probe neural architecture. Here we review the extensive use of diffusion MRI to capture hippocampal microstructure in both health and disease. The results of these studies indicate that (1) diffusion tensor imaging is sensitive but not specific to the hippocampal microstructure; (2) biophysical modeling of diffusion MRI signals is a promising avenue to capture more specific aspects of the hippocampal microstructure; (3) use of ultra-short diffusion times have shown unique laminar-specific microstructure and response to hippocampal injury; (4) dispersion of microstructure is likely abundant in the hippocampus; and (5) the angular richness of the diffusion MRI signal can be leveraged to improve delineation of the internal hippocampal circuitry. Overall, extant findings suggest that diffusion MRI offers a promising avenue for characterizing hippocampal microstructure.</p>

                <p>The mouse auditory organ cochlea contains two types of sound receptors: inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). Tbx2 is expressed in IHCs but repressed in OHCs, and neonatal OHCs that misexpress Tbx2 transdifferentiate into IHC-like cells. However, the extent of this switch from OHCs to IHC-like cells and the underlying molecular mechanism remain poorly understood. Furthermore, whether Tbx2 can transform fully mature adult OHCs into IHC-like cells is unknown. Here, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that in neonatal OHCs misexpressing Tbx2, 85.6% of IHC genes, including <I>Slc17a8</I>, are upregulated, but only 38.6% of OHC genes, including <I>Ikzf2</I> and <I>Slc26a5</I>, are downregulated. This suggests that Tbx2 cannot fully reprogram neonatal OHCs into IHCs. Moreover, Tbx2 also failed to completely reprogram cochlear progenitors into IHCs. Lastly, restoring Ikzf2 expression alleviated the abnormalities detected in Tbx2+ OHCs, which supports the notion that Ikzf2 repression by Tbx2 contributes to the transdifferentiation of OHCs into IHC-like cells. Our study evaluates the effects of ectopic Tbx2 expression on OHC lineage development at distinct stages of either male or female mice and provides molecular insights into how Tbx2 disrupts the gene expression profile of OHCs. This research also lays the groundwork for future studies on OHC regeneration.</p>

                <p>Latrophilin-1 (Lphn1, aka CIRL1 and CL1; gene symbol <I>Adgrl1</I>) is an adhesion GPCR that has been implicated in excitatory synaptic transmission as a candidate receptor for &alpha;-latrotoxin. Here we analyzed conditional knock-in/knock-out mice for Lphn1 that contain an extracellular myc epitope tag. Mice of both sexes were used in all experiments. Surprisingly, we found that Lphn1 is localized in cultured neurons to synaptic nanoclusters that are present in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Conditional deletion of Lphn1 in cultured neurons failed to elicit a detectable impairment in excitatory synapses but produced a decrease in inhibitory synapse numbers and synaptic transmission that was most pronounced for synapses close to the neuronal soma. No changes in axonal or dendritic outgrowth or branching were observed. Our data indicate that Lphn1 is among the few postsynaptic adhesion molecules that are present in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and that Lphn1 by itself is not essential for excitatory synaptic transmission but is required for some inhibitory synaptic connections.</p>

                <p>Physical exercise is a robust lifestyle intervention known for its enhancement of cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, the extent to which these benefits can be transmitted across generations (intergenerational inheritance to F1, and transgenerational to F2 and beyond) remains a topic of limited comprehension. We have already shown that cognitive improvements resulting from physical exercise can be inherited from parents to their offspring, proving intergenerational effects. So, we set out to explore whether these enhancements might extend transgenerationally, impacting the F2 generation. In this study, we initially examined the behavioral traits of second generation (F2) male mice, whose grandfathers (F0) had an exercise intervention. Our findings revealed that F2 mice with physically active grandpaternal F0 progenitors displayed significantly improved memory recall, encompassing both spatial and non-spatial information when compared to their counterparts from sedentary F0 progenitors, and proving for the first time the transgenerational inheritance of physical exercise induced cognitive enhancement. Surprisingly, while F2 memory improved (as was the case with F1), adult hippocampal neurogenesis remained unchanged between experimental and control groups (unlike in F1). Additionally, our analysis of small RNA sequences in the hippocampus identified 35 differentially expressed miRNAs linked to important brain function categories. Notably, two of these miRNAs, miRNA-144 and miRNA-298, displayed a robust negative correlation with cognitive performance. These findings highlight the enduring transgenerational transmission of cognitive benefits associated with exercise, even after two generations, suggesting that moderate exercise training can have lasting positive effects, possibly orchestrated by a specific set of miRNAs that exert their influence across multiple generations.</p>

                <p>A decade ago, in 2013, and over the course of 4 summer months, three separate observations were reported that each shed light independently on a new molecular organization that fundamentally reshaped our perception of excitatory synaptic transmission (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Fukata et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B81">MacGillavry et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B90">Nair et al., 2013</cross-ref>). This discovery unveiled an intricate arrangement of AMPA-type glutamate receptors and their principal scaffolding protein PSD-95, at synapses. This breakthrough was made possible, thanks to advanced super-resolution imaging techniques. It fundamentally changed our understanding of excitatory synaptic architecture and paved the way for a brand-new area of research. In this Progressions article, the primary investigators of the nanoscale organization of synapses have come together to chronicle the tale of their discovery. We recount the initial inquiry that prompted our research, the preceding studies that inspired our work, the technical obstacles that were encountered, and the breakthroughs that were made in the subsequent decade in the realm of nanoscale synaptic transmission. We review the new discoveries made possible by the democratization of super-resolution imaging techniques in the field of excitatory synaptic physiology and architecture, first by the extension to other glutamate receptors and to presynaptic proteins and then by the notion of trans-synaptic organization. After describing the organizational modifications occurring in various pathologies, we discuss briefly the latest technical developments made possible by super-resolution imaging and emerging concepts in synaptic physiology.</p>

                <p>Foraging decisions involve assessing potential risks and prioritizing food sources, which can be challenging when confronted with changing and conflicting circumstances. A crucial aspect of this decision-making process is the ability to actively overcome defensive reactions to threats and focus on achieving specific goals. The ventral pallidum (VP) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) are two brain regions that play key roles in regulating behavior motivated by either rewards or threats. However, it is unclear whether these regions are necessary in decision-making processes involving competing motivational drives during conflict. Our aim was to investigate the requirements of the VP and BLA for foraging choices in conflicts involving overcoming defensive responses. Here, we used a novel foraging task and pharmacological techniques to inactivate either the VP or BLA or to disconnect these brain regions before conducting a conflict test in male rats. Our findings showed that BLA is necessary for making risky choices during conflicts, whereas VP is necessary for invigorating the drive to obtain food, regardless of the presence of conflict. Importantly, our research revealed that the connection between VP and BLA is critical in controlling risky food-seeking choices during conflict situations. This study provides a new perspective on the collaborative function of VP and BLA in driving behavior, aimed at achieving goals in the face of dangers.</p>

                <p>High-throughput gene expression profiling measures individual gene expression across conditions. However, genes are regulated in complex networks, not as individual entities, limiting the interpretability of gene expression data. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological knowledge are a powerful tool to extract meaningful biology from gene expression data. Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) is an unsupervised machine learning method that defines biological pathways by leveraging the vast amount of published transcriptomic data. PLIER converts gene expression data into known pathway gene sets, termed latent variables (LVs), to substantially reduce data dimensionality and improve interpretability. In the current study, we trained the first mouse PLIER model on 190,111 mouse brain RNA-sequencing samples, the greatest amount of training data ever used by PLIER. We then validated the mousiPLIER approach in a study of microglia and astrocyte gene expression across mouse brain aging. mousiPLIER identified biological pathways that are significantly associated with aging, including one latent variable (LV41) corresponding to striatal signal. To gain further insight into the genes contained in LV41, we performed <I>k</I>-means clustering on the training data to identify studies that respond strongly to LV41. We found that the variable was relevant to striatum and aging across the scientific literature. Finally, we built a Web server (<A HREF="http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/">http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/</A>) for users to easily explore the learned latent variables. Taken together, this study defines mousiPLIER as a method to uncover meaningful biological processes in mouse brain transcriptomic studies.</p>

                <p>Social behavior is important for our well-being, and its dysfunctions impact several pathological conditions. Although the involvement of glutamate is undeniable, the relevance of vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (VGluT3), a specific vesicular transporter, in the control of social behavior is not sufficiently explored. Since midbrain median raphe region (MRR) is implicated in social behavior and the nucleus contains high amount of VGluT3+ neurons, we compared the behavior of male VGluT3 knock-out (KO) and VGluT3-Cre mice, the latter after chemogenetic MRR-VGluT3 manipulation. Appropriate control groups were included. Behavioral test battery was used for social behavior (sociability, social discrimination, social interaction, resident intruder test) and possible confounding factors (open field, elevated plus maze, Y-maze tests). Neuronal activation was studied by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Human relevance was confirmed by VGluT3 gene expression in relevant human brainstem areas. VGluT3 KO mice exhibited increased anxiety, social interest, but also aggressive behavior in anxiogenic environment and impaired social memory. For KO animals, social interaction induced lower cell activation in the anterior cingulate, infralimbic cortex, and medial septum. In turn, excitation of MRR-VGluT3+ neurons was anxiolytic. Inhibition increased social interest 24&nbsp;h later but decreased mobility and social behavior in aggressive context. Chemogenetic activation increased the number of c-Fos+ neurons only in the MRR. We confirmed the increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired memory of VGluT3 KO strain and revealed increased, but inadequate, social behavior. MRR-VGluT3 neurons regulated mobility and social and anxiety-like behavior in a context-dependent manner. The presence of VGluT3 mRNA on corresponding human brain areas suggests clinical relevance.</p>

                Background Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a condition that affects 5–12% of the general population. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is the preferred treatment because of its few adverse effects and highest success rates. The most common post-operative consequences include synechia, nasal blockage, and disease recurrence. Spray cryotherapy is a novel therapeutic approach with promising outcomes for the treatment of upper airway disorders. This review aimed to investigate the effects of spray cryotherapy (SCT) following ESS in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Methods Six electronic databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The selected trials were evaluated for methodological quality, and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results Three RCTs with 85 patients were included in the final analysis. SCT was related to -16 and -77 reductions in Lund-McKay and SNOT-22 scores after 36 weeks of follow-up, in contrast to a placebo, which showed -10.4, -65. Regarding the side effects of SCT, no adverse effects were reported, and visual assessments showed no pain, visual field loss, or any other ocular complications. Conclusions SCT is a new treatment modality after endoscopic sinus surgery that shows an effective post-operative management strategy with better post-operative scales (Lund-McKay, SNOT-22, POSE, and Lund-Kennedy) and less edema, obstruction, crusting, and inflammation with minimal or no side effects. However, further research with longer follow-ups, a larger sample size, and subjective assessment is needed to assess any possible long-term side effects.

                Background Car painting workers are at risk because of the use of solvents containing benzene as the main ingredient in the car painting process. One of the clinical effects of systemic benzene is kidney disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between benzene and Risk Quotient (RQ) benzene concentrations with Malondialdehyde (MDA), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels in workers exposed to benzene in car painting workshops in Surabaya. Methods This study used an observational design with a cross-sectional method conducted at two car paint workshops in Surabaya. The study population was all workers exposed to benzene in the two car paint workshops, aged between 20-65 years in 2019. The sample was taken using an accidental sampling method, involving 30 respondents. Inclusion criteria included workers exposed to benzene and willing to participate, while exclusion criteria included workers with a liver or kidney disease history. The variables studied included benzene concentration, benzene RQ (benzene metabolite), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as a marker of oxidative stress, and indicators of kidney function (BUN and creatinine levels). Data were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate analysis with Pearson correlation test. Results There was no significant relationship between concentrations, RQ benzene, and MDA levels in workers in painting in Surabaya (p> 0.05). There was no significant relationship between benzene concentration, BUN levels, and creatinine levels in paint workers in Surabaya (p> 0.05). There was no significant relationship between benzene RQ and BUN and creatinine levels in paint workers in Surabaya (p> 0.05). Conclusions This study's results indicate that benzene's effects do not lead to impaired kidney function. The benzene RQ variable in this study did not become a determining factor in BUN and creatinine levels in workers.

                Improvements in DNA sequencing technology are allowing the dramatic increase of whole genome data for a wide variety of species. Such genome sequence data can assist the monitoring of intraspecific genetic diversity, but is often lacking for threatened species. In this project, we focused on the national Red List, a catalog of extinct and threatened species, issued by the Japanese government. We combined the data included in it with the record of genome assembly in NCBI and tabulated the assembly availability of the species in the list. The combined data shows a low percentage (2.1%) of the availability of whole genome sequence data for the taxa ranked on the Japanese Red List as well as a strong bias towards mammals and birds in Animalia and vascular plants in Plantae. Our data presentation highlights potential systematic limitations in genome sequencing (e.g., budget for sequencing large genomes of amphibians) and instructs future policies including which taxon needs more effort for genome sequencing. The resultant tables are available in the original website https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/redlist/ and are regularly updated.

                Background Pelvic masses in females often present a diagnostic challenge, necessitating accurate detection and characterization for appropriate clinical management. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a valuable tool in pelvic mass evaluation, offering superior soft tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capabilities. This prospective observational study aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic MRI, determine anatomic origin, classify masses, estimate local spread, and evaluate the impact of gadolinium contrast in a tertiary care hospital in Central India. Methods The study will be conducted over a two-year period, enrolling female patients with lower back pain and clinical suspicion or inconclusive ultrasonographic findings of pelvic masses. A systematic approach to participant identification, recruitment, and engagement will be employed, with both verbal and written informed consent obtained. The imaging protocol will involve T1 and T2 weighted images, and gadolinium contrast administration when necessary. Data collection will encompass demographic information, medical history, clinical details, and MRI findings. Statistical analyses, including sensitivity, specificity, prevalence estimates, and regression analyses, will be performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic MRI. Expected outcome We anticipate that pelvic MRI will exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in detecting and characterizing pelvic masses, providing valuable information on anatomic origin and pelvic compartment localization. The study aims to contribute evidence on the impact of gadolinium contrast in enhancing diagnostic capabilities. The findings are expected to optimize clinical decision-making for effective management of females with pelvic masses, leading to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

                Background Malaria in pregnancy leads to placental malaria. The primary pathogenesis of the complex fetal implications in placental malaria is tissue hypoxia due to sequestrations of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. However, the pathomechanism of placental Plasmodium vivax infection has not been thoroughly investigated. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key transcriptional mediator of the response to hypoxic conditions, which interacts with the change and imbalances of many chemical mediators, including angiogenic factors, leading to fetal growth abnormality. Methods This study was conducted cross-sectionally in Maumere, Sikka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province, previously known as one of the malaria endemic areas with a high incidence of low birth weight (LBW) cases. This study collected peripheral and umbilical blood samples and placental tissues from mothers who delivered their babies with LBW at the TC Hiller Regional Hospital. All of the blood samples were examined for parasites by microscopic and PCR techniques, while the plasma levels of VEGF, PlGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α were determined using ELISA. The sequestration of infected erythrocytes and hemozoin was determined from placental histological slides, and the expression of placenta angiogenic factors was observed using the immunofluorescent technique. Results In this study, 33 cases had complete data to be analyzed. Of them, 19 samples were diagnosed as vivax malaria and none of falciparum malaria. There were significant differences in Δ 10th percentile growth curve of baby's body weights and also all angiogenic factors in placental tissues {VEGF, PlGF, and VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α} between those infected and not infected cases (p<0.05), but not for VEGF and VEGFR-2 in the plasma. Conclusion This study indicated that Plasmodium vivax sequestration may promote LBW through alterations and imbalances in angiogenic factors led by HIF-1α.

                Background The dimensions of popliteus muscle and its tendon are subjected to variability in the origin, mode of insertion, innervation patterns and vascular supply. The aim of this study was to measure the length, thickness and width of the popliteus muscle and its tendon at its different parts. The objectives were to study the topographic anatomy of the neurovascular structures of the popliteus and also to determine the dimensions of the popliteo-fibular ligament. Methods This descriptive cross sectional institutional based study included 50 formalin embalmed adult lower limb specimens. The measurements were performed by using the digital Vernier caliper. Results The length of the popliteus muscle belly along the upper and lower border were 44.2±6.63 mm and 89.26±14.41 mm, width of the muscle belly at midpoint, musculotendinous junction and insertion were 28.45±6.85 mm, 11.7±3.5 mm and 75.95±10.7 mm. The thickness of muscle belly at the midpoint was 2.55±0.55 mm. The length of popliteal tendon, width at origin and at musculotendinous junction were 24.85±2.15 mm, 7.55±1.55 mm and 8.5±1.15 mm. The thickness of tendon of popliteus was 2.6±0.75 mm. The length of nerve to popliteus was 50.44±8.66 mm and its origin was located 27.54±6.18 mm from the intercondylar line.

                Background Geopolymers are alternative materials to cement because they require less energy in their production process; hence, they contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of using industrial residues such as silica fume (SF) to improve the physical and mechanical properties of a pumice stone (PS)-based geopolymer. Methods Through an experimental methodology, the process starts with the extraction, grinding, and sieving of the raw material to carry out the physical and chemical characterization of the resulting material, followed by the dosage of the geopolymer mixture considering the factors that influence the resistance mechanical strength. Finally, the physical and mechanical properties of the geopolymer were characterized. This research was carried out in four stages: characterization of the pumice stone, design of the geopolymer through laboratory tests, application according to the dosage of the concrete, and analysis of the data through a multi-criteria analysis. Results It was determined that the optimal percentage of SF replacement is 10%, which to improves the properties of the geopolymer allowing to reach a maximum resistance to compression and flexion of 14.10 MPa and 4.78 MPa respectively, showing that there is a direct relationship between the percentage of SF and the resistance. Conclusions Geopolymer preparation involves the use of PS powder with a composition rich in silicon and aluminum. The factors influencing strength include the ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, water content, temperature, curing time, molarity of sodium hydroxide, and binder ratio. The results showed an increase in the compression and flexural strength with 10% SF replacement. The geopolymer’s maximum compressive strength indicates its non-structural use, but it can be improved by reducing the PS powder size.

                Village tanks, prevalent since ancient times, were an integrated part of the irrigation system in Sri Lanka (‘Ceylon’ till 1972). It was under these village tanks that paddy cultivation took place, and they were a part of the socially, technologically, and ecologically cohesive way of village life. The colonial authorities, who tried to renovate that ancient system, perceived village tanks as technically inefficient due to excessive evaporation and uneconomical land use. However, for several reasons, that perception could not be materialized during their renovation works. During the post-colonial period, with the implementation of the land colonization schemes in the 1930’s and the multipurpose river valley development schemes in the 1960’s, the scenario took a different shape. The technically perceived inferiority of the village tanks was brought into the new water management policies and the engineering designs. As a result, many of the village tanks were demolished, and those lands were converted to the farmlands. Instead of water availabilities assured through village tanks, canal irrigation became prominent. The socio-technical bondage between the village tanks and the village communities was not considered, presenting a classic case study for the consequences of neglecting social component of the technology. This paper discusses the social, political, and technical implications of these moves and their influence on shaping the present irrigation setup in the island.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

                <p>by Xiaoman Xie, Saurabh Sinha</p>

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have received attention in recent years for their regulatory roles in diverse biological contexts including cancer, yet large gaps remain in our understanding of their mechanisms and global maps of their targets. In this work, we investigated a basic unanswered question of lncRNA systems biology: to what extent can gene expression variation across individuals be attributed to lncRNA-driven regulation? To answer this, we analyzed RNA-seq data from a cohort of breast cancer patients, explaining each gene’s expression variation using a small set of automatically selected lncRNA regulators. A key aspect of this analysis is that it accounts for confounding effects of transcription factors (TFs) as common regulators of a lncRNA-mRNA pair, to enrich the explained gene expression for lncRNA-mediated regulation. We found that for 16% of analyzed genes, lncRNAs can explain more than 20% of expression variation. We observed 25–50% of the putative regulator lncRNAs to be in ‘cis’ to, i.e., overlapping or located proximally to the target gene. This led us to quantify the global regulatory impact of such cis-located lncRNAs, which was found to be substantially greater than that of trans-located lncRNAs. Additionally, by including statistical interaction terms involving lncRNA-protein pairs as predictors in our regression models, we identified cases where a lncRNA’s regulatory effect depends on the presence of a TF or RNA-binding protein. Finally, we created a high-confidence lncRNA-gene regulatory network whose edges are supported by co-expression as well as a plausible mechanism such as cis-action, protein scaffolding or competing endogenous RNAs. Our work is a first attempt to quantify the extent of gene expression control exerted globally by lncRNAs, especially those located proximally to their regulatory targets, in a specific biological (breast cancer) context. It also marks a first step towards systematic reconstruction of lncRNA regulatory networks, going beyond the current paradigm of co-expression networks, going beyond the current paradigm of co-expression networks, and motivates future analyses assessing the generalizability of our findings to additional biological contexts.

                <p>by Lu Zhang, Gang Xue, Xiaolin Zhou, Jiandong Huang, Zhiyuan Li</p>

In embryonic development and organogenesis, cells sharing identical genetic codes acquire diverse gene expression states in a highly reproducible spatial distribution, crucial for multicellular formation and quantifiable through positional information. To understand the spontaneous growth of complexity, we constructed a one-dimensional division-decision model, simulating the growth of cells with identical genetic networks from a single cell. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of cell division in providing positional cues, escorting the system toward states rich in information. Moreover, we pinpointed lateral inhibition as a critical mechanism translating spatial contacts into gene expression. Our model demonstrates that the spatial arrangement resulting from cell division, combined with cell lineages, imparts positional information, specifying multiple cell states with increased complexity—illustrated through examples in <i>C.elegans</i>. This study constitutes a foundational step in comprehending developmental intricacies, paving the way for future quantitative formulations to construct synthetic multicellular patterns.

                Background The purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness of yoga as a form of Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR) to standard VR for managing patients with symptoms such as dizziness, disequilibrium and gait instability. Methods 150 participants based on 18-point difference in the DHI score were randomly assigned to group 1- Yoga, group 2- VR and group 3- control group using block randomization. The intervention was provided for 12 weeks. The participants were assessed for Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) at baseline, 4th, 8th and 12th week. Results The mean DHI for group 1(41.12±7.13) group 2 (42.96±10.54) group 3 (50.84±10.78), p<0.001 decreased significantly in group 1 and 2 when compared to baseline. There was no statistically significant difference in overall Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores between the Yoga and Physiotherapy groups after one month; however, both groups resulted in a significant decrease in scores when compared to the control group. Similarly, by the end of the second and third months, there was no significant distinction between the Yoga and Physiotherapy groups, even though both had a considerable decrease in DHI scores when compared to the control group. Furthermore, an examination of the functional, emotional, and physical components of DHI demonstrated persistent trends of significant improvement in both the Yoga and Physiotherapy groups as compared to the control group over a three-month period. Conclusions In addition to VR, Yoga and medications administered concurrently can provide effective therapeutic effects. Yoga has an advantage over VR since it offers a customized cure for giddiness in addition to symptom relief. Yoga might be a great alternative to the conventional VR because along with enhancing overall body relaxation, it is affordable and is easy to learn.

                Background Cardiac rehabilitation is a multifaceted program implemented after adverse events. It aims at facilitating the return to normal life. This review aimed to examine the impact of cardiac rehabilitation on psychosocial risk factors, functional capacity, and left ventricular function. Methods The following databases: CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Library have been searched to retrieve the randomized controlled trials that investigate the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation versus usual care on anxiety, depression, peak oxygen consumption, six-minute walk distance, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-systolic and diastolic dimensions. Filters were set to retrieve trials that were published in the English Language between 2000 and 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (Rob2). Data were analysed meta-analytically. Results Twenty two (22) trials were included, randomized 2283 participants. A significant improvement favouring intervention groups was observed in anxiety SMD = -0.3890 (95% CI: -0.5640 to -0.2140; p˂0.001), depression SMD = -0.4032 (95% CI: -0.7114 to -0.0950; p= 0.002), peak oxygen consumption MD = 1.2471 (95% CI: 0.3963 to 2.0979; p = 0.004), six-minute walk distance MD = 36.0290 (95% CI: 7.7497 to 64.3082; p = 0.013), and left ventricular ejection fraction MD = 3.0650 (95% CI: 1.1279 to 5.0022; p = 0.001), Although cardiac rehabilitation had no significant effect in decreasing left ventricular end-diastolic dimension MD = -0.0480 (95% CI: -0.2609 to 0.1648; p = 0.658) and left ventricular end-systolic and MD = -0.0670 (95% CI: -0.2829 to 0.1489; p = 0.543) a favourable trend toward intervention group was seen. Risk of bias was high in 1 study and unclear in 7 studies. Conclusion For patients with Coronary Artery Disease, cardiac rehabilitation demonstrated effectiveness in improving psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression, functional capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption and six-minute walk test, and left ventricular function.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Remembering what just happened is a crucial prerequisite to form long-term memories but also for establishing and maintaining working memory. So far there is no general agreement about cortical mechanisms that support short-term memory. Using a classifier-based decoding approach, we report that hippocampal activity during few sparsely distributed brief time intervals contains information about the previous sensory motor experience of rodents. These intervals are characterized by only a small increase of firing rate of only a few neurons. These low-rate predictive patterns are present in both working memory and non-working memory tasks, in two rodent species, rats and Mongolian gerbils, are strongly reduced for rats with medial entorhinal cortex lesions, and depend on the familiarity of the sensory-motor context.</p>

                Sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD) share pathological features, but differing mechanisms, leading to disease. In this issue of Neuron, Almeida, Eger, et al. uncovered molecular processes that may distinguish sporadic AD from ADAD and how the APOE-Christchurch variant may be protective.

                In this issue of Neuron, Li, Zhang, et al. find that the bile acid receptor TGR5 in the lateral hypothalamus influences neuronal dynamics underlying stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Inhibition of these neurons produces antidepressant-like effects through a circuit that includes hippocampal CA3 and dorsolateral septum, revealing a novel potential therapeutic for depression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89306">Partitioning to ordered membrane domains regulates the kinetics of secretory traffic</a></h4>

              
                The organelles of eukaryotic cells maintain distinct protein and lipid compositions required for their specific functions. The mechanisms by which many of these components are sorted to their specific locations remain unknown. While some motifs mediating subcellular protein localization have been identified, many membrane proteins and most membrane lipids lack known sorting determinants. A putative mechanism for sorting of membrane components is based on membrane domains known as lipid rafts, which are laterally segregated nanoscopic assemblies of specific lipids and proteins. To assess the role of such domains in the secretory pathway, we applied a robust tool for synchronized secretory protein traffic (RUSH, <i>R</i>etention <i>U</i>sing <i>S</i>elective <i>H</i>ooks) to protein constructs with defined affinity for raft phases. These constructs consist solely of single-pass transmembrane domains (TMDs) and, lacking other sorting determinants, constitute probes for membrane domain-mediated trafficking. We find that while raft affinity can be sufficient for steady-state PM localization, it is not sufficient for rapid exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is instead mediated by a short cytosolic peptide motif. In contrast, we find that Golgi exit kinetics are highly dependent on raft affinity, with raft preferring probes exiting the Golgi ~2.5-fold faster than probes with minimal raft affinity. We rationalize these observations with a kinetic model of secretory trafficking, wherein Golgi export can be facilitated by protein association with raft domains. These observations support a role for raft-like membrane domains in the secretory pathway and establish an experimental paradigm for dissecting its underlying machinery.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93457">Loss of ninein interferes with osteoclast formation and causes premature ossification</a></h4>

              
                Ninein is a centrosome protein that has been implicated in microtubule anchorage and centrosome cohesion. Mutations in the human <i>NINEIN</i> gene have been linked to Seckel syndrome and to a rare form of skeletal dysplasia. However, the role of ninein in skeletal development remains unknown. Here, we describe a ninein knockout mouse with advanced endochondral ossification during embryonic development. Although the long bones maintain a regular size, the absence of ninein delays the formation of the bone marrow cavity in the prenatal tibia. Likewise, intramembranous ossification in the skull is more developed, leading to a premature closure of the interfrontal suture. We demonstrate that ninein is strongly expressed in osteoclasts of control mice, and that its absence reduces the fusion of precursor cells into syncytial osteoclasts, whereas the number of osteoblasts remains unaffected. As a consequence, ninein-deficient osteoclasts have a reduced capacity to resorb bone. At the cellular level, the absence of ninein interferes with centrosomal microtubule organization, reduces centrosome cohesion, and provokes the loss of centrosome clustering in multinucleated mature osteoclasts. We propose that centrosomal ninein is important for osteoclast fusion, to enable a functional balance between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts during skeletal development.

In this study, we conditionally nullified the signaling G protein subunit G<i>γ</i>13 and found that the number of ectopic tuft cells in the injured lung was reduced following the infection of the influenza virus H1N1. Furthermore, the infected mutant mice exhibited significantly larger areas of lung injury, increased macrophage infiltration, severer pulmonary epithelial leakage, augmented pyroptosis and cell death, greater bodyweight loss, slower recovery, worsened fibrosis and increased fatality. Our data demonstrate that the G<i>γ</i>13-mediated signal transduction pathway is critical to tuft cells-mediated inflammation resolution and functional repair of the damaged lungs.To our best knowledge, it is the first report indicating subtype-specific contributions of tuft cells to the resolution and recovery.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92262">A parameterized two-domain thermodynamic model explains diverse mutational effects on protein allostery</a></h4>

              
                New experimental findings continue to challenge our understanding of protein allostery. Recent deep mutational scanning study showed that allosteric hotspots in the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and its homologous transcriptional factors are broadly distributed rather than spanning well-defined structural pathways as often assumed. Moreover, hotspot mutation-induced allostery loss was rescued by distributed additional mutations in a degenerate fashion. Here, we develop a two-domain thermodynamic model for TetR, which readily rationalizes these intriguing observations. The model accurately captures the in vivo activities of various mutants with changes in physically transparent parameters, allowing the data-based quantification of mutational effects using statistical inference. Our analysis reveals the intrinsic connection of intra- and inter-domain properties for allosteric regulation and illustrate epistatic interactions that are consistent with structural features of the protein. The insights gained from this study into the nature of two-domain allostery are expected to have broader implications for other multi-domain allosteric proteins.

	<p>Ageing is a continuous process that can cause neurodevelopmental changes in the body. Several studies have examined its effects, but few have focused on how time affects biological processes in the early stages of brain development. As studying the changes that occur in the early stages of life is important to prevent age-related neurological and psychiatric disorders, we aim to focus on these changes. The transcriptomic markers of ageing that are common to the analysed brain regions of C57Bl/6J mice were identified after conducting two-way ANOVA tests and effect size analysis on the time courses of gene expression profiles in various mouse brain regions. A total of 16,374 genes (59.9%) significantly changed their expression level, among which 7600 (27.8%) demonstrated tissue-dependent differences only, and 1823 (6.7%) displayed time-dependent and tissue-independent responses. Focusing on genes with at least a large effect size gives the list of potential biomarkers 12,332 (45.1%) and 1670 (6.1%) genes, respectively. There were 305 genes that exhibited similar significant time response trends (independently of the brain region). Samples from an 11-day-old mouse embryo validated the identified early-stage brain ageing markers. The overall functional analysis revealed tRNA and rRNA processing in the mitochondrion and contact activation system (CAS), as well as the kallikrein/kinin system (KKS), together with clotting cascade and defective factor F9 activation being affected by ageing. Most ageing-related pathways were significantly enriched, especially those that are strongly connected to development processes and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>The present study explores comparatively the effectiveness of a cognitive (verbal short-term memory (vSTM), verbal working memory (vWM)) and of a linguistic training (10-week duration each) in the diffusion of gains in cognitive abilities (vSTM and vWM) of in school-aged Greek-speaking children with developmental language disorder (DLD). To this purpose, two computerized training programs i.e., a linguistic and a cognitive one, were developed and applied to three groups (A, B, and C) of children with DLD (N = 49, in total). There were three assessments with two vSTM tasks (non-word repetition and forward digit span) and a vWM task (backward digit span): pre-therapeutically (time 1), where no significant between-group differences were found, post-therapeutically I (time 2), and post-therapeutically II (time 3) and two training phases. In phase &amp;amp;Iota;, group A received meta-syntactic training, whereas group B vSTM/vWM training and group C received no training. In phase &amp;amp;Iota;&amp;amp;Iota;, a reversal of treatment was performed for groups A and B: group A received vSTM/vWM while group B meta-syntactic training. Again, group C received no training. Overall, the results indicated a significant performance improvement for the treatment groups and revealed beneficial far-transfer effects as language therapy can affect vSTM and vWM in addition to direct and near transfer effects. In addition, the intervention type order affected performance as follows: first, better performance on the vSTM task (non-word repetition) was shown when the linguistic treatment was delivered first; second, better performance on the vWM in Time 2 and Time 3 was shown by group B, for which the cognitive treatment was delivered first. Concluding, not only intervention type but also intervention type order can affect performance in DLD.</p>

	<p>Interoceptive dysfunctions are increasingly implicated in a number of physical and mental health conditions. Accordingly, there is a pertinent need for therapeutic interventions which target interoceptive deficits. Heartrate and heartrate variability biofeedback therapy (HR(V)-BF), interventions which train individuals to regulate their cardiovascular signals and constrain these within optimal parameters through breathing, could enhance the functioning of interoceptive pathways via stimulation of the vagus nerve. Consequently, this narrative systematic review sought to synthesise the current state of the literature with regard to the potential of HR(V)-BF as an interoceptive intervention across behavioural, physiological and neural outcome measures related to interoception. In total, 77 papers were included in this review, with the majority using physiological outcome measures. Overall, findings were mixed with respect to improvements in the outcome measures after HR(V)-BF. However, trends suggested that effects on measures related to interoception were stronger when resonance frequency breathing and an intense treatment protocol were employed. Based on these findings, we propose a three-stage model by which HR(V)-BF may improve interoception which draws upon principles of interoceptive inference and predictive coding. Furthermore, we provide specific directions for future research, which will serve to advance the current knowledge state.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Neurofeedback training (NFT) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing cognitive functions and reducing anxiety, yet its specific impact on university student populations requires further investigation. This study aims to examine the effects of NFT on working memory improvement and anxiety reduction within this demographic. (2) Methods: A total of forty healthy university student volunteers were randomized into two groups: an experimental group that received NFT and a control group. The NFT protocol was administered using a 14-channel Emotiv Epoc X headset (EMOTIV, Inc., San Francisco, CA 94102, USA) and BrainViz software version Brain Visualizer 1.1 (EMOTIV, Inc., San Francisco, CA 94102, USA), focusing on the alpha frequency band to target improvements in working memory and reductions in anxiety. Assessment tools, including the Corsi Block and Memory Span tests for working memory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-2 (STAI-2) for anxiety, were applied pre- and post-intervention. (3) Results: The findings indicated an increase in alpha wave amplitude in the experimental group from the second day of NFT, with statistically significant differences observed on days 2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and 8 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Contrary to expectations based on the previous literature, the study did not observe a concurrent positive impact on working memory. Nonetheless, a significant reduction in state anxiety levels was recorded in the experimental group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), corroborating NFT&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential for anxiety management. (4) Conclusions: While these results suggest some potential of the technique in enhancing neural efficiency, the variability across different days highlights the need for further investigation to fully ascertain its effectiveness. The study confirms the beneficial impact of NFT on reducing state anxiety among university students, underscoring its value in psychological and cognitive performance enhancement. Despite the lack of observed improvements in working memory, these results highlight the need for continued exploration of NFT applications across different populations and settings, emphasizing its potential utility in educational and therapeutic contexts.</p>

	<p>Ischemic stroke is a significant public health concern, with its incidence expected to double over the next 40 years, particularly among individuals over 75 years old. Previous studies, such as the DAWN trial, have highlighted the importance of correlating clinical severity with ischemic stroke volume to optimize patient management. Our study aimed to correlate the clinical severity of ischemic stroke, as assessed by the NIHSS score, with ischemic stroke volume measured using DWI, and short-term prognosis quantified by the mRS score at discharge. Conducted at the largest hospital in Gorj County from January 2023 to December 2023, this study enrolled 43 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. In our patient cohort, we observed a strong positive correlation between NIHSS score and ischemic stroke volume (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.982, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), and a strong negative correlation between ASPECTS-DWI score and mRS score (Spearman correlation coefficient = &amp;amp;minus;0.952, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant collective relationship between ASPECTS score, ischemic stroke volume, and NIHSS score (F(1, 41) = 600.28, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, R2 = 0.94, R2adj = 0.93). These findings underscore the importance of DWI in assessing ischemic stroke severity and prognosis, warranting further investigation for its integration into clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Oxidative stress may be a critical link between mitochondrial dysfunction and ASD as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from pro-oxidant environmental toxicants and activated immune cells can result in mitochondrial failure. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction, autoimmunity, and abnormal lipid mediators have been identified in multiple investigations as an acknowledged etiological mechanism of ASD that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Methods: The relationship between lipid mediator markers linked to inflammation induction, such as phospholipase A2/cyclooxygenase-2 (PLA2/Cox-2), and the mitochondrial dysfunction marker anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA-M2), and anti-histone autoantibodies in the etiology of ASD was investigated in this study using combined receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. This study also sought to identify the linear combination for a given set of markers that optimizes the partial area under ROC curves. This study included 40 age- and sex-matched controls and 40 ASD youngsters. The plasma of both groups was tested for PLA2/COX-2, AMA-M2, and anti-histone autoantibodies&amp;amp;rsquo; levels using ELISA kits. ROC curves and logistic regression models were used in the statistical analysis. Results: Using the integrated ROC curve analysis, a notable rise in the area under the curve was noticed. Additionally, the combined markers had markedly improved specificity and sensitivity. Conclusions: The current study suggested that measuring the predictive value of selected biomarkers related to mitochondrial dysfunction, autoimmunity, and lipid metabolism in children with ASD using a ROC curve analysis could lead to a better understanding of the etiological mechanism of ASD as well as its relationship with metabolism.</p>

                Back ground Code Blue is a common emergency code used in cases of cardiac arrest in hospitals to alert trained emergency response teams. The use of codes is mainly to convey essential information quickly to staff while preventing misunderstandings and panic among hospital visitors. This study aimed to determine the profiles and outcomes of patients with activated code blue calls. Methods This retrospective record-based study included all patients who had a code blue declared in the year 2022. Data was collected from the patient files from medical records department and analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Results A total of 86 code blue calls were analyzed in this study. In terms of age distribution, the age group 60-80 years had the highest percentage of code blue cases. Code blue cases were more announced in males in the study (55.8%). For the announced code blue cases, it was identified that CPR if initiated by the staff on scene before the arrival of the code blue team had higher survival chance (60.0%). Asystole was the most common rhythm detected initially (66.3%) upon arrival of the code blue team. It was found that if the response time was lesser than 2 min, the patients had a higher chance of survival (53.3%). Conclusions In conclusion, CPR performed by a trained code blue team in a hospital can help improve outcomes. The initiation of bystander CPR has been proven to have favorable outcomes. Better training of staff can result in better outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-573/v1?src=rss">Case series: Management and outcomes of five cases of blunt and open pancreatic trauma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Pancreatic trauma is notably less frequent than injuries affecting other solid organs, such as the liver or spleen. Despite their infrequency, pancreatic injuries can pose significant risks, with mortality rates ranging from 5 to 30% and morbidity rates reaching 50%. Managing such injuries remains contentious because of the anatomical complexity, lesion extent, and close proximity to neighboring organs. Methods Our study aimed to delineate the clinical and biological characteristics of pancreatic trauma and specify diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. This study was conducted retrospectively from 2010 to 2021 at Mahmoud El Matri Hospital’s General Surgery Department in Ariana, TUNISIA, and included five cases of blunt and open pancreatic trauma. Results Although rare, pancreatic injuries can lead to serious consequences, prompting the development of a diverse array of therapeutic options. Pancreatic trauma presents a complex clinical challenge, necessitating a comprehensive approach that considers various factors, such as injury severity, anatomical location, and patient condition. Advanced imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) scanning, Wirsung-MRI, and ERCP, aid in the accurate diagnosis and assessment of canal involvement. Conservative management was considered for cases with limited canal rupture, whereas endoscopic treatments showed promise for hemodynamically stable cases. Surgical interventions, such as duodenopancreatectomy, are reserved for exceptional cases with severe injuries. Conclusion Pancreatic trauma requires a comprehensive approach that considers factors such as injury severity, anatomical location, and patient condition. Ongoing research and collaboration are vital for refining pancreatic trauma management and proposing guidelines for facilitating decision-making.

                <p>Sleep's contribution to affective regulation is insufficiently understood. Previous human research has focused on memorizing or rating affective pictures and less on physiological affective responsivity. This may result in overlapping definitions of affective and declarative memories and inconsistent deductions for how rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and slow-wave sleep (SWS) are involved. Literature associates REMS theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) activity with emotional memory processing, but its contribution to social stress habituation is unknown. Applying selective sleep stage suppression and oscillatory analyses, we investigated how sleep modulated affective adaptation toward social stress and retention of neutral declarative memories. Native Finnish participants (<I>N</I> = 29; age, <I>M</I> = 25.8&nbsp;years) were allocated to REMS or SWS suppression conditions. We measured physiological (skin conductance response, SCR) and subjective stress response and declarative memory retrieval thrice: before laboratory night, the next morning, and after 3&nbsp;d. Linear mixed models were applied to test the effects of condition and sleep parameters on emotional responsivity and memory retrieval. Greater overnight increase in SCR toward the stressor emerged after suppressed SWS (intact REMS) relative to suppressed REMS (20.1% vs 6.1%; <I>p</I> = 0.016). The overnight SCR increase was positively associated with accumulated REMS theta energy irrespective of the condition (<I>r</I> = 0.601; <I>p</I> = 0.002). Subjectively rated affective response and declarative memory recall were comparable between the conditions. The contributions of REMS and SWS to habituation of social stress are distinct. REMS theta activity proposedly facilitates the consolidation of autonomic affective responses. Declarative memory consolidation may not have greater dependence on intact SWS relative to intact REMS.</p>

                <p>Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), crucially contribute to myelination and circuit function. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics in oligodendrocytes mediates activity-dependent and activity-independent myelination. Unraveling how myelinating oligodendrocytes orchestrate and integrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, particularly in relation to axonal firing, is crucial for gaining insights into their role in the CNS development and function, both in health and disease. In this framework, we used the recombinant adeno-associated virus/Olig001 capsid variant to express the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator jGCaMP8s, under the control of the myelin basic protein promoter. In our study, this tool exhibits excellent tropism and selectivity for myelinating and mature oligodendrocytes, and it allows monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in myelin-forming cells, both in isolated primary cultures and organotypic spinal cord explants. By live imaging of myelin Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in oligodendrocytes within organ cultures, we observed a rapid decline in the amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events across different in vitro developmental stages. Active myelin sheath remodeling and growth are modulated at the level of myelin&ndash;axon interface through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and, during early myelination in organ cultures, this phase is finely tuned by the firing of axon action potentials. In the later stages of myelination, Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in mature oligodendrocytes no longer display such a modulation, underscoring the involvement of complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in CNS myelination.</p>

                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                <p>by Frank Hawkins</p>

The potentially catastrophic loss of biodiversity happening around the globe is largely caused by economic activity that is not connected to its environmental impacts. To improve positive and reduce negative outcomes for nature, investment decision-makers in companies, governments, and the finance sector need data on the impacts of economic activity, especially production of food and other commodities, on biodiversity, at fine geographical scales. This Essay argues that the data allowing us to identify the most important factors causing biodiversity loss are already available. However, we need more data to track impacts on biodiversity up value chains into pathways, toolkits, and approaches that will facilitate verified, concrete actions by companies and consumers to reduce threats to biodiversity in particular places. Our current knowledge is insufficient to deliver complete responses to the biodiversity crisis, but this is no excuse for delaying action.

                <p>by Laura Dearden, Isadora C. Furigo, Lucas C. Pantaleão, L W. P. Wong, Denise S. Fernandez-Twinn, Juliana de Almeida-Faria, Katherine A. Kentistou, Maria V. Carreira, Guillaume Bidault, Antonio Vidal-Puig, Ken K. Ong, John R. B. Perry, Jose Donato Jr, Susan E. Ozanne</p>

In utero exposure to maternal obesity programs increased obesity risk. Animal models show that programmed offspring obesity is preceded by hyperphagia, but the mechanisms that mediate these changes are unknown. Using a mouse model of maternal obesity, we observed increased intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) in offspring of obese mothers that precedes the development of obesity. Through small RNA sequencing, we identified programmed overexpression of hypothalamic miR-505-5p that is established in the fetus, lasts to adulthood and is maintained in hypothalamic neural progenitor cells cultured in vitro. Metabolic hormones and long-chain fatty acids associated with obesity increase miR-505-5p expression in hypothalamic neurons in vitro. We demonstrate that targets of miR-505-5p are enriched in fatty acid metabolism pathways and overexpression of miR-505-5p decreased neuronal fatty acid metabolism in vitro. miR-505-5p targets are associated with increased BMI in human genetic studies. Intra-cerebroventricular injection of miR-505-5p in wild-type mice increased HFD intake, mimicking the phenotype observed in offspring exposed to maternal obesity. Conversely, maternal exercise intervention in an obese mouse pregnancy rescued the programmed increase of hypothalamic miR-505-5p in offspring of obese dams and reduced HFD intake to control offspring levels. This study identifies a novel mechanism by which maternal obesity programs obesity in offspring via increased intake of high-fat foods.

                Efforts have been made over the last five decades to create effective ultrasonic contrast media (UCM) for cardiac and noncardiac applications. The initial UCM was established in the 1980s, following publications from the 1960s that detailed the discovery of ultrasonic contrast enhancement using small gaseous bubbles in echocardiographic examinations. An optimal contrast agent for echography should possess the following characteristics: non-toxicity, suitability for intravenous injection, ability to traverse pulmonary, cardiac, and capillary circulations, and stability for recirculation. Definity, Optison, Sonazoid, and SonoVue are examples of current commercial contrast media. These contrast media have shown potential for various clinical reasons, both on-label and off-label. Several possible UCMs have been developed or are in progress. Advancements in comprehending the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of microbubbles have significantly improved the visualization of tumor blood vessels, the identification of areas with reduced blood supply, and the enhanced detection of narrowed blood vessels. Innovative advances are expected to enhance future applications such as ultrasonic molecular imaging and therapeutic utilization of microbubbles.

                Background Measures of hemiparetic ankle dorsiflexor muscle strength and rate of force development (RFD) are often used to determine the efficacy of rehabilitation interventions after stroke. However, evidence supporting the reliability of these measures is limited. This brief report provides a secondary analysis investigating the between-session reliability of isometric ankle dorsiflexor muscle strength, rate of force development (RFD), and tibialis anterior electromyography (TA EMG), in people with chronic stroke. Method Participants (n=15) completed three maximal isometric contractions of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles as fast as possible using a rigid dynamometer. Tests were repeated seven days later. Outcomes included ankle dorsiflexor isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), RFD in the first 200ms (RFD200ms), time to reach 90% MVC, and peak TA EMG. Data were analysed for 13 participants using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of the measure percentage (SEM%). Results Reliability was higher when analysing the mean of three trials rather than the best of three trials. There was excellent reliability for isometric dorsiflexor MVC (ICC 0.97 [95% CI 0.92, 0.99], SEM% 7%). However, for other outcomes, while the ICC indicated good reliability, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the ICC fell in the moderate range for TA EMG (ICC 0.86 [95% CI 0.60, 0.96], SEM% 25%) and time to reach 90% MVC (ICC 0.8 [95% CI 0.53, 0.93], SEM% 23%) and in the poor range for dorsiflexor RFD200ms (ICC 0.79 [95% CI 0.48, 0.92], SEM% 24%). Conclusion The findings raise concerns about the reliability of measures of rapid force production in the dorsiflexor muscles after stroke. Given the functional significance of the ankle dorsiflexors, larger studies should be conducted to further investigate these concerns and explore reliable methods for measuring rapid force production in the hemiparetic dorsiflexor muscles.

                Introduction Rectal bleeding commonly occurs in elderly patients using blood thinners, posing management challenges due to limited guidance on reversal agents and medication restart criteria. This study aims to review the demographics and management of elderly patients with rectal bleeding while on blood thinners. Methods A retrospective analysis of patients aged 60 or older presenting with rectal bleeding at West Suffolk Hospital’s emergency department was conducted from January 2018 to December 2020. Data were extracted from electronic records, focusing on patients using blood thinners and adhering to British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. All patients ceased blood-thinning medications upon admission. The hospital’s ethics committee approved the study, which focused on demographics, diagnosis, and management, particularly regarding re-initiation of blood-thinning medicines. Results During the study period, 170 patients were admitted to the emergency department of West Suffolk Hospital. 93 (54.71%) patients were included in the study. The average age of the participants was 82 years, and 62.3% were male. All patients were followed up for three months. Atrial fibrillation accounted for 52% of patients, while previous strokes accounted for 20%. The most typical pathology was diverticulosis. Regarding restarting of anticoagulants, Among patients on DOAC (Direct oral anticoagulant), 39% were restarted on discharge, 23% were switched to warfarin, and another 23% were not restarted; 15% planned to restart after seven days. For those on Warfarin, 62% were restarted on discharge, 22% stopped the medication, and the rest were switched to Dual Oral Anticoagulant. Among aspirin patients, 60% were restarted at discharge, while the remaining discontinued. All patients receiving clopidogrel and dual antiplatelet therapy were started at discharge. None of the patients were readmitted during the follow-up period of 3 months. Conclusion Restarting of blood-thinning drugs in patients with rectal bleeding is subject to individual patient variation. Necessitates more extensive trials to achieve greater standardization.

                In this current era of communications and networking, The Internet of things plays the main role in the making of smart communication and networking. In this article, we have focused on the literature survey on wireless sensor networks which are energy efficient. Various standard protocols are reviewed along with some enhanced protocols which makes the network energy efficient. The comparison of the standard and enhanced protocols with respect to various applications in wireless sensor networks is thoroughly done in this article. The outcomes of the enhanced protocols are also briefly discussed. For easier analysis to future researchers, a comparative table which lists the enhanced protocols which are compared with standard counterparts along with the factors for energy efficiency of the protocols. This article also comments on the issues and challenges of the protocols which can be further analyzed for making the wireless sensor network more energy efficient.
