This effect is phenocopied by the viral envelope (E) protein that is acetylated in cells and has evolved to antagonize the induction of the interferon response by binding and inhibiting BET proteins through their bromodomains.

                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto-immune inflammatory disorder affecting the central nervous system. The cause of the disease is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the pathogenesis. We derived cerebral organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of healthy control subjects as well as from primary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients to better understand the pathologic basis of the varied clinical phenotypic expressions of MS. In MS organoids, most notably in PPMS, we observed a decrease of proliferation marker Ki67 and a reduction of the SOX2+ stem cell pool associated with an increased expression of neuronal markers CTIP2 and TBR1. This dysregulation of the stem cell pool is associated with a decreased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Our findings show that the genetic background of a patient can directly alter stem cell function. This study also provides new insights on the innate cellular dysregulation in MS and identifies p21 pathway as a new potential target for therapeutic strategies in MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early exposure to high-fat diet impairs central and peripheral metabolic function: Impacts on cognition and mitochondrial function</a></h4>

              
                The impact of overnutrition early in life is not restricted to the onset of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but also affects critical brain functions related to cognition. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between peripheral metabolic and bioenergetic changes induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and their impact on hippocampal cognitive functions in juvenile mice. To this purpose, three-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received a HFD or control diet for seven weeks, associated with two low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) or vehicle, to accelerate the metabolic dysfunction. HFD induced metabolic changes in mice, particularly related to glucose metabolism, in spite of the absence of obesity and changes in lipid profile. HFD exposure starting from weaning impaired recognition and spatial memories in mice, without inducing a depressive-like behavior. Increased immunoreactivity for GFAP and a trend towards a decrease in NeuN staining were verified in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice. HFD caused a bioenergetic impairment in the hippocampus, characterized by a decrease in both O2 consumption related to ATP production and in the maximum respiratory capacity. The thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue was impaired by HFD, here verified through the absence of a decrease in O2 consumption after UCP-1 inhibition and increase in the reserve respiratory capacity. Impaired mitochondria function was also observed in the liver of HFD mice, while no changes were verified in O2 consumption in the heart of juvenile mice. These results indicate that the introduction of a HFD early in life has a detrimental impact on bioenergetic and mitochondrial function of tissues with metabolic and thermogenic activities, which is likely related to hippocampal metabolic changes and cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Intrinsic Hierarchy of Self - Converging Topography and Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The brain can be characterized by an intrinsic hierarchy in its topography which, as recently shown for the uni-transmodal distinction of core and periphery, converges with its dynamics. Does such intrinsic hierarchical organization in both topography and dynamic also apply to the brain's inner core itself and its higher-order cognitive functions like self? Applying multiple fMRI data sets, we show how the recently established three-layer topography of self (internal, external, mental) is already present during the resting state and carried over to task states including both task-specific and -unspecific effects. Moreover, the topographic hierarchy converges with corresponding dynamic changes (measured by power-law exponent, autocorrelation window, median frequency, sample entropy, complexity) during both rest and task states. Finally, analogous to the topographic hierarchy, we also demonstrate hierarchy among the different dynamic measures themselves according to background and foreground. Finally, we show task-specific- and un-specific effects in the hierarchies of both dynamics and topography. Together, we demonstrate the existence of an intrinsic topographic hierarchy of self and its convergence with dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An action-observation network in the common marmoset identified by ultra-high field fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Thirty years have passed since the first description of neurons in Old World macaque monkeys that fire both during the execution and observation of goal-directed actions. Since then, these so-called mirror neurons have been shown to play important roles in understanding the actions of others, learning by imitation, and social cognition in macaques and humans. In contrast to Old World primates, an action-observation network has not yet been identified in New World primates. Here we used ultra-high field fMRI at 9.4T in awake common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) while they watched videos depicting the upper-limb of marmosets performing goal-directed (grasping food) or non-goal-directed actions. We found that the observation of goal-directed actions, compared to non-goal directed ones, activated a frontotemporoparietal network, including areas 6 and 45 in premotor and prefrontal cortices, and areas PGa-IPa, FST, and the TE complex in temporoparietal regions. These results demonstrate the existence of an evolutionarily conserved action observation network in primates that likely predates the separation of Old and New World monkeys.

                Identifying genetic variants associated with nicotine-motivated behavioral traits is an important strategy to understand the fundamental mechanisms underpinning smoking and tobacco abuse. For suitable emulation of behavioral phenotype with the full advantage of this invertebrate model, we newly established a worm model of nicotine seeking by Conditioned Cue Preference (CCP). We demonstrated that C. elegans also exhibited pivotal features of nicotine-motivated behaviors as in mammals. First, we identified the nicotine-elicited cue preference is mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in worms. Additionally, we exhibited dopamine is also required for the development of CCP. Subsequently, we identified the nAChRs subunits associated with the facilitation of nicotine preference. Accordingly, we validated human GWAS candidates associated with nicotine dependence involved in the role of those nAChR subunits. we addressed the cross-species functional validation to determine the GWAS candidate genes have authentic roles in nicotine seeking associated with tobacco abuse. The loss of function strain of CACNA2D3 orthologue, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 3, was tested for CCP. We also tested the knock-out (KO) strain of the CACNA2D2 orthologue, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 2, which is closely related to CACNA2D3 in the same family and shared the human smoking phenotypes. Our orthogonal test suggests the functional conservation of the 2{delta} subunit of calcium channel in nicotine motivated behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Replicable multivariate BWAS with moderate sample sizes</a></h4>

              
                Brain-Wide Association Studies (BWAS) have become a dominant method for linking mind and brain over the past 30 years. Univariate models test tens to hundreds of thousands of brain voxels individually, whereas multivariate models ('multivariate BWAS') integrate signals across brain regions into a predictive model. Numerous problems have been raised with univariate BWAS, including lack of power and reliability and an inability to account for pattern-level information embedded in distributed neural circuits. Multivariate predictive models address many of these concerns, and offer substantial promise for delivering brain-based measures of behavioral and clinical states and traits. In their recent paper, Marek et al. evaluated the effects of sample size on univariate and multivariate BWAS in three large-scale neuroimaging dataset and came to the general conclusion that "BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals". We applaud their comprehensive analysis, and we agree that (a) large samples are needed when conducting univariate BWAS of individual differences in trait measures, and (b) multivariate BWAS reveal substantially larger effects and are therefore more highly powered. However, we disagree with Marek et al.'s claims that multivariate BWAS provide "inflated in-sample associations" that often fail to replicate (i.e., are underpowered), and that multivariate BWAS consequently require thousands of participants when predicting trait-level individual differences. Here we substantiate that (i) with appropriate methodology, the reported in-sample effect size inflation in multivariate BWAS can be entirely eliminated, and (ii) in most cases, multivariate BWAS effects are replicable with substantially smaller sample sizes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Graph Representation Learning Algorithms and Deep Neural Network, Based on fMRI Signals</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we are going to apply graph representation learning algorithms to identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients within a large brain imaging dataset. Since ASD is characterized by social deficits and repetitive behavioral symptoms, it is mainly identified by brain functional connectivity patterns. Attempts to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from ASD are the essence of ASD classification. We claim that considering the connectivity patterns of the brain can be appropriately executed by graph representation learning methods. These methods can capture the whole structure of the brain, both local and global properties. The investigation is done for the brain imaging worldwide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange). The classifier adapted to the features embedded in graphs is a LeNet deep neural network. Among different graph representation techniques, we used AWE, Node2vec, Struct2vec, multi node2vec, and Graph2Img. The best approach was Graph2Img, in which after extracting the feature vectors representative of the brain nodes, the PCA algorithm is applied to the matrix of feature vectors. Although we could not outperform the previous 70% accuracy of 10-fold cross-validation in the identification of ASD versus control patients in the dataset, for leave-one-site-out cross-validation, we could obtain better results (our accuracy: 80%). It is evident that the effect of graph embedding methods is making the connectivity matrix more suitable for applying to a deep network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural circuits underlying habituation of visually evoked escape behaviors in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Larval zebrafish that are exposed repeatedly to dark looming stimuli will quickly habituate to these aversive signals and cease to respond with their stereotypical escape swims. A dark looming stimulus can be separated into two independent components: one that is characterized by an overall spatial expansion, where overall luminance is maintained at the same level, and a second, that represents an overall dimming within the whole visual field in the absence of any motion energy. Using specific stimulation patterns that isolate these independent components, we first extracted the behavioral algorithms that dictate how these separate information channels interact with each other and across the two eyes during the habituation process. Concurrent brain wide imaging experiments then permitted the construction of circuit models that suggest the existence of three separate neural pathways. The first is a looming channel which responds specifically to concentrically expanding edges and relays that information to the brain stem escape network to generate directed escapes. The second is a dimming specific channel that serves to support and amplify the looming pathway. While the looming channel operates in a purely monocular fashion where stimuli are relayed exclusively to the contralateral hemisphere, dimming responses are processed in both monocular and binocular pathways. Finally, we identify a third, separate and largely monocular, dimming channel that appears to specifically inhibit escape responses when activated. We propose that, unlike the first two channels, this third channel is under strong contextual modulation and that it is primarily responsible for the incremental silencing of successive dark looming evoked escapes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The polycomb repressor complex 2 and Enhancer of Zeste 2 regulate glial reactivity and are required for the formation of Muller glia-derived progenitor cells in the retina</a></h4>

              
                EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste 2), a key component of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), is required for the differentiation of Muller glia (MG) during retinal development. However, nothing is known about the roles of EZH2 and PRC2 in mature or damaged retinas. Herein, we investigate the expression of PRC2-related factors and roles during the formation of Muller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the chick and mouse retinas. In chick, EZH2, PRC2-related factors, and EZH2-activators, JARID2 and AEBP1, are dynamically expressed by MG and MGPCs in damaged retinas. Inhibition of EZH2, EED or JARID2 blocks the formation of MGPCs. Similarly, inhibition of EZH2 suppresses the proliferation of progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone. By using a combination of single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq, we find significant changes in gene expression and chromatin access in MG with EZH2 inhibition and NMDA-treatment, and many of these genes are associated with glial and neuronal differentiation. Correlation across gene expression, chromatin access and transcription factor motif access in MG was observed for transcription factors known to covey glial identity and promote retinal development. In the mouse retina, components of the PRC2 complex are downregulated in MG in damaged retinas and inhibition of EZH2 has no effect upon the formation of neuron-like cells from Ascl1-overexpressing MG. We conclude that in the chick, but not mouse, the activity of EZH2 is required for the reprogramming of MG into MGPCs by regulating chromatin access to transcription factors associated with glial differentiation and retinal development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explicitly Nonlinear Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity In Resting-State fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Most dynamic functional connectivity in fMRI data is focused on linear correlations, and to our knowledge, no study has studied whole brain explicitly nonlinear dynamic relationships within the data. While some approaches have attempted to study overall connectivity more generally using flexible models, we are particularly interested in whether the non-linear relationships, above and beyond linear, are capturing unique information. This study thus proposes an approach to assess the explicitly nonlinear dynamic functional network 2 connectivity derived from the relationship among independent component analysis time courses. Linear relationships were removed at each time point to evaluate, typically ignored, explicitly nonlinear dFNC using normalized mutual information. Simulations showed the proposed method accurately estimated NMI over time, even within relatively short windows of data. Results on fMRI data included 151 schizophrenia patients, and 163 healthy controls showed three unique, highly structured, mostly long-range, functional states that also showed significant group differences. This analysis identifies a higher level of explicitly nonlinear dependencies in transient connectivity within the visual network in healthy controls compared to schizophrenia patients. In particular, nonlinear relationships tend to be more widespread than linear ones. We also find highly significant differences in the relative co-occurrence of linear and explicitly nonlinear states in HC and SZ, suggesting these may be an important aspect of the disorder. Overall, this work suggests that quantifying nonlinear dependencies of dynamic functional connectivity may provide a complementary and potentially valuable tool for studying brain function by exposing relevant variation that is typically ignored.

                Social decision-making requires the integration of reward valuation and social cognition systems, both dependent on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). How these two OFC functions interact is largely unknown. We recorded intracranial activity from the OFC of ten patients making choices in the context of different types of inequity (disadvantageous vs. advantageous). We found that high-frequency activity (70-150 HZ) encoded the amount of self-reward, consistent with previous reports. We also observed novel evidence for encoding in human OFC of the social counterpart's reward as well as the type of inequity being experienced. Additionally, we find social context modulates reward encoding: depending on inequity type, reward encoding was switched on and off rapidly within electrodes, across trials. These results provide direct evidence for explicit encoding of self- and other- rewards in the human OFC, and for rapid and reversible changes in encoding schemes driven by socially relevant contexts.

                Numerous tau immunotherapies are being developed against Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it has been challenging to specifically target early-stage tau aggregates using conformation-dependent antibodies. Here, we report a monoclonal antibody, APNmAb005, that recognized a conformational epitope associated with tau oligomers. In AD brain extracts, mAb005 preferentially recognized oligomeric tau in the synapse over monomeric tau in the cytosol. In the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, mAb005 immunoreactivity was strongly present in early-stage AD but surprisingly diminished in late-stage AD (Braak stage VI). mAb005 also recognized aggregates in 3R tauopathies (Pick's disease) and 4R tauopathies (corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy), including those in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In rTg4510 mice (P301L tau), mAb005 immunoreactivity first appeared in distal neurites but much later in neuronal somas. Thus, the mAb005 epitope appears to be associated with early-stage oligomers of tau (esoTau) that accumulate around synapses in AD, which is also detectable in both 3R and 4R tauopathies. In cellular uptake models of tauopathy transmission, mAb005 blocked the formation of intracellular inclusions induced by incubation with rTg4510 mouse brain extracts. Long-term treatments with mAb005 in rTg4510 mice partially rescued synaptic and neuronal loss in the hippocampus without promoting overall tau clearance. Our data suggest that immunotherapies targeting esoTau enriched around synaptic sites may alleviate tau toxicity against synapses and neurons, which may be a promising treatment strategy against AD.

                Sensory cortex amplifies relevant features of external stimuli. This sensitivity and selectivity arise through the transformation of inputs by cortical circuitry. We characterize the circuit mechanisms and dynamics of cortical amplification by making large-scale simultaneous measurements of single cells in awake primates and by testing computational models. By comparing network activity in both driven and spontaneous states with models, we identify the circuit as operating in a regime of balanced amplification. Incoming inputs are strongly but transiently amplified by recurrent excitation. Inhibition acts to counterbalance this excitation by rapidly quenching responses, thereby permitting tracking of time-varying stimuli.

                k-core percolation on the scale-free static brain connectivity revealed hierarchical structure of inter-voxel correlations, which was successfully visualized by hyperbolic disc embedding on resting-state fMRI. In static study, flagplots and brain rendered kmax-core display showed the changes of hierarchical structures of voxels belonging to functional independent components (IC). In this dynamic sliding-window study, temporal progress of hierarchical structure of voxels were investigated in individuals and in sessions of an individual. kmax-core and coreness k values characterizing time-varying core voxels were visualized on animated stacked-histogram/flagplots and animated brain-rendered images. Resting-state fMRI of Human Connectome Project and of Kirby weekly revealed the slow progress and multiple abrupt state transitions of the voxels of coreness k and at the uppermost hierarchy, representing their correlative time-varying mental states in individuals and in sessions. We suggest this characteristic core voxels-IC compositions on dynamic study fingerprint the time-varying resting states of human minds.

                The cerebrovasculature plays an essential role in neurovascular and homeostatic functions in health and disease conditions. Many efforts have been made for developing vascular thrombosis methods to study vascular dysfunction in vivo, while technical challenges remain, such as accuracy and depth-selectivity to target single vessel in the cerebral cortex. Herein, we first demonstrates the evaluation and quantification of the feasibility and effects of Rose Bengal (RB)-induced photothrombosis with 720-1070 nm ultrafast lasers in raster scan. A flexible and reproducible approach is then proposed to employ a 1070 nm ultrafast laser with spiral scan for producing RB-induced occlusion, which is described as precision ultrafast laser-induced photothrombosis (PLP). Combine with two-photon microscopy imaging, this PLP displays highly precise and fast occlusion induction of various vessel types, sizes, and depths, which enhances the precision and power of the photothrombosis protocol. Overall, the PLP method provides a real-time, practical, precise, and depth-selected single-vessel photothrombosis technology in cerebral cortex with commercially available optical equipment, which is crucial for exploring brain vascular function with high spatial temporal resolution in brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A potential marker for problematic mother-infant bonding revealed by magnetoencephalography study of first-time mothers listening to infant cries</a></h4>

              
                Studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) have identified the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to be an important early hub for a "parental instinct" in the brain. This complements the finding from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies linking reward, emotion regulation, empathy and mentalisation networks to the "parental brain". Here, we used MEG in 43 first-time mothers listening to infant and adult cry vocalisations to investigate the link with mother-infant postpartum bonding scores and their level of sleep deprivation (assessed using both actigraphy and sleep logs). We found significant differences 800-1000ms after onset of infant compared to adult cries in source-reconstructed brain activity in areas previously linked to the parental brain. Importantly, mothers with weaker bonding scores showed decreased brain responses to infant cries in the auditory cortex, middle and superior temporal gyrus, OFC, hippocampal areas, supramarginal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus at around 100-200ms after stimulus onset. In contrast, we did not find correlations with sleep deprivation scores. The significant changes in brain processing of infant distress signals could be a novel marker of weaker infant bonding in new mothers and should be investigated in vulnerable populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contributions of Bayesian and Discriminative Models to Active Visual Perception across Saccades</a></h4>

              
                The brain interprets sensory inputs to guide behavior, but behavior disrupts sensory inputs. In primates, saccadic eye movements displace visual images on the retina and yet the brain perceives visual stability, a process called active vision. We studied whether active vision is Bayesian. Humans and monkeys reported whether an image moved during saccades. We tested whether they used prior expectations to account for sensory uncertainty in a Bayesian manner. For continuous judgments, subjects were Bayesian. For categorical judgments, they were anti-Bayesian for uncertainty due to external, image noise but Bayesian for uncertainty due to internal, motor-driven noise. A discriminative learning model explained the anti-Bayesian effect. Therefore, active vision uses both Bayesian and discriminative models depending on task requirements (continuous vs. categorical) and the source of uncertainty (image noise vs. motor-driven noise), suggesting that active perceptual mechanisms are governed by the interaction of both models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scene-selective brain regions respond to embedded objects of a scene</a></h4>

              
                Objects are fundamental to scene understanding. Scenes are defined by embedded objects and how we interact with them. Paradoxically, scene processing in the brain is typically discussed in contrast to object processing. Using the BOLD5000 dataset (Chang et al., 2019), we examined whether objects within a scene predicted the neural representation of scenes, as measured by fMRI in humans. Stimuli included 1,179 unique scenes across 18 semantic categories. Object composition of scenes were compared across scene exemplars in different semantic categories, and separately, in exemplars of the same category. Neural representations in scene- and object- preferring brain regions were significantly related to which objects were in a scene, with the effect at times stronger in the scene-preferring regions. The object model accounted for more variance when comparing scenes within the same semantic category to scenes from different categories. Thus, the functional role of scene-preferring regions should include the processing of objects. This suggests visual processing regions may be better characterized with respect to which processes are engaged when interacting with the stimulus category, such as processing groups of objects in scenes, or processing a single object in our foreground, rather than the stimulus category itself.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scene-relative object motion biases depth percepts</a></h4>

              
                An important function of the visual system is to represent 3D scene structure from a sequence of 2D images projected onto the retinae. During observer translation, the relative image motion of stationary objects at different distances (motion parallax) provides potent depth information. However, if an object moves relative to the scene, this complicates the computation of depth from motion parallax since there will be an additional component of image motion related to scene-relative object motion. To correctly compute depth from motion parallax, only the component of image motion caused by self-motion should be used by the brain. Previous experimental and theoretical work on perception of depth from motion parallax has assumed that objects are stationary in the world. Thus, it is unknown whether perceived depth based on motion parallax is biased by object motion relative to the scene. Naive human subjects viewed a virtual 3D scene consisting of a ground plane and stationary background objects, while lateral self-motion was simulated by optic flow. A target object could be either stationary or moving laterally at different velocities, and subjects were asked to judge the depth of the object relative to the plane of fixation. Subjects showed a far bias when object and observer moved in the same direction, and a near bias when object and observer moved in opposite directions. This pattern of biases is expected if subjects confound image motion due to self-motion with that due to scene-relative object motion. These biases were large when the object was viewed monocularly, and were greatly reduced, but not eliminated, when binocular disparity cues were provided. Our findings establish that scene-relative object motion can confound perceptual judgements of depth during self-motion.

                Although touch and itch are coded by distinct neuronal populations, light touch also provokes itch in the presence of exogenous pruritogens, resulting in a phenomenon called alloknesis. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of pruritogen-induced mechanical itch sensitization are poorly understood. Here we show that intradermal injections of histamine or chloroquine (CQ) provoke alloknesis through activation of TRPV1- and MrgprA3-expressing prurioceptors, and functional ablation of these neurons reverses pruritogen-induced alloknesis. Moreover, genetic ablation of mechanosensitive Piezo2 channel function from MrgprA3-expressing prurioceptors also dampens pruritogen-induced alloknesis. Mechanistically, histamine and CQ sensitize Piezo2 channel function through activation of the PLC-PKC{delta} signaling. Collectively, our data uncovered a TRPV1+/MrgprA3+ prurioceptor-Piezo2 signaling axis in the initiation of pruritogen-induced mechanical itch sensitization in the skin.

                Demyelination, the loss of the insulating sheath of neurons, causes failed or slowed neuronal conduction and contributes to the neurological symptoms in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, stroke, and dementia. In demyelinated neurons, the axonal potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, normally under the myelin sheath, become exposed and upregulated. Imaging these channels using positron emission tomography can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Here, we describe the novel tracer for Kv1 channels [11C]3-methyl-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3Me4AP). [11C]3Me4AP was efficiently synthesized via Pd(0)-Cu(I) co-mediated Stille cross-coupling of a stannyl precursor containing a free amino group. Evaluation of its imaging properties in rats and nonhuman primates showed that [11C]3Me4AP has moderate brain permeability and slow kinetics. Additional evaluation in monkeys showed that the tracer is metabolically stable and that regional brain time-activity curves can be accurately modeled by a 1-tissue compartment model. Compared to the related tracers [18F]3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine ([18F]3F4AP) and [11C]3-methoxy-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3MeO4AP), [11C]3Me4AP shows lower initial brain uptake indicating reduced permeability to the blood-brain-barrier and slower kinetics suggesting higher binding affinity consistent with in vitro studies. While the slow kinetics and strong binding affinity are favorable attributes for its potential use as a therapeutic drug, our results suggest that [11C]3Me4AP is not as promising as its predecessors for PET imaging of the brain.

                Epilepsy, the condition of recurrent unprovoked seizures resulting from a wide variety of causes, is one of the worlds most prominent brain syndrome. Seizures which are an expression of neuronal network dysfunction occur in a positive feedback loop of concomitant factors where seizures generate more seizures, including also neuro-inflammatory responses. Among other pathways involved in inflammatory responses, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway has been proposed to prevent epilepsy. In this work we tested on a model of temporal lobe epilepsy in-vitro, the hypothesis that acute inhibition of STAT3-phosphorylation - during epileptogenesis, can prevent structural damages in the hippocampal circuits, and the imprinting both of neural epileptic activity and inflammatory glial states. We performed calcium imaging of spontaneous circuits dynamics in organotypic hippocampal slices previously exposed to hyper-excitable conditions through the blockage of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Epileptogenic conditions lead to imprinted epileptic dynamics in the circuits in terms of higher frequency of neuronal firing and circuits synchronizations, higher correlated activity in neuronal pairs and decreased complexity in synchronization patterns. Acute inhibition of the STAT3-phosphorylation during epileptogenesis, prevented the imprinting of epileptic activity patterns, general cell loss, GABAergic cells loss and the persistence of inflammatory reactive glial states. This work provides further evidence that inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway under epileptogenesis can prevent patho-topological reorganization of neuro-glial circuits.

                Augmented Reality (AR) overlays computer-generated visual, auditory or other sensory information on the real world. Due to recent advancements in AR it can be difficult for the user to differentiate between sensory information coming from real and virtual objects, leading to interesting phenomena. For example, an AR experience in which users can experience their own hands in flames has been shown to elicit heat illusions on the affected hands. In this study, we investigate the potential that AR has for top-down modulation of pain and thermal perception. We assessed thermal pain and detection thresholds on the participant's right hand when they experienced that hand covered in virtual flames in AR. We compared that experience to a baseline condition with no additional stimuli as well to a control condition that sees the hand covered by unrealistic blue flames to compensate the distraction factor. We found that experiencing a burning hand in AR induced analgesic and hyperalgesic effects as participants began to feel heat related pain on lower temperatures and cold related pain on higher temperatures. That experience also significantly changed the lowest temperature at which participants started perceiving warmth. These results demonstrate that pain and thermal perception can be manipulated by altering the perception of our body in AR.

                Unbiased genetic screens implicated a number of uncharacterized genes in hearing loss, suggesting some biological processes required for auditory function remain unexplored. Loss of Kiaa1024L/Minar2, a previously understudied gene, caused deafness in mice, but how it functioned in hearing was unclear. Here we show that disruption of kiaa1024L/minar2 causes hearing loss in the zebrafish. Defects in mechanotransduction, longer and thinner hair bundles, and enlarged apical lysosomes in hair cells are observed in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. In cultured cells, Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is mainly localized to lysosomes and its overexpression recruits cholesterol and increases cholesterol labeling. Strikingly, an accessible pool of cholesterol is highly enriched in the hair bundle membrane, and loss of kiaa1024L/minar2 reduces cholesterol localization to the hair bundles. Decreasing cholesterol levels aggravates, while increasing cholesterol levels rescues hair cell defects in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. Therefore cholesterol plays an essential role in the hair bundles, and Kiaa1024L/Minar2 regulates cholesterol distribution and homeostasis to ensure normal hearing.

                Severe stress exposure is a global problem with long-lasting negative behavioral and physiological consequences, which increases the risk of stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). An essential characteristic of MDD is the impairment of social functioning and lack of social motivation. Chronic social defeat stress is an established animal model for MDD research, which induces a cascade of physiological and social behavioral changes. The current developments of markerless pose estimation tools allow for more complex and socially relevant behavioral tests, but the application of these tools to social behavior remains to be explored. Here, we introduce the open-source tool DeepOF to investigate the individual and social behavioral profile in mice by providing supervised and unsupervised pipelines using DeepLabCut-annotated pose estimation data. The supervised pipeline relies on pre-trained classifiers to detect defined traits for both single and dyadic animal behaviors. Subsequently, the unsupervised pipeline explores the behavioral repertoire of the animals without label priming, which has the potential of pointing towards previously unrecognized motion motifs that are systematically different across conditions. We here provide evidence that the DeepOF supervised and unsupervised pipelines detect a distinct stress-induced social behavioral pattern, which was particularly observed at the beginning of a novel social encounter. The stress-induced social behavior shows a state of arousal that fades with time due to habituation. In addition, while the classical social avoidance task does identify the stress-induced social behavioral differences, both DeepOF behavioral pipelines provide a clearer and more detailed profile. DeepOF aims to facilitate reproducibility and unification of behavioral classification of social behavior by providing an open-source tool, which can significantly advance the study of rodent individual and social behavior, thereby enabling novel biological insights and subsequent drug development for psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Binge alcohol drinking alters the differential control of cholinergic interneurons over nucleus accumbens D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ventral striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) play a central role in basal ganglia function by regulating associative learning and reward processing. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ChIs regulate glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission. However, it is unclear how ChIs orchestrate the control of these neurotransmitters to determine the excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. Additionally, the effects of binge alcohol drinking on ChIs-mediated modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in NAc MSNs are also undefined. Methods: We optogenetically stimulated ChIs while recording evoked and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in D1- and D2-MSN of ChAT.ChR2.eYFPxDrd1.tdtomato mice. To determine the effect of ChIs on mouse behavior and alcohol consumption, we implanted ChAT.ChR2.eYFP mice with fiber optic cannulas and stimulated ChIs while mice were allowed to drink 20% alcohol using the binge alcohol drinking-in-the-dark (DID) paradigm. Results: We demonstrated that NAc ChIs decrease the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in both D1- and D2-MSNs. While inhibition of D1-MSNs glutamate release by ChIs depends on dopamine release, that of D2-MSNs results from a direct interactions between ChIs and glutamatergic terminals. Interestingly, after two weeks of binge alcohol drinking, the effect of ChIs stimulation on glutamate release was reversed in D1-MSNs, while its effect on D2-MSNs remained unchanged. Finally, in vivo optogenetic stimulation of NAc ChIs significantly increased alcohol consumption. Conclusions: These results identify ChIs as a key target for the regulation of NAc circuitry and as a potential treatment of alcohol addiction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Postsynaptic GluA3 subunits are required for the appropriate assembly of AMPA receptor GluA2 and GluA4 subunits on mammalian cochlear afferent synapses and for presynaptic ribbon modiolar-pillar morphological distinctions</a></h4>

              
                The encoding of acoustic signals in the cochlea depends on -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs), but relatively little is known about their reliance on specific pore-forming subunits. With 5-week-old male GluA3KO mice, we determined cochlear function, synapse ultrastructure, and AMPAR subunit molecular anatomy at ribbon synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). GluA3KO and wild-type (GluA3WT) mice reared in ambient sound pressure level (SPL) of 55-75 dB had similar ABR thresholds, wave-1 amplitudes, and latencies. Ultrastructurally, the IHC modiolar-pillar differences in presynaptic ribbon size and shape, and synaptic vesicle size seen in GluA3WT were diminished or reversed in GluA3KO. The quantity of paired synapses (presynaptic ribbons juxtaposed with postsynaptic GluA2 and GluA4) was similar, however, GluA2-lacking synapses (ribbons paired with GluA4 but not GluA2) were observed only in GluA3KO. SGNs of GluA3KO mice had AMPAR arrays of smaller overall volume, containing less GluA2 and greater GluA4 immunofluorescence intensity relative to GluA3WT (3-fold difference in mean GluA4:GluA2 ratio). The expected modiolar-pillar gradient in ribbon volume was observed in IHCs of GluA3WT but not GluA3KO. Unexpected modiolar-pillar gradients in GluA2 and GluA4 volume were present in GluA3KO. GluA3 is essential to the morphology and molecular composition of IHC-ribbon synapses. We propose the hearing loss seen in older male GluA3KO mice results from progressive synaptopathy evident in 5-week-old mice as increased abundance of GluA2-lacking, GluA4 monomeric, Ca2+- permeable AMPARs.

                Representation of the context in which events occur is essential for episodic memory. Yet context is also important for other cognitive processes including, for example, making decisions, sequencing behavior, and associative learning. The rodent postrhinal cortex and its primate homolog, the parahippocampal cortex, are thought to preferentially process visuospatial information in order to represent the spatial features of contexts and scenes. An open question, however, is whether the postrhinal cortex is also involved in representing non-spatial contexts. Here, we used electrophysiology in behaving rats to show that postrhinal contextual representations extend to the non-spatial domain. Based on the pattern of results, we suggest that postrhinal representations of context, whether spatial or nonspatial, behave like occasion setters by modulating the meaning of other items in the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pop-in: the inversion of pop-out for a feature dimension during visual search in area V4 of the monkey cortex</a></h4>

              
                During visual search, it is important to reduce the interference of distracting objects in the scene. The neuronal responses elicited by the search target stimulus are typically enhanced. However, it is equally important to suppress the representations of distracting stimuli, especially if they are salient and capture attention. We trained monkeys to make an eye movement to a unique 'pop-out' shape stimulus among an array of distracting stimuli. One of these distractors had a salient color that varied across trials and differed from the color of the other stimuli, causing it to also pop-out. The monkeys were able to select the pop-out shape target with high accuracy and actively avoided the pop-out color distractor. This behavioral pattern was reflected in the activity of neurons in area V4. Responses to the shape targets were enhanced, while the activity evoked by the pop-out color distractor was only briefly enhanced, directly followed by a sustained period of pronounced suppression. These behavioral and neuronal results demonstrate a cortical selection mechanism that rapidly inverts a pop-out signal to 'pop-in' for an entire feature dimension thereby facilitating goal-directed visual search in the presence of salient distractors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Penetratin inhibits α-synuclein fibrillation and improves locomotor functions in mice model of Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The presence of lewy bodies, primarily consisting of -synuclein (-syn) aggregates is one of the common features seen in the substantia nigra region of the brain in PD patients. The disease remains incurable and only symptomatic relief is available. We screened various cell-penetrating peptides and reveal that penetratin is a potent inhibitor of -syn aggregation in-vitro, and significantly improved locomotor coordination in mice models of PD in-vivo. The peptide inhibits -syn aggregation in vitro as well as in yeast, and C.elegans models. We further made a cyclic derivative of penetratin by disulfide coupling of N- and C-terminal cysteine residues. Both penetratin and its cyclized derivative interact with -syn. NMR studies show that both linear as well as cyclic derivative interact at the acidic C-terminal tail of the protein. Similar to penetratin, its cyclic derivative inhibited -syn aggregation in the C.elegans model of Parkinsons disease, and also improved worm motility. Molecular Dynamics studies show that penetratin interacts with -synuclein and prevents its conformational transition from disordered into {beta}-sheet rich structure. The therapeutic efficacy of penetratin was further confirmed in a transgenic mice model of the disease, wherein penetratin treatment over a period of 90 days improved locomotor coordination, and halted disease progression. Overall, the present work provides a potent therapeutic agent that could be further explored in the management of PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precise overlapping neural representations between feeling and seeing touch in people with high tactile empathy</a></h4>

              
                Empathy allows us to understand and sometimes vicariously experience what someone else is feeling1,2. For some people this extends to tactile sensations, with reports of feeling touch when seeing others being touched3,4. Major theories claim that tactile empathy relies on overlapping neural representations between feeling and seeing touch5-8. Here we test this using time-resolved decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data collected while participants felt touch to the fingers or watched videos of touch to another person's fingers. A classifier trained and tested on brain activation patterns during tactile trials could distinguish touch to the thumb versus little finger, demonstrating remarkable sensitivity to small neural differences. In people with high tactile empathy, who report feeling touch when watching videos of touch, these tactile classifiers cross-generalised to visual trials. These data show that representations of feeling and seeing touch overlap, including fine-grained information about touch location on the hand. The timing suggests that early visual predictions of touch location involve later (high-level) tactile representations. Our results demonstrate that EEG decoding can extract precise neural signatures for location of touch and suggest that shared neural representations underpin tactile empathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Opioid suppression of an excitatory pontomedullary respiratory circuit by convergent mechanisms.</a></h4>

              
                Opioids depress breathing by inhibition of inter-connected respiratory nuclei in the pons and medulla. Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists directly hyperpolarize a population of neurons in the dorsolateral pons, particularly the Kolliker-Fuse (KF) nucleus, that are key mediators of opioid-induced respiratory depression. However, the projection target and synaptic connections of MOR-expressing KF neurons is unknown. Here, we used retrograde labeling and brain slice electrophysiology to determine that MOR-expressing KF neurons project to respiratory nuclei in the ventrolateral medulla, including the pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC) and rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG). These medullary projecting, MOR-expressing dorsolateral pontine neurons express FoxP2 and are distinct from calcitonin gene-related peptide-expressing lateral parabrachial neurons. Furthermore, dorsolateral pontine neurons release glutamate onto excitatory preBotC and rVRG neurons via monosynaptic projections, which is inhibited by presynaptic opioid receptors. The excitatory preBotC and rVRG neurons receiving MOR-sensitive glutamatergic synaptic input from the dorsolateral pons are themselves hyperpolarized by opioids. Thus, opioids can synergistically inhibit this excitatory pontomedullary respiratory circuit by three distinct mechanisms--somatodendritic MORs on dorsolateral pontine and ventrolateral medullary neurons and presynaptic MORs on dorsolateral pontine neuron terminals in the ventrolateral medulla--all of which could contribute to opioid-induced respiratory depression.

	<p>Maternal and passionate love are both crucial for reproduction and involve attachment behaviors with high rewards. Neurobiological studies of attachment in animal and human neuroimaging studies have suggested that the coordination of oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic pathways, coupled with the dopaminergic reward system, contribute to the formation and maintenance of maternal and passionate love. In the present study, we carried out a quantitative meta-analysis of human neuroimaging to identify common and dissociable neural substrates associated with maternal and passionate love, using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. The ALE results showed significant activation of the brain regions in the left ventral tegmental area (VTA), right thalamus, left substantia nigra, and the left putamen for maternal love, but in the bilateral VTA for passionate love. The meta-analytic neuroimaging evidence suggests the greater involvement of cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;affective regulation in maternal attachment and the greater desire to combine liking and wanting in romantic love behaviors. The conjunction analysis highlights the functional convergence of the VTA across the two types of human love, indicating a shared neurobiological mechanism of maternal and passionate love with evolutionary roots. Our findings suggest that the processing of both maternal and passionate love involve the affective and motivational regulation associated with dopaminergic systems; our neuroimaging evidence supports the notion that maternal and passionate love share a common evolutionary origin and neurobiological basis in the human brain.</p>

	<p>Tic disorders (TDs) are a series of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by involuntary motor and/or vocal tics and commonly comorbid with several other psychopathological and/or behavioral disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder), which indeed aggravate clinical symptoms and complicate diagnosis and treatment. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) derived from small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have been recognized as novel circulating biomarkers of disease. To identify specific miRNAs derived from plasma sEVs for TDs&amp;amp;rsquo; diagnosis and prognosis, we used official EV isolation and purification methods to characterize the plasma-derived EV miRNAs from children with different types of TDs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and immunoblot analysis of EV surface markers were applied to confirm the features and quality of sEVs. The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach was adapted to identify novel circulating sEVs-derived miRNAs with altered expression levels in paired comparisons of TDs versus healthy controls (HCs), transient tic disorder (TTD) versus chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD), and TTD versus Tourette Syndrome (TS). GO term and KEGG pathway were performed for functional analysis and the receiver operator curve analysis was followed to test the diagnosis efficacy of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) derived from plasma sEVs among paired groups, namely, TDs versus HCs, TTD versus CTD, and TTD versus TS. As a result, 10 miRNAs (hsa-let-7a, hsa-let-7b, hsa-let-7c, hsa-let-7e, hsa-let-7f, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-125b-5p, and hsa-miR-1469) have demonstrated a significantly different expression signature in the TDs group compared to HCs with excellent area under curve (AUC) values of 0.99, 0.973, 0.997, 1, 0.99, 0.997, 0.987, 0.993, 0.977, and 0.997, respectively, and the diagnostic efficacy of miRNAs was also estimated for discriminating TTD from CTD or TS. In our research, we finally obtained several potential sEVs-derived miRNA biomarkers to assess the diagnosis and prognosis of TDs.</p>

	<p>Op art was created, in part, to produce illusions of movement. Given that dyslexics have been shown to have impaired visuo-postural axis deficits, it may be possible that dyslexics see illusions different than their non-dyslexic peers. To test this theory, we measured eye movement and posture in 47 dyslexic (18 female, 29 male; mean age 15.4) and 44 non dyslexic (22 female, 22 male; mean age 14.8) adolescents while they viewed three works of art by Op artist Bridget Riley. They then responded to a questionnaire about how they felt while viewing the artworks. Dyslexics demonstrated significantly slower saccades in terms of average velocity that was particularly disturbed in paintings that manipulated depth. Subjectively, dyslexics felt much more destabilized compared to their peers; however, there was not a significant difference in objective postural measurements between the two groups. The sensation of destabilization was positively correlated with appreciation in non-dyslexic adolescents. These subjective results suggest that dyslexics may be more sensitive to movement in depth, which could be related to the instability in vergence movements. Whereas this instability represents a hinderance in relation to reading, it could be an advantage while viewing paintings such as these.</p>

	<p>Depression is a common but easily misdiagnosed disease when using a self-assessment scale. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) provide an important reference and objective basis for the identification and diagnosis of depression. In order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of depression by using mainstream algorithms, a high-performance hybrid neural network depression detection method is proposed in this paper combined with deep learning technology. Firstly, a concatenating one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are employed to extract the local features and to determine the global features of the EEG signal. Secondly, the attention mechanism is introduced to form the hybrid neural network. The attention mechanism assigns different weights to the multi-dimensional features extracted by the network, so as to screen out more representative features, which can reduce the computational complexity of the network and save the training time of the model while ensuring high precision. Moreover, dropout is applied to accelerate network training and address the over-fitting problem. Experiments reveal that the 1D-CNN-GRU-ATTN model has more effectiveness and a better generalization ability compared with traditional algorithms. The accuracy of the proposed method in this paper reaches 99.33% in a public dataset and 97.98% in a private dataset, respectively.</p>

	<p>Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology has been shown to provide new communication possibilities, conveying brain information externally. BCI-based robot control has started to play an important role, especially in medically assistive robots but not only there. For example, a BCI-controlled robotic arm can provide patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases such as Locked-in syndrome (LIS), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and others with the ability to manipulate different objects. This study presents the optimization of the configuration parameters of a three-class Motor Imagery (MI) -based BCI for controlling a six Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm in a plane. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are recorded from 64 positions on the scalp according to the International 10-10 System. In terms of the resulting classification of error rates, we investigated twelve time windows for the spatial filter and classifier calculation and three time windows for the variance smoothing time. The lowest error rates were achieved when using a 3 s time window for creating the spatial filters and classifier, for a variance time window of 1.5 s.</p>

	<p>Many people who received amputation wear sEMG prostheses to assist in their daily lives. How these prostheses promote muscle growth and change neural activity remains elusive. We recruited a subject who had his left hand amputated for over 53 years to participate in a six-week rehabilitation training using an sEMG prosthesis. We tracked the muscle growth of his left forearm and changes in neural activity over six weeks. The subject showed an increase in fast muscle fiber in his left forearm during the training period. In an analysis of complex networks of neural activity, we observed that the &amp;amp;alpha;-band network decreased in efficiency but increased in its capability to integrate information. This could be due to an expansion of the network to accommodate new movements enabled by rehabilitation training. Differently, we found that in the &amp;amp;beta;-band network, a band frequency related to motor functions, the efficiency of the network initially decreased but started to increase after approximately three weeks. The ability to integrate network information showed an opposite trend compared with its efficiency. rMT values, a measure that negatively correlates with cortical excitability, showed a sharp decrease in the first three weeks, suggesting an increase in cortical excitability. In the last three weeks, there was little to no change. These data indicate that rehabilitation training promoted fast muscle fiber growth and introduced neural activity changes in the subject during the first three weeks of training. Our study gave insights into how rehabilitation training with an sEMG prosthesis could lead to physiological and neural changes in amputees.</p>

	<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopment disorder that affects millions of children and typically persists into adulthood. It must be diagnosed efficiently and consistently to receive adequate treatment, otherwise, it can have a detrimental impact on the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s professional performance, mental health, and relationships. In this work, motor activity data of adults suffering from ADHD and clinical controls has been preprocessed to obtain 788 activity-related statistical features. Afterwards, principal component analysis has been carried out to obtain significant features for accurate classification. These features are then fed into six different machine learning algorithms for classification, which include C4.5, kNN, Random Forest, LogitBoost, SVM, and Naive Bayes. The detailed evaluation of the results through 10-fold cross-validation reveals that SVM outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 98.43%, F-measure of 98.42%, sensitivity of 98.33%, specificity of 98.56% and AUC of 0.983. Thus, a PCA-based SVM approach appears to be an effective choice for accurate identification of ADHD patients among other clinical controls using real-time analysis of activity data.</p>

                Pathogenic a-synuclein and tau are critical drivers of neurodegeneration and their mutations cause neuronal loss in patients. Whether the underlying preferential neuronal vulnerability is a cell-type intrinsic property or a consequence of increased expression levels is an open question. Here, we explore cell-type specific a-synuclein and tau expression in human brain datasets and use deep phenotyping as well as brain-wide single-cell RNA sequencing of >200 live neuron types in fruit flies to ask which cellular environments react most to a-synuclein or tau toxicity. We detect phenotypic and transcriptomic evidence of differential neuronal vulnerability independent of a-synuclein or tau expression levels. Comparing vulnerable with resilient neurons enabled us to identify molecular signatures associated with these differential responses. We used these to verify, and then predict resilient and vulnerable neuron subtypes in human brains. This confirms substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to be sensitive to a-synuclein, and we predict pathogenic tau vulnerable and protected cortical neuron subtypes. Our work indicates that cellular determinants confer selective vulnerability to specific types of amyloid toxicity, thus paving the way to leverage neuronal identity to uncover modifiers of neurodegeneration-associated toxic proteins.

                The medial preoptic area (mPOA) undergoes through neuroanatomical changes across the postpartum period, during which its neurons play a critical role in the regulation of maternal behavior. In addition, this area is also crucial for sleep-wake regulation. We have previously shown that hypocretins (HCRT) within the mPOA facilitate active maternal behaviors in postpartum rats, while the blockade of endogenous HCRT in this area promotes nursing and sleep. To explore the mechanisms behind these HCRT actions, we aimed to evaluate the effects of juxta-cellular HCRT-1 administration on mPOA neurons in urethane-anesthetized postpartum and virgin female rats. We recorded mPOA single units and the electroencephalogram (EEG) and applied HCRT-1 juxta-cellular by pressure pulses. Our main results show that the electrophysiological characteristics of the mPOA neurons and their relationship with the EEG of postpartum rats did not differ from virgin rats. Additionally, neurons that respond to HCRT-1 had a slower firing rate than those that did not. In addition, administration of HCRT increased the activity in one group of neurons while decreasing it in another, both in postpartum and virgin rats. The mechanisms by which HCRT modulate functions controlled by the mPOA involve different cell populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gender and comorbidity moderate the relationship between mood disorder symptoms and effortful avoidance performance</a></h4>

              
                We must often decide how much effort to exert or withhold to avoid undesirable outcomes or obtain rewards. In depression and anxiety, levels of avoidance tend to be excessive and reward-seeking is reduced. Yet outstanding questions remain about the links between motivated action/inhibition and anxiety and depression symptoms, and whether they differ between men and women. Here we examined the relationship between anxiety and depression symptoms and performance on effortful active and inhibitory avoidance (Study 1) and reward seeking (Study 2) in humans. Undergraduates and paid online workers (NAvoid = 545, NReward = 310; NFemale = 368, NMale = 450, MAge = 22.58, RangeAge = 17-62) were assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and performed an instructed online avoidance or reward-seeking task. Participants had to make multiple presses on active trials and withhold presses on inhibitory trials to avoid an unpleasant sound (Study 1) or obtain points towards a monetary reward (Study 2). Overall, men deployed more effort than women in both avoidance and reward-seeking, and anxiety symptoms were negatively associated with active reward-seeking accuracy. Gender moderated the relationship between anxiety symptoms and inhibitory avoidance, such that women with higher anxiety showed reduced inhibitory avoidance accuracy. Anxiety symptoms predicted poorer active avoidance performance for those high in depression symptoms only. Our results illuminate effects of gender and symptom comorbidity in the relationship between mood disorder symptoms and the motivation to actively and effortfully respond to obtain positive and avoid negative outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tilt Aftereffect Spreads Across the Visual Field</a></h4>

              
                The tilt aftereffect (TAE) is observed when adaptation to a tilted contour alters the perceived tilt of a subsequently presented contour. Thus far, the TAE has been treated as a local aftereffect observed only at the location of the adapter. Whether and how TAE spreads to other locations in the visual field has not been systematically studied. Here we sought an answer to this question by measuring TAE magnitudes at locations including but not limited to the adapter location. The adapter was a tilted grating presented at the same peripheral location throughout an experimental session. In a single trial, participants indicated the perceived tilt of a test grating presented after the adapter at one of fifteen locations in the same hemifield as the adapter. We found non-zero TAE magnitudes in all locations tested, showing that the effect spreads across the tested visual hemifield. Next, to establish a link between neuronal activity and the behavioral results, and to predict possible origins of the spread, we built a model based on known characteristics of neuronal responses in the visual cortex. Simulation results showed that the model can successfully capture the pattern of the behavioral results. Furthermore, the pattern of the optimized receptive field sizes suggests that mid-level visual areas, for example V4, could be critically involved in TAE and its spread across the visual field.

                Olfactory coding, from insects to humans, is canonically considered to involve considerable across-fiber coding already at the peripheral level, thereby allowing recognition of very large numbers of odor compounds. Here we show that the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, has evolved an alternative strategy built on highly specific odorant receptors feeding into a complex primary processing center in the brain. By collecting odors from food and different life stages of the locust, we identified 208 ecologically relevant odorants, which we used to deorphanize 48 locust olfactory receptors via ectopic expression in Drosophila. Contrary to the often broadly tuned olfactory receptors of other insects, almost all locust receptors were found to be narrowly tuned to one ligand and most of these best ligands exclusively excited only one receptor. Knocking out a single receptor using CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in an abolished physiological and behavioral response to the corresponding ligand. We conclude that the locust olfactory system, with an apparent lack of redundancy among most olfactory receptors, differs from so-far described olfactory systems.

                The ability to flexibly adjust beliefs about other people is crucial for human social functioning. Dopamine has been proposed to regulate the precision of beliefs, but direct behavioural evidence of this is lacking. We investigated how a relatively high dose of the selective D2/D3 dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride impacts learning about other people's prosocial attitudes in a repeated trust game. Using a Bayesian model of belief updating, we show that sulpiride increased the volatility of beliefs, which led to higher precision-weights on prediction errors. This effect was entirely driven by participants with genetically conferring higher dopamine availability (Taq1a polymorphism). Higher precision weights were reflected in higher reciprocal behaviour in the repeated trust game but not in single-round trust games. This finding suggests that antipsychotic medication might acutely reduce rigidity of pathological beliefs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter and literacy: a dynamic system in flux</a></h4>

              
                Past studies have linked differences in white matter tissue properties to reading skills. However, these studies have reported a range of, sometimes conflicting, results. Some studies suggest that white matter properties act as individual-level traits predictive of reading skill, whereas others suggest that reading skill and white matter develop as a function of an individual's educational context. In the present study, we tested two hypotheses: a) that diffusion properties of the white matter reflect stable brain characteristics that relate to reading skills over development or b) that white matter plays a part in a dynamic system, linked with learning over time. To answer these questions, we examined the relationship between white matter and reading in a series of large-scale, single-observation datasets and a four-year longitudinal dataset. We find that gains in reading skill correspond to longitudinal changes in the white matter. However, in the single-observation datasets, we find no evidence for the hypothesis that individual differences in white matter predict reading skill. These findings highlight the link between dynamic processes in the white matter and learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combining Backpropagation with Equilibrium Propagation to improve an Actor-Critic RL framework</a></h4>

              
                Backpropagation has been used to train neural networks for many years, allowing them to solve a wide variety of tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning tasks. But the biological plausibility of backpropagation as a mechanism of neural learning has been questioned. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) has been proposed as a more biologically plausible alternative and achieves comparable accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image classification task. This study proposes the first EP-based reinforcement learning architecture: an actor-critic architecture with the actor network trained by EP. We show that this model can solve the basic control tasks often used as benchmarks for BP-based models. Interestingly, our trained model demonstrates more consistent high-reward behavior than a comparable model trained exclusively by backpropagation.

	<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep bruxism (SB) may appear concomitantly. Data on the relationship between OSA and SB are limited. It was shown that in a population with an increased risk of OSA, OSA was dependently correlated with SB on the degree of OSA severity only in mild and moderate cases of OSA. We aimed to confirm this relationship and affecting factors in a group of dental office patients in a prospective, observational study. Adult patients (n = 119) were evaluated using respiratory polygraphy. The risk of OSA was assessed using a STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ). The episodes of bruxism and respiratory events were scored according to the standards of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The prevalence of OSA and SB was found to be 63.02% and 41.17%, respectively. The bruxism episode index (BEI) was increased in the group with a higher risk of OSA (SBQ &amp;amp;ge; 3) compared to the group with a lower risk of OSA (3.49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.63 vs. 2.27 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.50, p = 0.03). The sensitivity and specificity of the SBQ were not sufficient to predict SB. A positive linear correlation between AHI and BEI in the group with AHI &amp;amp;lt; 23/h was found. The study confirmed that OSA was associated with SB in the group of patients with OSA and/or SB risk. The relationship between OSA and SB depended on the degree of severity of OSA and occurred in mild and moderate cases of OSA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">14-3-3{theta} Does Not Protect against Behavioral or Pathological Deficits in Alzheimers Disease Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment associated with synaptic dysfunction and dendritic spine loss and the pathologic hallmarks of &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles. 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family of proteins whose functions include regulation of protein folding, neuronal architecture, and synaptic function. Additionally, 14-3-3s interact with both A&beta; and tau, and reduced levels of 14-3-3s have been shown in the brains of AD patients and in AD mouse models. Here, we examine the neuroprotective potential of the 14-3-3 isoform in AD models. We demonstrate that 14-3-3 overexpression is protective and 14-3-3 inhibition is detrimental against oligomeric A&beta;-induced neuronal death in primary cortical cultures. Overexpression of 14-3-3 using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector failed to improve performance on behavioral tests, improve A&beta; pathology, or affect synaptic density in the J20 AD mouse model. Similarly, crossing a second AD mouse model, the <I>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></I> knock-in (APP KI) mouse, with 14-3-3 transgenic mice failed to rescue behavioral deficits, reduce A&beta; pathology, or impact synaptic density in the APP KI mouse model. 14-3-3 is likely partially insolubilized in the APP models, as demonstrated by proteinase K digestion. These findings do not support increasing 14-3-3 expression as a therapeutic approach for AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS and its prevention among Ghanaian women [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: HIV/AIDS is still a major public health issue around the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where this has resulted in unquantifiable human suffering, social and cultural disruption, and enormous economic losses. Methods: This study aims to assess women’s knowledge and attitude toward HIV/AIDS and its prevention in Ghana. To perform an analytic cross-sectional study, this study used data (the women in reproductive age 15-49 years dataset) from the Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2017/18. Bivariate analysis was done using chi-square and predictor variables were identified using binary logistics regression. Results: This study recorded good HIV knowledge and attitude levels of 81.9% and 10.5%. Factors that predicted only good HIV knowledge levels were ethnicity, and disability status. Also, predictors of only good attitude level were type of residence and marital status. Factors implicated in the prediction of both good knowledge and attitude levels were age, educational status, region of orientation, health insurance status, economic status, and media exposure. Conclusions: This study recorded a good HIV knowledge level among the majority of the women, but recorded most respondents having a poor attitude toward HIV.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of non-pharmacologic strategies on prevention or management of intensive care unit delirium: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Post-operative delirium is a common complication among adult patients in the intensive care unit. Current literature does not support the use of pharmacologic measures to manage this condition, and several studies explore the potential for the use of non-pharmacologic methods such as early mobility plans or environmental modifications. The aim of this systematic review is to examine and report on recently available literature evaluating the relationship between non-pharmacologic management strategies and the reduction of delirium in the intensive care unit. Methods: Six major research databases were systematically searched for articles analyzing the efficacy of non-pharmacologic delirium interventions in the past five years. Search results were restricted to adult human patients aged 18 years or older in the intensive care unit setting, excluding terminally ill subjects and withdrawal-related delirium. Following title, abstract, and full text review, 27 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Results: The 27 reviewed articles consist of 12 interventions with a single-component investigational approach, and 15 with multi-component bundled protocols. Delirium incidence was the most commonly assessed outcome followed by duration. Family visitation was the most effective individual intervention while mobility interventions were the least effective. Two of the three family studies significantly reduced delirium incidence, while one in five mobility studies did the same. Multi-component bundle approaches were the most effective of all; of the reviewed studies, eight of 11 bundles significantly improved delirium incidence and seven of eight bundles decreased the duration of delirium. Conclusions: Multi-component, bundled interventions were more effective at managing intensive care unit delirium than those utilizing an approach with a single interventional element. Although better management of this condition suggests a decrease in resource burden and improvement in patient outcomes, comparative research should be performed to identify the importance of specific bundle elements.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The level of community behaviour towards hearing loss in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hearing loss is the most common disability in the world, with a prevalence of 5% of the world's population of 466 million people. Knowledge about noise exposure and hearing protection equipment is related to hearing loss. Health is associated with a person's healthy lifestyle behaviour. This study aimed to determine the level of community behaviour towards hearing loss. Methods: This study used a descriptive analytical approach with a cross-sectional study design. The population in this study was Indonesian people who were not healthcare workers aged 17 years and over. The sample inclusion criteria included individuals who were not healthcare workers (such as doctors, nurses and midwives etc.), aged 17 years and over, and willing to participate in the study. The sampling method in this study was consecutive sampling. Results: Based on the distribution of patients, there were more female participants (1484, 61.6%) than male participants. Diploma-3 (D3) was the most common education type, with as many as 1095 people (45.4%), while the least common education type was not in school (eight, 0.3%). Most participants were in the ‘employee’ profession, namely 509 people (21.1%), while the lowest number of participants was in the Police profession (20, 0.8%). There were significant relationships between the respondent's knowledge and action about hearing loss, and the respondent’s knowledge and attitudes regarding hearing loss (p=0.000). Conclusions: There were significant relationships between the respondent's knowledge and actions about hearing loss and the respondent's knowledge and attitude, while there was no significant relationship between the respondent's attitude and actions regarding hearing loss.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MaxHiC: A robust background correction model to identify biologically relevant chromatin interactions in Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Rassa Ghavami Modegh, Hamid R. Rabiee, Ehsan Ramezani Sarbandi, Narges Rezaie, Kin Tung Tam, Alistair R. R. Forrest</p>

Hi-C is a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture technology that detects interactions between pairs of genomic regions and exploits higher order chromatin structures. Conceptually Hi-C data counts interaction frequencies between every position in the genome and every other position. Biologically functional interactions are expected to occur more frequently than transient background and artefactual interactions. To identify biologically relevant interactions, several background models that take biases such as distance, GC content and mappability into account have been proposed. Here we introduce MaxHiC, a background correction tool that deals with these complex biases and robustly identifies statistically significant interactions in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments. MaxHiC uses a negative binomial distribution model and a maximum likelihood technique to correct biases in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries. We systematically benchmark MaxHiC against major Hi-C background correction tools including Hi-C significant interaction callers (SIC) and Hi-C loop callers using published Hi-C, capture Hi-C, and Micro-C datasets. Our results demonstrate that 1) Interacting regions identified by MaxHiC have significantly greater levels of overlap with known regulatory features (e.g. active chromatin histone marks, CTCF binding sites, DNase sensitivity) and also disease-associated genome-wide association SNPs than those identified by currently existing models, 2) the pairs of interacting regions are more likely to be linked by eQTL pairs and 3) more likely to link known regulatory features including known functional enhancer-promoter pairs validated by CRISPRi than any of the existing methods. We also demonstrate that interactions between different genomic region types have distinct distance distributions only revealed by MaxHiC. MaxHiC is publicly available as a python package for the analysis of Hi-C, capture Hi-C and Micro-C data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evidence for influenza and RSV interaction from 10 years of enhanced surveillance in Nha Trang, Vietnam, a modelling study</a></h4>

Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) interact within their host posing the concern for impacts on heterologous viruses following vaccination. We aimed to estimate the population level impact of their interaction. We developed a dynamic age-stratified two-pathogen mathematical model that includes pathogen interaction through competition for infection and enhanced severity of dual infections. We used parallel tempering to fit its parameters to 11 years of enhanced hospital-based surveillance for acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in children under 5 years old in Nha Trang, Vietnam. The data supported either a 41% (95%CrI: 36–54) reduction in susceptibility following infection and for 10.0 days (95%CrI 7.1–12.8) thereafter, or no change in susceptibility following infection. We estimate that co-infection increased the probability for an infection in <2y old children to be reported 7.2 fold (95%CrI 5.0–11.4); or 16.6 fold (95%CrI 14.5–18.4) in the moderate or low interaction scenarios. Absence of either pathogen was not to the detriment of the other. We find stronger evidence for severity enhancing than for acquisition limiting interaction. In this setting vaccination against either pathogen is unlikely to have a major detrimental effect on the burden of disease caused by the other.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A pipeline for the reconstruction and evaluation of context-specific human metabolic models at a large-scale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vítor Vieira, Jorge Ferreira, Miguel Rocha</p>

Constraint-based (CB) metabolic models provide a mathematical framework and scaffold for <i>in silico</i> cell metabolism analysis and manipulation. In the past decade, significant efforts have been done to model human metabolism, enabled by the increased availability of multi-omics datasets and curated genome-scale reconstructions, as well as the development of several algorithms for context-specific model (CSM) reconstruction. Although CSM reconstruction has revealed insights on the deregulated metabolism of several pathologies, the process of reconstructing representative models of human tissues still lacks benchmarks and appropriate integrated software frameworks, since many tools required for this process are still disperse across various software platforms, some of which are proprietary. In this work, we address this challenge by assembling a scalable CSM reconstruction pipeline capable of integrating transcriptomics data in CB models. We combined omics preprocessing methods inspired by previous efforts with in-house implementations of existing CSM algorithms and new model refinement and validation routines, all implemented in the <i>Troppo</i> Python-based open-source framework. The pipeline was validated with multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), also including reference fluxomics measurements for the MCF7 cell line. We reconstructed over 6000 models based on the Human-GEM template model for 733 cell lines featured in the CCLE, using MCF7 models as reference to find the best parameter combinations. These reference models outperform earlier studies using the same template by comparing gene essentiality and fluxomics experiments. We also analysed the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell lines, identifying key changes in metabolism related to cancer aggressiveness. Despite the many challenges in CB modelling, we demonstrate using our pipeline that combining transcriptomics data in metabolic models can be used to investigate key metabolic shifts. Significant limitations were found on these models ability for reliable quantitative flux prediction, thus motivating further work in genome-wide phenotype prediction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unmet contraceptive needs and unintended pregnancies among adolescent girls amid COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa and the importance of accurate, reliable and real-time data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has had a significant negative impact on issues such as the reproductive health of young girls. One of the consequences of the pandemic is a shortage of contraceptives and devices due to supply chain disruptions. The concern is that due to a lack of data, it is unclear how much these restrictions have impacted contraceptive use among youth from sub-Saharan Africa during COVID-19. Thousands of Kenyan schoolgirls have become pregnant due to the lockdown. It was recently reported from Gauteng, one of the South African provinces, that between April 2020 and March 2021 there were over 23,000 teenage pregnancies, with 934 girls aged 10 to 14 giving birth. This opinion piece aims to stimulate discussion on these issues while also addressing the issue of the importance of data for studying contraceptive use and teenage pregnancy in the face of hard-hit pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">“Ependymal‐in” gradient of thalamic damage in progressive multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Leptomeningeal and perivenular infiltrates are important contributors to cortical grey matter damage and disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). While perivenular inflammation induces vasculocentric lesions, leptomeningeal involvement follows a subpial ‘surface-in’ gradient. To determine whether similar gradient of damage occurs in deep grey matter nuclei, we examined the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei and CSF samples from 41 post-mortem secondary progressive MS cases compared to 5 non-neurological controls and 12 controls with other neurological diseases. CSF/ependyma-oriented gradient of reduction in NeuN+ neuron density was present in MS thalamic lesions compared to controls, greatest (26%) in subventricular locations at the ependyma/CSF boundary and least with increasing distance (12% at 10mm). Concomitant graded reduction in SMI31+ axon density was observed, greatest (38%) at 2mm from the ependyma/CSF boundary and least at 10mm (13%). Conversely, gradient of MHC-II+ microglia density increased by over 50% at 2 mm at the ependyma/CSF boundary and only by 15% at 10mm and this gradient inversely correlated with the neuronal (R=-0.91,p&lt;0.0001) and axonal (R=-0.79,p&lt;0.0001) thalamic changes. Observed gradients were also detected in normal-appearing thalamus and were associated with: rapid/severe disease progression; presence of leptomeningeal tertiary lymphoid-like structures; large subependymal infiltrates, enriched in CD20+ B cells and occasionally containing CXCL13+CD35+ follicular dendritic cells; and high CSF protein expression of a complex pattern of soluble inflammatory/neurodegeneration factors, including chitinase-3-like-1, TNFR-1, parvalbumin, neurofilament-light-chains and TNF. Substantial “ependymal-in” gradient of pathological cell alterations, accompanied by presence of intrathecal inflammation, compartmentalized either in sub-ependymal lymphoid perivascular infiltrates or in CSF, may play a key role in MS progression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Polygenic Resilience Modulates the Penetrance of Parkinson Disease Genetic Risk Factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the current study is to understand why some individuals avoid developing Parkinson disease (PD) despite being at relatively high genetic risk, using the largest datasets of individual-level genetic data available.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We calculated polygenic risk score to identify controls and matched PD cases with the highest burden of genetic risk for PD in the discovery cohort (International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, 7,204 PD cases and 9,412 controls) and validation cohorts (Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease, 8,968 cases and 7,598 controls; UK Biobank, 2,639 PD cases and 14,301 controls; Accelerating Medicines Partnership–Parkinson's Disease Initiative, 2,248 cases and 2,817 controls). A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, and performed multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (β = −0.054, standard error [SE] = 0.022, <i>p</i> = 0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated <i>TBCA</i> as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (<i>h</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, SE = 0.035, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as a potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metformin abrogates pathological TNF-α-producing B cells through mTOR-dependent metabolic reprogramming in polycystic ovary syndrome</a></h4>

              
                B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Clinically, metformin is used to treat PCOS, but it is unclear whether metformin exerts its therapeutic effect by regulating B cells. Here, we showed that the expression level of TNF-α in peripheral blood B cells from PCOS patient was increased. Metformin used <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> was able to reduce the production of TNF-α in B cells from PCOS patient. Administration of metformin improved mouse PCOS phenotypes induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and also inhibited TNF-α expression in splenic B cells. Further, metformin induced metabolic reprogramming of B cells in PCOS patients, including the alteration in mitochondrial morphology, the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production and glucose uptake. In DHEA-induced mouse PCOS model, metformin altered metabolic intermediates in splenic B cells. Moreover, the inhibition of TNF-α expression and metabolic reprogramming in B cells of PCOS patients and mouse model by metformin were associated with decreased mTOR phosphorylation. Together, TNF-α-producing B cells are involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and metformin inhibits mTOR phosphorylation and affects metabolic reprogramming, thereby inhibiting TNF-α expression in B cells, which may be a new mechanism of metformin in the treatment of PCOS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The molecular mechanism of load adaptation by branched actin networks</a></h4>

              
                Branched actin networks are self-assembling molecular motors that move biological membranes and drive many important cellular processes, including phagocytosis, endocytosis, and pseudopod protrusion. When confronted with opposing forces, the growth rate of these networks slows and their density increases, but the stoichiometry of key components does not change. The molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood, so we used single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Although load forces are observed to increase the density of growing filaments, we find that they actually decrease the rate of filament nucleation due to inhibitory interactions between actin filament ends and nucleation promoting factors. The force-induced increase in network density turns out to result from an exponential drop in the rate constant that governs filament capping. The force dependence of filament capping matches that of filament elongation and can be explained by expanding Brownian Ratchet theory to cover both processes. We tested a key prediction of this expanded theory by measuring the force-dependent activity of engineered capping protein variants and found that increasing the size of the capping protein increases its sensitivity to applied forces. In summary, we find that Brownian Ratchets underlie not only the ability of growing actin filaments to generate force but also the ability of branched actin networks to adapt their architecture to changing loads.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cd59 and inflammation regulate Schwann cell development</a></h4>

              
                Efficient neurotransmission is essential for organism survival and is enhanced by myelination. However, the genes that regulate myelin and myelinating glial cell development have not been fully characterized. Data from our lab and others demonstrates that <i>cd59</i>, which encodes for a small GPI-anchored glycoprotein, is highly expressed in developing zebrafish, rodent, and human oligodendrocytes (OLs) and Schwann cells (SCs), and that patients with CD59 dysfunction develop neurological dysfunction during early childhood. Yet, the function of Cd59 in the developing nervous system is currently undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>cd59</i> is expressed in a subset of developing SCs. Using <i>cd59</i> mutant zebrafish, we show that developing SCs proliferate excessively and nerves may have reduced myelin volume, altered myelin ultrastructure, and perturbed node of Ranvier assembly. Finally, we demonstrate that complement activity is elevated in <i>cd59</i> mutants and that inhibiting inflammation restores SC proliferation, myelin volume, and nodes of Ranvier to wildtype levels. Together, this work identifies Cd59 and developmental inflammation as key players in myelinating glial cell development, highlighting the collaboration between glia and the innate immune system to ensure normal neural development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure-based electron-confurcation mechanism of the Ldh-EtfAB complex</a></h4>

              
                Lactate oxidation with NAD<sup>+</sup> as electron acceptor is a highly endergonic reaction. Some anaerobic bacteria overcome the energetic hurdle by flavin-based electron bifurcation/confurcation (FBEB/FBEC) using a lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) in concert with the electron-transferring proteins EtfA and EtfB. The electron cryo-microscopically characterized (Ldh-EtfAB)<sub>2</sub> complex of <i>Acetobacterium woodii</i> at 2.43 Å resolution consists of a mobile EtfAB shuttle domain located between the rigid central Ldh and the peripheral EtfAB base units. The FADs of Ldh and the EtfAB shuttle domain contact each other thereby forming the D (dehydrogenation-connected) state. The intermediary Glu37 and Glu139 may harmonize the redox potentials between the FADs and the pyruvate/lactate pair crucial for FBEC. By integrating Alphafold2 calculations a plausible novel B (bifurcation-connected) state was obtained allowing electron transfer between the EtfAB base and shuttle FADs. Kinetic analysis of enzyme variants suggests a correlation between NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site and D-to-B-state transition implicating a 75° rotation of the EtfAB shuttle domain. The FBEC inactivity when truncating the ferredoxin domain of EtfA substantiates its role as redox relay. Lactate oxidation in Ldh is assisted by the catalytic base His423 and a metal center. On this basis, a comprehensive catalytic mechanism of the FBEC process was proposed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Amoxicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae can be resensitized by targeting the mevalonate pathway as indicated by sCRilecs-seq</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic resistance in the important opportunistic human pathogen <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is on the rise. This is particularly problematic in the case of the β-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin, which is the first-line therapy. It is therefore crucial to uncover targets that would kill or resensitize amoxicillin-resistant pneumococci. To do so, we developed a genome-wide, single-cell based, gene silencing screen using CRISPR interference called sCRilecs-seq (subsets of CRISPR interference libraries extracted by fluorescence activated cell sorting coupled to next generation sequencing). Since amoxicillin affects growth and division, sCRilecs-seq was used to identify targets that are responsible for maintaining proper cell size. Our screen revealed that downregulation of the mevalonate pathway leads to extensive cell elongation. Further investigation into this phenotype indicates that it is caused by a reduced availability of cell wall precursors at the site of cell wall synthesis due to a limitation in the production of undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), the lipid carrier that is responsible for transporting these precursors across the cell membrane. The data suggest that, whereas peptidoglycan synthesis continues even with reduced Und-P levels, cell constriction is specifically halted. We successfully exploited this knowledge to create a combination treatment strategy where the FDA-approved drug clomiphene, an inhibitor of Und-P synthesis, is paired up with amoxicillin. Our results show that clomiphene potentiates the antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin and that combination therapy resensitizes amoxicillin-resistant <i>S. pneumoniae</i>. These findings could provide a starting point to develop a solution for the increasing amount of hard-to-treat amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcal infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tongue immune compartment analysis reveals spatial macrophage heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                The tongue is a unique muscular organ situated in the oral cavity where it is involved in taste sensation, mastication, and articulation. As a barrier organ, which is constantly exposed to environmental pathogens, the tongue is expected to host an immune cell network ensuring local immune defence. However, the composition and the transcriptional landscape of the tongue immune system are currently not completely defined. Here, we characterised the tissue-resident immune compartment of the murine tongue during development, health and disease, combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with in situ immunophenotyping. We identified distinct local immune cell populations and described two specific subsets of tongue-resident macrophages occupying discrete anatomical niches. <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages were located specifically in the highly innervated lamina propria beneath the tongue epidermis and at times in close proximity to fungiform papillae. <i>Folr2</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages were detected in deeper muscular tissue. In silico analysis indicated that the two macrophage subsets originate from a common proliferative precursor during early postnatal development and responded differently to systemic LPS in vivo. Our description of the under-investigated tongue immune system sets a starting point to facilitate research on tongue immune-physiology and pathology including cancer and taste disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oscillatory movement of a dynein-microtubule complex crosslinked with DNA origami</a></h4>

              
                Bending of cilia and flagella occurs when axonemal dynein molecules on one side of the axoneme produce force and move toward the microtubule (MT) minus end. These dyneins are then pulled back when the axoneme bends in the other direction, meaning oscillatory back and forth movement of dynein during repetitive bending of cilia/flagella. There are various factors that may regulate the dynein activity, e.g. the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, radial spokes, and central apparatus. In order to understand the basic mechanism of dynein’s oscillatory movement, we constructed a simple model system composed of MTs, outer-arm dyneins, and crosslinks between the MTs made of DNA origami. Electron microscopy (EM) showed pairs of parallel MTs crossbridged by patches of regularly arranged dynein molecules bound in two different orientations, depending on which of the MTs their tails bind to. The oppositely oriented dyneins are expected to produce opposing forces when the pair of MTs have the same polarity. Optical trapping experiments showed that the dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex actually oscillates back and forth after photolysis of caged ATP. Intriguingly, the complex, when held at one end, showed repetitive bending motions. The results show that a simple system composed of ensembles of oppositely oriented dyneins, MTs, and inter-MT crosslinkers, without any additional regulatory structures, has an intrinsic ability to cause oscillation and repetitive bending motions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Zebrafish fin regeneration involves generic and regeneration-specific osteoblast injury responses</a></h4>

              
                Successful regeneration requires the coordinated execution of multiple cellular responses to injury. In amputated zebrafish fins, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate, migrate towards the injury and form proliferative osteogenic blastema cells. We show that osteoblast migration is preceded by cell elongation and alignment along the proximodistal axis, which require actomyosin, but not microtubule turnover. Surprisingly, osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration can be uncoupled. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we found that NF-ĸB and retinoic acid signalling regulate dedifferentiation without affecting migration, while the complement system and actomyosin dynamics affect migration but not dedifferentiation. Furthermore, by removing bone at two locations within a fin ray, we established an injury model containing two injury sites. We found that osteoblasts dedifferentiate at and migrate towards both sites, while accumulation of osteogenic progenitor cells and regenerative bone formation only occur at the distal-facing injury. Together, these data indicate that osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration represent generic injury responses that are differentially regulated and can occur independently of each other and of regenerative growth. We conclude that successful fin bone regeneration appears to involve the coordinated execution of generic and regeneration-specific responses of osteoblasts to injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Predictive Coding: A New Model of Hierarchical Sequence Learning and Prediction in the Cortex</a></h4>

              
                We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a new hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the cortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using precision-weighted prediction errors. We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation is implemented as a low-dimensional mixture of possible temporal dynamics. When trained on natural videos, the first-level neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those found in simple cells of the primary visual cortex. The second-level responses spanned longer timescales and showed more stability than those at the first level, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. After adapting to a repeated visual sequence, the model displayed full recall of the sequence given only the beginning of the sequence, similar to sequence recall in the visual cortex. Our results suggest that sequence learning and temporal prediction in the cortex can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical generative model of input sequences.

                Learning, memory and cognition are thought to require forms of synaptic plasticity such as hippocampal long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), and such plasticity can be modulated by {beta}-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol or norepinephrine. For instance, LTP versus LTD is induced by high-versus low-frequency stimulation (HFS versus LFS) but, stimulating {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs) enables LTP induction also by LFS. In contrast to HFS-LTP, such {beta}AR-LTP requires signaling by L-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels, not NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Surprisingly, we found that {beta}AR-LTP still required a non-ionotropic NMDAR function: the stimulus-induced binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) that mediates CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. In hippocampal neurons, {beta}-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol transformed LTD-type CaMKII movement to LTP-type movement, resulting in CaMKII movement to excitatory instead of inhibitory synapses. Additionally, isoproterenol enabled induction of a major cell-biological feature of LTP in response to LTD stimuli: increased SEP-GluA1 surface expression. Like for the {beta}AR-LTP in hippocampal slices, the effects of isoproterenol on CaMKII movement and SEP-GluA1 surface expression involved L-type Ca2+-channels. Taken together, these results indicate that isoproterenol transforms LTD stimuli to LTP signals by switching CaMKII movement and GluN2B binding to LTP mode.

One Sentence SummaryBuonarati et al. show that {beta}-adrenergic stimulation enables LTP induction in response to LTD stimuli by switching synaptic CaMKII movement to LTP mode.

                Regenerating functional new neurons in adult mammalian brains has been proven a difficult task for decades. Recent advancement in direct glia-to-neuron conversion in vivo opens a new field for neural regeneration and repair. However, this emerging new field is facing serious challenges from misuse of viral vectors to misinterpretation of conversion data. Here, we employ a variety of AAV vectors with different promoters and enhancers to demonstrate that astrocytes can be converted into neurons in a NeuroD1 dose-dependent manner in both wildtype (WT) and transgenic mice. Notably, astrocytes in WT mice were relatively easy to convert with higher conversion efficiency, whereas lineage-traced astrocytes in Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice showed high resistance to reprogramming but were still converted into neurons after enhancing NeuroD1 expression with CMV enhancer. Furthermore, under two-photon microscope, we observed direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion within 3 weeks of serial live imaging in the mouse cortex. We also demonstrated that high titre AAV reaching 1013 GC/ml caused severe neuronal leakage using a variety of AAV GFAP::GFP vectors, highlighting the necessity to inject low titre AAV into healthy brains to avoid artifactual results. Together, our studies suggest that lineage-traced astrocytes can be converted into neurons but require stronger conversion force such as enhanced NeuroD1 expression. Failure to recognize the difference between WT astrocytes and lineage-traced astrocytes in terms of conversion barrier will lead to misinterpretation of data.

                Germinal zone (GZ) exit is at the top of a cascade of events promoting the maturation of neurons and their assembly into neuronal circuits.

How newborn neurons integrate multiple cell-extrinsic niche cues with their cell-intrinsic machinery in exiting a GZ is unknown. We establish cooperation between cell polarity-regulated adhesion and Netrin-1 signaling comprises a coincidence detection circuit repelling maturing neurons from their GZ. In this circuit, the Partitioning defective 3 (Pard3) polarity protein and Junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) adhesion protein promote, while the Seven in absentia 2 (Siah2) ubiquitin ligase inhibits, Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) receptor surface recruitment to gate differentiation linked repulsion to GZ Netrin-1.

                Regeneration of myelin in the CNS is being pursued as a potential therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis. Several labs have reported small molecules that promote oligodendrocyte formation and remyelination in vivo. Recently, we reported that many such molecules function by inhibiting a narrow window of enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Here we describe a new high-throughput screen of 1,836 bioactive molecules and a thorough re-analysis of more than 60 molecules previously-identified as promoting oligodendrocyte formation from human, rat, or mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). These studies highlight that an overwhelming fraction of validated screening hits, including several molecules being evaluated clinically for remyelination, inhibit cholesterol pathway enzymes like EBP. To rationalize these findings, we suggest a model that relies on the high druggability of sterol-metabolizing enzymes and the ability of cationic amphiphiles to mimic the transition state of EBP. These studies further establish cholesterol pathway inhibition as a dominant mechanism among screening hits that enhance human, rat, or mouse oligodendrocyte formation.

                Cross-orientation suppression is a classic form of contextual normalization in visual cortex, yet the degree to which cortical circuits participate in the normalization computation is unclear. We visualized orientation maps of individual ferrets, and provided patterned optogenetic stimulation to both excitatory and inhibitory cells in orientation columns that either matched or were orthogonal to the preferred visual orientation of neurons recorded with electrodes. When visual or optogenetic stimulation of columns preferring one orientation was combined with optogenetic stimulation of columns preferring the orthogonal orientation, we observed less suppression than when orthogonal stimulation was provided visually, suggesting that cortical circuits do not provide a large fraction of visual cross-orientation suppression. Integration of visual and optogenetic signals was linear when neurons exhibited low firing rates and became sublinear when neurons exhibited higher firing rates. We probed the nature of sublinearities in cortex by examining the influence of optogenetic stimulation of cortical interneurons. We observed a range of responses, including evidence for paradoxical responses in which interneuron stimulation caused a decrease in inhibitory firing rate, presumably due to the withdrawal of recurrent excitation. These results are compatible with cortical circuits that exhibit strong recurrent excitation with stabilizing inhibition that provides normalization, albeit normalization that is too weak across columns to account for cross-orientation suppression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-resolution cross-species transcriptomic atlas of dorsal root ganglia reveals species-specific programs for sensory function</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) play a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by sensing and initiating responses to stimuli. While most preclinical studies of DRGs are conducted in rodents, much less is known about the mechanisms of sensory perception in primates. We generated a transcriptome atlas of mouse, guinea pig, cynomolgus monkey, and human DRGs using a framework that implements a common laboratory workflow and multiple data-integration approaches to generate high-resolution cross-species mappings of sensory neuron subtypes. Using our atlas, we identified conserved core modules highlighting subtype-specific biological processes related to inflammatory response. We also identified divergent expression of key genes involved in DRG function, suggesting species-specific adaptations. Among these, we validated that Tafa4, a member of the druggable genome, was expressed in distinct populations of DRG neurons across species, highlighting species-specific programs that are critical for therapeutic development.

	<p>Background: With the guidance of multi-mode imaging, the time window for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has been expanded to 24 h. However, poor clinical outcomes are still not uncommon. We aimed to develop a multi-mode imaging scale for endovascular therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke (META) to predict the neurological outcome in patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Methods: We included consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with occlusion of middle cerebral artery and/or internal carotid artery who underwent EVT. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3&amp;amp;ndash;6 at 3 months. A five-point META score was constructed based on clot burden score, multi-segment clot, the Alberta Stroke Program early computed tomography score of cerebral blood volume (CBV-ASPECTS), and collateral status. We evaluated the META score performance using area under the curve (AUC) calculations. Results: A total of 259 patients were included. A higher META score was independently correlated with poor outcomes at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.690, 95% CI, 1.340 to 2.132, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) after adjusting for age, hypertension, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and baseline blood glucose. Patients with a META score &amp;amp;ge; 2 were less likely to benefit from EVT (mRS 3&amp;amp;ndash;6: 60.8% vs. 29.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The META score predicted poor outcomes with an AUC of 0.714, higher than the Pittsburgh Response to Endovascular therapy (PRE) score, the totaled health risks in vascular events (THRIVE) score (AUC: 0.566, 0.706), and the single imaging marker in the scale. Conclusions: The novel META score could refine the predictive accuracy of prognosis after EVT, which might provide a promising avenue for future automatic imaging analysis to help decision making.</p>

	<p>Background. Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease which affects more than 50 million patients and represents 60&amp;amp;ndash;80% of all cases of dementia. Mutations in the APP gene, mostly affecting the &amp;amp;gamma;-secretase site of cleavage and presenilin mutations, have been identified in inherited forms of AD. Methods. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis of the transcriptional signatures that characterize two familial AD mutations (APPV7171F and PSEN1M146V) in order to characterize the common altered biomolecular pathways affected by these mutations. Next, an anti-signature perturbation analysis was performed using the AD meta-signature and the drug meta-signatures obtained from the L1000 database, using cosine similarity as distance metrics. Results. Overall, the meta-analysis identified 1479 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 684 downregulated genes, and 795 upregulated genes. Additionally, we found 14 drugs with a significant anti-similarity to the AD signature, with the top five drugs being naftifine, moricizine, ketoconazole, perindopril, and fexofenadine. Conclusions. This study aimed to integrate the transcriptional profiles associated with common familial AD mutations in neurons in order to characterize the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in AD and to find more effective drugs for AD.</p>

	<p>Early and recent studies show that dopamine through its neuronal systems and receptor subtypes plays different roles in the control of male sexual behavior. These studies show that (i) the mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic system plays a key role in the preparatory phase of sexual behavior, e.g., in sexual arousal, motivation and reward, whereas the nigrostriatal system controls the sensory-motor coordination necessary for copulation, (ii) the incertohypothalamic system is involved in the consummatory aspects of sexual behavior (penile erection and copulation), but evidence for its role in sexual motivation is also available, (iii) the pro-sexual effects of dopamine occur in concert with neural systems interconnecting the hypothalamus and preoptic area with the spinal cord, ventral tegmental area and other limbic brain areas and (iv) D2 and D4 receptors play a major role in the pro-sexual effects of dopamine. Despite some controversy, increases or decreases, respectively, of brain dopamine activity induced by drugs or that occur physiologically, usually improves or worsens, respectively, sexual activity. These findings suggest that an altered central dopaminergic tone plays a role in mental pathologies characterized by aberrant sexual behavior, and that pro-erectile D4 receptor agonists may be considered a new strategy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men.</p>

	<p>Sleep deprivation leads to the deterioration in the physiological functioning of the brain, cognitive decline, and many neurodegenerative diseases, all of which progress with advancing age. Sleep insufficiency and impairments in cognitive function are characterized by progressive neuronal losses in the cerebral cortex. In this study, we analyze gene expression profiles following sleep-deprived murine models and circadian matched controls to identify genes that might underlie cortical homeostasis in response to sleep deprivation. Screening of the literature resulted in three murine (Mus musculus) gene expression datasets (GSE6514, GSE78215, and GSE33491) that included cortical tissue biopsies from mice that are sleep deprived for 6 h (n = 15) and from circadian controls that are left undisturbed (n = 15). Cortical differentially expressed genes are used to construct a network of encoded proteins that are ranked based on their interactome according to 11 topological algorithms. The analysis revealed three genes&amp;amp;mdash;NFKBIA, EZR, and SGK1&amp;amp;mdash;which exhibited the highest multi-algorithmic topological significance. These genes are strong markers of increased brain inflammation, cytoskeletal aberrations, and glucocorticoid resistance, changes that imply aging-like transcriptional responses during sleep deprivation in the murine cortex. Their potential role as candidate markers of local homeostatic response to sleep loss in the murine cortex warrants further experimental validation.</p>

	<p>It has been consistently demonstrated that females report greater numbers of concussions in sex-comparable sports and take longer to recover from concussive symptoms than males. However, it is unknown if the neurophysiological consequences of concussion may contribute to these sex differences in concussion symptoms and recovery. The purpose of this study was to examine potential sex-related differences in neurophysiology in healthy and concussed individuals. Twenty-one (nine F) concussed individuals (20.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.1 years; CONC) and twenty-one age-, sex-, height-, weight-, and activity-matched controls (21.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.2 years; CONT) participated in the study. The CONC group reported to the lab within 72 h, 1-week, and 2-weeks post-injury and the CONT group followed a similar measurement schedule. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and cortical silent period (CSP) duration were measured from the first dorsal interosseous muscle to assess corticospinal excitability and inhibition, respectively. There were no significant differences across time (p &amp;amp;ge; 0.13) or between the CONC and CONT group in MEP amplitude (p = 0.72) or CSP duration (p = 0.54). Overall, males (119.08 &amp;amp;plusmn; 29.91 ms) had significantly longer CSP durations compared with females (101.24 &amp;amp;plusmn; 33.43 ms), indicating greater corticospinal inhibition in males, regardless of injury status (p = 0.04). An important and novel finding of this study was the lack of differences in these neurophysiological measures between males and females following concussion. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document greater corticospinal inhibition in males compared with females.</p>

	<p>Previous research on the relationship between attention and emotion processing have focused essentially on consciously-viewed, supraliminal stimuli, while the attention-emotion interplay remains unexplored in situations where visual awareness is restricted. Here, we presented participants with face pairs in a backward masking paradigm and examined the electrophysiological activity in response to fearful and neutral expressions under different conditions of attention (spatially attended vs. unattended) and stimulus visibility (subliminal vs. supraliminal). We found an enhanced N2 (visual awareness negativity -VAN-) and an enhanced P3 for supraliminal compared to subliminal faces. The VAN, indexing the early perceptual awareness, was enhanced when the faces were spatially attended compared to when they were unattended, showing that the VAN does not require spatial attention focus but can be enhanced by it. Fearful relative to neutral expressions enhanced the early neural activity (N2) regardless of spatial attention but only in the supraliminal viewing condition. However, fear-related enhancements on later neural activity (P3) were found when stimuli were both attended and presented supraliminally. These findings suggest that visual awareness is needed for emotion processing during both early and late stages. Spatial attention is required for emotion processing at the later stage but not at the early stage.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The rise in armed conflicts has contributed to an increase in the number of asylum seekers. Prolonged asylum processes may negatively affect asylum seekers&amp;amp;rsquo; health and lead to inactivity. Studies show that physical activity interventions are associated with improvements in health outcomes. However, there are a limited number of studies investigating the associations of physical activity on asylum seekers&amp;amp;rsquo; health. Methods: Participants (263 males and 204 females), mostly from Syria, were assessed before and after a 10-week intervention for VO2 max, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), body fat, and visceral fat. Linear mixed models were used to test differences within groups, and a linear regression model analysis was performed to test whether physiological variables predicted adherence. Results: Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; VO2 max increased: males by 2.96 mL/min/kg and females 2.57 mL/min/kg. Increased SMM percentages were seen in both genders: females by 0.38% and males 0.23%. Visceral fat area decreased: males by 0.73 cm2 and females 5.44 cm2. Conclusions: Participants showed significant increases in VO2 max and SMM and decreased visceral fat. This study provides an insight into asylum seekers&amp;amp;rsquo; health and serves as a starting point to new interventions in which physical activity is used as a tool to promote and improve vulnerable populations&amp;amp;rsquo; health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Compartmentalization of Learning-Related Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons receive synaptic inputs from different pathways that are organized according to their laminar target. This architectural scheme provides cortical neurons with a spatial mechanism to separate information, which may support neural flexibility required during learning. Here, we investigated layer-specific plasticity of sensory encoding following learning by recording from two different dendritic compartments, tuft and basal dendrites, of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in the auditory cortex of mice. Following auditory fear conditioning, auditory-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were enhanced in tuft, but not basal, dendrites leading to increased somatic action potential output. This is in direct contrast to the long held (and debated) hypothesis that, despite extensive dendritic arbors, neurons function as a simple one-compartment model. Two computational models of varying complexity based on the experimental data illustrated that this learning-related increase of auditory responses in tuft dendrites can account for the changes in somatic output. Taken together, we illustrate that neurons do not function as a single compartment, and dendritic compartmentalization of learning-related plasticity may act to increase the computational power of pyramidal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Fortuitous discovery of primary peritoneal psammocarcinoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Psammocarcinoma is an uncommon subtype of low-grade serous carcinoma. It is characterized by the presence of extensive psammoma bodies and can have either an ovarian or peritoneal origin. To our knowledge fewer than 30 cases of primary peritoneal psammocarcinoma (PPP) have been reported in the English literature. We report a rare case of  PPP in a 74-year-old female, discovered fortuitously within a laparotomy for gallbladder lithiasis. At laparotomy, multiple nodular implants involving the omentum, the peritoneum and a magma of intestinal loops in the right iliac fossa were noted. A biopsy from nodules was performed. Gross examination showed multiple nodules of different sizes in the fat tissue. Pathologic examination showed massive psammoma bodies representing more than 75% of the tumor. The final diagnosis was psammocarcinoma. Our patient was referred to the gynecologic department for further investigation and to ascertain whether the tumor arose from the ovaries or peritoneum. Hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy and omentectomy were performed. Macroscopic examination showed that both ovaries were intact having a normal size. No invasion of ovarian stroma was shown in microscopic examination. The patient died of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) six days after the surgery. PPP is a rare type of  low-grade serous carcinoma. The behavior of this tumor is unclear, and the treatment is not standardized because of its rarity and lack of long-term follow-up. More cases need to be studied for better understanding and improvement of the management protocols.

                Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a benign but rare central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm of the choroid plexus. The onset of symptoms is usually in the first decade and may occur at birth (i.e., congenital). It accounts for 0.4–0.6% of all brain tumors. Usually seen in patients who are young children. The object of this clinical case to highlight early surgical intervention, intensive and multidisciplinary care, and pharmaceutical prescriptions can enhance the patient's condition and quality of life. We herein report a rare presentation of CPP in a 6-year-old Sudanese female child with seizures. Who suffered from obstructive hydrocephalus with lateral ventricular choroid plexus papilloma. The patient underwent resection at the age of 6 months in our center's neurosurgery department. Intensive and multidisciplinary follow-up managed to maintain positive outcome and better quality of life in a relatively benign neoplasm. In spite of a wide range of therapeutic options for the management of CPP described in the literature, studies demonstrated that patients with CPP alone and underwent a surgical procedure can live independently as adults and work full-time with uncommon recurrences.

                Genome biology shows substantial progress in its analytical and computational part in the last decades. Differential gene expression is one of many computationally intense areas; it is largely developed under R programming language. Here we explain possible reasons for such dominance of R in gene expression data. Next, we discuss the prospects for Python to become competitive in this area of research in coming years. We indicate that Python can be used already in a field of a single cell differential gene expression. We pinpoint still missing parts in Python and possibilities for improvement.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying control ensembles for information processing within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Catalina Vich, Matthew Clapp, Jonathan E. Rubin, Timothy Verstynen</p>

In situations featuring uncertainty about action-reward contingencies, mammals can flexibly adopt strategies for decision-making that are tuned in response to environmental changes. Although the cortico-basal ganglia thalamic (CBGT) network has been identified as contributing to the decision-making process, it features a complex synaptic architecture, comprised of multiple feed-forward, reciprocal, and feedback pathways, that complicate efforts to elucidate the roles of specific CBGT populations in the process by which evidence is accumulated and influences behavior. In this paper we apply a strategic sampling approach, based on Latin hypercube sampling, to explore how variations in CBGT network properties, including subpopulation firing rates and synaptic weights, map to variability of parameters in a normative drift diffusion model (DDM), representing algorithmic aspects of information processing during decision-making. Through the application of canonical correlation analysis, we find that this relationship can be characterized in terms of three low-dimensional control ensembles within the CBGT network that impact specific qualities of the emergent decision policy: responsiveness (a measure of how quickly evidence evaluation gets underway, associated with overall activity in corticothalamic and direct pathways), pliancy (a measure of the standard of evidence needed to commit to a decision, associated largely with overall activity in components of the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia), and choice (a measure of commitment toward one available option, associated with differences in direct and indirect pathways across action channels). These analyses provide mechanistic predictions about the roles of specific CBGT network elements in tuning the way that information is accumulated and translated into decision-related behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpretable pairwise distillations for generative protein sequence models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoph Feinauer, Barthelemy Meynard-Piganeau, Carlo Lucibello</p>

Many different types of generative models for protein sequences have been proposed in literature. Their uses include the prediction of mutational effects, protein design and the prediction of structural properties. Neural network (NN) architectures have shown great performances, commonly attributed to the capacity to extract non-trivial higher-order interactions from the data. In this work, we analyze two different NN models and assess how close they are to simple pairwise distributions, which have been used in the past for similar problems. We present an approach for extracting pairwise models from more complex ones using an energy-based modeling framework. We show that for the tested models the extracted pairwise models can replicate the energies of the original models and are also close in performance in tasks like mutational effect prediction. In addition, we show that even simpler, factorized models often come close in performance to the original models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Image-based parameter inference for epithelial mechanics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Goshi Ogita, Takefumi Kondo, Keisuke Ikawa, Tadashi Uemura, Shuji Ishihara, Kaoru Sugimura</p>

Measuring mechanical parameters in tissues, such as the elastic modulus of cell-cell junctions, is essential to decipher the mechanical control of morphogenesis. However, their <i>in vivo</i> measurement is technically challenging. Here, we formulated an image-based statistical approach to estimate the mechanical parameters of epithelial cells. Candidate mechanical models are constructed based on force-cell shape correlations obtained from image data. Substitution of the model functions into force-balance equations at the cell vertex leads to an equation with respect to the parameters of the model, by which one can estimate the parameter values using a least-squares method. A test using synthetic data confirmed the accuracy of parameter estimation and model selection. By applying this method to <i>Drosophila</i> epithelial tissues, we found that the magnitude and orientation of feedback between the junction tension and shrinkage, which are determined by the spring constant of the junction, were correlated with the elevation of tension and myosin-II on shrinking junctions during cell rearrangement. Further, this method clarified how alterations in tissue polarity and stretching affect the anisotropy in tension parameters. Thus, our method provides a novel approach to uncovering the mechanisms governing epithelial morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epidemic management and control through risk-dependent individual contact interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tapio Schneider, Oliver R. A. Dunbar, Jinlong Wu, Lucas Böttcher, Dmitry Burov, Alfredo Garbuno-Inigo, Gregory L. Wagner, Sen Pei, Chiara Daraio, Raffaele Ferrari, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Testing, contact tracing, and isolation (TTI) is an epidemic management and control approach that is difficult to implement at scale because it relies on manual tracing of contacts. Exposure notification apps have been developed to digitally scale up TTI by harnessing contact data obtained from mobile devices; however, exposure notification apps provide users only with limited binary information when they have been directly exposed to a known infection source. Here we demonstrate a scalable improvement to TTI and exposure notification apps that uses data assimilation (DA) on a contact network. Network DA exploits diverse sources of health data together with the proximity data from mobile devices that exposure notification apps rely upon. It provides users with continuously assessed individual risks of exposure and infection, which can form the basis for targeting individual contact interventions. Simulations of the early COVID-19 epidemic in New York City are used to establish proof-of-concept. In the simulations, network DA identifies up to a factor 2 more infections than contact tracing when both harness the same contact data and diagnostic test data. This remains true even when only a relatively small fraction of the population uses network DA. When a sufficiently large fraction of the population (≳ 75%) uses network DA and complies with individual contact interventions, targeting contact interventions with network DA reduces deaths by up to a factor 4 relative to TTI. Network DA can be implemented by expanding the computational backend of existing exposure notification apps, thus greatly enhancing their capabilities. Implemented at scale, it has the potential to precisely and effectively control future epidemics while minimizing economic disruption.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">LaDIVA: A neurocomputational model providing laryngeal motor control for speech acquisition and production</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hasini R. Weerathunge, Gabriel A. Alzamendi, Gabriel J. Cler, Frank H. Guenther, Cara E. Stepp, Matías Zañartu</p>

Many voice disorders are the result of intricate neural and/or biomechanical impairments that are poorly understood. The limited knowledge of their etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms hampers effective clinical management. Behavioral studies have been used concurrently with computational models to better understand typical and pathological laryngeal motor control. Thus far, however, a unified computational framework that quantitatively integrates physiologically relevant models of phonation with the neural control of speech has not been developed. Here, we introduce <i>LaDIVA</i>, a novel neurocomputational model with physiologically based laryngeal motor control. We combined the DIVA model (an established neural network model of speech motor control) with the extended body-cover model (a physics-based vocal fold model). The resulting integrated model, LaDIVA, was validated by comparing its model simulations with behavioral responses to perturbations of auditory vocal fundamental frequency (<i>f</i><sub>o</sub>) feedback in adults with typical speech. LaDIVA demonstrated capability to simulate different modes of laryngeal motor control, ranging from short-term (i.e., <i>reflexive</i>) and long-term (i.e., <i>adaptive</i>) auditory feedback paradigms, to generating prosodic contours in speech. Simulations showed that LaDIVA’s laryngeal motor control displays properties of motor equivalence, i.e., LaDIVA could robustly generate compensatory responses to reflexive vocal <i>f</i><sub>o</sub> perturbations with varying initial laryngeal muscle activation levels leading to the same output. The model can also generate prosodic contours for studying laryngeal motor control in running speech. LaDIVA can expand the understanding of the physiology of human phonation to enable, for the first time, the investigation of causal effects of neural motor control in the fine structure of the vocal signal.

Communication is a fundamental part of scientific development and methodology. With the advancement of the internet and social networks, communication has become rapid and sometimes overwhelming, especially in science. It is important to provide scientists with useful, effective, and dynamic tools to establish and build a fluid communication framework that allows for scientific advancement. Therefore, in this article, we present advice and recommendations that can help promote and improve science communication while respecting an adequate balance in the degree of commitment toward collaborative work. We have developed 10 rules shown in increasing order of commitment that are grouped into 3 key categories: (1) speak (based on active participation); (2) join (based on joining scientific groups); and (3) assess (based on the analysis and retrospective consideration of the weaknesses and strengths). We include examples and resources that provide actionable strategies for involvement and engagement with science communication, from basic steps to more advanced, introspective, and long-term commitments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling cortical synaptic effects of anesthesia and their cholinergic reversal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bolaji P. Eniwaye, Victoria Booth, Anthony G. Hudetz, Michal Zochowski</p>

General anesthetics work through a variety of molecular mechanisms while resulting in the common end point of sedation and loss of consciousness. Generally, the administration of common anesthetics induces reduction in synaptic excitation while promoting synaptic inhibition. Exogenous modulation of the anesthetics’ synaptic effects can help determine the neuronal pathways involved in anesthesia. For example, both animal and human studies have shown that exogenously induced increases in acetylcholine in the brain can elicit wakeful-like behavior despite the continued presence of the anesthetic. However, the underlying mechanisms of anesthesia reversal at the cellular level have not been investigated. Here we apply a computational model of a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to simulate the network-wide effects of anesthesia, due to changes in synaptic inhibition and excitation, and their reversal by cholinergic activation through muscarinic receptors. We use a differential evolution algorithm to fit model parameters to match measures of spiking activity, neuronal connectivity, and network dynamics recorded in the visual cortex of rodents during anesthesia with desflurane <i>in vivo</i>. We find that facilitating muscarinic receptor effects of acetylcholine on top of anesthetic-induced synaptic changes predicts the reversal of anesthetic suppression of neurons’ spiking activity, functional connectivity, as well as pairwise and population interactions. Thus, our model predicts a specific neuronal mechanism for the cholinergic reversal of anesthesia consistent with experimental behavioral observations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The population genetics of the causative agent of snake fungal disease indicate recent introductions to the USA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason T. Ladner, Jonathan M. Palmer, Cassandra L. Ettinger, Jason E. Stajich, Terence M. Farrell, Brad M. Glorioso, Becki Lawson, Steven J. Price, Anne G. Stengle, Daniel A. Grear, Jeffrey M. Lorch</p>

Snake fungal disease (SFD; ophidiomycosis), caused by the pathogen <i>Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola</i> (<i>Oo</i>), has been documented in wild snakes in North America and Eurasia, and is considered an emerging disease in the eastern United States of America. However, a lack of historical disease data has made it challenging to determine whether <i>Oo</i> is a recent arrival to the USA or whether SFD emergence is due to other factors. Here, we examined the genomes of 82 <i>Oo</i> strains to determine the pathogen’s history in the eastern USA. <i>Oo</i> strains from the USA formed a clade (Clade II) distinct from European strains (Clade I), and molecular dating indicated that these clades diverged too recently (approximately 2,000 years ago) for transcontinental dispersal of <i>Oo</i> to have occurred via natural snake movements across Beringia. A lack of nonrecombinant intermediates between clonal lineages in Clade II indicates that <i>Oo</i> has actually been introduced multiple times to North America from an unsampled source population, and molecular dating indicates that several of these introductions occurred within the last few hundred years. Molecular dating also indicated that the most common Clade II clonal lineages have expanded recently in the USA, with time of most recent common ancestor mean estimates ranging from 1985 to 2007 CE. The presence of Clade II in captive snakes worldwide demonstrates a potential mechanism of introduction and highlights that additional incursions are likely unless action is taken to reduce the risk of pathogen translocation and spillover into wild snake populations.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Debate continues regarding the possible role of the hippocampus across short-term and working memory tasks. The current study examined the possibility of a hippocampal contribution to precise, high-resolution cognition and conjunctive memory. We administered visual working memory tasks featuring a continuous response component to a well-established developmental amnesic patient with relatively selective bilateral hippocampal damage (Jon) and healthy controls. The patient was able to produce highly accurate response judgments regarding conjunctions of color and orientation or color and location, using simultaneous or sequential presentation of stimuli, with no evidence of any impairment in working memory binding, categorical accuracy, or continuous precision. These findings indicate that hippocampal damage does not necessarily lead to deficits in high-resolution cognitive performance, even when the damage is severe and bilateral.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current views of community and hospital pharmacists on pharmaceutical care services in the United Arab Emirates: A mixed methodological study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The profession of pharmacy has evolved significantly in recent years in terms of professional service delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the current views of pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on pharmaceutical care services and the nature of barriers encountered in practice using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among hospital and community pharmacists (n = 305) between March and May 2021, using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. In the qualitative phase, 15 interviews were conducted to explore five main criteria: patient information, inadequate patient counseling, prescribing errors prevention and identifying drug-related problems, lack of participation in health awareness programs, and barriers to pharmaceutical care implementation. In the quantitative phase, 305 consenting pharmacists completed a questionnaire on seven criteria: demographic profile, pharmacist-physician interaction, patient counseling assessment, patient reports of adverse drug events, pharmacist participation in health awareness programs, perceptions of reducing prescribing errors and identifying drug-related problems, and barriers to appropriate pharmaceutical care implementation. Results: The results of both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study revealed that pharmacists' influence on practice in the UAE is limited due to many factors, mainly lack of time and patients' ignorance of the pharmacist's role in the medical field. The mean responses regarding pharmacists' approach to patient counseling and patients' knowledge of pharmacists' role in managing adverse drug reactions were 77.1% and 59.7%, respectively. Active participation in health awareness programs was 64.8%. The mean positive response of participants in reducing prescribing errors and recognizing drug-related problems was 9.2%. Pharmacists' age and number of years in practice were the most important factors influencing the pharmaceutical care services implementation. Conclusion: The study has shown the need to shed light on the proper implementation of pharmaceutical care while maintaining a trusting relationship with physicians.

                The position weight matrix, also called the position-specific scoring matrix, is the commonly accepted model to quantify the specificity of transcription factor binding to DNA. Position weight matrices are used in thousands of projects and software tools in regulatory genomics, including computational prediction of the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide variants. Yet, recently Yan et al. reported that "the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power" if applied to the analysis of regulatory variants studied with a newly developed experimental method, SNP-SELEX. Here, we re-analyze the rich experimental dataset obtained by Yan et al. and show that appropriately selected position weight matrices in fact can adequately quantify transcription factor binding to alternative alleles.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Associations of vascular risk and amyloid burden with subsequent dementia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Midlife vascular risk factors (MVRF) are associated with incident dementia, as are amyloid β(Aβ) deposition and neurodegeneration. Whether vascular and Alzheimer Disease (AD)-associated factors contribute to dementia independently or interact synergistically to reduce cognition is poorly understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET study were followed from 1987-89(45-64 yo) through 2016-17(74-94 yo), with repeat cognitive assessment and dementia adjudication. In 2011-13, dementia-free participants underwent brain MRI (with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and brain volume measurement) and florbetapir (Aβ) PET. The relative contributions of vascular risk and injury (MVRF, WMH volume), elevated Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and neurodegeneration (smaller temporo-parietal brain regions) to incident dementia were evaluated with adjusted Cox models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 298 individuals, 36 developed dementia (median follow-up 4.9 years). Midlife hypertension and Aβ each independently predicted dementia risk (hypertension:HR 2.57 (95% CI 1.16-5.67); Aβ SUVR(per SD):HR 2.57 (1.72-3.84)), but didn’t interact significantly, whereas <i>late-life</i> diabetes (HR 2.50 (1.18 to 5.28)) and Aβ independently predicted dementia risk. WMH(per SD):HR 1.51 (1.03-2.20) and Aβ SUVR (HR 2.52 (1.83-3.47)) independently contributed to incident dementia but WMH lost significance when MVRF were included. Smaller temporo-parietal brain regions were associated with incident dementia, independent of Aβ and MVRF (HR 2.18 (1.18-4.01)).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Midlife hypertension and late-life Aβ are independently associated with dementia risk, without evidence for synergy on a multiplicative scale. Given the independent contributions of vascular and amyloid mechanisms, multiple pathways should be considered when evaluating interventions to reduce the burden of dementia.</p>
