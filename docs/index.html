              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Radical pairs may explain reactive oxygen species-mediated effects of hypomagnetic field on neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rishabh Rishabh, Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, Dennis Salahub, Christoph Simon</p>

Exposures to a hypomagnetic field can affect biological processes. Recently, it has been observed that hypomagnetic field exposure can adversely affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition in mice. In the same study, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hypomagnetic field effects has been demonstrated. However, the mechanistic reasons behind this effect are not clear. This study proposes a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of ROS production and the attenuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a hypomagnetic field. The results of our calculations favor a singlet-born radical pair over a triplet-born radical pair. Our model predicts hypomagnetic field effects on the triplet/singlet yield of comparable strength as the effects observed in experimental studies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental results on superoxide concentration and other observed ROS effects. We also predict the effects of applied magnetic fields and oxygen isotopic substitution on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of water-bridged interactions in metal ion coupled protein allostery</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xingyue Guan, Cheng Tan, Wenfei Li, Wei Wang, D. Thirumalai</p>

Allosteric communication between distant parts of proteins controls many cellular functions, in which metal ions are widely utilized as effectors to trigger the allosteric cascade. Due to the involvement of strong coordination interactions, the energy landscape dictating the metal ion binding is intrinsically rugged. How metal ions achieve fast binding by overcoming the landscape ruggedness and thereby efficiently mediate protein allostery is elusive. By performing molecular dynamics simulations for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding mediated allostery of the calmodulin (CaM) domains, each containing two Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding helix-loop-helix motifs (EF-hands), we revealed the key role of water-bridged interactions in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and protein allostery. The bridging water molecules between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and binding residue reduces the ruggedness of ligand exchange landscape by acting as a lubricant, facilitating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupled protein allostery. Calcium-induced rotation of the helices in the EF-hands, with the hydrophobic core serving as the pivot, leads to exposure of hydrophobic sites for target binding. Intriguingly, despite being structurally similar, the response of the two symmetrically arranged EF-hands upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is asymmetric. Breakage of symmetry is needed for efficient allosteric communication between the EF-hands. The key roles that water molecules play in driving allosteric transitions are likely to be general in other metal ion mediated protein allostery.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">sumSTAAR: A flexible framework for gene-based association studies using GWAS summary statistics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadezhda M. Belonogova, Gulnara R. Svishcheva, Anatoly V. Kirichenko, Irina V. Zorkoltseva, Yakov A. Tsepilov, Tatiana I. Axenovich</p>

Gene-based association analysis is an effective gene-mapping tool. Many gene-based methods have been proposed recently. However, their power depends on the underlying genetic architecture, which is rarely known in complex traits, and so it is likely that a combination of such methods could serve as a universal approach. Several frameworks combining different gene-based methods have been developed. However, they all imply a fixed set of methods, weights and functional annotations. Moreover, most of them use individual phenotypes and genotypes as input data. Here, we introduce sumSTAAR, a framework for gene-based association analysis using summary statistics obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It is an extended and modified version of STAAR framework proposed by Li and colleagues in 2020. The sumSTAAR framework offers a wider range of gene-based methods to combine. It allows the user to arbitrarily define a set of these methods, weighting functions and probabilities of genetic variants being causal. The methods used in the framework were adapted to analyse genes with large number of SNPs to decrease the running time. The framework includes the polygene pruning procedure to guard against the influence of the strong GWAS signals outside the gene. We also present new improved matrices of correlations between the genotypes of variants within genes. These matrices estimated on a sample of 265,000 individuals are a state-of-the-art replacement of widely used matrices based on the 1000 Genomes Project data.

                <p>by Cosimo Lupo, Natanael Spisak, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Thierry Mora</p>

Affinity maturation is crucial for improving the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens. This process is mainly driven by point substitutions caused by somatic hypermutations of the immunoglobulin gene. It also includes deletions and insertions of genomic material known as indels. While the landscape of point substitutions has been extensively studied, a detailed statistical description of indels is still lacking. Here we present a probabilistic inference tool to learn the statistics of indels from repertoire sequencing data, which overcomes the pitfalls and biases of standard annotation methods. The model includes antibody-specific maturation ages to account for variable mutational loads in the repertoire. After validation on synthetic data, we applied our tool to a large dataset of human immunoglobulin heavy chains. The inferred model allows us to identify universal statistical features of indels in heavy chains. We report distinct insertion and deletion hotspots, and show that the distribution of lengths of indels follows a geometric distribution, which puts constraints on future mechanistic models of the hypermutation process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pulmonary drug delivery and retention: A computational study to identify plausible parameters based on a coupled airway-mucus flow model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aranyak Chakravarty, Mahesh V. Panchagnula, Alladi Mohan, Neelesh A. Patankar</p>

Pulmonary drug delivery systems rely on inhalation of drug-laden aerosols produced from aerosol generators such as inhalers, nebulizers etc. On deposition, the drug molecules diffuse in the mucus layer and are also subjected to mucociliary advection which transports the drugs away from the initial deposition site. The availability of the drug at a particular region of the lung is, thus, determined by a balance between these two phenomena. A mathematical analysis of drug deposition and retention in the lungs is developed through a coupled mathematical model of aerosol transport in air as well as drug molecule transport in the mucus layer. The mathematical model is solved computationally to identify suitable conditions for the transport of drug-laden aerosols to the deep lungs. This study identifies the conditions conducive for delivering drugs to the deep lungs which is crucial for achieving systemic drug delivery. The effect of different parameters on drug retention is also characterized for various regions of the lungs, which is important in determining the availability of the inhaled drugs at a target location. Our analysis confirms that drug delivery efficacy remains highest for aerosols in the size range of 1-5 <i>μ</i>m. Moreover, it is observed that amount of drugs deposited in the deep lung increases by a factor of 2 when the breathing time period is doubled, with respect to normal breathing, suggesting breath control as a means to increase the efficacy of drug delivery to the deep lung. A higher efficacy also reduces the drug load required to be inhaled to produce the same health effects and hence, can help in minimizing the side effects of a drug.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">fingeRNAt—A novel tool for high-throughput analysis of nucleic acid-ligand interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natalia A. Szulc, Zuzanna Mackiewicz, Janusz M. Bujnicki, Filip Stefaniak</p>

Computational methods play a pivotal role in drug discovery and are widely applied in virtual screening, structure optimization, and compound activity profiling. Over the last decades, almost all the attention in medicinal chemistry has been directed to protein-ligand binding, and computational tools have been created with this target in mind. With novel discoveries of functional RNAs and their possible applications, RNAs have gained considerable attention as potential drug targets. However, the availability of bioinformatics tools for nucleic acids is limited. Here, we introduce fingeRNAt—a software tool for detecting non-covalent interactions formed in complexes of nucleic acids with ligands. The program detects nine types of interactions: (i) hydrogen and (ii) halogen bonds, (iii) cation-anion, (iv) pi-cation, (v) pi-anion, (vi) pi-stacking, (vii) inorganic ion-mediated, (viii) water-mediated, and (ix) lipophilic interactions. However, the scope of detected interactions can be easily expanded using a simple plugin system. In addition, detected interactions can be visualized using the associated PyMOL plugin, which facilitates the analysis of medium-throughput molecular complexes. Interactions are also encoded and stored as a bioinformatics-friendly Structural Interaction Fingerprint (SIFt)—a binary string where the respective bit in the fingerprint is set to 1 if a particular interaction is present and to 0 otherwise. This output format, in turn, enables high-throughput analysis of interaction data using data analysis techniques. We present applications of fingeRNAt-generated interaction fingerprints for visual and computational analysis of RNA-ligand complexes, including analysis of interactions formed in experimentally determined RNA-small molecule ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank. We propose interaction fingerprint-based similarity as an alternative measure to RMSD to recapitulate complexes with similar interactions but different folding. We present an application of interaction fingerprints for the clustering of molecular complexes. This approach can be used to group ligands that form similar binding networks and thus have similar biological properties. The fingeRNAt software is freely available at https://github.com/n-szulc/fingeRNAt.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Priority-based transformations of stimulus representation in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quan Wan, Jorge A. Menendez, Bradley R. Postle</p>

How does the brain prioritize among the contents of working memory (WM) to appropriately guide behavior? Previous work, employing inverted encoding modeling (IEM) of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, has shown that unprioritized memory items (UMI) are actively represented in the brain, but in a “flipped”, or opposite, format compared to prioritized memory items (PMI). To acquire independent evidence for such a priority-based representational transformation, and to explore underlying mechanisms, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to perform a 2-back WM task. Visualization of LSTM hidden layer activity using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) confirmed that stimulus representations undergo a representational transformation–consistent with a flip—while transitioning from the functional status of UMI to PMI. Demixed (d)PCA of the same data identified two representational trajectories, one each within a UMI subspace and a PMI subspace, both undergoing a reversal of stimulus coding axes. dPCA of data from an EEG dataset also provided evidence for priority-based transformations of the representational code, albeit with some differences. This type of transformation could allow for retention of unprioritized information in WM while preventing it from interfering with concurrent behavior. The results from this initial exploration suggest that the algorithmic details of how this transformation is carried out by RNNs, versus by the human brain, may differ.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A new test suggests hundreds of amino acid polymorphisms in humans are subject to balancing selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vivak Soni, Michiel Vos, Adam Eyre-Walker</p>

The role that balancing selection plays in the maintenance of genetic diversity remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a new test, based on the McDonald–Kreitman test, in which the number of polymorphisms that are shared between populations is contrasted to those that are private at selected and neutral sites. We show that this simple test is robust to a variety of demographic changes, and that it can also give a direct estimate of the number of shared polymorphisms that are directly maintained by balancing selection. We apply our method to population genomic data from humans and provide some evidence that hundreds of nonsynonymous polymorphisms are subject to balancing selection.

     alt="Parcellation of the murine cortical hindlimb area is demonstrated by its subcortical connectivity and cytoarchitecture"/>
<p>We investigated fiber distribution patterns of corticospinal neurons within the cortical area projecting to the lumbar cord gray matter of mice. The lumbar-cord-projecting area fundamentally innervates the gray matter in the same way as the cervical-cord-projecting area does.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although corticospinal neurons are known to be distributed in both the primary motor and somatosensory cortices (S1), details of the projection pattern of their fibers to the lumbar cord gray matter remain largely uncharacterized, especially in rodents. We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB. These findings suggest that the L4 Cx is parceled into subregions defined by the cytoarchitecture and subcortical projection.</p>

<p>By using a genetically modified mouse model and viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of a subpopulation of neurons in the anterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus, molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup>). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons form connections with several nuclei throughout the brain axis, with the strongest concerning hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation and forebrain areas associated with reward and stress processing. Furthermore, guided by the transcriptional signatures of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons, we combined retrograde labeling with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization and we identified that they receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) is a structure highly interconnected with several nuclei ranging from forebrain to hypothalamus and brainstem. Numerous rodent studies have examined afferent and efferent connections of the PVT and their contribution to behavior, revealing its important role in the integration of arousal cues. However, the majority of these studies used a region-oriented approach, without considering the neuronal subtype diversity of the nucleus. In the present study, we provide the anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of a subpopulation of PVT neurons molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck). Combining a genetically modified mouse model with viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of Gck-positive neurons of the anterior PVT (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup>). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons innervate several nuclei throughout the brain axis. The strongest connections are with forebrain areas associated with reward and stress and with hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the Gck-expressing neurons revealed that they are enriched in receptors for hypothalamic-derived neuropeptides, adhesion molecules, and obesity and diabetes susceptibility transcription factors. Using retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we identify that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations, including arginine-vasopressin-, melanin-concentrating hormone-, orexin-, and proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons. This detailed anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons provides a basis for functional studies of the integration of homeostatic and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, and for deciphering the potential role of these neurons in obesity and diabetes development.</p>

<p>Gaze stabilization reflexes such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the optokinetic reflex (OKR) share some neuronal circuitry and interact in oculomotor adaptation phenomena. The presence of androgen receptors (Ars) in the cerebellar–vestibular network that mediates the adaptive modification of the VOR makes the VOR an excellent model to study the impact of androgens on cerebellar-dependent learning. In young male rats, the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (FLUT) acutely impairs the capability of VOR to encode gain-increase and gain-decrease adaptation without influencing basal VOR and OKR. Such findings imply that the androgenic neuronal pathway activation participates in the VOR adaptation phenomenon probably via nonclassical mechanisms of regulation. We suggested that androgens, possibly testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by binding Ars may rapidly regulate cerebellar and extracerebellar plastic sites responsible for VOR adaptation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebellar-dependent learning is essential for the adaptation of motor and no motor behaviors to changing contexts, and neuroactive steroids—mainly referred to as estrogens—may regulate this process. However, the role of androgens in this process has not been established, although they may affect cerebellar physiology. Thus, this study aims to determine whether the activation of androgenic neural pathways may take part in controlling the vestibuloocular (VOR) and optokinetic reflexes (OKR), which depend on a defined cerebellar circuitry. To answer this question, we acutely blocked the activation of androgen receptors (Ars) using systemic administration of the Ars antagonist flutamide (FLUT; 20 mg/Kg) in peripubertal male rats. Then, we evaluated the FLUT effect on general oculomotor performance in the VOR and OKR as well as VOR adaptive gain increases and decreases. We used a paradigm causing fast VOR adaptation that combined in phase/out phase visuo-vestibular stimulations. We found that FLUT impaired the gain increase and decrease in VOR adaptation. However, FLUT altered neither acute nor overtime basal ocular-motor performance in the VOR or OKR. These findings indicate that the activation of androgenic neural pathways participates in phenomena leading to fast VOR adaptation, probably through the modulation of plasticity mechanisms that underlie adaptation of this reflex. Conversely, androgens may not be essential for neural information processing demands in basal ocular-motor reflexes. Moreover, our results suggest that androgens, possibly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, could rapidly regulate motor memory encoding in the VOR adaptation, acting at both cerebellar and extracerebellar plasticity sites.</p>

<p>Expression and significance of secretagogin (scgn) in the brain of catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Three scgn transcript variants were found in the brain of <i>C. batrachus</i>. Two of these transcript variants predicted to encode a putative 272 aa protein, comparable to that found in teleosts and fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Cells expressing scgn showed wide distribution in the brain and pituitary. None of the hypophysiotropic dopamine neurons but a great majority of the isotocin and vasotocin neurons coexpressed scgn. Distinct scgn neurons/fibers were observed in the entopeduncular nucleus (EN, arrow) in the ventral telencephalon. Intracranial insulin enhanced scgn expression in EN neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), is a novel hexa EF-hand, phylogenetically conserved calcium-binding protein. It serves as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and neuroendocrine regulation in mammals. However, its relevance in the brain of non-mammalian vertebrates has largely remained unexplored. To address this issue, we studied the cDNA encoding scgn, <i>scgn</i> mRNA expression, and distribution of scgn-equipped elements in the brain and pituitary of a teleost, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (<i>cb</i>). The <i>cbscgn</i> cDNA consists of three transcripts (T) variants: T1 (2185 bp), T2 (2151 bp) and T3 (2060 bp). While 816 bp ORF in T1 and T2 encodes highly conserved six EF-hand 272 aa protein fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, 726-bp ORF in T3 encodes 242 aa protein. The T1 showed &gt;90% and &gt;70% identity with scgn of catfishes, and other teleosts and mammals, respectively. The T1-mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and pituitary, while the expression of T3 was restricted to the telencephalon. Application of the anti-scgn antiserum revealed a ∼32 kDa scgn-immunoreactive (scgn-i) band (known molecular weight of scgn) in the forebrain tissue, and immunohistochemically labeled neurons in the olfactory epithelium and bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hindbrain. In the pituitary, scgn-i cells were seen in the pars distalis and intermedia. Insulin is reported to regulate <i>scgn</i> mRNA in the mammalian hippocampus, and feeding-related neuropeptides in the telencephalon of teleost. Intracranial injection of insulin significantly increased T1-mRNA expression and scgn-immunoreactivity in the telencephalon. We suggest that scgn may be an important player in the regulation of olfactory, neuroendocrine system, and energy balance functions in <i>C. batrachus</i>.</p>

<p>The expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) in the zebra finch brain showing unique differential expressions in subdivisions of the forebrain and the song nuclei. The white color represents mRNA signal.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission and cell signaling, which contribute to learning, memory, and the execution of motor skills. Birdsong is a complex learned motor skill in songbirds. Although the existence of 15 nAChR subunits has been predicted in the avian genome, their expression patterns and potential contributions to song learning and production have not been comprehensively investigated. Here, we cloned all the 15 nAChR subunits (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) from the zebra finch brain and investigated the mRNA expression patterns in the neural pathways responsible for the learning and production of birdsong during a critical period of song learning. Although there were no detectable hybridization signals for ChrnA1, A6, A9, and A10, the other 11 nAChR subunits were uniquely expressed in one or more major subdivisions in the song nuclei of the songbird brain. Of these 11 subunits, ChrnA3–5, A7, and B2 were differentially regulated in the song nuclei compared with the surrounding anatomically related regions. ChrnA5 was upregulated during the critical period of song learning in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed ChrnA7 and B2 to be the major subunits expressed in neurons of the vocal motor nuclei HVC and robust nucleus of the arcopallium, indicating the potential existence of ChrnA7-homomeric and ChrnB2-heteromeric nAChRs in limited cell populations. These results suggest that relatively limited types of nAChR subunits provide functional contributions to song learning and production in songbirds.</p>

<p>Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad) is a regulator of dendritic spine density. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. <i>Acad</i> was substantially expressed in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus of intact brains. Cerebral ischemia dramatically upregulated <i>Acad</i> expression, mainly in the limbic and paralimbic regions. The upregulation of <i>Acad</i> depended on neuronal activation following cerebral ischemia. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms underlying neuronal plasticity after brain ischemia.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structural plasticity of dendritic spines serves as the adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system to various stimuli. Among these stimuli, cerebral ischemia induces dynamic alterations in neuronal network activity. Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad), a regulator of dendritic spine density, is strongly induced by activating stimuli to the neurons. However, the detailed distribution of Acad in normal and ischemic adult brains remains unclear. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We found that intact adult brains expressed <i>Acad</i> in the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, hippocampal CA3, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. <i>Acad</i> expression was dramatically upregulated in the piriform cortex, olfactory area, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, amygdala, and septohippocampal nucleus 4 h after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induced widespread neuronal activation, which was required for <i>Acad</i> upregulation. Our data suggested the involvement of Acad in the adaptive plasticity and remodeling of the neuronal network in the limbic and paralimbic systems.</p>

     alt="Brain-wide mapping of inputs to the mouse lateral posterior (LP/Pulvinar) thalamus–anterior cingulate cortex network"/>
<p>We perform projection-specific monosynaptic mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP and ACC network in mice and show that the LP-ACC network integrates information from regions which parallel that of the primate pulvinar-prefrontal network. LP→ACC and ACC→LP neurons share common sources of inputs from regions involved in orienting and sensorimotor control. Inputs to the ACC→LP projection may serve to provide spatial context or visuomotor instructions, while the bottom-up LP→ACC circuit integrates multisensory information and could serve as a route for SC feedback to frontal cortex. Our study serves as a primer for future circuit-level examination of LP-ACC interactions and inputs integrated by this circuit.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent homolog of the primate pulvinar, the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus, is extensively interconnected with multiple cortical areas. While these cortical interactions can span the entire LP, subdivisions of the LP are characterized by differential connections with specific cortical regions. In particular, the medial LP has reciprocal connections with frontoparietal cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC plays an integral role in top-down sensory processing and attentional regulation, likely exerting some of these functions via the LP. However, little is known about how ACC and LP interact, and about the information potentially integrated in this reciprocal network. Here, we address this gap by employing a projection-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to delineate brain-wide inputs to bottom-up LP→ACC and top-down ACC→LP neurons. We find that LP→ACC neurons receive inputs from widespread cortical regions, including primary and higher order sensory and motor cortical areas. LP→ACC neurons also receive extensive subcortical inputs, particularly from the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Sensory inputs to ACC→LP neurons largely arise from visual cortical areas. In addition, ACC→LP neurons integrate cross-hemispheric prefrontal cortex inputs as well as inputs from higher order medial cortex. Our brain-wide anatomical mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP-ACC pathways provides a roadmap for understanding how LP and ACC communicate different sources of information to mediate attentional control and visuomotor functions.</p>

     alt="Estrogen receptors observed at extranuclear neuronal sites and in glia in the nucleus accumbens core and shell of the female rat: Evidence for localization to catecholaminergic and GABAergic neurons"/>
<p>This study used electron microscopy to examine the distribution ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core and shell. These receptors are localized, almost exclusively, to extranuclear sites in the NAc. They are observed in all neuronal profiles and in glia, but are most prevalent in presynaptic profiles. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic neurons, and a larger proportion are localized to GABAergic neurons. These results provide a mechanism for the rapid effects of estrogens on dopaminergic transmission in the NAc.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens affect dopamine-dependent diseases/behavior and have rapid effects on dopamine release and receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Low levels of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ are seen in the NAc, which cannot account for the rapid effects of estrogens in this region. G-protein coupled ER 1 (GPER1) is observed at low levels in the NAc shell, which also likely does not account for the array of estrogens’ effects in this region. Prior studies demonstrated membrane-associated ERs in the dorsal striatum; these experiments extend those findings to the NAc core and shell. Single- and dual-immunolabeling electron microscopy determined whether ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are at extranuclear sites in the NAc core and shell and whether ERα and GPER1 were localized to catecholaminergic or γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons. All three ERs are observed, almost exclusively, at extranuclear sites in the NAc, and similarly distributed in the core and shell. ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are primarily in axons and axon terminals suggesting that estrogens affect transmission in the NAc via presynaptic mechanisms. About 10% of these receptors are found on glia. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic terminals, suggesting that binding at these ERs alters release of catecholamines, including dopamine. A larger proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to GABAergic dendrites and terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter GABAergic transmission to indirectly affect dopamine transmission in the NAc. Thus, the localization of ERs could account for the rapid effects of estrogen in the NAc.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied changes in the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [Cb] and parvalbumin [Pv]) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of four capuchin monkeys with laser-induced retinal lesions. The lesions were generated with the aid of a neodymium-YAG dual-frequency laser with shots of different intensity and at different survival time in each animal. The expression of these proteins in the layers of the dLGN was evaluated by performing histodensitometry of coronal sections throughout the nucleus. High-power laser shots administered at the border of the optic disc (OD)-injured fibers resulted in large scotomas. These lesions produced a devastating effect on fibers in this passage, resulting in large deafferentation of the dLGN. The time course of plasticity expressed in this nucleus varied with the degree of the retinal lesion. Topographically, corresponding portions of the dLGN were inferred by the extent of the ocular dominance column revealed by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry in flattened preparations of V1. In the region representing the retinal lesion, the expression of GFAP, GAP43, Pv, and Cb increased and decreased in the corresponding dLGN layers shortly after lesion induction and returned to their original values with different time courses. Synaptogenesis (indicated by GAP43 expression) appeared to be increased in all layers, while “cleansing” of the glial-damaged region (indicated by GFAP expression) was markedly greater in the parvocellular layers, followed by the magnocellular layers.</p>

                Endophenotypes are heritable and quantifiable traits indexing genetic liability for a disorder. Here, we examined three potential endophenotypes, working memory function, response inhibition and reaction time variability, for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) measured as a dimensional latent trait in a large general population sample derived from the Adolescent Brain and Cognition Developmental study. The genetic risk for ADHD was estimated using polygenic risk scores (PRS) whereas ADHD traits were quantified as a dimensional continuum using Bartlett factor score estimates, derived from Attention Problems items from the Child Behaviour Checklist and Effortful Control items from the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised. The three candidate cognitive endophenotypes were quantified using task-based performance measures. Higher ADHD PRSs were associated with higher ADHD traits, as well as poorer working memory performance and increased reaction time variability. Lower working memory performance, poorer response inhibition, and increased reaction time variability were associated with more pronounced ADHD traits. Working memory and reaction time variability partially statistically mediated the relationship between ADHD PRS and ADHD traits, explaining 14% and 16% of the association, respectively. The mediation effect was specific to the genetic risk for ADHD and did not generalise to genetic risk for four other major psychiatric disorders. Together, these findings provide robust evidence from a large general population sample that working memory and reaction time variability can be considered endophenotypes for ADHD that mediate the relationship between ADHD PRS and ADHD traits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of neonatal brain functional centrality and alterations associated with preterm birth</a></h4>

              
                Formation of the functional connectome in early life underpins future learning and behaviour. However, our understanding of how the functional organisation of brain regions into interconnected hubs (centrality) matures in the early postnatal period is limited, especially in response to factors associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as preterm birth. We characterised voxel-wise functional centrality (weighted degree) in 366 neonates from the Developing Human Connectome Project. We tested the hypothesis that functional centrality matures with age at scan in term-born babies and is disrupted by preterm birth. Finally, we asked whether neonatal functional centrality predicts general neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. We report an age-related increase in functional centrality predominantly within visual regions and decrease within motor and auditory regions in term-born infants. Preterm-born infants scanned at term equivalent age had higher functional centrality predominantly within visual regions and lower measures in motor regions. Functional centrality was not related to outcome at 18 months old. Thus, preterm birth appears to affect functional centrality in regions undergoing substantial development during the perinatal period. Our work raises the question of whether these alterations are adaptive or disruptive, and whether they predict neurodevelopmental characteristics that are more subtle or emerge later in life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ankyrin-B is lipid-modified by S-palmitoylation to promote dendritic membrane scaffolding of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2 in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal ankyrin-B is an intracellular scaffolding protein that plays multiple roles in the axon. By contrast, relatively little is known about the function of ankyrin-B in dendrites, where ankyrin-B is also localized in mature neurons. Recently, we showed that ankyrin-B acts as a scaffold for the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.2, in dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons. How ankyrin-B is itself targeted to the dendritic membrane is not well understood. Here, we report that ankyrin-B is lipid-modified by S-palmitoylation to promote dendritic localization of Nav1.2. We identify the palmitoyl acyl transferase zDHHC17 as a key mediator of ankyrin-B palmitoylation in heterologous cells and in neurons. Additionally, we find that zDHHC17 regulates ankyrin-B protein levels independently of its S-acylation function through a conserved binding mechanism between the ANK repeat domain of zDHHC17 and the zDHHC ankyrin-repeat binding motif of ankyrin-B. We subsequently identify five cysteines in the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain of ankyrin-B that are necessary for ankyrin-B palmitoylation. Mutation of these five cysteines to alanines not only abolishes ankyrin-B palmitoylation, but also prevents ankyrin-B from scaffolding Nav1.2 at dendritic membranes of neurons due to ankyrin-B's inability to localize properly at dendrites. Thus, we show palmitoylation is critical for localization and function of ankyrin-B at dendrites. Strikingly, loss of ankyrin-B palmitoylation does not affect ankyrin-B-mediated axonal cargo transport of synaptic vesicle synaptotagmin-1 in neurons. This is the first demonstration of S-palmitoylation of ankyrin-B as an underlying mechanism required for ankyrin-B localization and function in scaffolding Nav1.2 at dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Association of Striatal Connectivity Gradients to Functional Domains Across Psychiatric Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To uncover transdiagnostic domains of functioning across stress- and neurodevelopmental disorders, and to map these on to the topographic functional organization of cortico-striatal circuitry. Methods: In a clinical sample (n=186) of subjects with high rates of comorbidity of major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and/or autism spectrum disorder, we use exploratory factor analysis on a wide range of clinical questionnaires to identify consistent functional domains of symptomatology across disorders, then replicate these functional domains in an independent dataset (n=188). Then, we use canonical correlation analysis link these functional domains to the topographic organization of the striatum as represented by connectopic maps. Results: We reveal four functional domains that transcend current diagnostic categories relating to negative valence, cognition, social functioning and inhibition/arousal. These functional domains are replicated in an independent sample and are associated with the fine-grained topographical organization of functional connectivity in the striatum (out of sample r=0.20, p=0.026), a central hub in motor, cognitive, affective and reward-related brain circuits. Conclusions and relevance: Functional domains across stress- and neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with the functional organization of the striatum. We propose that investigating psychiatric symptoms across disorders is a promising path to linking them to underlying biology, and can help bridge the gap between neuroscience and clinical psychiatry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scalable graph analysis tools for the connectomics community</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscientists now have the opportunity to analyze synaptic resolution connectomes that are larger than the memory on single consumer workstations. As dataset size and tissue diversity have grown, there is increasing interest in conducting comparative connectomics research, including rapidly querying and searching for recurring patterns of connectivity across brain regions and species. There is also a demand for algorithm reuse --- applying methods developed for one dataset to another volume. A key technological hurdle is enabling researchers to efficiently and effectively query these diverse datasets, especially as the raw image volumes grow beyond terabyte sizes. Existing community tools can perform such queries and analysis on smaller scale datasets, which can fit locally in memory, but the path to scaling remains unclear. Existing solutions such as neuPrint or FlyBrainLab enable these queries for specific datasets, but there remains a need to generalize algorithms and standards across datasets. To overcome this challenge, we present a software framework for comparative connectomics and graph discovery to make connectomes easy to analyze, even when larger-than-RAM, and even when stored in disparate datastores. This software suite includes visualization tools, a web portal, a connectivity and annotation query engine, and the ability to interface with a variety of data sources and community tools from the neuroscience community. These tools include MossDB (an immutable datastore for metadata and rich annotations); Grand (for prototyping larger-than-RAM graphs); GrandIso-Cloud (for querying existing graphs that exceed the capabilities of a single workstation); and Motif Studio (for enabling the public to query across connectomes). These tools interface with existing frameworks such as neuPrint, graph databases such as Neo4j, and standard data analysis tools such as Pandas or NetworkX. Together, these tools enable tool and algorithm reuse, standardization, and neuroscience discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectome-based predictive modeling of cognitive reserve using task-based functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive reserve supports cognitive function in the presence of pathology or atrophy. Functional neuroimaging may enable direct and accurate measurement of cognitive reserve which could have considerable clinical potential. The present study aimed to develop and validate a measure of cognitive reserve using task-based fMRI data that could then be applied to independent resting-state data. Connectome-based predictive modeling with leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to predict a residual measure of cognitive reserve using task-based functional connectivity from the Cognitive Reserve/Reference Ability Neural Network studies (n = 220, mean age = 51.91 years, SD = 17.04 years). Three network-strength predicted cognitive reserve measures were generated that accurately predicted the residual measures of unseen participants. The theoretical validity of these measures was established via a positive correlation with a socio-behavioural proxy of cognitive reserve (verbal intelligence) and a positive correlation with global cognition, independent of brain structure. This fitted model was then applied to external test data: resting-state functional connectivity data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA, n = 294, mean age = 68.3 years, SD = 7.18 years). The network-strength predicted measures were not positively associated with a residual measure of cognitive reserve nor with measures of verbal intelligence and global cognition. The present study demonstrated that task-based functional connectivity data can be used to generate theoretically valid measures of cognitive reserve. Further work is needed to establish if, and how, measures of cognitive reserve derived from task-based functional connectivity can be applied to independent resting-state data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontal cortex melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4R) mediate food intake behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) activity in the hypothalamus is crucial for regulation of metabolism and food intake. The peptide ligands for the MC4R are associated with feeding, energy expenditure, and also with complex behaviors that orchestrate energy intake and expenditure, but the downstream neuroanatomical and neurochemical targets associated with these behaviors are elusive. In addition to strong expression in the hypothalamus, the MC4R is highly expressed in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in executive function and decision-making. Methods: Using viral techniques in genetically modified mice combined with molecular techniques, we identify and describe the neuronal dynamics, and define the effects on feeding behavior of a novel population of MC4R expressing neurons in the infralimbic region of the cortex. Results: Here, we describe a novel population of MC4R-expressing neurons in the infralimbic (IL) region of the mouse prefrontal cortex that are glutamatergic, receive input from melanocortinergic neurons of the arcuate hypothalamus, and project to multiple regions that coordinate appetitive responses to food-related stimuli. The neurons are depolarized by application of MC4R-specific peptidergic agonist, THIQ. Deletion of MC4R from the IL neurons causes increased food intake and body weight gain and impaired executive function in simple food-related behavior tasks. Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that MC4R neurons of the IL play a critical role in the regulation of food intake.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High emotional reactivity is associated with activation of a molecularly distinct hippocampal-amygdala circuit modulated by the glucocorticoid receptor</a></h4>

              
                Emotions are characterized not only by their valence but also by whether they are stable or labile. Yet, we do not understand the molecular or circuit mechanisms that control the dynamic nature of emotionality. We have shown that glucocorticoid receptor overexpression in the forebrain (GRov) leads to a highly reactive mouse with increased anxiety behavior coupled with greater swings in emotional responses. This phenotype is established early in development and persists into adulthood. However, the neural circuitry mediating this lifelong emotional lability remains unknown. In the present study, optogenetic stimulation in ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) of GRov mice led to a greater range and a prolonged duration of anxiety behavior. cFos expression showed that the amplified behavioral response to vDG activation in GRov mice is coupled to increased neuronal activity in specific brain regions. Relative to wild type mice, GRov mice displayed glutamatergic/GABAergic activation imbalance in ventral CA1 (vCA1) and selectively increased glutamatergic activation in the basal posterior amygdaloid complex. Fluorescence in situ hybridization chain reaction studies showed that forebrain GR overexpression led to increased activation of molecularly distinct subpopulations of neurons within the hippocampus and the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA). Increased cFos labeling was observed in the Calbindin 1 (Calbn1+) glutamatergic neurons in vCA1 and in the DARPP-32/Ppp1r1b+ glutamatergic neurons in pBLA. We propose that a molecularly distinct hippocampal-amygdala circuit is shaped by stress early in life and tunes the dynamics of emotional responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Olfactory decoding is positively associated with ad libitum food intake in sated humans</a></h4>

              
                The role of olfaction in eating behavior and body weight regulation is controversial. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test whether central olfactory coding is associated with internal state, food intake, and change in body weight over one year in healthy human adults. Since odor quality and category are coded across distributed neural patterns that are not discernible with traditional univariate analyses, we used multi-voxel pattern analyses to decode patterns of brain activation to food versus nonfood odors. We found that decoding accuracies in the piriform cortex and amygdala were greater in the sated compared to hungry state. Sated decoding accuracies in these and other regions were also associated with post-scan ad libitum food intake, but not with weight change. These findings demonstrate that the fidelity of olfactory decoding is influenced by internal state and is associated with immediate food intake, but not longer-term body weight regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improving classification and reconstruction of imagined images from EEG signals</a></h4>

              
                Decoding brain activity related to specific tasks, such as imagining something, is important for brain computer interface (BCI) control. While decoding of brain signals, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, during observing visual images and while imagining images has been previously reported, further development of methods for improving training, performance, and interpretation of brain data was the goal of this study. We applied a Sinc-EEGNet to decode brain activity during perception and imagination of EEG stimuli, and added an attention module to extract the importance of each electrode or frequency band. We also reconstructed images from brain activity by using a generative adversarial network (GAN). By combining the EEG recorded during a visual task (perception) and imagination task, we have successfully boosted the accuracy of classifying EEG data in the imagination task and improved the quality of reconstruction by GAN. Our result indicates that the brain activity evoked during the visual task is present in the imagination task and can be used for better classification of the imagined image. By using the attention module, we can derive the spatial weights in each frequency band and contrast spatial or frequency importance between tasks from our model. Imagination tasks are classified by low frequency EEG signals over temporal cortex, while perception tasks are classified by high frequency EEG signals over occipital and frontal cortex. Combining data sets in training results in a balanced model improving classification of the imagination task without significantly changing performance in the visual task. Our approach not only improves performance and interpretability but also potentially reduces the burden on training since we can improve the accuracy of classifying a relatively hard task with high variability (imagination) by combining with the data of the relatively easy task, observing visual images.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Color Constant Representations in Early Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The light entering our eyes is the product of the illumination and the surface reflectance of an object. Although this light changes considerably when the illumination changes, we are usually able to perceive objects as stable in color. To investigate how the brain achieves color constancy, we measured BOLD fMRI while 19 participants either observed patches of light that appear colored (yellow, blue) under a spectrally neutral illuminant, or spectrally neutral gray patches that appear colored under simulated blue and yellow illumination conditions. Under bluish illumination, the neutral gray patches appeared yellow; under yellowish illumination, the same gray patches appeared blue. We successfully trained a classifier to discriminate between the blue- and yellow-colored patches in V1-V4. Crucially, we then tested whether this same classifier could also distinguish between the apparent blue and yellow induced by the illuminants. The neural representations for apparent blue and yellow resembled colorimetric blue and yellow in V1, V3 and V4. A control experiment showed that apparent lightness cannot explain these effects. These findings suggest that not only colorimetric, but also apparent color is represented to some degree in retinotopic visual cortex, as early as in V1. Furthermore, a small frontal region, the Rolandic operculum, showed activation for apparent color, possibly playing a role in color constancy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proactive inhibition of goal-directed movements involves explicit changes to movement planning</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition can be implemented reactively, withholding movement in response to a stop-signal, or by proactive changes to movement planning when a stop-signal is expected. Previous studies have typically employed simple button presses, finding proactive delays to movement onset when a stop-signal might appear. Here, we consider inhibition in the context of more complex, goal-directed movements, such as the swing of a bat. Thus, we observe two additional dimensions of movement planning under proactive control, movement duration and end-point error. We found, in addition to onset delay, movements were briefer and arrived later when a stop-signal might appear. This challenges a classical theoretical dichotomy, suggesting proactive inhibition is underlay by both response suppression and delayed facilitation. Moreover, participants were aware of delays to onset and arrival, but reported magnitudes were smaller than observed. This suggests proactive inhibition operates as an explicitly retrievable compensatory strategy whose finer details are implicitly tuned.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large errors increase the generalization of locomotor adaptation depending on the error direction.</a></h4>

              
                Generalization in motor adaptation involves the transfer of movements beyond the adaptation context. We investigated the effect of size (large vs. small) and direction (unidirectional vs. bidirectional) of performance errors during adaptation on the generalization of walking patterns from a split-belt treadmill (training context) to overground (testing context). We hypothesized that unusual errors (i.e., large unidirectional or bidirectional errors) would serve as contextual cues limiting generalization. The size of unidirectional errors was modulated either implicitly (i.e., gradual vs. semi-abrupt split-belt perturbations) or explicitly (i.e., through instructed visual feedback). Bidirectional errors were induced by a sudden removal of the split-perturbation after a long adaptation period, resulting in errors in the opposite direction to those at the start of the adaptation period. Our findings did not support our hypothesis. We found that bidirectional, but not large, performance errors limited generalization across contexts, which could be mediated by two distinct mechanisms. On the one hand, bidirectional errors upon removal of the split-perturbation are also experienced when transitioning to overground walking. Thus, bidirectional errors may facilitate switching between distinct walking patterns, thereby limiting generalization. On the other hand, large unidirectional errors induce more motor adaptation, which might lead to more generalization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Language exposure and brain myelination in early development</a></h4>

              
                The language environment to which children are exposed has an impact on later language and cognitive abilities as well as on brain development; however, it is unclear how early such impacts emerge. This study investigates the effects of children's early language environment and socioeconomic status (SES) on brain structure in infancy at both 6 and 30 months of age. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify concentrations of myelin in specific fiber tracts in the brain. Our central question was whether Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) measures from in-home recording devices and SES measures of maternal education and family income predicted myelin concentrations over development. Results show relationships between amount of in-home adult input and myelination in the white matter tracts most associated with language. Right hemisphere regions also show an association with SES, with older children from a higher SES background who were exposed to more adult input showing greater concentrations of myelin in language-related areas. We discuss these results in relation with the current literature and implications for future language research and intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effect of channel density, inverse solutions and connectivity measures on EEG resting-state networks: a simulation study</a></h4>

              
                Along with the study of brain activity evoked by external stimuli, the past two decades witnessed an increased interest in characterizing the spontaneous brain activity occurring during resting conditions. The identification of the connectivity patterns in this so-called "resting-state" has been the subject of a great number of electrophysiology-based studies, using the Electro/Magneto-Encephalography (EEG/MEG) source connectivity method. However, no consensus has been reached yet regarding a unified (if possible) analysis pipeline, and several involved parameters and methods require cautious tuning. This is particularly challenging when different choices induce significant discrepancy in results and drawn conclusions, thereby hindering reproducibility of neuroimaging research. Hence, our objective in this study was to evaluate some of the parameters related to the EEG source connectivity analysis and shed light on their implications on the accuracy of the resulting networks. We simulated, using neural mass models, EEG data corresponding to two of the resting-state networks (RSNs), namely the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attentional network (DAN). We investigated the impact of five channel densities (19, 32, 64, 128, 256), three inverse solutions (weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE), exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), and linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming) and four functional connectivity measures (phase-locking value (PLV), phase-lag index (PLI), and amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) with and without source leakage correction), on the correspondence between reconstructed and reference networks. We showed that, with different analytical choices, a high variability is present in the results. More specifically, our results show that a higher number of EEG channels significantly increased the accuracy of the reconstructed networks. Additionally, our results showed a significant variability in the performance of the tested inverse solutions and connectivity measures. In our specific simulation context, eLORETA and wMNE combined with AEC computed between orthogonalized time series exhibited the highest performance in terms of similarity between reconstructed and reference connectivity matrices. Results were similar for both DMN and DAN. We believe that this work could be useful for the field of electrophysiology connectomics, by shedding light on the challenge of analytical variability and its consequences on the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Leveraging place field repetition to understand positional versus nonpositional inputs to hippocampal field CA1</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is believed to encode episodic memory by binding information about the content of experience within a spatial framework encoding the location of that experience. Previous work implies a distinction between positional inputs to the hippocampus that provide information about an animal's location and nonpositional inputs which provide information about the content of experience, both sensory and navigational. Here we leverage the phenomenon of "place field repetition" to better understand the functional dissociation between positional and nonpositional inputs to CA1 as rats navigated freely on a novel city-block maze, which combined elements of open-field foraging and linear-track tasks. Unlike typical results in open-field foraging, place fields were directionally tuned on the maze, even though the animal's behavior was not constrained to 1-D trajectories. Repeating fields from the same cell tended to have the same directional preference when the fields were aligned along a linear corridor of the maze, but they showed uncorrelated directional preferences when they were unaligned across different corridors. Lastly, individual fields displayed complex time dynamics which resulted in the population activity changing gradually over the course of minutes. These temporal dynamics were evident across repeating fields of the same cell. These results demonstrate that the positional inputs that drive a cell to fire in similar locations across the maze can be behaviorally and temporally dissociated from the nonpositional inputs that alter the firing rates of the cell within its place fields, thereby increasing the flexibility of the system to encode episodic variables within a stable, spatial framework provided by place cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maternal obesity programs hypothalamic miR-505-5p expression in mouse offspring and impacts hypothalamic fatty acid sensing</a></h4>

              
                In utero exposure to maternal obesity programs a susceptibility to develop obesity. Animal models have shown that offspring obesity is often preceded by increased food intake, however, the mechanisms that mediate these changes are not understood. Using a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity we observed increased intake specifically of a high-fat pellet in adult offspring of obese mothers. Through small RNA sequencing, we identified programmed overexpression of miR-505-5p in the hypothalamus of offspring of obese mothers that is established in the fetus, and confirmed in vitro that fatty acid exposure increases expression of miR-505-5p. Pulsed SILAC analysis demonstrated protein targets of miR-505-5p are enriched in pathways involved in fatty acid metabolism. These include key components of neuronal fatty acid sensing, such as Cpt1a, that are implicated in BMI regulation in human genetic studies. Over-expression of miR-505-5p decreased neuronal fatty acid uptake and metabolism in vitro. Importantly, intra-cerebroventricular injection of a miR-505-5p mimic in mice resulted in increased high-fat pellet intake. Collectively these data suggest that maternal obesity induces over-expression of miR-505-5p in offspring hypothalamus, resulting in altered fatty acid sensing and increased intake of high-fat diet. This represents a novel mechanism by which maternal obesity programs obesity in offspring.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale brain correlates of sweet versus cocaine reward in rats</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine induces many supranormal changes in neuronal activity in the brain, notably in learning- and reward-related regions, in comparison to nondrug rewards - a difference that is thought to contribute to its relatively high addictive potential. However, when facing a choice between cocaine and a nondrug reward (e.g., water sweetened with saccharin), most rats do not choose cocaine, as one would expect from the extent and magnitude of its global activation of the brain, but instead choose the nondrug option. We recently showed that cocaine, though larger in magnitude, is also an inherently more delayed reward than sweet water, thereby explaining why it has less value during choice and why rats opt for the more immediate nondrug option. Here we used a large-scale fos brain mapping approach to measure brain responses to each option in saccharin-preferring rats, with the hope to identify brain regions whose activity may explain the preference for the nondrug option. In total, fos expression was measured in 142 brain levels corresponding to 52 brain subregions and composing 5 brain macrosystems. Overall, our findings confirm in rats with a preference for saccharin that cocaine induces more global brain activation than the preferred nondrug option does. Only very few brain regions were uniquely activated by saccharin. They included regions involved in taste processing (i.e., anterior gustatory cortex) and also regions involved in processing reward delay and intertemporal choice (i.e., some components of the septohippocampal system and its connections with the lateral habenula).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical areas involved in grasping and reaching actions with and without visual information: an ALE meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies</a></h4>

              
                The functional specialization of the ventral stream in Perception and the dorsal stream in Action is the cornerstone of the leading model proposed by Goodale and Milner in 1982. This model is based on neuropsychological evidence and has been a matter of debate for almost three decades, during which the dual-visual stream hypothesis has received much attention, including support and criticisms. The advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed investigating the brain areas involved in Perception and Action and provided useful data on the functional specialization of the two streams. Research on this topic has been quite prolific, yet very little attempt has been made so far to identify consistent neuroimaging results across the available literature. In particular, no meta-analysis has explored the spatial convergence in the involvement of the two streams in Action. The present meta-analysis (N=53) was designed to reveal the specific neural activations associated with Action (i.e., grasping and reaching movements), and the extent to which visual information affects the involvement of the two streams during motor control. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the consistent and spatially convergent neural correlates of Action based on neuroimaging studies conducted over the past two decades. We discuss our results in light of the well-established dual-visual stream model and frame these findings in the context of recent discoveries obtained with advanced fMRI methods, such as multivoxel pattern analysis.

	<p>The field of neuroscience has seen significant growth and interest in recent decades. While neuroscience knowledge can benefit laypeople as well as professionals in many different areas, it may be particularly relevant for educators. With the right information, educators can apply neuroscience-based teaching strategies as well as protect themselves and their students against pseudoscientific ideas and products based on them. Despite rapidly growing sources of available information and courses, studies show that educators in many countries have poor knowledge of brain science and tend to endorse education-related neuromyths. Poor English skills and fewer resources (personal, institutional and governmental) may be additional limitations in Latin America. In order to better understand the scenario in Latin America&amp;amp;rsquo;s largest country, we created an anonymous online survey which was answered by 1634 individuals working in education from all five regions of Brazil. Respondents stated whether they agreed with each statement and reported their level of confidence for each answer. Significant differences in performance were observed across regions, between educators living in capital cities versus the outskirts, between those teaching in private versus public schools, and among educators teaching different levels (pre-school up to college/university). We also observed high endorsement of some key neuromyths, even among groups who performed better overall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a detailed analysis of the profile of a large group of educators in Brazil. We discuss our findings in terms of efforts to better understand regional and global limitations and develop methods of addressing these most efficiently.</p>

	<p>The relative benefit of ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for tinnitus treatment remains unclear, especially for patients with lateralized tinnitus. In this study, we compared outcomes after 10 sessions of 1-Hz rTMS at 110% of resting motor threshold over a two-week period. In total, 104 right-handed patients with lateralized subjective tinnitus were randomly divided into four groups according to rTMS treatment: Left (n = 29), Right (n = 23), Bilateral (n = 30), and Sham stimulation (n = 22). Outcomes included estimates of tinnitus severity, psychological state, and psychoacoustic measures. Patients with left- or right-sided tinnitus were similarly distributed across treatment groups. There were no significant changes in outcome measures for the Right or Sham treatment groups. For the Left and Bilateral groups, tinnitus severity was significantly lower after treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The reduction in tinnitus severity was largest for ipsilateral treatment in the Left group. The overall response rate was 56.1% for the Left group, 46.7% for the Bilateral group, 8.3% for the Right group, and 8.3% for the Sham group. For the Left and Bilateral groups, the response rate was larger for patients with left- than right-sided tinnitus. Changes in tinnitus severity were best predicted by changes in anxiety, depression, and the loudness of the tinnitus. The results suggests that rTMS on the left temporoparietal cortex is more effective for patients with left-sided than with right-sided tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Flavonoids are one of the most exciting types of phenolic compounds with a wide range of bioactive benefits. A series of flavone derivatives (F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5) were previously synthesized from substituted O-hydroxy acetophenone and substituted chloro-benzaldehydes. The titled compounds F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5 in the present study were evaluated for their anticholinesterase potential (against AChE and BuChE). The obtained results were then validated through a molecular docking approach. Compound F5 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of AChE (IC50 = 98.42 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.97 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL) followed by compound F4, whereas compound F2 was found to be the most promising inhibitor of BuChE (IC50 = 105.20 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.43 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL) among the tested compounds. The molecular docking analysis revealed a similar trend in the binding affinity of compounds with the targeted enzymes and found them to be capable of forming highly stable complexes with both receptors. The selected compounds were further subjected to in vivo assessment of cognitive function in a scopolamine-induced amnesic animal model, in which almost all compounds F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5 significantly attenuated the amnesic effects as evaluated through Y-Maze Paradigm and novel object discrimination (NOD) tasks, findings that were further supported by ex vivo experimental results. Among (F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5), F5 showed significant anti-amnesic effects in scopolamine-induced amnesic models and ameliorated the memory loss in behavioral model studies as compared to counterparts. In ex vivo study, noteworthy protection from oxidative stress in the brains of scopolamine-induced amnesic mice was also recorded for F5. These findings also confirmed that there were no significant differences among the in vivo and ex vivo results after administration of F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5 (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) or donepezil (2 mg/kg). These synthesized flavonoids could serve as potential candidates for new neuroprotective and nootropic drugs. However, further studies are needed to validate their observed potential in other animal models as well.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to systematically review to find if aerobic exercise compared to no exercise or any other intervention affects brain plasticity among people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Searches were conducted in the Scopus, SciELO, PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. The included studies were randomized control trials (RCTs) written in English comprising individuals with MCI that evaluated the effects of aerobic training on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), brain structures, or brain activity. The quality of trials was evaluated using the PEDro scale for RCTs. Twelve studies with medium to high quality were included, of which five studies focused on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (four articles reported elevation and one article reported no changes in BDNF levels following the aerobic exercise), two studies focused on brain structures (both reported increases in hippocampus volume following the aerobic exercise), and five studies focused on brain activity (four articles reported positive changes, and one article reported no changes in brain activity following the aerobic exercise). Research regarding the effects of aerobic training on brain plasticity in people with MCI is in its infancy. Still, aerobic exercise seems to be a promising therapy in people with MCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Granule Cells Constitute One of the Major Neuronal Subtypes in the Molecular Layer of the Posterior Cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The migration of neurons from their birthplace to their correct destination is one of the most crucial steps in brain development. Incomplete or incorrect migration yields ectopic neurons, which cause neurologic deficits or are negligible at best. However, the granule cells (GCs) in the cerebellar cortex may challenge this traditional view of ectopic neurons. When animals are born, GCs proliferate near the pia mater and then migrate down to the GC layer located deep in the cerebellar cortex. However, some GC-like cells stay in the molecular layer, a layer between the pia mater and GC layer, even in normal adult animals. These cells were named ectopic GCs nearly 50 years ago, but their abundance and functional properties remain unclear. Here, we have examined GCs in the molecular layer (mGCs) with a specific marker for mature GCs and transgenic mice in which GCs are sparsely labeled with a fluorescent protein. Contrary to the previous assumption that mGCs are a minor neuronal population, we have found that mGCs are as prevalent as stellate or basket cells in the posterior cerebellum. They are produced during a similar period as regular GCs (rGCs), and <I>in vivo</I> time-lapse imaging has revealed that mGCs are stably present in the molecular layer. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings have shown that mGCs discharge action potentials similarly to rGCs. Since axonal inputs differ between the molecular layer and GC layer, mGCs might be incorporated in different micro-circuits from rGCs and have a unique functional role in the cerebellum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Learning from the Physical Consequences of Our Actions Improves Motor Memory</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Actions have consequences. Motor learning involves correcting actions that lead to movement errors and remembering these actions for future behavior. In most laboratory situations, movement errors have no physical consequences and simply indicate the progress of learning. Here, we asked how experiencing a physical consequence when making a movement error affects motor learning. Two groups of participants adapted to a new, prism-induced mapping between visual input and motor output while performing a precision walking task. Importantly, one group experienced an unexpected slip perturbation when making foot-placement errors during adaptation. Because of our innate drive for safety, and the fact that balance is fundamental to movement, we hypothesized that this experience would enhance motor memory. Learning generalized to different walking tasks to a greater extent in the group who experienced the adverse physical consequence. This group also showed faster relearning one week later despite exposure to a competing mapping during initial learning, evidence of greater memory consolidation. The group differences in generalization and consolidation occurred although they both experienced similar magnitude foot-placement errors and adapted at similar rates. Our results suggest the brain considers the potential physical consequences of movement error when learning and that balance-threatening consequences serve to enhance this process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Contributions of Mu-Opioid Receptors on Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons to Analgesia Induced by Various Stress Intensities</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The endogenous opioid system plays a crucial role in stress-induced analgesia. Mu-opioid receptors (MORs), one of the major opioid receptors, are expressed widely in subpopulations of cells throughout the CNS. However, the potential roles of MORs expressed in glutamatergic (MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB>) and -aminobutyric acidergic (MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB>) neurons in stress-induced analgesia remain unclear. By examining tail-flick latencies to noxious radiant heat of male mice, here we investigated the contributions of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> and MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> to behavioral analgesia and activities of neurons projecting from periaqueductal gray (PAG) to rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) induced by a range of time courses of forced swim exposure. The moderate but not transitory or prolonged swim exposure induced a MOR-dependent analgesia, although all of these three stresses enhanced &beta;-endorphin release. Selective deletion of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> but not MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> clearly attenuated analgesia and blocked the enhancement of activities of PAG-RVM neurons induced by moderate swim exposure. Under transitory swim exposure, in contrast, selective deletion of MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> elicited an analgesia behavior via strengthening the activities of PAG-RVM neurons. These results indicate that MOR-dependent endogenous opioid signaling participates in nociceptive modulation in a wide range, not limited to moderate, of stress intensities. Endogenous activation of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> exerts analgesia, whereas MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> produces antianalgesia. More importantly, with an increase of stress intensities, the efficiencies of MORs on nociception shifts from balance between MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> and MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> to biasing toward MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB>-mediated processes. Our results point to the cellular dynamic characteristics of MORs expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in pain modulation under various stress intensities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Functional Gradient of the Fusiform Cortex for Chinese Character Recognition</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visual word recognition has been proposed to have a  functional and spatial organization corresponding to hierarchical language-like word forms in the left fusiform gyrus (FG) during visual word recognition in alphabetic languages. However, it is still unclear whether the similar functional gradients of word-like representation exist during Chinese character recognition. In this study, we adopted univariate activation analysis and representational similarity analysis (RSA) methods to investigate the functional organization in the FG for Chinese character recognition using task fMRI data. Native Chinese readers were visually presented with four types of character-like stimuli (i.e., real characters, pseudo-characters, false characters, and stroke combinations). After analysis, we observed a posterior-to-anterior functional gradient in the left FG corresponding to the degree of likeness of stimuli to character. Additionally, distinct subregions of the left FG harbor different orthographic codes. The middle part of the left FG was involved in abstract orthographic processing, while the anterior part of the left FG was involved in lexical orthographic processing (i.e., mapping orthography onto phonology or semantics). Notably, for the right FG, we did not find similar coding pattern for selectivity to character likeness, indicating the asymmetry of the functional hierarchical organization in favor of the left hemisphere. In conclusion, our findings revealed that the left FG presents a posterior-to-anterior gradient functional processing for Chinese character recognition, which expands our understanding of the psychological, neural, and computational theories of word reading.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynein Is Required for Rab7-Dependent Endosome Maturation, Retrograde Dendritic Transport, and Degradation</a></h4>

              
                <p>In all cell types, endocytosed cargo is transported along a set of endosomal compartments, which are linked maturationally from early endosomes (EEs) via late endosomes (LEs) to lysosomes. Lysosomes are critical for degradation of proteins that enter through endocytic as well as autophagic pathways. Rab7 is the master regulator of early-to-late endosome maturation, motility, and fusion with lysosomes. We previously showed that most degradative lysosomes are localized in the soma and in the first 25 &micro;m of the dendrite and that bulk degradation of dendritic membrane proteins occurs in/near the soma. Dendritic late endosomes therefore move retrogradely in a Rab7-dependent manner for fusion with somatic lysosomes. We now used cultured E18 rat hippocampal neurons of both sexes to determine which microtubule motor is responsible for degradative flux of late endosomes. Based on multiple approaches (inhibiting dynein/dynactin itself or inhibiting dynein recruitment to endosomes by expressing the C-terminus of the Rab7 effector, RILP), we now demonstrate that net retrograde flux of late endosomes in dendrites is supported by dynein. Inhibition of dynein also delays maturation of somatic endosomes, as evidenced by excessive accumulation of Rab7. In addition, degradation of dendritic cargos is inhibited. Our results also suggest that GDP-GTP cycling of Rab7 appears necessary not only for endosomal maturation but also for fusion with lysosomes subsequent to arrival in the soma. In conclusion, Rab7-dependent dynein/dynactin recruitment to dendritic endosomes plays multifaceted roles in dendritic endosome maturation as well as retrograde transport of late endosomes to sustain normal degradative flux.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lysosomes are critical for degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins that enter through endocytosis. Lysosomes are also the endpoint of autophagy and thus responsible for protein and organelle homeostasis. Endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction is linked to neurodegeneration and aging. We identify roles in dendrites for two proteins with links to human diseases, Rab7 and dynein. Our previous work identified a process that requires directional retrograde transport in dendrites, namely, efficient degradation of short-lived membrane proteins. Based on multiple approaches, we demonstrate that Rab7-dependent recruitment of dynein motors supports net retrograde transport to lysosomes and is needed for endosome maturation. Our data also suggest that GDP-GTP cycling of Rab7 is required for fusion with lysosomes and degradation, subsequent to arrival in the soma.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a Developmental Switch in Information Transfer between Whisker S1 and S2 Cortex in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The whiskers of rodents are a key sensory organ that provides critical tactile information for animal navigation and object exploration throughout life. Previous work has explored the developmental sensory-driven activation of the primary sensory cortex processing whisker information (wS1), also called barrel cortex. This body of work has shown that the barrel cortex is already activated by sensory stimuli during the first postnatal week. However, it is currently unknown when over the course of development these stimuli begin being processed by higher-order cortical areas, such as secondary whisker somatosensory area (wS2). Here we investigate the developmental engagement of wS2 by whisker stimuli and the emergence of corticocortical communication from wS1 to wS2. Using <I>in vivo</I> wide-field imaging and multielectrode recordings in control and conditional KO mice of either sex with thalamocortical innervation defects, we find that wS1 and wS2 are able to process bottom-up information coming from the thalamus from birth. We also identify that it is only at the end of the first postnatal week that wS1 begins to provide functional excitation into wS2, switching to more inhibitory actions after the second postnatal week. Therefore, we have uncovered a developmental window when information transfer between wS1 and wS2 reaches mature function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At the end of the first postnatal week, the primary whisker somatosensory area starts providing excitatory input to the secondary whisker somatosensory area 2. This excitatory drive weakens during the second postnatal week and switches to inhibition in the adult.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Stimulation Induces Distinct Forms of Sensitization of On-Off Direction-Selective Ganglion Cell Responses in the Dorsal and Ventral Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experience-dependent modulation of neuronal responses is a key attribute in sensory processing. In the mammalian retina, the On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) is well known for its robust direction selectivity. However, how the On-Off DSGC light responsiveness dynamically adjusts to the changing visual environment is underexplored. Here, we report that On-Off DSGCs tuned to posterior motion direction [i.e. posterior DSGCs (pDSGCs)] in mice of both sexes can be transiently sensitized by prior stimuli. Notably, distinct sensitization patterns are found in dorsal and ventral pDSGCs. Although responses of both dorsal and ventral pDSGCs to dark stimuli (Off responses) are sensitized, only dorsal cells show the sensitization of responses to bright stimuli (On responses). Visual stimulation to the dorsal retina potentiates a sustained excitatory input from Off bipolar cells, leading to tonic depolarization of pDSGCs. Such tonic depolarization propagates from the Off to the On dendritic arbor of the pDSGC to sensitize its On response. We also identified a previously overlooked feature of DSGC dendritic architecture that can support dendritic integration between On and Off dendritic layers bypassing the soma. By contrast, ventral pDSGCs lack a sensitized tonic depolarization and thus do not exhibit sensitization of their On responses. Our results highlight a topographic difference in Off bipolar cell inputs underlying divergent sensitization patterns of dorsal and ventral pDSGCs. Moreover, substantial crossovers between dendritic layers of On-Off DSGCs suggest an interactive dendritic algorithm for processing On and Off signals before they reach the soma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual neuronal responses are dynamically influenced by the prior visual experience. This form of plasticity reflects the efficient coding of the naturalistic environment by the visual system. We found that a class of retinal output neurons, On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells, transiently increase their responsiveness after visual stimulation. Cells located in dorsal and ventral retinas exhibit distinct sensitization patterns because of different adaptive properties of Off bipolar cell signaling. A previously overlooked dendritic morphologic feature of the On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell is implicated in the cross talk between On and Off pathways during sensitization. Together, these findings uncover a topographic difference in the adaptive encoding of upper and lower visual fields and the underlying neural mechanism in the dorsal and ventral retinas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Biophysical and Architectural Mechanisms of Subthalamic Theta under Response Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cortico-basal ganglia circuit is needed to suppress prepotent actions and to facilitate controlled behavior. Under conditions of response conflict, the frontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN) exhibit increased spiking and theta band power, which are linked to adaptive regulation of behavioral output. The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these neural signatures of impulse control remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal (STN-globus pallidus externus) network and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence, and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN "conflict detector" units because of an NMDA-dependent supralinear response. Our results provide insights into the biophysical principles and architectural constraints that give rise to STN dynamics during response conflict, and how their disruption can lead to impulsivity and compulsivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subthalamic nucleus exhibits theta band power modulation related to cognitive control over motor actions during conditions of response conflict. However, the mechanisms of such dynamics are not understood. Here we developed a novel biophysically detailed and data-constrained large-scale model of the subthalamopallidal network, and examined the impacts of cellular and network architectural properties that give rise to theta dynamics. Our investigations implicate an important role for NMDA receptors and cortico-subthalamic nucleus topographical connectivities in theta power modulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in the Activity of Basolateral Amygdalar Neurons That Project to the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis and Their Role in Anticipatory Anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal fear and anxiety can manifest as psychiatric disorders. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in sustained responding to, or anticipation of, an aversive event which can be expressed as anticipatory anxiety. The BLA is also active during anticipatory anxiety and sends projections to the BNST. However, little is known about the role for BLA neurons that project to BNST (BLA-BNST) in anticipatory anxiety in rodents. To address this, we tested whether chemogenetic inactivation of the BLA-BNST pathway attenuates sustained conditioned responses produced by anticipation of an aversive stimulus. For comparison, we also assessed BLA-BNST inactivation during social interaction, which is sensitive to unlearned anxiety. We found that BLA-BNST inactivation reduced conditioned sustained freezing and increased social behaviors, but surprisingly, only in males. To determine whether sex differences in BLA-BNST neuronal activity contribute to the differences in behavior, we used <I>in vivo</I> and <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiological approaches. In males, BLA-BNST projection neurons were more active and excitable, which coincided with a smaller after-hyperpolarization current (<I>I</I><SUB>AHP</SUB>) compared with other BLA neurons; whereas in females, BLA-BNST neurons were less excitable and had larger <I>I</I><SUB>AHP</SUB> compared with other BLA neurons. These findings demonstrate that activity of BLA-BNST neurons mediates conditioned anticipatory anxiety-like behavior in males. The lack of a role of BLA-BNST in females in this behavior, possibly because of low excitability of these neurons, also highlights the need for caution when generalizing the role of specific neurocircuits in fear and anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anxiety disorders disproportionately affect women. This hints toward sex differences within anxiety neurocircuitry, yet most of our understanding is derived from male rodents. Furthermore, debilitating anticipation of adverse events is among the most severe anxiety symptoms, but little is known about anticipatory anxiety neurocircuitry. Here we demonstrated that BLA-BNST activity is required for anticipatory anxiety to a prolonged aversive cue, but only in males. Moreover, BLA-BNST neurons are hypoactive and less excitable in females. These results uncover BLA-BNST as a key component of anticipatory anxiety circuitry, and cellular differences may explain the sex-dependent role of this circuit. Uncovering this disparity provides evidence that the assumed basic circuitry of an anxiety behavior might not readily transpose from males to females.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Aged Rats Exhibit Altered Behavior-Induced Oscillatory Activity, Place Cell Firing Rates, and Spatial Information Content in the CA1 Region of the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal gamma and theta oscillations are associated with mnemonic and navigational processes and adapt to changes in the behavioral state of an animal to optimize spatial information processing. It has been shown that locomotor activity modulates gamma and theta frequencies in rats, although how age alters this modulation has not been well studied. Here, we examine gamma and theta local-field potential and place cell activity in the hippocampus CA1 region of young and old male rats as they performed a spatial eye-blink conditioning task across 31 d. Although mean gamma frequency was similar in both groups, gamma frequency increased with running speed at a slower rate in old animals. By contrast, theta frequencies scaled with speed similarly in both groups but were lower across speeds in old animals. Although these frequencies scaled equally well with deceleration and speed, acceleration was less correlated with gamma frequency in both age groups. Additionally, spike phase-locking to gamma, but not theta, was greater in older animals. Finally, aged rats had reduced within-field firing rates but greater spatial information per spike within the field. These data support a strong relationship between locomotor behavior and local-field potential activity and suggest that age significantly affects this relationship. Furthermore, observed changes in CA1 place cell firing rates and information content lend support to the hypothesis that age may result in more general and context-invariant hippocampal representations over more detailed information. These results may explain the observation that older adults tend to recall the gist of an experience rather than the details.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal oscillations and place cell activity are sensitive to sensorimotor input generated from active locomotion, yet studies of aged hippocampal function often do not account for this. By considering locomotion and spatial location, we identify novel age-associated differences in the scaling of oscillatory activity with speed, spike-field coherence, spatial information content, and within-field firing rates of CA1 place cells. These results indicate that age has an impact on the relationship between locomotion and hippocampal oscillatory activity, perhaps indicative of alterations to afferent input. These data also support the hypothesis that aged hippocampal place cells, compared with young, may more often represent more general spatial information. If true, these results may help explain why older humans tend to recall less specific and more gist-like information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human Spindle Variability</a></h4>

              
                <p>In humans, sleep spindles are 10- to 16-Hz oscillations lasting approximately 0.5&ndash;2 s. Spindles, along with cortical slow oscillations, may facilitate memory consolidation by enabling synaptic plasticity. Early recordings of spindles at the scalp found anterior channels had overall slower frequency than central-posterior channels. This robust, topographical finding led to dichotomizing spindles as "slow" versus "fast," modeled as two distinct spindle generators in frontal versus posterior cortex. Using a large dataset of intracranial stereoelectroencephalographic (sEEG) recordings from 20 patients (13 female, 7 male) and 365 bipolar recordings, we show that the difference in spindle frequency between frontal and parietal channels is comparable to the variability in spindle frequency within the course of individual spindles, across different spindles recorded by a given site, and across sites within a given region. Thus, fast and slow spindles only capture average differences that obscure a much larger underlying overlap in frequency. Furthermore, differences in mean frequency are only one of several ways that spindles differ. For example, compared with parietal, frontal spindles are smaller, tend to occur after parietal when both are engaged, and show a larger decrease in frequency within-spindles. However, frontal and parietal spindles are similar in being longer, less variable, and more widespread than occipital, temporal, and Rolandic spindles. These characteristics are accentuated in spindles which are highly phase-locked to posterior hippocampal spindles. We propose that rather than a strict parietal-fast/frontal-slow dichotomy, spindles differ continuously and quasi-independently in multiple dimensions, with variability due about equally to within-spindle, within-region, and between-region factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep spindles are 10- to 16-Hz neural oscillations generated by cortico-thalamic circuits that promote memory consolidation. Spindles are often dichotomized into slow-anterior and fast-posterior categories for cognitive and clinical studies. Here, we show that the anterior-posterior difference in spindle frequency is comparable to that observed between different cycles of individual spindles, between spindles from a given site, or from different sites within a region. Further, we show that spindles vary on other dimensions such as duration, amplitude, spread, primacy and consistency, and that these multiple dimensions vary continuously and largely independently across cortical regions. These findings suggest that multiple continuous variables rather than a strict frequency dichotomy may be more useful biomarkers for memory consolidation or psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>Calcium imaging using GCaMP indicators and miniature microscopes has been used to image cellular populations during long timescales and in different task phases, as well as to determine neuronal circuit topology and organization. Because the hippocampus (HPC) is essential for tasks of memory, spatial navigation, and learning, calcium imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can provide new insight on cell changes over time during these tasks. All reported HPC <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging experiments have been done in mouse. However, rats have many behavioral and physiological experimental advantages over mice. In this paper, we present the first (to our knowledge) <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging from CA1 HPC in freely moving male rats. Using the UCLA Miniscope, we demonstrate that, in rat, hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks. We show that calcium events in these cells are highly correlated with periods of movement, with few calcium events occurring during periods without movement. We additionally show that an extremely large percent of cells recorded during a navigational task are place cells (77.3 &plusmn; 5.0%, surpassing the percent seen during mouse calcium imaging), and that these cells enable accurate decoding of animal position and can be held over days with consistent place fields in a consistent spatial map. A detailed protocol is included, and implications of these advancements on <I>in vivo</I> imaging and place field literature are discussed.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>In vivo</I> calcium imaging in freely moving animals allows the visualization of cellular activity across days. In this paper, we present the first <I>in vivo</I> Ca2+ recording from CA1 hippocampus (HPC) in freely moving rats. We demonstrate that hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks, and that calcium activity corresponds to periods of movement. We show that a high percentage (77.3 &plusmn; 5.0%) of imaged cells are place cells, and that these place cells enable accurate decoding and can be held stably over days with little change in field location. Because the HPC is essential for many tasks involving memory, navigation, and learning, imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can shed new insight on cellular activity changes and organization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for the Normalization Effects of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder on Functional Connectivity in Neonates with Prenatal Opioid Exposure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altered functional connectivity has been reported in infants with prenatal exposure to opioids, which significantly interrupts and influences endogenous neurotransmitter/receptor signaling during fetal programming. Better birth outcomes and long-term developmental outcomes are associated with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during pregnancy, but the neural mechanisms underlying these benefits are largely unknown. We aimed to characterize effects of prenatal opioid/other drug exposure (PODE) and the neural basis for the reported beneficial effects of MOUD by examining neonatal brain functional organization. A cohort of 109 human newborns, 42 PODE, 39 with prenatal exposure to drugs excluding opioids (PDE), 28 drug-free controls (males and females) underwent resting-state fMRI at 2 weeks of age. To examine neural effects of MOUD, PODE infants were separated into subgroups based on whether mothers received MOUD (<I>n</I> = 31) or no treatment (<I>n</I> = 11). A novel heatmap analysis was designed to characterize PODE-associated functional connectivity alterations and MOUD-related effects, and permutation testing identified regions of interest with significant effects. PODE neonates showed alterations beyond those associated with PDE, particularly in reward-related frontal-sensory connectivity. MOUD was associated with a significant reduction of PODE-related alterations in key regions of endogenous opioid pathways including limbic and frontal connections. However, significant residual effects in limbic and subcortical circuitry were observed. These findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with PODE. Importantly, widespread normalization effects associated with MOUD reveal, for the first time, the potential brain basis of the beneficial effects of MOUD on the developing brain and underscore the importance of this treatment intervention for better developmental outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first study to reveal the potential neural mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects on the neonate brain associated with MOUD during pregnancy. We identified both normalization and residual effects of MOUD on brain functional architecture by directly comparing neonates prenatally exposed to opioids with MOUD and those exposed to opioids but without MOUD. Our findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with prenatal opioid exposure and demonstrate that although significant residual effects remain in reward circuitry, MOUD confers significant normalization effects on functional connectivity of regions associated with socioemotional development and reward processing. Together, our results highlight the importance of MOUD intervention for better neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Uncertainty Alternates Top-down and Bottom-up Fronto-Temporal Network Signaling during Response Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response inhibition is a primary executive control function that allows the withholding of inappropriate responses, and requires appropriate perception of the external environment to achieve a behavioral goal. It remains unclear, however, how response inhibition is achieved when goal-relevant information involves perceptual uncertainty. Twenty-six human participants of both sexes performed a go/no-go task where visually presented random-dot motion stimuli involved perceptual uncertainties. The right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) was involved in response inhibition, and the middle temporal (MT) region showed greater activity when dot motions involved less uncertainty. A neocortical temporal region in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) specifically showed greater activity during response inhibition in more perceptually certain trials. In this STS region, activity was greater when response inhibition was successful than when it failed. Directional effective connectivity analysis revealed that, in more coherent trials, the MT and STS regions showed enhanced connectivity to the rIFC, whereas in less coherent trials, the signal direction was reversed. These results suggest that a reversible fronto-temporal functional network guides response inhibition and perceptual decision-making under perceptual uncertainty, and in this network, perceptual information in the MT is converted to control information in the rIFC via STS, enabling achievement of response inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Response inhibition refers to withholding inappropriate behavior and is important for achieving goals. Often, however, decision must be made based on limited environmental evidence. We showed that successful response inhibition is guided by a neocortical temporal region that plays a hub role in converting perceived information coded in a posterior temporal region to control information coded in the PFC. Interestingly, when a perceived stimulus becomes more uncertain, the PFC supplements stimulus encoding in the temporal regions. Our results highlight fronto-temporal mechanisms of response inhibition in which conversion of stimulus-control information is regulated based on the uncertainty of environmental evidence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sound Localization of World and Head-Centered Space in Ferrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>The location of sounds can be described in multiple coordinate systems that are defined relative to ourselves, or the world around us. Evidence from neural recordings in animals point toward the existence of both head-centered and world-centered representations of sound location in the brain; however, it is unclear whether such neural representations have perceptual correlates in the sound localization abilities of nonhuman listeners. Here, we establish novel behavioral tests to determine the coordinate systems in which ferrets can localize sounds. We found that ferrets could learn to discriminate between sound locations that were fixed in either world-centered or head-centered space, across wide variations in sound location in the alternative coordinate system. Using probe sounds to assess broader generalization of spatial hearing, we demonstrated that in both head and world-centered tasks, animals used continuous maps of auditory space to guide behavior. Single trial responses of individual animals were sufficiently informative that we could then model sound localization using speaker position in specific coordinate systems and accurately predict ferrets' actions in held-out data. Our results demonstrate that ferrets, an animal model in which neurons are known to be tuned to sound location in egocentric and allocentric reference frames, can also localize sounds in multiple head and world-centered spaces.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans can describe the location of sounds either relative to themselves, or in the world, independent of their momentary position. These different spaces are also represented in the activity of neurons in animals, but it is not clear whether nonhuman listeners also perceive both head and world-centered sound location. Here, we designed behavioral tasks in which ferrets discriminated between sounds using their position in the world, or relative to the head. Subjects learnt to solve both problems and generalized sound location in each space when presented with infrequent probe sounds. These findings reveal a perceptual correlate of neural sensitivity previously observed in the ferret brain and establish that, like humans, ferrets can access an auditory map of their local environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CREB Inactivation by HDAC1/PP1{gamma} Contributes to Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding the pathogenesis of nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration is critical for developing mechanism-based treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). In the nigral dopaminergic neurons of postmortem human PD brains, we found that CREB, a well-recognized pro-survival transcription factor in neurons, was inactivated by dephosphorylation at Ser133. CREB dephosphorylation correlated with decreased expression of NURR1, one of its target genes crucial for dopaminergic neuron survival, confirming that CREB function was impaired in nigral dopaminergic neurons in PD. An MPTP mouse model was used to further elucidate the mechanism underlying CREB dephosphorylation. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates CREB, was constitutively associated with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC1 promotes CREB Ser133 dephosphorylation via a stable interaction with PP1. We found that CREB interacted with the HDAC1/PP1 complex during dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Importantly, increased CREB/HDAC1 interaction occurred in the nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patients as demonstrated using a proximity ligation assay. Disrupting CREB/HDAC1 interaction via either overexpression of GAL4 M1, a CREB mutant, or administration of trichostatin A, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, restored the expression levels of phospho-CREB (Ser133) and NURR1, and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP-treated mouse brain. Collectively, our results demonstrated that HDAC1/PP1-mediated CREB inactivation contributed to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Disruption of CREB/HDAC1 interaction has the potential to be a new approach for PD therapy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder attributed to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Understanding the pathogenesis of nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration is critical for developing mechanism-based treatments for PD. We found in nigral dopaminergic neurons of postmortem human PD brains that CREB, a well-recognized pro-survival transcription factor in neurons, was inactivated by dephosphorylation at Ser133. HDAC1, constitutively associated with PP1, interacted with CREB to mediate its dephosphorylation during dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Disrupting CREB/HDAC1 interaction restored CREB activity and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP mouse brains. This work suggests that disruption of the CREB/HDAC1 interaction to restore CREB activity may be a potential therapeutic approach in PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Developmental shifts in computations used to detect environmental controllability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hillary A. Raab, Careen Foord, Romain Ligneul, Catherine A. Hartley</p>

Accurate assessment of environmental controllability enables individuals to adaptively adjust their behavior—exploiting rewards when desirable outcomes are contingent upon their actions and minimizing costly deliberation when their actions are inconsequential. However, it remains unclear how estimation of environmental controllability changes from childhood to adulthood. Ninety participants (ages 8–25) completed a task that covertly alternated between controllable and uncontrollable conditions, requiring them to explore different actions to discover the current degree of environmental controllability. We found that while children were able to distinguish controllable and uncontrollable conditions, accuracy of controllability assessments improved with age. Computational modeling revealed that whereas younger participants’ controllability assessments relied on evidence gleaned through random exploration, older participants more effectively recruited their task structure knowledge to make highly informative interventions. Age-related improvements in working memory mediated this qualitative shift toward increased use of an inferential strategy. Collectively, these findings reveal an age-related shift in the cognitive processes engaged to assess environmental controllability. Improved detection of environmental controllability may foster increasingly adaptive behavior over development by revealing when actions can be leveraged for one’s benefit.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Improved transcriptome assembly using a hybrid of long and short reads with StringTie</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alaina Shumate, Brandon Wong, Geo Pertea, Mihaela Pertea</p>

Short-read RNA sequencing and long-read RNA sequencing each have their strengths and weaknesses for transcriptome assembly. While short reads are highly accurate, they are rarely able to span multiple exons. Long-read technology can capture full-length transcripts, but its relatively high error rate often leads to mis-identified splice sites. Here we present a new release of StringTie that performs hybrid-read assembly. By taking advantage of the strengths of both long and short reads, hybrid-read assembly with StringTie is more accurate than long-read only or short-read only assembly, and on some datasets it can more than double the number of correctly assembled transcripts, while obtaining substantially higher precision than the long-read data assembly alone. Here we demonstrate the improved accuracy on simulated data and real data from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Mus musculus</i>, and human. We also show that hybrid-read assembly is more accurate than correcting long reads prior to assembly while also being substantially faster. StringTie is freely available as open source software at https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatial modelling for population replacement of mosquito vectors at continental scale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicholas J. Beeton, Andrew Wilkins, Adrien Ickowicz, Keith R. Hayes, Geoffrey R. Hosack</p>

Malaria is one of the deadliest vector-borne diseases in the world. Researchers are developing new genetic and conventional vector control strategies to attempt to limit its burden. Novel control strategies require detailed safety assessment to ensure responsible and successful deployments. <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu stricto (s.s.) and <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i>, two closely related subspecies within the species complex <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu lato (s.l.), are among the dominant malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. These two subspecies readily hybridise and compete in the wild and are also known to have distinct niches, each with spatially and temporally varying carrying capacities driven by precipitation and land use factors.
We model the spread and persistence of a population-modifying gene drive system in these subspecies across sub-Saharan Africa by simulating introductions of genetically modified mosquitoes across the African mainland and its offshore islands. We explore transmission of the gene drive between the two subspecies that arise from different hybridisation mechanisms, the effects of both local dispersal and potential wind-aided migration to the spread, and the development of resistance to the gene drive. Given the best current available knowledge on the subspecies’ life histories, we find that an introduced gene drive system with typical characteristics can plausibly spread from even distant offshore islands to the African mainland with the aid of wind-driven migration, with resistance beginning to take over within a decade. Our model accounts for regional to continental scale mechanisms, and demonstrates a range of realistic dynamics including the effect of prevailing wind on spread and spatio-temporally varying carrying capacities for subspecies. As a result, it is well-placed to answer future questions relating to mosquito gene drives as important life history parameters become better understood.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Why does viral RNA sometimes persist after recovery from acute infections?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Diane E. Griffin</p>

DNA viruses often persist in the body of their host, becoming latent and recurring many months or years later. By contrast, most RNA viruses cause acute infections that are cleared from the host as they lack the mechanisms to persist. However, it is becoming clear that viral RNA can persist after clinical recovery and elimination of detectable infectious virus. This persistence can either be asymptomatic or associated with late progressive disease or nonspecific lingering symptoms, such as may be the case following infection with Ebola or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Why does viral RNA sometimes persist after recovery from an acute infection? Where does the RNA come from? And what are the consequences?

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RSK1 promotes mammalian axon regeneration by inducing the synthesis of regeneration-related proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susu Mao, Yuanyuan Chen, Wei Feng, Songlin Zhou, Chunyi Jiang, Junjie Zhang, Xiaohong Liu, Tianmei Qian, Kai Liu, Yaxian Wang, Chun Yao, Xiaosong Gu, Bin Yu</p>

In contrast to the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the neurons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) can regenerate their axons. However, the underlying mechanism dictating the regeneration program after PNS injuries remains poorly understood. Combining chemical inhibitor screening with gain- and loss-of-function analyses, we identified p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) as a crucial regulator of axon regeneration in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after sciatic nerve injury (SNI). Mechanistically, RSK1 was found to preferentially regulate the synthesis of regeneration-related proteins using ribosomal profiling. Interestingly, RSK1 expression was up-regulated in injured DRG neurons, but not retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Additionally, RSK1 overexpression enhanced phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion-induced axon regeneration in RGCs in the adult CNS. Our findings reveal a critical mechanism in inducing protein synthesis that promotes axon regeneration and further suggest RSK1 as a possible therapeutic target for neuronal injury repair.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Central retinal artery occlusion following sildenafil intake [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To report a case of central retinal artery occlusion associated with sildenafil intake and briefly discuss its causative pathogenesis. Methods: A 50-year-old man with no premorbidities presented with symptoms of sudden severe visual field constriction in the left eye (LE). Best-corrected visual acuity in the LE was 20/25. Fundus examination and fluorescein angiography of the LE were suggestive of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) with cilioretinal artery sparing. Further investigation revealed that 100 mg of sildenafil had been taken for the first time three hours before the onset of symptoms. Results: The patient was treated promptly with intravenous acetazolamide, sublingual isosorbide dinitrate and ocular massage, but without visual recovery. No other associated systemic or local risk factors were found, and the case was classified as a potential complication of sildenafil. Conclusion: Although no direct link could be established, the aim of this report is to highlight the incidence and to consider this issue when evaluating any case of central retinal artery occlusion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of balance training on pain and functional outcomes in knee osteoarthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a musculoskeletal disorder that causes pain and increasing loss of function, resulting in reduced proprioceptive accuracy and balance. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of balance training on pain and functional outcomes in knee OA. Methods: “PubMed”, “Scopus”, “Web of Science”, “Cochrane”, and “Physiotherapy Evidence Database” were searched for studies conducted between January 2000 and December 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effectiveness of balance training in knee OA, as well as its effects on pain and functional outcome measures, were included. Conference abstracts, case reports, observational studies, and clinical commentaries were not included. Meta-analysis was conducted for the common outcomes, i.e., Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The Timed Up and Go (TUG), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). The PEDro scale was used to determine the quality of the included studies. Results: This review includes 22 RCTs of which 17 articles were included for meta-analysis. The included articles had 1456 participants. The meta-analysis showed improvement in the VAS scores in the experimental group compared to the control group [I2 = 92%; mean difference= -0.79; 95% CI= -1.59 to 0.01; p<0.05] and for the WOMAC scores the heterogeneity (I2) was 81% with a mean difference of -0.02 [95% CI= -0.44 to 0.40; p<0.0001]. The TUG score was analyzed, the I2 was 95% with a mean difference of -1.71 [95% CI= -3.09 to -0.33; p<0.0001] for the intervention against the control group. Conclusions: Balance training significantly reduced knee pain and improved functional outcomes measured with TUG. However, there was no difference observed in WOMAC. Although due to the heterogeneity of the included articles the treatment impact may be overestimated. Registration: The current systematic review was registered in PROSPERO on 7th October 2021 (registration number CRD42021276674).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between dermatoglyphic patterns and growth patterns of subjects with skeletal class I relation: A cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To assess the relationship between dermatoglyphic patterns and various growth patterns of the mandible. Methods: Patients with Class I Skeletal relation were selected after clinical diagnosis followed by digitally tracing the cephalogram. The patients were subdivided into three groups of mandibular divergence patterns ie Average, Horizontal and Vertical. 90 samples ie 30 in each group were selected for the study. The fingerprints of all the selected subjects were then extracted digitally and analysed for the most dominant pattern in each hand. Results: For the left hand, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) association between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern when Horizontal growers were compared to Average and Vertical Growers. For the right hand, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) association between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern when Horizontal growers were compared to Average Growers. A significant association (P<0.05) between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern was also found when average growers were compared to vertical growers. Conclusions: Horizontal growers had 80% frequency of appearance of whorls in their left hand and 67% in their right hand. Horizontal growers could easily be differentiated from the average and vertical growers because of the dominance of whorl pattern in their hands. Composite and arch pattern were more frequent in vertical growers when compared to horizontal and average growers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bone tissue engineering application on fracture healing with bone defect as assessed through osteocalcin and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) biomarker examination: experimental study on murine models [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Bone is naturally regenerable, with a high ability to repair itself. In massive segmental bone defect, bone cannot be repaired independently. Therefore, it is necessary to give a bone graft to promote the healing process. To date, autografts are the gold standard for bone grafts. However, some of the reported complications reported have led to auto-bone transplants being often disregarded. Both autografts or allografts also have some issues. Therefore, in an effort to develop alternative treatments for correcting bone defects and their consequences, bone tissue engineering (BTE) has gained popularity and is nowadays being researched as a potential alternative in bone defect management. There are three fundamental components in BTE combined: biomaterials (scaffolds), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and growth factors. The combination of these components is believed to help the healing process of bone defects.  Methods: This work was an animal study involving twenty Wistar strain Rattus norvegicus. They were divided into five groups: negative group (normal rats), positive group (rats with the bone defect without intervention), K-P1 group (rats with bone defect given SVF and porous carbonated- hydroxyapatite (HA)application), K-P2 group (rats with bone defect given SVF and nanocrystalline-HA application) and K-P3 (rats with bone defect giving SVF a bovine-HA application). After 30 days, the rats were sacrificed, the biomarkers osteocalcin and BMP-2 were evaluated. Biomarkers were quantified using ELISA. Results: Both osteocalcin and BMP-2 biomarker expressions were higher in intervention group (with SVF and scaffolds application) compared to the positive group (with no SVF and scaffolds treatment). The combination of SVF and bovine HA was reported significantly to have the highest osteocalcin and BMP levels when compared with other groups Conclusions: A combined application of SVF and scaffolds could aid the healing process in murine models with bone defect, marked by increasing levels of osteocalcin and BMP-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Presenteeism and associated factors among railway train drivers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Presenteeism is an emerging work-related health problem among train drivers. It is more serious than absenteeism, as it accounts for higher productivity losses over the long term and may increase the risk of occupational accidents. Train drivers have high rates of mental and physical health conditions that may put them at high risk of presenteeism. Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 train drivers working in Mansoura railway station and 100 administrative employees working in the Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura university as a comparison group to estimate the prevalence of presenteeism and its associated factors among train drivers working in Mansoura railway station, Egypt. A questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic, occupational and medical data. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used to measure non-specific psychological distress. The Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS-6) was used to assess productivity loss related to sickness presenteeism. Results: The prevalence of presenteeism was significantly higher among train drivers (76%) compared to the comparison group (31%). All participants (100%) with psychological distress reported presenteeism. Being a train driver (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=5.4) and having hypertension (AOR=4.03) are independent predictors for presenteeism. Conclusions: The prevalence of presenteeism and its associated risk factors were significantly higher among train drivers than the comparison group. There is an urgent need for the railway industry to understand the factors that may contribute to presenteeism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of technology capability in supporting firm performance in the high-tech manufacturing industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Technology has influenced many aspects of life, particularly in the digital era of today. Companies that are closely related to technology are also challenged to keep innovating to stay competitive in the market, especially the higher their technology intensity their products and services are related. This study focuses on examining the technology capability of high-tech manufacturing firms in Indonesia. According to the International Standard Industrial Classification, high-tech manufacturing firms are firms that manufacture computer, electronic, and optical products. The aim of this study is to identify the role of technology capability that influences a firm’s performance and identify whether the value chain mediates the relationship between technology capability to firm performance. Methods: The method used in this study is descriptive quantitative analysis, using multi-linear regression and path analysis to test the hypothesis. The data used in this study is secondary data that came from Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), Indonesia's official statistics agency. The survey data used in this study comes from Indonesia's annual survey of manufacturing firms in 2017. Result: Technology capability and value chain have significant effects on firm performance. Nonetheless, the value chain as an intervening variable has no significant effect on firm performance. In other words, with or without technology utilization of the value chain, both produce similar results. Conclusion: Firms in the high-tech manufacturing industry are expected to have sufficient knowledge and capability in utilizing their technology resources to ensure the firm's long-term viability and to enable them to continuously create innovations, which leads to improved firm performance and thus to their competitive market survival. By identifying the effect of the value chain as an intervening variable and identifying the difference between direct and indirect effects, this study also adds to previous research on the effects of technology capability and value chain on firm performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Thermal comfort optimization through bioclimatic design in Mediterranean cities [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bioclimatic design is an approach based on local climate which improves thermal qualities and indoor comfort. Buildings follow this process to minimize negative effects on the environment. However, this approach is still not suitable in developed countries. This study aims to investigate Mediterranean local bioclimatic strategies’ impact on thermal comfort efficiency in housing, by examining architectural elements and treatments. Methods: We adopted a descriptive, analytical, and comparative methodology, complemented with a software simulation, within a qualitative and quantitative approach. Investigation and methodological tools were based on technical information including plans, elevations, photos, and documentation. The approach consisted of multiple stages: a literature review interpreting the concept of bioclimatic design, as well as thermal comfort variables and common Mediterranean building features. Moreover, the paper showcases three examples of successful Mediterranean passive houses. Furthermore, the paper presents a case- studyhouse in Alex West, Alexandria, designed in the Mediterranean Revival style. Results: The results showed that the most influencing building features on thermal comfort were the low-pitched roofs and the top chimney, which achieved 12.6% and 5% improvement in the summer and 13% and 6.8% in winter, respectively. The pergola and porch elements barely had an effect when placed on the northern façade. However, on the southern façade, a positive contribution in the summer by 1.4% and 3.4% respectively were reported, but a slight negative impact in winter by 0.5% and 2% respectively. Conclusions:  We examined the impact of common Mediterranean building features , and compared thermal comfort results between case-study houses. Features focusing on passive design for cooling rather than heating, allowing wind flow for maximized natural ventilation, using ventilated pitched roof spaces, using sun shading elements in the proper facades and angles, help passive thermal regulation. The study proposes recommendations for optimizing thermal comfort in residential buildings in Alexandria, Egypt.

                Candida krusei is a Candida non-albicans species with a high prevalence, which causes candidaemia. Current treatment guidelines include fluconazole as a primary therapeutic option for the treatment of these infections; however, it is only a fungistatic against Candida spp., and both inherent and acquired resistance to fluconazole have been reported. C. krusei species is also reported as the only Candida sp. which has an intrinsic resistance factor to fluconazole. Therefore, in dealing with antifungal resistance, it is necessary to develop new antifungal agents that are efficient in the treatment of fungal infections, especially those caused by C. krusei. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genome of clinical C. krusei isolates and correlate the resistant phenotypes with mutations in resistance genes. A total of 16 samples of C. krusei from clinical samples from hospitals in Jakarta were used in the experiment. All colonies were extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. The library was prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep Kit. The sequencing process was carried out on the Illumina MiSeq Platform using a 2x301 paired-end configuration. FASTQ raw files are available under the BioProject Accession Number PRJNA819536 and Sequence Read Archive Accession Numbers SRR18739949 and SRR18739964.

                Background: High anthropometric indexes before sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are associated with an increased risk of erosive esophagitis (EE) in bariatric surgery candidates. Reasons that explain how these indexes influence the development of esophageal pathology after surgery remains unclear. Objectives: To assess the association between the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and body fat percentage (BFP) with the development of EE in adults with obesity three months after SG. Setting: Clínica Avendaño, Lima, Peru. Methods: Retrospective cohort using a database including adults with obesity who underwent SG during 2017-2020. All the patients included had an endoscopy before and after the surgery. Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared according to BMI, WC and BFP, as well as by the development of de novo esophagitis. The association was evaluated by crude and adjusted generalized linear models with the log-Poisson family. Results: From a total of 106 patients, 23 (21.7%) developed EE. We did not find significant differences in sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with de novo EE compared to those who did not develop EE. After adjustment, BMI (aRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.18-1.40), BFP (aRR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.15-1.19) and WC (aRR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.69-1.16) were not associated with the development of EE three months post SG. Conclusions: We found no association between preoperative anthropometric indexes and the development of de novo EE; therefore, morbid obesity should not be a criterion to exclude the patients to undergo SG as primary surgery because of the risk of developing EE.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD), as a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, particularly affects the elderly population, and is clinically identified by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Pathophysiologically, PD is characterized by an early loss of dopaminergic neurons in the <i>Substantia nigra pars compacta</i>, accompanied by the extensive aggregation of alpha-synuclein (<i>α-Syn</i>) in the form of Lewy bodies. The onset of PD has been reported to be influenced by multiple biological molecules. In this context, circular RNAs (circRNAs), as tissue-specific noncoding RNAs with closed structures, have been recently demonstrated to involve in a set of PD's pathogenic processes. These RNA molecules can either up- or downregulate the expression of <i>α-Syn</i>, as well as moderating its accumulation through different regulatory mechanisms, in which targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) is considered the most common pathway. Since circRNAs have prominent structural and biological characteristics, they could also be considered as promising candidates for PD diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, PD has become a global health concern, and a large number of its pathogenic processes are still unclear; thus, it is crucial to elucidate the ambiguous aspects of PD pathophysiology to improve the efficiency of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In line with this fact, the current review aims to highlight the interplay between circRNAs and PD pathogenesis, and then discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of circRNAs in PD progression. This study will thus be the first of its kind reviewing the relationship between circRNAs and PD.</p>
