Objective
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and neurological deficits in children and young adults, however no pharmacological intervention is available to treat these patients. Although more than 95% of bAVMs are sporadic without family history, the pathogenesis of sporadic bAVMs is largely unknown, which may account for the lack of therapeutic options. KRAS mutations are frequently observed in cancer, and a recent unprecedented finding of these mutations in sporadic human bAVMs offers a new direction in the research. Using a novel adeno‐associated virus targeting brain endothelium (AAV‐BR1), the current study tested if endothelial KRASG12V mutation induces sporadic bAVMs in mice.


Methods
Five‐week‐old mice were systemically injected with either AAV‐BR1‐GFP or ‐KRASG12V. At 8 weeks after the AAV injection, bAVM formation and characteristics were addressed by histological and molecular analyses. The effect of MEK/ERK inhibition on KRASG12V‐induced bAVMs was determined by treatment of trametinib, an FDA‐approved MEK/ERK inhibitor.


Results
The viral‐mediated KRASG12V overexpression induced bAVMs which were composed of a tangled nidus mirroring the distinctive morphology of human bAVMs. The bAVMs were accompanied by focal angiogenesis, intracerebral hemorrhages, altered vascular constituents, neuroinflammation, and impaired sensory/cognitive/motor functions. Finally, we confirmed that bAVM growth was inhibited by trametinib treatment.


Interpretation
Our innovative approach using AAV‐BR1 confirms that KRAS mutations promote bAVM development via the MEK/ERK pathway, and provides a preclinical mouse model of bAVMs which will be useful to develop a therapeutic strategy for bAVM patients.

GNX‐4728, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, does not protect against hypoxia‐ischemia induced neuronal necrosis in piglet putamen (indicated by bolt strike zone). Acute depletion of mitochondrial SOD2 and developmental differences in mitochondrial proteins, such as CypD, may limit the efficacy of mitochondrial‐targeted drugs for neonatal brain injury.

Abstract
Neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes significant morbidity despite treatment with therapeutic hypothermia. Mitochondrial dysfunction may drive the mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death, thereby making mitochondria prime targets for neuroprotection. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is one such target within mitochondria. In adult animal models, mPTP inhibition is neuroprotective. However, evidence for mPTP inhibition in neonatal models of neurologic disease is less certain. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of the mPTP small molecule inhibitor GNX‐4728 and examined the developmental presence of brain mPTP proteins for drug targeting in a neonatal piglet model of hypoxic‐ischemic brain injury. Male neonatal piglets were randomized to hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) or sham procedure with GNX‐4728 (15 mg/kg, IV) or vehicle (saline/cyclodextrin/DMSO, IV). GNX‐4728 was administered as a single dose within 5 min after resuscitation from bradycardic arrest. Normal, ischemic, and injured neurons were counted in putamen and somatosensory cortex using hematoxylin and eosin staining. In separate neonatal and juvenile pigs, western blots of putamen mitochondrial‐enriched fractions were used to evaluate mitochondrial integrity and the presence of mPTP proteins. We found that a single dose of GNX‐4728 did not protect putamen and cortical neurons from cell death after HI. However, loss of mitochondrial matrix integrity occurred within 6h after HI, and while mPTP components are present in the neonatal brain their levels were significantly different compared to that of a mature juvenile brain. Thus, the neonatal brain mPTP may not be a good target for current neurotherapeutic drugs that are developed based on adult mitochondria.

Abstract
Opioids are potent analgesics used to manage pain in both young and old, but the increased use in the pregnant population has significant individual and societal implications. Infants dependent on opioids, either through maternal or iatrogenic exposure, undergo neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), where they may experience withdrawal symptoms ranging from mild to severe. We present a detailed and original review of NOWS caused by maternal opioid exposure (mNOWS) and iatrogenic opioid intake (iNOWS). While these two entities have been assessed entirely separately, recognition and treatment of the clinical manifestations of NOWS overlap. Neonatal risk factors such as age, genetic predisposition, drug type, and clinical factors like type of opioid, cumulative dose of opioid exposure, and disease status affect the incidence of both mNOWS and iNOWS, as well as their severity. Recognition of withdrawal is dependent on clinical assessment of symptoms, and the use of clinical assessment tools designed to determine the need for pharmacotherapy. Treatment of NOWS relies on a combination of non‐pharmacological therapies and pharmacological options. Long‐term consequences of opioids and NOWS continue to generate controversy, with some evidence of anatomic brain changes, but conflicting animal and human clinical evidence of significant cognitive or behavioral impacts on school‐age children. We highlight the current knowledge on clinically relevant recognition, treatment, and consequences of NOWS, and identify new advances in clinical management of the neonate. This review brings a unique clinical perspective and critically analyzes gaps between the clinical problem and our preclinical understanding of NOWS.

We studied functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in conjunction with electroencephalography (EEG) to measure changes in the brain activation at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) following ctDCS as well as virtual reality–based balance training (VBaT) before and after ctDCS treatment in 12 hemiparetic chronic stroke survivors. We performed general linear modeling (GLM) that putatively associated the lobular electric field strength with the changes in the fNIRS-EEG measures at the ipsilesional and contra-lesional PFC and SMC. Here, fNIRS-EEG measures were found in the latent space from canonical correlation analysis (CCA) between the changes in total hemoglobin (tHb) concentrations (0.01–0.07Hz and 0.07–0.13Hz bands) and log10-transformed EEG bandpower within 1–45 Hz where significant (Wilks’ lambda&gt;0.95) canonical correlations were found only for the 0.07–0.13-Hz band. Also, the first principal component (97.5% variance accounted for) of the mean lobular electric field strength was a good predictor of the latent variables of oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) concentrations and log10-transformed EEG bandpower. GLM also provided insights into non-responders to ctDCS who also performed poorly in the VBaT due to ideomotor apraxia. Future studies should investigate fNIRS-EEG joint-imaging in a larger cohort to identify non-responders based on GLM fitting to the fNIRS-EEG data.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em class="a-plus-plus">Adcyap1</em>) activation of PAC1 receptors (<em class="a-plus-plus">Adcyap1r1</em>) can significantly increase the excitability of diverse neurons through differential mechanisms. For guinea pig cardiac neurons, the modulation of excitability can be mediated in part by PAC1 receptor plasma membrane G protein-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase and downstream signaling cascades. By contrast, PAC1 receptor-mediated excitability of hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells appears independent of membrane-delimited AC/cAMP/PKA and PLC/PKC signaling. For both neuronal types, there is mechanistic convergence demonstrating that endosomal PAC1 receptor signaling has prominent roles. In these models, neuronal exposure to Pitstop2 to inhibit β-arrestin/clathrin-mediated PAC1 receptor internalization eliminates PACAP modulation of excitability. β-arrestin is a scaffold for a number of effectors especially MEK/ERK and notably, paradigms that inhibit PAC1 receptor endosome formation and ERK signaling also blunt the PACAP-induced increase in excitability. Detailed PAC1 receptor internalization and endosomal ERK signaling mechanisms have been confirmed in HEK PAC1R-EGFP cells and shown to be long lasting which appear to recapitulate the sustained electrophysiological responses. Thus, PAC1 receptor internalization/endosomal recruitment efficiently and efficaciously activates MEK/ERK signaling and appears to represent a singular and critical common denominator in regulating neuronal excitability by PACAP.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract
      </h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex disease regarding its risk factors; among those factors, genetics has an important role. Protein C (PC) is an important antithrombotic enzyme which its genetic variations disrupt the normal cascade of blood coagulation, resulting in thrombosis and increases the chance of stroke. Therefore, we aimed to investigate three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the core promoter of PC in order to find their role in this condition in the Iranian population. Blood samples from IS patients (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 249) and healthy volunteers (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 203) were collected. Biochemical analysis was performed. Genotyping was conducted on the extracted DNA from blood samples via the HRM technique. Bioinformatic investigations were used to assess how these SNPs may be involved in the IS. Smoking, hypertension, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose were significantly different between healthy and IS groups. rs1799809 and rs1799810 SNPs were significantly more frequent among IS patients. Also, among four identified haplotypes, CGT was found associated with IS (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.001). It was also found that these SNPs may interfere with the binding of transcription factors to alter the expression of PC. Our data predict that SNPs at the core promoter of PC can affect the binding affinity of transcription factors which in turn reduces the expression of PC and increases the risk of IS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Postural control impairments have been reported in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Balance relies on the integration of multisensory cues, a process that requires attention. The purpose of this study was to determine if the influence of attention demands on sensory integration abilities relevant for balance partially contributes to postural control impairments in ASD. Young adults with ASD (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 24) and neurotypical participants (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 24) were exposed to sensory perturbations during standing. An established dual-task paradigm was used, requiring participants to maintain balance in these sensory challenging environments and to perform auditory information processing tasks (simple reaction time task and choice reaction time task). Balance was assessed using sway magnitude and sway speed, and attention demands were evaluated based on the response time in the auditory tasks. While young adults with ASD were able to maintain balance in destabilizing sensory conditions, they were more challenged (greater sway speed) than their neurotypical counterparts. Additionally, when exposed for an extended amount of time (3 min) to the most challenging sensory condition included in this study, adults with ASD exhibited a reduced ability to adapt their postural control strategies (sway speed was minimally reduced), demonstrating a postural inflexibility pattern in ASD compared to neurotypical counterparts. Finally, the impact of performing an auditory information processing task on balance and the dual-task cost on information processing (response time) was similar in both groups. ASD may disrupt temporal adaptive postural control processes associated with sensory reweighting that occurs in neurotypicals.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Even for a stereotyped task, sensorimotor behavior is generally variable due to noise, redundancy, adaptability, learning or plasticity. The sources and significance of different kinds of behavioral variability have attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, the idea that part of this variability depends on unique individual strategies has been explored to a lesser extent. In particular, the notion of style recurs infrequently in the literature on sensorimotor behavior. In general use, style refers to a distinctive manner or custom of behaving oneself or of doing something, especially one that is typical of a person, group of people, place, context, or period. The application of the term to the domain of perceptual and motor phenomenology opens new perspectives on the nature of behavioral variability, perspectives that are complementary to those typically considered in the studies of sensorimotor variability. In particular, the concept of style may help toward the development of personalised physiology and medicine by providing markers of individual behaviour and response to different stimuli or treatments. Here, we cover some potential applications of the concept of perceptual-motor style to different areas of neuroscience, both in the healthy and the diseased. We prefer to be as general as possible in the types of applications we consider, even at the expense of running the risk of encompassing loosely related studies, given the relative novelty of the introduction of the term perceptual-motor style in neurosciences.</p>

Few situations in life are completely novel. We effortlessly generalise prior knowledge to solve novel problems, abstracting common structure and mapping it onto new sensorimotor specifics. Here we trained mice on a series of reversal learning tasks that shared the same structure but had different physical implementations. Performance improved across tasks, demonstrating transfer of knowledge. Neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) maintained similar representations across multiple tasks, despite their different sensorimotor correlates, whereas hippocampal (dCA1) representations were more strongly influenced by the specifics of each task. Critically, this was true both for representations of the events that comprised each trial, and those that integrated choices and outcomes over multiple trials to guide subjects' decisions. These data suggest that PFC and hippocampus play complementary roles in generalisation of knowledge, with the former abstracting the common structure among related tasks, and the latter mapping this structure onto the specifics of the current situation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433352v1?rss=1">Arc rescues defective synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunction in sepsis-associated encephalopathy</a></h4>

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a major and frequent complication in patients with sepsis resulting in delirium and premature death. Sepsis survivors commonly suffer from long-term cognitive impairment causing immense burden on patients, caregivers, and economic health systems. The underlying pathophysiology of SAE is largely unresolved, thus treatment options are missing. We report that experimental polymicrobial sepsis in mice induces synaptic pathology in the central nervous system underlying defective long-term potentiation and cognitive dysfunction. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed severely affected downregulation of genes related to neuronal and synaptic signaling in the brain, e.g. of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), of the transcription-regulatory EGR family, and of the dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6). On the protein level, ARC expression and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling in the brain was disturbed during SAE. For targeted rescue of dysregulated synaptic signaling and plasticity, we overexpressed ARC in the hippocampus by bilateral in-vivo stereotactic microinjection of an adeno-associated virus containing a neuron-specific plasmid of the Arc transgene. Hereby, defective synaptic plasticity and signaling in the hippocampus were restored and memory function improved. Accordingly, synaptic plasticity, neuronal spine pathology, and memory dysfunction also improved when post-septic mice were subjected to enriched environment demonstrating the potential for activity-induced recovery of long-term cognitive dysfunction. Together, we identified synaptic pathology of neurocognitive dysfunction after severe systemic infection and provide a proof-of-concept approach to interfere with SAE pathomechanisms leading to cognitive improvement.

Serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used across pathologies, often providing users a simple, binary result (positive or negative) in as little as 5 to 20 min. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, new RDTs for identifying SARS-CoV-2 have rapidly proliferated.

<p>by Catalina Rivera, David Hofmann, Ilya Nemenman</p>

Biochemical processes in cells are governed by complex networks of many chemical species interacting stochastically in diverse ways and on different time scales. Constructing microscopically accurate models of such networks is often infeasible. Instead, here we propose a systematic framework for building <i>phenomenological</i> models of such networks from experimental data, focusing on accurately approximating the time it takes to complete the process, the First Passage (FP) time. Our phenomenological models are mixtures of Gamma distributions, which have a natural biophysical interpretation. The complexity of the models is adapted automatically to account for the amount of available data and its temporal resolution. The framework can be used for predicting behavior of FP systems under varying external conditions. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we build models for the distribution of inter-spike intervals of a morphologically complex neuron, a Purkinje cell, from experimental and simulated data. We demonstrate that the developed models can not only fit the data, but also make nontrivial predictions. We demonstrate that our coarse-grained models provide constraints on more mechanistically accurate models of the involved phenomena.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AJj-_t4aBqM" width="1" />

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTC) CRISPR locus diversity has long been studied solely investigating the presence/absence of a known set of spacers. Unveiling the genetic mechanisms of its evolution requires a more exhaustive reconstruction in a large amount of representative strains.
In this article, we point out and resolve, with a new pipeline, the problem of CRISPR reconstruction based directly on short read sequences in <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>. We first show that the process we set up, that we coin as “CRISPRbuilder-TB” (https://github.com/cguyeux/CRISPRbuilder-TB), allows an efficient reconstruction of simulated or real CRISPRs, even when including complex evolutionary steps like the insertions of mobile elements. Compared to more generalist tools, the whole process is much more precise and robust, and requires only minimal manual investigation. Second, we show that more than 1/3 of the currently complete genomes available for this complex in the public databases contain largely erroneous CRISPR loci. Third, we highlight how both the classical experimental <i>in vitro</i> approach and the basic <i>in silico</i> spoligotyping provided by existing analytic tools miss a whole diversity of this locus in MTC, by not capturing duplications, spacer and direct repeats variants, and IS<i>6110</i> insertion locations. This description is extended in a second article that describes MTC-CRISPR diversity and suggests general rules for its evolution. This work opens perspectives for an in-depth exploration of <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> CRISPR loci diversity and of mechanisms involved in its evolution and its functionality, as well as its adaptation to other CRISPR locus-harboring bacterial species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sMB0wMI08DA" width="1" />

<p>by Xiaoqiang Sun, Ji Zhang, Qing Nie</p>

Unraveling molecular regulatory networks underlying disease progression is critically important for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying drug targets. The existing methods for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) rely mainly on time-course gene expression data. However, most available omics data from cross-sectional studies of cancer patients often lack sufficient temporal information, leading to a key challenge for GRN inference. Through quantifying the latent progression using random walks-based manifold distance, we propose a latent-temporal progression-based Bayesian method, PROB, for inferring GRNs from the cross-sectional transcriptomic data of tumor samples. The robustness of PROB to the measurement variabilities in the data is mathematically proved and numerically verified. Performance evaluation on real data indicates that PROB outperforms other methods in both pseudotime inference and GRN inference. Applications to bladder cancer and breast cancer demonstrate that our method is effective to identify key regulators of cancer progression or drug targets. The identified ACSS1 is experimentally validated to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of bladder cancer cells, and the predicted FOXM1-targets interactions are verified and are predictive of relapse in breast cancer. Our study suggests new effective ways to clinical transcriptomic data modeling for characterizing cancer progression and facilitates the translation of regulatory network-based approaches into precision medicine.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_hXsVlqJGRc" width="1" />

<p>by Javier Rasero, Amy Isabella Sentis, Fang-Cheng Yeh, Timothy Verstynen</p>

Variation in cognitive ability arises from subtle differences in underlying neural architecture. Understanding and predicting individual variability in cognition from the differences in brain networks requires harnessing the unique variance captured by different neuroimaging modalities. Here we adopted a multi-level machine learning approach that combines diffusion, functional, and structural MRI data from the Human Connectome Project (N = 1050) to provide unitary prediction models of various cognitive abilities: global cognitive function, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, impulsivity, spatial orientation, verbal episodic memory and sustained attention. Out-of-sample predictions of each cognitive score were first generated using a sparsity-constrained principal component regression on individual neuroimaging modalities. These individual predictions were then aggregated and submitted to a LASSO estimator that removed redundant variability across channels. This stacked prediction led to a significant improvement in accuracy, relative to the best single modality predictions (approximately 1% to more than 3% boost in variance explained), across a majority of the cognitive abilities tested. Further analysis found that diffusion and brain surface properties contribute the most to the predictive power. Our findings establish a lower bound to predict individual differences in cognition using multiple neuroimaging measures of brain architecture, both structural and functional, quantify the relative predictive power of the different imaging modalities, and reveal how each modality provides unique and complementary information about individual differences in cognitive function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zNDhzR3phvs" width="1" />

<p>by Guy Avraham, J. Ryan Morehead, Hyosub E. Kim, Richard B. Ivry</p>

The motor system demonstrates an exquisite ability to adapt to
changes in the environment and to quickly reset when these changes prove transient. If similar environmental changes are encountered in the future, learning may be faster, a phenomenon known as savings. In studies of sensorimotor learning, a central component of savings is attributed to the explicit recall of the task structure and appropriate compensatory strategies. Whether implicit adaptation also contributes to savings remains subject to debate. We tackled this question by measuring, in parallel, explicit and implicit adaptive responses in a visuomotor rotation task, employing a protocol that typically elicits savings. While the initial rate of learning was faster in the second exposure to the perturbation, an analysis decomposing the 2 processes showed the benefit to be solely associated with explicit re-aiming. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease after relearning in aftereffect magnitudes during no-feedback trials, a direct measure of implicit adaptation. In a second experiment, we isolated implicit adaptation using clamped visual feedback, a method known to eliminate the contribution of explicit learning processes. Consistent with the results of the first experiment, participants exhibited a marked reduction in the adaptation function, as well as an attenuated aftereffect when relearning from the clamped feedback. Motivated by these results, we reanalyzed data from prior studies and observed a consistent, yet unappreciated pattern of attenuation of implicit adaptation during relearning. These results indicate that explicit and implicit sensorimotor processes exhibit opposite effects upon relearning: Explicit learning shows savings, while implicit adaptation becomes attenuated<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bHjbYsBzork" width="1" />

Objective
The present work was undertaken to study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between amyloid‐beta (Aβ) aggregation as measured by the Aβ1–42/1–40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (beta‐secretase 1, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–38) and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 0.73–0.86, all p &lt; 0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 0.50–0.64, all p &lt; 0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1–38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1–42/1–40 ratios, and t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their cotwins (r range = −0.28 to 0.58, all p &lt; .007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 0.49–0.61, all p &lt; 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes. ANN NEUROL 2021

Objective
Understanding how different parts of the immune system contribute to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease is a burning challenge with important therapeutic implications. We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types.


Methods
We used summary statistics from the most recent meta‐analysis of genomewide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types, as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease‐associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus.


Results
We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these 2 cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3.


Interpretation
Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor, and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021

Abstract
Stroke‐related damage to the crossed lateral corticospinal tract causes motor deficits in the contralateral (paretic) limb. To restore functional movement in the paretic limb, the nervous system may increase its reliance on ipsilaterally descending motor pathways, including the uncrossed lateral corticospinal tract, the reticulospinal tract, the rubrospinal tract, and the vestibulospinal tract. Our knowledge about the role of these pathways for upper limb motor recovery is incomplete, and even less is known about the role of these pathways for lower limb motor recovery. Understanding the role of ipsilateral motor pathways to paretic lower limb movement and recovery after stroke may help improve our rehabilitative efforts and provide alternate solutions to address stroke‐related impairments. These advances are important because walking and mobility impairments are major contributors to long‐term disability after stroke, and improving walking is a high priority for individuals with stroke. This perspective highlights evidence regarding the contributions of ipsilateral motor pathways from the contralesional hemisphere and spinal interneuronal pathways for paretic lower limb movement and recovery. This perspective also identifies opportunities for future research to expand our knowledge about ipsilateral motor pathways and provides insights into how this information may be used to guide rehabilitation.

A domain for combined forelimb and hindlimb movements in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos was identified. This domain had dense intrinsic connections within PPC and reciprocal connections with frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas of the ipsilateral cortex. It also had connections with the homotopic region of the contralateral cortex.







Abstract
Previous studies in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnetti) have demonstrated that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into several functionally distinct domains, each of which mediates a specific type of complex movements (e.g., reaching, grasping, hand‐to‐mouth) and has a different pattern of cortical connections. Here we identified a medially located domain in PPC where combined forelimb and hindlimb movements, as if climbing or running, were evoked by long‐train intracortical microstimulation. We injected anatomical tracers in this climbing/running domain of PPC to reveal its cortical connections. Our results showed the PPC climbing domain had dense intrinsic connections within rostral PPC and reciprocal connections with forelimb and hindlimb region in primary motor cortex (M1) of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Fewer connections were with dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), and cingulate motor (CMA) areas, as well as somatosensory cortex including areas 3a, 3b, and 1–2, secondary somatosensory (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and retroinsular (Ri) areas. The rostral portion of the climbing domain had more connections with primary somatosensory cortex than the caudal portion. Cortical projections were found in functionally matched domains in M1 and premotor cortex (PMC). Similar patterns of connections with fewer labeled neurons and terminals were seen in the contralateral hemisphere. These connection patterns are consistent with the proposed role of the climbing/running domain as part of a parietal‐frontal network for combined use of the limbs in locomotion as in climbing and running. The cortical connections identify this action‐specific domain in PPC as a more somatosensory driven domain.

<p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised
methods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to
learn representations which are invariant to distortions of the input sample.
However, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial
constant representations. Most current methods avoid such collapsed solutions
by careful implementation details. We propose an objective function that
naturally avoids such collapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix
between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a
sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes
the representation vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar,
while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors. The
method is called Barlow Twins, owing to neuroscientist H. Barlow's
redundancy-reduction principle applied to a pair of identical networks. Barlow
Twins does not require large batches nor asymmetry between the network twins
such as a predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on the
weight updates. It allows the use of very high-dimensional output vectors.
Barlow Twins outperforms previous methods on ImageNet for semi-supervised
classification in the low-data regime, and is on par with current state of the
art for ImageNet classification with a linear classifier head, and for transfer
tasks of classification and object detection.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03108">An empirical analysis of phrase-based and neural machine translation. (arXiv:2103.03108v1 [cs.CL])</a></h4>

<p>Two popular types of machine translation (MT) are phrase-based and neural
machine translation systems. Both of these types of systems are composed of
multiple complex models or layers. Each of these models and layers learns
different linguistic aspects of the source language. However, for some of these
models and layers, it is not clear which linguistic phenomena are learned or
how this information is learned. For phrase-based MT systems, it is often clear
what information is learned by each model, and the question is rather how this
information is learned, especially for its phrase reordering model. For neural
machine translation systems, the situation is even more complex, since for many
cases it is not exactly clear what information is learned and how it is
learned.
</p>
<p>To shed light on what linguistic phenomena are captured by MT systems, we
analyze the behavior of important models in both phrase-based and neural MT
systems. We consider phrase reordering models from phrase-based MT systems to
investigate which words from inside of a phrase have the biggest impact on
defining the phrase reordering behavior. Additionally, to contribute to the
interpretability of neural MT systems we study the behavior of the attention
model, which is a key component in neural MT systems and the closest model in
functionality to phrase reordering models in phrase-based systems. The
attention model together with the encoder hidden state representations form the
main components to encode source side linguistic information in neural MT. To
this end, we also analyze the information captured in the encoder hidden state
representations of a neural MT system. We investigate the extent to which
syntactic and lexical-semantic information from the source side is captured by
hidden state representations of different neural MT architectures.

<p>INTRODUCTION: Lateral ventricles are reliable and sensitive indicators of
brain atrophy and disease progression in behavioral variant frontotemporal
dementia (bvFTD). We aimed to investigate whether an automated tool using
ventricular features could improve diagnostic accuracy in bvFTD across
neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: Using 678 subjects (2750 timepoints),
differences in ventricular features were assessed between bvFTD, normal
controls and other dementia cohorts. RESULTS: Ventricular antero-posterior
ratio (APR) was the only feature that was significantly different and increased
faster in bvFTD compared to all other cohorts. We achieved a 10-fold
cross-validation accuracy of 80% (77% sensitivity, 82% specificity) in
differentiating bvFTD from all other cohorts with ventricular features, and 76%
accuracy using only the single APR feature. DISCUSSION: APR could be a useful
and easy-to-implement feature to aid bvFTD diagnosis. We have made our
ventricle feature estimation and bvFTD diagnostic tool publicly available,
allowing application of our model in other studies.

<p>Despite their recent success on image denoising, the need for deep and
complex architectures still hinders the practical usage of CNNs. Older but
computationally more efficient methods such as BM3D remain a popular choice,
especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In this study, we aim to find out
whether compact neural networks can learn to produce competitive results as
compared to BM3D for AWGN image denoising. To this end, we configure networks
with only two hidden layers and employ different neuron models and layer widths
for comparing the performance with BM3D across different AWGN noise levels. Our
results conclusively show that the recently proposed self-organized variant of
operational neural networks based on a generative neuron model (Self-ONNs) is
not only a better choice as compared to CNNs, but also provide competitive
results as compared to BM3D and even significantly surpass it for high noise
levels.

<p>Chest radiography is a relatively cheap, widely available medical procedure
that conveys key information for making diagnostic decisions. Chest X-rays are
almost always used in the diagnosis of respiratory diseases such as pneumonia
or the recent COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised deep neural

<p>Computers has been endowed with a part of human-like intelligence owing to
the rapid development of the artificial intelligence technology represented by
the neural networks. Facing the challenge to make machines more imaginative, we
consider a quantum stochastic neural network (QSNN), and propose a learning
algorithm to update the parameters governing the network evolution. The QSNN
can be applied to a class of classification problems, we investigate its
performance in sentence classification and find that the coherent part of the
quantum evolution can accelerate training, and improve the accuracy of verses
recognition which can be deemed as a quantum enhanced associative memory. In
addition, the coherent QSNN is found more robust against both label noise and
device noise so that it is a more adaptive option for practical implementation.

<p>In this paper we propose a novel approach to realize forecast verification.
Specifically, we introduce a strategy for assessing the severity of forecast
errors based on the evidence that, on the one hand, a false alarm just
anticipating an occurring event is better than one in the middle of consecutive
non-occurring events, and that, on the other hand, a miss of an isolated event
has a worse impact than a miss of a single event, which is part of several
consecutive occurrences. Relying on this idea, we introduce a novel definition
of confusion matrix and skill scores giving greater importance to the value of
the prediction rather than to its quality. Then, we introduce a deep ensemble
learning procedure for binary classification, in which the probabilistic
outcomes of a neural network are clustered via optimization of these
value-weighted skill scores. We finally show the performances of this approach
in the case of three applications concerned with pollution, space weather and
stock prize forecasting.

<p>The third generation of artificial intelligence (AI) introduced by
neuromorphic computing is revolutionizing the way robots and autonomous systems
can sense the world, process the information, and interact with their
environment. The promises of high flexibility, energy efficiency, and
robustness of neuromorphic systems is widely supported by software tools for
simulating spiking neural networks, and hardware integration (neuromorphic
processors). Yet, while efforts have been made on neuromorphic vision
(event-based cameras), it is worth noting that most of the sensors available
for robotics remain inherently incompatible with neuromorphic computing, where
information is encoded into spikes. To facilitate the use of traditional
sensors, we need to convert the output signals into streams of spikes, i.e., a
series of events (+1, -1) along with their corresponding timestamps. In this
paper, we propose a review of the coding algorithms from a robotics perspective
and further supported by a benchmark to assess their performance. We also
introduce a ROS (Robot Operating System) toolbox to encode and decode input
signals coming from any type of sensor available on a robot. This initiative is
meant to stimulate and facilitate robotic integration of neuromorphic AI, with
the opportunity to adapt traditional off-the-shelf sensors to spiking neural
nets within one of the most powerful robotic tools, ROS.

<p>In this paper, we construct neural networks with ReLU, sine and $2^x$ as
activation functions. For general continuous $f$ defined on $[0,1]^d$ with
continuity modulus $\omega_f(\cdot)$, we construct ReLU-sine-$2^x$ networks
that enjoy an approximation rate
$\mathcal{O}(\omega_f(\sqrt{d})\cdot2^{-M}+\omega_{f}\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{N}\right))$,
where $M,N\in \mathbb{N}^{+}$ denote the hyperparameters related to widths of
the networks. As a consequence, we can construct ReLU-sine-$2^x$ network with
the depth $5$ and width
$\max\left\{\left\lceil2d^{3/2}\left(\frac{3\mu}{\epsilon}\right)^{1/{\alpha}}\right\rceil,2\left\lceil\log_2\frac{3\mu
d^{\alpha/2}}{2\epsilon}\right\rceil+2\right\}$ that approximates $f\in
\mathcal{H}_{\mu}^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$ within a given tolerance $\epsilon &gt;0$
measured in $L^p$ norm $p\in[1,\infty)$, where
$\mathcal{H}_{\mu}^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$ denotes the H\"older continuous function
class defined on $[0,1]^d$ with order $\alpha \in (0,1]$ and constant $\mu &gt;
0$. Therefore, the ReLU-sine-$2^x$ networks overcome the curse of
dimensionality on $\mathcal{H}_{\mu}^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$. In addition to its
supper expressive power, functions implemented by ReLU-sine-$2^x$ networks are
(generalized) differentiable, enabling us to apply SGD to train.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">We mined a set of neuroblastoma (NBL) exomes for immune receptor recombinations representing all seven, human adaptive immune receptor genes, using a very high standard for identifications of V- and J-gene segments in sequencing reads. Results indicated an unusually large number of TRD recombination reads in the NBL samples, possibly related to the younger age of the patients. In general, recovery of immune receptor (IR) recombination reads representing any of the immune receptors, from either blood or tumor samples, was associated with a lower overall survival rate, consistent with an emerging literature indicating that systemic immunology parameters can be informative for cancer evaluations. Despite the overall negative association of IR recombination frequencies and outcomes, survival rate distinctions could still be established as associated with certain chemical features of IR complementarity determining region-3 (CDR3) amino acid sequences, thereby likely revealing a distinction between the negative impacts of a general adaptive immune response versus the positive aspects of specific CDR3 chemical interaction potentials. These data underscore the relevance of gamma-delta T cells in the development of cancer in younger patients. And for the first time, these data allow a distinction within an NBL cohort with active disease, between two contrasting systemic immune states: (i) general and likely harmful adaptive immunity development versus (ii) a likely positive, adaptive immune response with particular antigenic specificities.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Identifying the direction of signal flows in neural networks is important for understanding the intricate information dynamics of a living brain. Using a dataset of 213 projection neurons distributed in more than 15 neuropils of a <em class="a-plus-plus">Drosophila</em> brain, we develop a powerful machine learning algorithm: node-based polarity identifier of neurons (NPIN). The proposed model is trained only by information specific to nodes, the branch points on the skeleton, and includes both Soma Features <em class="a-plus-plus">(which contain spatial information from a given node to a soma)</em> and Local Features <em class="a-plus-plus">(which contain morphological information of a given node).</em> After including the spatial correlations between nodal polarities, our NPIN provided extremely high accuracy (&gt;96.0%) for the classification of neuronal polarity, even for complex neurons with more than two dendrite/axon clusters. Finally, we further apply NPIN to classify the neuronal polarity of neurons in other species (Blowfly and Moth), which have much less neuronal data available. Our results demonstrate the potential of NPIN as a powerful tool to identify the neuronal polarity of insects and to map out the signal flows in the brain’s neural networks if more training data become available in the future.</p>

Adverse events of famciclovir were too rare and slight to be analyzed. Our confidence in pairwise comparisons was moderate to low, due to study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision; our confidence in ranking was moderate, due to study limitations. Inconsistency is not deemed to exist by a loop-specific approach and node-splitting procedure. Results of exploring publication bias are satisfying.</p>

Screening for autoimmune diseases was only performed in 22%. In 8%, no or late (i.e., &gt; 24 after SE diagnosis) lumbar puncture was performed despite persistent unknown SE etiology in all, transformation into refractory SE in 78%, and no recovery to premorbid neurologic function in 66%.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Several brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), are important in the process of fear extinction learning. Ketamine is a glutamate <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>-methyl-<span class="a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps">d</span>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which is shown to play a role in extinction modulation. Ketamine and calcineurin (CN), an intracellular protein phosphatase, have several common targets in the cells. Therefore, in the present study, our aim is to investigate the possible role of calcineurin in the mPFC on the enhancing effects of ketamine in fear extinction. First, different doses of a CN inhibitor, cyclosporine-A (CsA), were micro-injected into the infralimbic (IL) region of the mPFC prior to extinction training in a classical conditioning model in rats. Next, sub-effective doses of CsA (Intra-mPFC) and ketamine (i.p.) were co-administered in another cohort of rats to find their possible interactions. Enzymatic activity of calcineurin was measured in the IL-mPFC following drug administration. We used the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open field (OF) test for further behavioral assessments. The results showed that CsA can enhance the extinction of conditioned fear and inhibit the enzyme CN at a dose of 20 nM. The combination of sub-effective doses of CsA (5 nM) and ketamine (10 mg/kg) could again enhance the extinction of fear and reduce CN activity in the region. Our results propose that inhibition of CN in the IL-mPFC is involved in the extinction of fear and ketamine enhancement of extinction is probably mediated by reducing CN activity in this part of the brain.</p>

<p>Cue-evoked persistent activity is neural activity that persists beyond stimulation of a sensory cue and has been described in many regions of the brain, including primary sensory areas. Nonetheless, the functional role that persistent activity plays in primary sensory areas is enigmatic. However, one form of persistent activity in a primary sensory area is the representation of time between a visual stimulus and a water reward. This “reward timing activity”—observed within the primary visual cortex—has been implicated in informing the timing of visually cued, reward-seeking actions. Although rewarding outcomes are sufficient to engender interval timing activity within V1, it is unclear to what extent cue-evoked persistent activity exists outside of reward conditioning, and whether temporal relationships to other outcomes (such as behaviorally neutral or aversive outcomes) are able to engender timing activity. Here we describe the existence of cue-evoked persistent activity in mouse V1 following three conditioning strategies: pseudo-conditioning (where unpaired, monocular visual stimuli are repeatedly presented to an animal), neutral conditioning (where monocular visual stimuli are paired with a binocular visual stimulus, at a delay), and aversive conditioning (where monocular visual stimuli are paired with a tail shock, at a delay). We find that these conditioning strategies exhibit persistent activity that takes one of three forms, a sustained increase of activity; a sustained decrease of activity; or a delayed, transient peak of activity, as previously observed following conditioning with delayed reward. However, these conditioning strategies do not result in visually cued interval timing activity, as observed following appetitive conditioning. Moreover, we find that neutral conditioning increases the magnitude of cue-evoked responses whereas aversive conditioning strongly diminished both the response magnitude and the prevalence of cue-evoked persistent activity. These results demonstrate that cue-evoked persistent activity within V1 can exist outside of conditioning visual stimuli with delayed outcomes and that this persistent activity can be uniquely modulated across different conditioning strategies using unconditioned stimuli of varying behavioral relevance. Together, these data extend our understanding of cue-evoked persistent activity within a primary sensory cortical network and its ability to be modulated by salient outcomes.</p>

<p>In our daily lives, we continuously evaluate feedback information, update our knowledge, and adapt our behavior in order to reach desired goals. This ability to learn from feedback information, however, declines with age. Previous research has indicated that certain higher-level learning processes, such as feedback evaluation, integration of feedback information, and updating of knowledge, seem to be affected by age, and recent studies have shown how the adaption of choice behavior following feedback can differ with age. The neural mechanisms underlying this age-related change in choice behavior during learning, however, remain unclear. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the relation between learning-related neural processes and choice behavior during feedback learning in two age groups. Behavioral and fMRI data were collected, while a group of young (age 18–30) and older (age 60–75) adults performed a probabilistic learning task consisting of 10 blocks of 20 trials each. On each trial, the participants chose between a house and a face, after which they received visual feedback (loss vs. gain). In each block, either the house or the face image had a higher probability of yielding a reward (62.5 vs. 37.5%). Participants were instructed to try to maximize their gains. Our results showed that less successful learning in older adults, as indicated by a lower learning rate, corresponded with a higher tendency to switch to the other stimulus option, and with a reduced adaptation of this switch choice behavior following positive feedback. At the neural level, activation following positive and negative feedback was found to be less distinctive in the older adults, due to a smaller feedback-evaluation response to positive feedback in this group. Furthermore, whereas young adults displayed increased levels of knowledge updating prior to adapting choice behavior, we did not find this effect in older adults. Together, our results suggest that diminished learning performance with age corresponds with diminished evaluation of positive feedback and reduced knowledge updating related to changes in choice behavior, indicating how such differences in feedback processing at the trial level in older adults might lead to reduced learning performance across trials.</p>

<p>The resting-state human electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum is dominated by alpha (8–12 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations, and also includes non-oscillatory broadband activity inversely related to frequency (1/f activity). Gratton proposed that alpha and theta oscillations are both related to cognitive control function, though in a complementary manner. Alpha activity is hypothesized to facilitate the maintenance of representations, such as task sets in preparation for expected task conditions. In contrast, theta activity would facilitate changes in representations, such as the updating of task sets in response to unpredicted task demands. Therefore, theta should be related to reactive control (which may prompt changes in task representations), while alpha may be more relevant to proactive control (which implies the maintenance of current task representations). Less is known about the possible relationship between 1/f activity and cognitive control, which was analyzed here in an exploratory fashion. To investigate these hypothesized relationships, we recorded eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state EEG from younger and older adults and subsequently tested their performance on a cued flanker task, expected to elicit both proactive and reactive control processes. Results showed that alpha power and 1/f offset were smaller in older than younger adults, whereas theta power did not show age-related reductions. Resting alpha power and 1/f offset were associated with proactive control processes, whereas theta power was related to reactive control as measured by the cued flanker task. All associations were present over and above the effect of age, suggesting that these resting-state EEG correlates could be indicative of trait-like individual differences in cognitive control performance, which may be already evident in younger adults, and are still similarly present in healthy older adults.</p>

<p>Microsaccades, small saccadic eye movements occurring during fixation, have been suggested to be modulated by various sensory, cognitive, and affective processes relating to arousal. Although the modulation of fatigue-related arousal on microsaccade behavior has previously been characterized, the influence of other aspects of arousal, such as emotional arousal, is less understood. Moreover, microsaccades are modulated by cognitive processes (e.g., voluntary saccade preparation) that could also be linked to arousal. To investigate the influence of emotional arousal, saccade preparation, and global luminance levels on microsaccade behavior, emotional auditory stimuli were presented prior to the onset of a fixation cue whose color indicated to look either at the peripheral stimulus (pro-saccade) or in the opposite direction of the stimulus (anti-saccade). Microsaccade behavior was found to be significantly modulated by saccade preparation and global luminance level, but not emotional arousal. In the pro- and anti-saccade task, microsaccade rate was lower during anti-saccade preparation as compared to pro-saccade preparation, though microsaccade dynamics were comparable during both trial types. Our results reveal a differential role of arousal linked to emotion, fatigue, saccade preparation, and global luminance level on microsaccade behavior.</p>

<p>Dopamine (DA) modulates the activity of nuclei within the ascending and descending auditory pathway. Previous studies have identified neurons and fibers in the inferior colliculus (IC) which are positively labeled for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine. However, the origins of the tyrosine hydroxylase positive projections to the inferior colliculus have not been fully explored. The lateral lemniscus (LL) provides a robust inhibitory projection to the inferior colliculus and plays a role in the temporal processing of sound. In the present study, immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase was examined in animals with and without 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. Lesioning, with 6-OHDA placed in the inferior colliculus, led to a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immuno-positive labeling in the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus. Immunolabeling for dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), enzymes responsible for the synthesis of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), respectively, were evaluated. Very little immunoreactivity for DBH and no immunoreactivity for PNMT was found within the cell bodies of the dorsal, intermediate, or ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. The results indicate that catecholaminergic neurons of the lateral lemniscus are likely dopaminergic and not noradrenergic or adrenergic. Next, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used to confirm that dopamine is present in the inferior colliculus and nuclei that send projections to the inferior colliculus, including the cochlear nucleus (CN), superior olivary complex (SOC), lateral lemniscus, and auditory cortex (AC). Finally, fluorogold, a retrograde tracer, was injected into the inferior colliculus of adult rats. Each subdivision of the lateral lemniscus contained fluorogold within the somata, with the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus showing the most robust projections to the inferior colliculus. Fluorogold-tyrosine hydroxylase colocalization within the lateral lemniscus was assessed. The dorsal and intermediate nuclei neurons exhibiting similar degrees of colocalization, while neurons of the ventral nucleus had significantly fewer colocalized fluorogold-tyrosine hydroxylase labeled neurons. These results suggest that several auditory nuclei that project to the inferior colliculus contain dopamine, dopaminergic neurons in the lateral lemniscus project to the inferior colliculus and that dopaminergic neurotransmission is poised to play a pivotal role in the function of the inferior colliculus.</p>

<p>Neuronal firing and neuron-to-neuron synaptic wiring are currently widely described as orchestrated by astrocytes—elaborately ramified glial cells tiling the cortical and hippocampal space into non-overlapping domains, each covering hundreds of individual dendrites and hundreds thousands synapses. A key component to astrocytic signaling is the dynamics of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> which displays multiscale spatiotemporal patterns from short confined elemental Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (puffs) to Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves expanding through many cells. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of astrocyte morphology, coupling local synaptic activity to astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in perisynaptic astrocytic processes and morphology-defined mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in a distributed model. To this end, we build simplified realistic data-driven spatial network templates and compile model equations as defined by local cell morphology. The input to the model is spatially uncorrelated stochastic synaptic activity. The proposed modeling approach is validated by statistics of simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at a single cell level. In multicellular templates we observe regular sequences of cell entrainment in Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, as a result of interplay between stochastic input and morphology variability between individual astrocytes. Our approach adds spatial dimension to the existing astrocyte models by employment of realistic morphology while retaining enough flexibility and scalability to be embedded in multiscale heterocellular models of neural tissue. We conclude that the proposed approach provides a useful description of neuron-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activity in the astrocyte syncytium.</p>

<p>Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are a distressful condition. We aimed to investigate the BPSD distribution in subjects with cognitive impairment, and the potential correlations between BPSD and neurodegeneration in terms of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and brain atrophy.</p><p>Methods: One-hundred patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (Alzheimer’s disease, AD; Lewy-body disease, LBD; frontotemporal dementia, FTD; vascular dementia, VD) underwent a complete diagnostic workup, including 3T-MRI and/or CT and CSF. Cortical atrophy was assessed with medial temporal atrophy (MTA), posterior atrophy (PA), and global cortical atrophy-frontal lobe (GCA-F) scales. BPSD were rated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and BPSD clusters were defined according to the European Alzheimer Disease Consortium.</p><p>Results: Delusions, hallucinations, and psychosis cluster were differently distributed among the diagnostic groups (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.001, and p &lt; 0.05), with LBD patients showing higher scores for hallucinations (vs. MCI, p &lt; 0.001, and AD, p &lt; 0.05) and psychosis cluster (vs. MCI, p &lt; 0.05). In primary dementias, we found a negative correlation between NPI total score and tau levels (p = 0.08), confirmed by beta regression (p &lt; 0.01), while a positive non-significant relationship was observed in MCI. Higher GCA-F scores were associated with delusions and apathy (p &lt; 0.05, on both hemispheres) and hallucinations (left: p &lt; 0.01, right: p &lt; 0.05). GCA-F scores were positively correlated with psychosis cluster (right: p &lt; 0.05), and agitation/aggression (left: p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, nighttime disturbances were positively correlated with both GCA-F and MTA scores (left: p &lt; 0.01; right: p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Our results suggest that psychotic symptoms are significantly more represented in LBD patients and that CSF tau and frontal atrophy are associated with the occurrence and severity of BPSD in clinical practice. Longitudinal studies are however required to ascertain their actual predictive value.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66718">Glial insulin regulates cooperative or antagonistic Golden goal/Flamingo interactions during photoreceptor axon guidance</a></h4>

Transmembrane protein Golden goal (Gogo) interacts with atypical cadherin Flamingo to direct R8 photoreceptor axons in the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system. However, the precise mechanisms underlying Gogo regulation during columnar- and layer-specific R8 axon targeting are unknown. Our studies demonstrated that the insulin secreted from surface and cortex glia switches the phosphorylation status of Gogo, thereby regulating its two distinct functions. Non-phosphorylated Gogo mediates the initial recognition of the glial protrusion in the center of the medulla column, whereas phosphorylated Gogo suppresses radial filopodia extension by counteracting Flamingo to maintain a one axon to one column ratio. Later, Gogo expression ceases during the midpupal stage, thus allowing R8 filopodia to extend vertically into the M3 layer. These results demonstrate that the long- and short-range signaling between the glia and R8 axon growth cones regulates growth cone dynamics in a stepwise manner, and thus shape the entire organization of the visual system.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65939">A confinable home and rescue gene drive for population modification</a></h4>

Homing based gene drives, engineered using CRISPR/Cas9, have been proposed to spread desirable genes throughout populations. However, invasion of such drives can be hindered by the accumulation of resistant alleles. To limit this obstacle, we engineer a confinable population modification Home-and-Rescue (HomeR) drive in Drosophila targeting an essential gene. In our experiments, resistant alleles that disrupt the target gene function were recessive lethal, and therefore disadvantaged. We demonstrate that HomeR can achieve an increase in frequency in population cage experiments, but that fitness costs due to the Cas9 insertion limit drive efficacy. Finally, we conduct mathematical modeling comparing HomeR to contemporary gene drive architectures for population modification over wide ranges of fitness costs, transmission rates, and release regimens. HomeR could potentially be adapted to other species, as a means for safe, confinable, modification of wild populations.

Establishing how many people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 remains an urgent priority for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies has been unclear. We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions, and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize serosurvey design given test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63036">Targeted molecular profiling of rare olfactory sensory neurons identifies fate, wiring and functional determinants</a></h4>

Determining the molecular properties of neurons is essential to understand their development, function and evolution. Using Targeted DamID (TaDa), we characterize RNA polymerase II occupancy and chromatin accessibility in selected <i>Ionotropic </i><i>receptor</i> (<i>Ir</i>)-expressing olfactory sensory neurons in <i>Drosophila</i>. Although individual populations represent a minute fraction of cells, TaDa is sufficiently sensitive and specific to identify the expected receptor genes. Unique <i>Ir</i> expression is not consistently associated with differences in chromatin accessibility, but rather to distinct transcription factor profiles. Genes that are heterogeneously-expressed across populations are enriched for neurodevelopmental factors, and we identify functions for the POU-domain protein Pdm3 as a genetic switch of Ir neuron fate, and the atypical cadherin Flamingo in segregation of neurons into discrete glomeruli. Together this study reveals the effectiveness of TaDa in profiling rare neural populations, identifies new roles for a transcription factor and a neuronal guidance molecule, and provides valuable datasets for future exploration.

A notable example of spiral architecture in organs is the mammalian cochlear duct, where the morphology is critical for hearing function. Genetic studies have revealed necessary signaling molecules, but it remains unclear how cellular dynamics generate elongating, bending, and coiling of the cochlear duct. Here, we show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation waves control collective cell migration during the murine cochlear duct development using deep tissue live-cell imaging, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based quantitation, and mathematical modeling. Long-term FRET imaging reveals that helical ERK activation propagates from the apex duct tip concomitant with the reverse multicellular flow on the lateral side of the developing cochlear duct, resulting in advection-based duct elongation. Moreover, model simulations, together with experiments, explain that the oscillatory wave trains of ERK activity and the cell flow are generated by mechanochemical feedback. Our findings propose a regulatory mechanism to coordinate the multicellular behaviors underlying the duct elongation during development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60779">Parabrachial opioidergic projections to preoptic hypothalamus mediate behavioral and physiological thermal defenses</a></h4>

Maintaining stable body temperature through environmental thermal stressors requires detection of temperature changes, relay of information, and coordination of physiological and behavioral responses. Studies have implicated areas in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) and the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) as nodes in the thermosensory neural circuitry and indicate that the opioid system within the POA is vital in regulating body temperature. In the present study we identify neurons projecting to the POA from PBN expressing the opioid peptides dynorphin and enkephalin. Using mouse models, we determine that warm-activated PBN neuronal populations overlap with both prodynorphin (Pdyn) and proenkephalin (Penk) expressing PBN populations. Here we report that in the PBN <i>Prodynorphin</i> (<i>Pdyn</i>) and <i>Proenkephalin</i> (<i>Penk</i>) mRNA expressing neurons are partially overlapping subsets of a glutamatergic population expressing <i>Solute carrier family 17</i> (<i>Slc17a6</i>) (VGLUT2). Using optogenetic approaches we selectively activate projections in the POA from PBN Pdyn, Penk, and VGLUT2 expressing neurons. Our findings demonstrate that Pdyn, Penk, and VGLUT2 expressing PBN neurons are critical for physiological and behavioral heat defense.

In utero exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) is an environmental risk factor for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Animal models provide an opportunity to identify mechanisms driving neuropathology associated with MIA. We performed time course transcriptional profiling of mouse cortical development following induced MIA via poly(I:C) injection at E12.5. MIA-driven transcriptional changes were validated via protein analysis, and parallel perturbations to cortical neuroanatomy were identified via imaging. MIA-induced acute upregulation of genes associated with hypoxia, immune signaling, and angiogenesis, by six hours following exposure. This acute response was followed by changes in proliferation, neuronal and glial specification, and cortical lamination that emerged at E14.5 and peaked at E17.5. Decreased numbers of proliferative cells in germinal zones and alterations in neuronal and glial populations were identified in the MIA-exposed cortex. Overall, paired transcriptomic and neuroanatomical characterization revealed a sequence of perturbations to corticogenesis driven by mid-gestational MIA.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59594">Systematic functional analysis of Rab GTPases reveals limits of neuronal robustness to environmental challenges in flies</a></h4>

Rab GTPases are molecular switches that regulate membrane trafficking in all cells. Neurons have particular demands on membrane trafficking and express numerous Rab GTPases of unknown function. Here we report the generation and characterization of molecularly defined null mutants for all 26 <i>rab</i> genes in <i>Drosophila</i>. In flies, all <i>rab</i> genes are expressed in the nervous system where at least half exhibit particularly high levels compared to other tissues. Surprisingly, loss of any of these 13 nervous system-enriched Rabs yielded viable and fertile flies without obvious morphological defects. However, all 13 mutants differentially affected development when challenged with different temperatures, or neuronal function when challenged with continuous stimulation. We identified a synaptic maintenance defect following continuous stimulation for six mutants, including an autophagy-independent role of <i>rab26. </i> The complete mutant collection generated in this study provides a basis for further comprehensive studies of Rab GTPases during development and function <i>in vivo</i>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58394">Effective dynamics of nucleosome configurations at the yeast <i>PHO5</i> promoter</a></h4>

Chromatin dynamics are mediated by remodeling enzymes and play crucial roles in gene regulation, as established in a paradigmatic model, the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> <i>PHO5</i> promoter. However, effective nucleosome dynamics, i.e. trajectories of promoter nucleosome configurations, remain elusive. Here, we infer such dynamics from the integration of published single-molecule data capturing multi-nucleosome configurations for repressed to fully active <i>PHO5</i> promoter states with other existing histone turnover and new chromatin accessibility data. We devised and systematically investigated a new class of 'regulated on-off-slide' models simulating global and local nucleosome (dis)assembly and sliding. Only seven of 68145 models agreed well with all data. All seven models involve sliding and the known central role of the N-2 nucleosome, but regulate promoter state transitions by modulating just one assembly rather than disassembly process. This is consistent with but challenges common interpretations of previous observations at the <i>PHO5</i> promoter and suggests chromatin opening by binding competition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56279">Emergence and diversification of a highly invasive chestnut pathogen lineage across southeastern Europe</a></h4>

Invasive microbial species constitute a major threat to biodiversity, agricultural production and human health. Invasions are often dominated by one or a small number of genotypes, yet the underlying factors driving invasions are poorly understood. The chestnut blight fungus <i>Cryphonectria parasitica</i> first decimated the North American chestnut, and a more recent outbreak threatens European chestnut stands. To unravel the chestnut blight invasion of southeastern Europe, we sequenced 230 genomes of predominantly European strains. Genotypes outside of the invasion zone showed high levels of diversity with evidence for frequent and ongoing recombination. The invasive lineage emerged from the highly diverse European genotype pool rather than a secondary introduction from Asia or North America. The expansion across southeastern Europe was mostly clonal and is dominated by a single mating type, suggesting a fitness advantage of asexual reproduction. Our findings show how an intermediary, highly diverse bridgehead population gave rise to an invasive, largely clonally expanding pathogen.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54932"><i>Mayday</i> sustains trans-synaptic BMP signaling required for synaptic maintenance with age</a></h4>

Maintaining synaptic structure and function over time is vital for overall nervous system function and survival. The processes that underly synaptic development are well understood. However, the mechanisms responsible for sustaining synapses throughout the lifespan of an organism are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>CG31475</i>, regulates synaptic maintenance in adult <i>Drosophila</i> NMJs. We named <i>CG31475 mayday</i> due to the progressive loss of flight ability and synapse architecture with age. Mayday is functionally homologous to the human protein Cab45, which sorts secretory cargo from the Trans Golgi Network (TGN). We find that Mayday is required to maintain trans-synaptic BMP signaling at adult NMJs in order to sustain proper synaptic structure and function. Finally, we show that mutations in <i>mayday</i> result in the loss of both presynaptic motor neurons as well as postsynaptic muscles, highlighting the importance of maintaining synaptic integrity for cell viability.

Compartmentalized microfluidic chips have demonstrated tremendous potential to create in vitro minimalistic environments for the reproduction of the neural circuitry of the brain. Although the protocol for seeding neural soma in these devices is well known and has been widely used in myriad studies, the accurate control of the number of neurites passing through the microchannels remains challenging. However, the regulation of axonal density among different groups of neurons is still a requirement to assess the inherent structural connectivity between neuronal populations. In this work, we report the effect of microchannel patterning strategies on the modulation of neuronal connectivity by applying dimensional modifications on microchannel-connected microfluidic chambers. Our results show that those strategies can modulate the direction and the number of neuronal projections of passage, therefore regulating the strength of the structural connections between two populations of neurons. With this approach, we provide innovative microfluidic design rules for the engineering of in vitro physiologically relevant neural networks.

Computing confidence in one's own and others' decisions is crucial for success in many social situations. There has been substantial progress in our understanding of confidence in oneself, but little is known about how we form confidence in others. Here, we address this question by asking subjects undergoing fMRI to place bets on perceptual decisions made by themselves or one of three other players of varying ability. We show that subjects' compute confidence in another player's decisions by combining distinct estimates of player ability and decision difficulty - allowing them to predict that a good player may get a difficult decision wrong and that a bad player may get an easy decision right. We find that this computation is supported by an interaction between brain systems traditionally implicated in decision-making (LIP) and theory of mind (TPJ, dmPFC). These results reveal a neurocomputational interplay between self- and other-related processes during social cognition.

The adult mammalian brain entails a reservoir of neural stem cells (NSCs) generating glial cells and neurons. However, NSCs become increasingly quiescent with age, which hampers their regenerative capacity. New means are therefore required to genetically modify adult NSCs for re-enabling endogenous brain repair. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are ideal gene therapy vectors due to an excellent safety profile and high transduction efficiency. We thus conducted a high-throughput screening of 177 intraventricularly injected barcoded AAV variants profiled by RNA sequencing. Quantification of barcoded AAV mRNAs identified two synthetic capsids, AAV9_A2 and AAV1_P5, both of which transduce active and quiescent NSCs. Further optimization of AAV1_P5 by judicious selection of promoter and dose of injected viral genomes enabled labeling of 30-60% of the NSC compartment, which was validated by FACS analyses and single cell RNA sequencing. Importantly, transduced NSC readily produced neurons. The present study identifies AAV variants with a high regional tropism towards the v-SVZ with high efficiency in targeting adult NSCs, thereby paving the way for preclinical testing of regenerative gene therapy.

Diffusion-weighted neuroimaging approaches provide rich evidence with which to estimate the structural integrity of white matter in vivo. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), for instance, allows us to assess the spatial distribution of statistical tests performed on diffusion properties such as fractional anisotropy, which are proposed to reflect the integrity of white matter tracts. However, such methods do not provide a direct assessment of white matter integrity for connections between two specific regions of the brain. Here, we present a novel method for deriving tract-specific diffusion statistics, based upon arbitrarily-defined regions of interest. Our approach makes use of an empirically-derived population distribution based on probabilistic tractography, using the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) Enhanced Rockland sample. We use a heuristic method to determine the most likely geometry of a path between two regions, if one exists, and express this as a spatial distribution. We then estimate the average orientation of streamlines traversing this path, at discrete distances along its trajectory, and compute the fraction of diffusion directed along this orientation for each participant. This allows us to obtain participant-wise metrics along the specific tract (tract-specific anisotropy; TSA), which can then be used to perform statistical analysis on any comparable population. Based on this method, we report both negative and positive associations between age and TSA for two networks derived from published meta-analytic studies (the "default mode" and "what-where" networks), along with more moderate sex differences and age-by-sex interactions in both networks.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a late onset, inherited neurodegenerative disorder for which early pathogenic events remain poorly understood. Here we show that mutant exon 1 HTT proteins are recruited to a subset of cytoplasmic aggregates in the cell bodies of neurons in brain sections from presymptomatic HD, but not wild-type, mice. This occurred in a disease stage and polyglutamine-length dependent manner. We successfully adapted a high-resolution correlative light and electron microscopy methodology, originally developed for mammalian and yeast cells, to allow us to correlate light microscopy and electron microscopy images on the same brain section within an accuracy of 100 nm. Using this approach, we identified these recruitment sites as single membrane bound, vesicle-rich endolysosomal organelles, specifically as (i) multivesicular bodies (MVBs), or amphisomes and (ii) autolysosomes or residual bodies. The organelles were often found in close proximity to phagophore-like structures. Immunogold labeling localized mutant HTT to non-fibrillar, electron lucent structures within the lumen of these organelles. In presymptomatic HD, the recruitment organelles were predominantly MVBs/amphisomes, whereas in late-stage HD, there were more autolysosomes or residual bodies. Electron tomograms indicated the fusion of small vesicles with the vacuole within the lumen, suggesting that MVBs develop into residual bodies. We found that markers of MVB-related exocytosis were depleted in presymptomatic mice and throughout the disease course. This suggests that endolysosomal homeostasis has moved away from exocytosis toward lysosome fusion and degradation, in response to the need to clear the chronically aggregating mutant HTT protein, and that this occurs at an early stage in HD pathogenesis.

Dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal neurons are initially overproduced then remodeled substantially in the adolescent brain to achieve appropriate excitatory balance in mature circuits. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of developmental spine pruning by Semaphorin 3F (Sema3F) and its holoreceptor complex, which consists of immunoglobulin-class adhesion molecule NrCAM, Neuropilin-2 (Npn2), and PlexinA3 (PlexA3) signaling subunits. Structure-function studies of the NrCAM-Npn2 interface showed that NrCAM stabilizes binding between Npn2 and PlexA3 necessary for Sema3F-induced spine pruning. Using a mouse neuronal culture system, we identified a dual signaling pathway for Sema3F-induced pruning, which involves activation of Tiam1-Rac1-PAK1-3 -LIMK1/2-Cofilin1 and RhoA-ROCK1/2-Myosin II in dendritic spines. Inhibitors of actin remodeling impaired spine collapse in the cortical neurons. Elucidation of these pathways expands our understanding of critical events that sculpt neuronal networks and may provide insight into how interruptions to these pathways could lead to spine dysgenesis in diseases such as autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects over 20 million people globally. Notably, schizophrenia is associated with decreased density of dendritic spines and decreased levels of D-serine, a co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), and hypofunction of NMDARs is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We hypothesized that lowered D-serine levels associated with schizophrenia would bias toward ion flux-independent signaling by the NMDAR, which drives spine shrinkage and loss. Using a schizophrenia mouse model lacking the enzyme for D-serine production (serine racemase knock out; SRKO), we show that activity-dependent spine growth is inhibited in SRKO mice but can be acutely rescued by exogenous D-serine. When examining a wider range of stimulus strengths, we observed activity-dependent spine growth at higher stimulus strengths, but overall found a strong bias toward spine shrinkage in the SRKO mice as compared to wild-type littermates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that enhanced ion flux-independent signaling through the NMDAR contributes to this bias toward spine shrinkage, which is likely exacerbated by an increase in synaptic NMDARs in hippocampal synapses of SRKO mice. Our results support a model in which the lowered D-serine levels associated with schizophrenia lead to increased ion flux-independent NMDAR signaling and a bias toward spine shrinkage that could play an important role in the loss of dendritic spines associated with schizophrenia.

Hypnotic suggestions can produce a broad range of perceptual experiences, including hallucinations. Visual hypnotic hallucinations differ in many ways from regular mental images. For example, they are usually experienced as automatic, vivid, and real images, typically compromising the sense of reality. While both hypnotic hallucination and mental imagery are believed to mainly rely on the activation of the visual cortex via top-down mechanisms, it is unknown how they differ in the neural processes they engage. Here we used an adaptation paradigm to test and compare top-down processing between hypnotic hallucination, mental imagery, and visual perception in very highly hypnotisable individuals whose ability to hallucinate was assessed. By measuring the N170/VPP event-related complex and using multivariate decoding analysis, we found that hypnotic hallucination of faces involves greater top-down activation of sensory processing through lateralised mechanisms in the right hemisphere compared to mental imagery. Our findings suggest that the neural signatures that distinguish hypnotically hallucinated faces from imagined faces lie in the right brain hemisphere.

Identifying individuals with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) can be an effective strategy for early diagnosis and delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many approaches have been devised to discriminate those with EMCI from healthy control (HC) individuals. Selection of the most effective parameters has been one of the challenging aspects of these approaches. In this study we suggest an optimization method based on five evolutionary algorithms that can be used in optimization of neuroimaging data with a large number of parameters. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) measures, which measure functional connectivity, have been shown to be useful in prediction of cognitive decline. Analysis of functional connectivity data using graph measures is a common practice that results in a great number of parameters. Using graph measures we calculated 1155 parameters from the functional connectivity data of HC (n=36) and EMCI (n=34) extracted from the publicly available database of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative database (ADNI). These parameters were fed into the evolutionary algorithms to select a subset of parameters for classification of the data into two categories of EMCI and HC using a two-layer artificial neural network. All algorithms achieved classification accuracy of 94.55%, which is extremely high considering single-modality input and low number of data participants. These results highlight potential application of rs-fMRI and efficiency of such optimization methods in classification of images into HC and EMCI. This is of particular importance considering that MRI images of EMCI individuals cannot be easily identified by experts.

Introduction In-scanner head motion is a common cause of reduced image quality in neuroimaging, and causes systematic brain-wide changes in cortical thickness and volumetric estimates derived from structural MRI scans. There are currently no widely available methods for measuring head motion during structural MRI. Here, we train a deep learning predictive model to estimate changes in head pose using video obtained from an in-scanner eye tracker during an EPI-BOLD acquisition with participants undertaking deliberate in-scanner head movements. The predictive model was used to estimate head pose changes during structural MRI scans, and correlated with cortical thickness and subcortical volume estimates. Methods 21 healthy controls (age 32 {+/-} 13 years, 11 female) were studied. Participants carried out a series of stereotyped prompted in-scanner head motions during acquisition of an EPI-BOLD sequence with simultaneous recording of eye tracker video. Motion-affected and motion-free whole brain T1-weighted MRI were also obtained. Image coregistration was used to estimate changes in head pose over the duration of the EPI-BOLD scan, and used to train a predictive model to estimate head pose changes from the video data. Model performance was quantified by assessing the coefficient of determination (R{superscript 2}). We evaluated the utility of our technique by assessing the relationship between video-based head pose changes during structural MRI and (i) vertex-wise cortical thickness and (ii) subcortical volume estimates. Results Video-based head pose estimates were significantly correlated with ground truth head pose changes estimated from EPI-BOLD imaging in a hold-out dataset. We observed a general brain-wide overall reduction in cortical thickness with increased head motion, with some isolated regions showing increased cortical thickness estimates with increased motion. Subcortical volumes were generally reduced in motion affected scans. Conclusions We trained a predictive model to estimate changes in head pose during structural MRI scans using in-scanner eye tracker video. The method is independent of individual image acquisition parameters and does not require markers to be to be fixed to the patient, suggesting it may be well suited to clinical imaging and research environments. Head pose changes estimated using our approach can be used as covariates for morphometric image analyses to improve the neurobiological validity of structural imaging studies of brain development and disease.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) measurements and models provide information about brain connectivity and are sensitive to the physical properties of tissue microstructure. Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) quantifies the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion in biological tissue from dMRI. These estimates are of interest because they were shown to be more sensitive to microstructural alterations in health and diseases than measures based on the total anisotropy of diffusion which are highly confounded by tissue dispersion and fiber crossings. In this work, we implemented DKI in the Diffusion in Python (DIPY) project - a large collaborative open-source project which aims to provide well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive implementation of different dMRI techniques. We demonstrate the functionality of our methods in numerical simulations with known ground truth parameters and in openly available datasets. A particular strength of our DKI implementations is that it pursues several extensions of the model that connect it explicitly with microstructural models and the reconstruction of 3D white matter fiber bundles (tractography). For instance, our implementations include DKI-based microstructural models that allow the estimation of biophysical parameters, such as axonal water fraction. Moreover, we illustrate how DKI provides more general characterization of non-Gaussian diffusion compatible with complex white matter fiber architectures and grey matter, and we include a novel mean kurtosis index that is invariant to the confounding effects due to tissue dispersion. In summary, DKI in DIPY provides a well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive reference implementation for DKI. It provides a platform for wider use of DKI in research on brain disorders and cognitive neuroscience research. It will ease the translation of DKI advantages into clinical applications.

Despite the frequency of mood disorders in the population our understanding of neuronal markers of mood remains elusive which stalls the development of targeted brain-based treatments for these problems. Computational models can help identifying likely parameters affecting self-reported mood during mood induction tasks. Here we test if our previously proposed computational model dynamics of self-reported mood during monetary gambling can be used to identify trial-by-trial variations in neuronal activity. To this end we shifted mood in healthy (N=24) and depressed (N=30) adolescents by delivering individually tailored reward prediction errors whilst recording magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Following a pre-registered analysis we hypothesize that expectation (defined by previous reward outcomes) would be predictive of beta-gamma oscillatory power (25-40Hz), a frequency shown to modulate to reward feedback. We also hypothesize that trial variations in the evoked response to the presentation of gambling options and in source localized responses to reward feedback. Through our multilevel statistical analysis we found confirmatory evidence that beta-gamma power is positively related to reward expectation during mood shifts, with possible localized sources in the posterior cingulate cortex. We also confirmed reward prediction error to be predictive of trial-level variations in the response of the paracentral lobule and expectation to have an effect on the cerebellum after presentation of gambling options. To our knowledge, this is the first study to relate fluctuations in mood on a minute time-scale to variations in neural oscillations with non-invasive electrophysiology.

In this paper, we present a deep learning method, DDMReg, for fast and accurate registration between diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets. In dMRI registration, the goal is to spatially align brain anatomical structures while ensuring that local fiber orientations remain consistent with the underlying white matter fiber tract anatomy. To the best of our knowledge, DDMReg is the first deep-learning-based dMRI registration method. DDMReg is a fully unsupervised method for deformable registration between pairs of dMRI datasets. We propose a novel registration architecture that leverages not only whole brain information but also tract-specific fiber orientation information. We perform comparisons with four state-of-the-art registration methods. We evaluate the registration performance by assessing the ability to align anatomically corresponding brain structures and ensure fiber spatial agreement between different subjects after registration. Experimental results show that DDMReg obtains significantly improved registration performance. In addition, DDMReg leverages deep learning techniques and provides a fast and efficient tool for dMRI registration.

We previously reported that GABAergic neurons within the ventral anterior lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (alBST) express glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) in rats, and that virally-mediated  of GLP1R expression in the alBST prolongs the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to acute stress. Given other evidence that a GABAergic projection pathway from ventral alBST serves to limit stress-induced activation of the HPA axis, we hypothesized that GLP1 signaling promotes activation of GABAergic ventral alBST neurons that project directly to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). After PVN microinjection of fluorescent retrograde tracer followed by preparation of ex vivo rat brain slices, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made in identified PVN-projecting neurons within the ventral alBST. Bath application of Exendin-4 (a specific GLP1R agonist) indirectly depolarized PVN-projecting neurons in the ventral alBST and adjacent hypothalamic parastrial nucleus (PS) via circuit-mediated effects that increased excitatory synaptic inputs and decreased inhibitory synaptic inputs to the PVN-projecting neurons; these effects were occluded by prior bath application of a GLP1R antagonist. Additional retrograde tracing experiments combined with in situ hybridization confirmed that PVN-projecting neurons within the ventral alBST/PS are GABAergic, and do not express GLP1R mRNA. Conversely, GLP1 mRNA is expressed by a subset of GABAergic neurons within the oval subnucleus of the dorsal alBST that project into the ventral alBST. Our novel findings reveal a potential GLP1R-mediated mechanism through which the alBST exerts inhibitory control over the endocrine HPA axis.

The preoptic area (POA) is a key region controlling body temperature (Tb), dictating thermogenic, cardiovascular, and behavioral responses to regulate Tb. Known POA neuronal populations reduce Tb when activated; a population that increases Tb upon activation has not yet been reported. We now identify bombesin-like receptor 3 (BRS3)-expressing POA (POABRS3) neurons as having this missing functionality. BRS3 is an orphan receptor that regulates energy and cardiovascular homeostasis, but the relevant neural circuits are incompletely understood. In mice, we demonstrate that POABRS3 neuronal activation increases Tb, heart rate, and blood pressure sympathetically, via projections to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and dorsomedial hypothalamus. Acute POABRS3 inhibition reduces Tb. Long-term inactivation of POABRS3 neurons increased Tb variability with exaggerated Tb changes, overshooting both increases and decreases in Tb set point. BRS3 marks preoptic populations that regulate Tb and heart rate, contribute to cold-defense and fine-tune feedback control of Tb. These findings advance understanding of homeothermy, a defining feature of mammalian biology.

Cortical activity can be difficult to interpret. Neural responses to the same stimulus vary between presentations, due to random noise and other sources of variability. This unreliable relationship to external stimuli renders any pattern of activity open to a multitude of plausible interpretations. We have previously shown that this uncertainty in cortical stimulus representations can be characterized using a probabilistic decoding algorithm, which inverts a generative model of stimulus-evoked cortical responses. Here, we improve upon this method in two important ways, which both target the precision with which the generative model can be estimated from limited, noisy training data. We show that these improvements lead to considerably better estimation of the presented stimulus and its associated uncertainty. Estimates of the presented stimulus are recovered with an accuracy that exceeds that of standard decoding methods (SVMs), and in some cases even approaches the behavioral accuracy of human observers. Moreover, the uncertainty in the decoded probability distributions better characterizes the precision of cortical stimulus information from trial to trial.

Brain areas representing the body can change in response to behavioral alterations. This idea is firmly established for the adult cortex in response to extraordinary alterations such as traumatic amputation or casting of the limb. Here we address how adult cortical sensorimotor processing alters in response to a subtle perturbation in the form of smartphone deprivation lasting for ~7 days. We quantified the sensorimotor processes associated with the fingertips before and after the deprivation in right-handed smartphone users. The measurements were contrasted with those of a control group with unperturbed smartphone behavior. First, smartphone tapping speed in daily life became slower after the deprivation. Second, according to reaction time tests conducted in the laboratory the asymmetrically superior performance of the right vs. left thumb was eroded by the deprivation. Third, according to EEG measurements at physical rest, tactile stimulation at the right thumb tip resulted in smaller signal amplitudes after the deprivation. Moreover, the EEG measurements during smartphone use revealed larger signal amplitudes for tactile stimulation at the right little fingertip after the deprivation. We show that cortical plasticity can occur by merely disengaging from a common day-to-day behavior. We suggest that in daily life the adult brain continuously and selectively updates its sensorimotor processing according to recent experience.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease 4A is an autosomal-recessive polyneuropathy caused by mutations of ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1), a putative glutathione transferase, which affects mitochondrial shape and alters cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Here, we identify the underlying mechanism. We found that patient-derived motoneurons and GDAP1 knockdown SH-SY5Y cells display two phenotypes: more tubular mitochondria and a metabolism characterized by glutamine dependence and fewer cytosolic lipid droplets. GDAP1 interacts with the actin-depolymerizing protein Cofilin-1 in a redox-dependent manner, suggesting a role for actin signaling. Consistently, GDAP1 loss causes less F-actin close to mitochondria, which restricts mitochondrial localization of the fission factor dynamin-related protein 1, instigating tubularity. Changes in the actin cytoskeleton also disrupt mitochondria-ER contact sites. This results in lower mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, explaining the metabolic changes upon GDAP1 loss of function. Together, these findings reconcile GDAP1-associated phenotypes and implicate disrupted actin signaling in CMT4A pathophysiology.

Our knowledge about neuronal activity in the sensorimotor cortex relies primarily on stereotyped movements which are strictly controlled via the experimental settings. It remains unclear how results can be carried over to less constrained behavior, i.e. freely moving subjects. Towards this goal, we developed a self-paced behavioral paradigm which encouraged rats to conduct different types of movements. Via bilateral electrophysiological recordings across the entire sensorimotor cortex and simultaneous paw tracking, we identified behavioral coupling of neurons with lateralization and an anterior-posterior gradient from premotor to primary sensory cortex. The structure of population activity patterns was conserved across animals, in spite of severe undersampling of the total number of neurons and variations of electrode positions across individuals. Via alignments of low-dimensional neural manifolds, we demonstrate cross-subject and cross-session generalization in a decoding task arguing for a conserved neuronal code.

Interoception, i.e., the perception of the physiological status of the body, includes signals originating both from inside the body and from its surface, the skin. Here, we focused on the perception of temperature, a crucial modality for the maintenance of homeostasis. We used a classic thermal detection task and developed a new thermal matching task, in which participants were asked to match a previously perceived moving thermal stimulus applied to their skin to a range of colder or warmer stimuli, presented in increasing or decreasing order. We investigated both hairy (forearm) and non-hairy (palm) skin to target the potential involvement of C-tactile fibres, which are part of an afferent homeostatic system found mainly on hairy skin. We also explored the relationship between performance on the two thermal tasks and on three other tasks in different interoceptive sub-modalities: cardiac perception, affective touch, and pain detection. We found a significantly more accurate perception of dynamic temperature on hairy skin compared to non-hairy skin overall, particularly when temperature was decreasing. Static perception of cooling was also superior on hairy skin and was related to dynamic temperature and pain only on non-hairy skin. Thus, thermosensation might offer a promising avenue to investigate interoception, and different mechanisms might be involved in the perception of affective thermal stimuli in hairy and non-hairy skin. Critically, we did not find any other significant relationship in objective perceptual performance among the interoceptive modalities, which suggests independent processing and that interoception might be best quantified using a battery of tests.

Drosophila Class IV neurons are polymodal nociceptors that detect noxious mechanical, thermal, optical and chemical stimuli. Escape behaviors in response to attacks by parasitoid wasps are dependent on Class IV cells, whose highly branched dendritic arbors form a fine meshwork that is thought to enable detection of the wasp's needle-like ovipositor barb. To understand how mechanical stimuli trigger cellular responses, we used a focused 405-nm laser to create highly local lesions to probe the precise position needed in evoke responses. By imaging calcium signals in dendrites, axons, and soma in response to stimuli of varying positions, intensities and spatial profiles, we discovered that there are two distinct nociceptive pathways. Direct stimulation to dendrites (the contact pathway) produces calcium responses in axons, dendrites and the cell body whereas stimulation adjacent to the dendrite (the non-contact pathway) produces calcium responses in the axons only. We interpret the non-contact pathway as damage to adjacent cells releasing diffusible molecules that act on the dendrites. Axonal responses have higher sensitivities and shorter latencies. In contrast, dendritic responses have lower sensitivities and longer latencies. Stimulation of finer, distal dendrites leads to smaller responses than stimulation of coarser, proximal dendrites, as expected if the contact response depends on the geometric overlap of the laser profile and the dendrite diameter. Because the axon signals to the CNS to trigger escape behaviors, we propose that the density of the dendritic meshwork is high not only to enable direct contact with the ovipositor, but also to enable neuronal activation via diffusing signals from damaged surrounding cells. Dendritic contact evokes responses throughout the dendritic arbor, even to regions distant and distal from the stimulus. These dendrite-wide calcium signals may facilitate hyperalgesia or cellular morphological changes following dendritic damage.

While dexterity relies on the constant transmission of sensory information, unchecked feedback can be disruptive to behavior. Yet how somatosensory feedback from the hands is regulated as it first enters the brain, and whether this modulation exerts any influence on movement, remain unclear. Leveraging molecular-genetic access in mice, we find that tactile afferents from the hand recruit neurons in the brainstem cuneate nucleus whose activity is modulated by distinct classes of local inhibitory neurons. Selective manipulation of these inhibitory circuits can suppress or enhance the transmission of tactile information, affecting behaviors that rely on movement of the hands. Investigating whether these local circuits are subject to top-down control, we identify distinct descending cortical pathways that innervate cuneate in a complementary pattern. Somatosensory cortical neurons target the core tactile region of cuneate, while a large rostral cortical population drives feed-forward inhibition of tactile transmission through an inhibitory shell. These findings identify a circuit basis for tactile feedback modulation, enabling the effective execution of dexterous movement.

Many cognitive neuroscience theories assume that changes in behavior arise from changes in the tuning properties of neurons (e.g., Dosher &amp; Lu 1998, Ling, Liu, &amp; Carrasco 2009). However, direct tests of these theories with electrophysiology are rarely feasible with humans. Non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) produces voxel tuning, but each voxel aggregates hundreds of thousands of neurons, and voxel tuning modulation is a complex mixture of the underlying neural responses. We developed a pair of statistical tools to address this problem, which we refer to as NeuroModulation Modeling (NMM). NMM advances fMRI analysis methods, inferring the response of neural subpopulations by leveraging modulations at the voxel-level to differentiate between different forms of neuromodulation. One tool uses hierarchical Bayesian modeling and model comparison while the other tool uses a non-parametric slope analysis. We tested the validity of NMM by applying it to fMRI data collected from participants viewing orientation stimuli at high- and low-contrast, which is known from electrophysiology to cause multiplicative scaling of neural tuning (e.g., Sclar &amp; Freeman 1982). In seeming contradiction to ground truth, increasing contrast appeared to cause an additive shift in orientation tuning of voxel-level fMRI data. However, NMM indicated multiplicative gain rather than an additive shift, in line with single-cell electrophysiology. Beyond orientation, this approach could be applied to determine the form of neuromodulation in any fMRI experiment, provided that the experiment tests multiple points along a stimulus dimension to which neurons are tuned (e.g., direction of motion, isoluminant hue, pitch, etc.).

Morphine is a widely used opioid analgesic, which shows large differences in clinical response in children, even when aiming for equivalent plasma drug concentrations. Age-dependent brain disposition of morphine could contribute to this variability, as developmental increase in blood-brain barrier (BBB) P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression has been reported. In addition, age-related pharmacodynamics might also explain the variability in effect. To assess the influence of these processes on morphine effectiveness, a multi-compartment brain physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PB-PK/PD) model was developed in R (Version 3.6.2). Active Pgp-mediated morphine transport was measured in MDCKII-Pgp cells grown on transwell filters and translated by an <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> extrapolation approach, which included developmental Pgp expression. Passive BBB permeability of morphine and its active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) and their pharmacodynamic parameters were derived from experiments reported in literature. Model simulations after single dose morphine were compared with measured and published concentrations of morphine and M6G in plasma, brain extracellular fluid (ECF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as published drug responses in children (1 day– 16 years) and adults. Visual predictive checks indicated acceptable overlays between simulated and measured morphine and M6G concentration-time profiles and prediction errors were between 1 and -1. Incorporation of active Pgp-mediated BBB transport into the PB-PK/PD model resulted in a 1.3-fold reduced brain exposure in adults, indicating only a modest contribution on brain disposition. Analgesic effect-time profiles could be described reasonably well for older children and adults, but were largely underpredicted for neonates. In summary, an age-appropriate morphine PB-PK/PD model was developed for the prediction of brain pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects. In the neonatal population, pharmacodynamic characteristics, but not brain drug disposition, appear to be altered compared to adults and older children, which may explain the reported differences in analgesic effect.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NbwUuMplwc0" width="1" />

<p>by Quentin Richard, Samuel Alizon, Marc Choisy, Mircea T. Sofonea, Ramsès Djidjou-Demasse</p>

In an epidemic, individuals can widely differ in the way they spread the infection depending on their age or on the number of days they have been infected for. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a vaccine or treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions (<i>e.g</i>. physical or social distancing) are essential to mitigate the pandemic. We develop an original approach to identify the optimal age-stratified control strategy to implement as a function of the time since the onset of the epidemic. This is based on a model with a double continuous structure in terms of host age and time since infection. By applying optimal control theory to this model, we identify a solution that minimizes deaths and costs associated with the implementation of the control strategy itself. We also implement this strategy for three countries with contrasted age distributions (Burkina-Faso, France, and Vietnam). Overall, the optimal strategy varies throughout the epidemic, with a more intense control early on, and depending on host age, with a stronger control for the older population, except in the scenario where the cost associated with the control is low. In the latter scenario, we find strong differences across countries because the control extends to the younger population for France and Vietnam 2 to 3 months after the onset of the epidemic, but not for Burkina Faso. Finally, we show that the optimal control strategy strongly outperforms a constant uniform control exerted over the whole population or over its younger fraction. This improved understanding of the effect of age-based control interventions opens new perspectives for the field, especially for age-based contact tracing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NP-QGyXkP6s" width="1" />

We propose an analysis and applications of sample pooling to the epidemiologic monitoring of COVID-19. We first introduce a model of the RT-qPCR process used to test for the presence of virus in a sample and construct a statistical model for the viral load in a typical infected individual inspired by large-scale clinical datasets. We present an application of group testing for the prevention of epidemic outbreak in closed connected communities. We then propose a method for the measure of the prevalence in a population taking into account the increased number of false negatives associated with the group testing method.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8HMaprGIowc" width="1" />

The enzyme nitrogenase reduces dinitrogen to ammonia utilizing electrons, protons, and energy obtained from the hydrolysis of ATP. Mo-dependent nitrogenase is a symmetric dimer, with each half comprising an ATP-dependent reductase, termed the Fe Protein, and a catalytic protein, known as the MoFe protein, which hosts the electron transfer P-cluster and the active-site metal cofactor (FeMo-co). A series of synchronized events for the electron transfer have been characterized experimentally, in which electron delivery is coupled to nucleotide hydrolysis and regulated by an intricate allosteric network. We report a graph theory analysis of the mechanical coupling in the nitrogenase complex as a key step to understanding the dynamics of allosteric regulation of nitrogen reduction. This analysis shows that regions near the active sites undergo large-scale, large-amplitude correlated motions that enable communications within each half and between the two halves of the complex. Computational predictions of mechanically regions were validated against an analysis of the solution phase dynamics of the nitrogenase complex via hydrogen-deuterium exchange. These regions include the P-loops and the switch regions in the Fe proteins, the loop containing the residue β-188<sup>Ser</sup> adjacent to the P-cluster in the MoFe protein, and the residues near the protein-protein interface. In particular, it is found that: (<i>i</i>) within each Fe protein, the switch regions I and II are coupled to the [4Fe-4S] cluster; (<i>ii</i>) within each half of the complex, the switch regions I and II are coupled to the loop containing β-188<sup>Ser</sup>; (<i>iii</i>) between the two halves of the complex, the regions near the nucleotide binding pockets of the two Fe proteins (in particular the P-loops, located over 130 Å apart) are also mechanically coupled. Notably, we found that residues next to the P-cluster (in particular the loop containing β-188<sup>Ser</sup>) are important for communication between the two halves.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/awb8dOq8sRc" width="1" />

<p>by Janez Demšar, Blaž Zupan</p>

Overfitting is one of the critical problems in developing models by machine learning. With machine learning becoming an essential technology in computational biology, we must include training about overfitting in all courses that introduce this technology to students and practitioners. We here propose a hands-on training for overfitting that is suitable for introductory level courses and can be carried out on its own or embedded within any data science course. We use workflow-based design of machine learning pipelines, experimentation-based teaching, and hands-on approach that focuses on concepts rather than underlying mathematics. We here detail the data analysis workflows we use in training and motivate them from the viewpoint of teaching goals. Our proposed approach relies on Orange, an open-source data science toolbox that combines data visualization and machine learning, and that is tailored for education in machine learning and explorative data analysis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QBik8ingZkM" width="1" />

<p>by Simone Sturniolo, William Waites, Tim Colbourn, David Manheim, Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths</p>

Existing compartmental mathematical modelling methods for epidemics, such as SEIR models, cannot accurately represent effects of contact tracing. This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent- or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computational efficiency is such that it can be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/43t7fNS7pq4" width="1" />

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are a small population of undifferentiated cells that have the capacity for self-renewal and differentiate into all blood cell lineages. These cells are the most useful cells for clinical transplantations and for regenerative medicine. So far, it has not been possible to expand adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without losing their self-renewal properties. CD74 is a cell surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and its mRNA is known to be expressed in HSCs. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking CD74 exhibit an accumulation of HSCs in the bone marrow (BM) due to their increased potential to repopulate and compete for BM niches. Our results suggest that CD74 regulates the maintenance of the HSCs and CD18 expression. Its absence leads to induced survival of these cells and accumulation of quiescent and proliferating cells. Furthermore, in in vitro experiments, blocking of CD74 elevated the numbers of HSPCs. Thus, we suggest that blocking CD74 could lead to improved clinical insight into BM transplant protocols, enabling improved engraftment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vmo-KLRPzv8" width="1" />

Custom made antibodies against four putative neuropeptides where used on whole mounts of the box jellyfish, Tripedalia cystophora, and revealed new details of the neuroanatomy in both the rhopalium and in the bell. These neuropeptides are most likely neurotransmitters in most stained neurons but might also be involved in neuronal development.






Abstract
Box jellyfish have an elaborate visual system and perform advanced visually guided behaviours. However, the rhopalial nervous system (RNS), believed to be the main visual processing centre, only has 1000 neurons in each of the four eye carrying rhopalia. We have examined the detailed structure of the RNS of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora, using immuno‐labelling with antibodies raised against four putative neuropeptides (T. cys RFamide, VWamide, RAamide and FRamide). In the RNS T. cys RF‐, VW‐ and RAamide antibodies stain sensory neurons, the pit eyes, the neuropil, and in peptide specific subpopulations of stalk associated neurons and giant neurons. Furthermore, RFamide ir+ neurites are seen in the epidermal stalk nerve, whereas VWamide antibodies stain the gastrodermal stalk nerve. RFamide has the most widespread expression including in the ring and radial nerves, the pedalium nerve plexus and in the tentacular nerve net. RAamide is the putative neurotransmitter in the motor neurons of the subumbrellar nerve net and VWamide is a potential marker for neuronal differentiation as it is found in subpopulations of undifferentiated cells both in the rhopalia and in the bell. The results from the FRamide antibodies were not included as only few cells were stained and in an unreproducible way. Our studies show hitherto unseen details of the nervous system of T. cystophora, and allowed us to identify specific functional groups of neurons. This identification is important for understanding visual processing in the RNS and enables experimental work, directly addressing the role of the different neuropeptides in vision.

Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body spectrum diseases (LBDs) are associated with a specific risk for clinical depression. In the present clinicopathological study with 73 patients with LBD, we observed that the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neuron density was markedly lower in patients who had comorbid depression antemortem than in nondepressed patients (1.52 vs 2.32 n/mm2, p = 0.004). There were no differences in cognition, motor disease severity, antiparkinsonian medications, or disease duration between groups. The results implicate the substantia nigra as an important psychomotor modulatory area of mood in patients with Lewy body disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>The rapidity and low power consumption of superconducting electronics makes
them an ideal substrate for physical reservoir computing, which commandeers the
computational power inherent to the evolution of a dynamical system for the
purposes of performing machine learning tasks. We focus on a subset of
superconducting circuits that exhibit soliton-like dynamics in simple
transmission line geometries. With numerical simulations we demonstrate the
effectiveness of these circuits in performing higher-order parity calculations
and channel equalization at rates approaching 100 Gb/s. The availability of a
proven superconducting logic scheme considerably simplifies the path to a fully
integrated reservoir computing platform and makes superconducting reservoirs an
enticing substrate for high rate signal processing applications.

<p>Understanding how the brain responds to sensory inputs is challenging: brain
recordings are partial, noisy, and high dimensional; they vary across sessions
and subjects and they capture highly nonlinear dynamics. These challenges have
led the community to develop a variety of preprocessing and analytical (almost
exclusively linear) methods, each designed to tackle one of these issues.
Instead, we propose to address these challenges through a specific end-to-end
deep learning architecture, trained to predict the brain responses of multiple
subjects at once. We successfully test this approach on a large cohort of
magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings acquired during a one-hour reading
task. Our Deep Recurrent Encoding (DRE) architecture reliably predicts MEG
responses to words with a three-fold improvement over classic linear methods.
To overcome the notorious issue of interpretability of deep learning, we
describe a simple variable importance analysis. When applied to DRE, this
method recovers the expected evoked responses to word length and word
frequency. The quantitative improvement of the present deep learning approach
paves the way to better understand the nonlinear dynamics of brain activity
from large datasets.

<p>Brain Computer Interface (BCI) helps in processing and extraction of useful
information from the acquired brain signals having applications in diverse
fields such as military, medicine, neuroscience, and rehabilitation. BCI has
been used to support paralytic patients having speech impediments with severe
disabilities. To help paralytic patients communicate with ease, BCI based
systems convert silent speech (thoughts) to text. However, these systems have
an inconvenient graphical user interface, high latency, limited typing speed,
and low accuracy rate. Apart from these limitations, the existing systems do
not incorporate the inevitable factor of a patient's emotional states and
sentiment analysis. The proposed system EmoWrite implements a dynamic keyboard
with contextualized appearance of characters reducing the traversal time and
improving the utilization of the screen space. The proposed system has been
evaluated and compared with the existing systems for accuracy, convenience,
sentimental analysis, and typing speed. This system results in 6.58 Words Per
Minute (WPM) and 31.92 Characters Per Minute (CPM) with an accuracy of 90.36
percent. EmoWrite also gives remarkable results when it comes to the
integration of emotional states. Its Information Transfer Rate (ITR) is also
high as compared to other systems i.e., 87.55 bits per min with commands and
72.52 bits per min for letters. Furthermore, it provides easy to use interface

<p>With the increasing popularity of calcium imaging data in neuroscience
research, methods for analyzing calcium trace data are critical to address
various questions. The observed calcium traces are either analyzed directly or
deconvolved to spike trains to infer neuronal activities. When both approaches
are applicable, it is unclear whether deconvolving calcium traces is a
necessary step. In this article, we compare the performance of using calcium
traces or their deconvolved spike trains for three common analyses: clustering,
principal component analysis (PCA), and population decoding. Our simulations
and applications to real data suggest that the estimated spike data outperform
calcium trace data for both clustering and PCA. Although calcium trace data
show higher predictability than spike data at each time point, spike history or
cumulative spike counts is comparable to or better than calcium traces in
population decoding.

<p>This study investigated how social interaction among robotic agents changes
dynamically depending on individual sense of agency. In a set of simulation
studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational
recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle
such that interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict
and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how
regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy during training
determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and affects dyadic imitative
interactions. Our simulation results show that through softer regulation of the
complexity term, a robot with stronger agency develops and dominates its
counterpart developed with weaker agency through tighter regulation. When two
robots are trained with equally soft regulation, both generate individual
intended behavior patterns, ignoring each other. We argue that primary
intersubjectivity does develop in dyadic robotic interactions.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02107">Surrogate-assisted cooperative signal optimization for large-scale traffic networks. (arXiv:2103.02107v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Reasonable setting of traffic signals can be very helpful in alleviating
congestion in urban traffic networks. Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms
have proved themselves to be able to find high-quality signal timing plans.
However, they generally suffer from performance deterioration when solving
large-scale traffic signal optimization problems due to the huge search space
and limited computational budget. Directing against this issue, this study
proposes a surrogate-assisted cooperative signal optimization (SCSO) method.
Different from existing methods that directly deal with the entire traffic
network, SCSO first decomposes it into a set of tractable sub-networks, and
then achieves signal setting by cooperatively optimizing these sub-networks
with a surrogate-assisted optimizer. The decomposition operation significantly
narrows the search space of the whole traffic network, and the
surrogate-assisted optimizer greatly lowers the computational burden by
reducing the number of expensive traffic simulations. By taking Newman fast
algorithm, radial basis function and a modified estimation of distribution
algorithm as decomposer, surrogate model and optimizer, respectively, this
study develops a concrete SCSO algorithm. To evaluate its effectiveness and
efficiency, a large-scale traffic network involving crossroads and T-junctions
is generated based on a real traffic network. Comparison with several existing
meta-heuristic algorithms specially designed for traffic signal optimization
demonstrates the superiority of SCSO in reducing the average delay time of
vehicles.

<p>Cellular automata are capable of developing complex behaviors based on simple
local interactions between their elements. Some of these characteristics have
been used to propose and improve meta-heuristics for global optimization;
however, the properties offered by the evolution rules in cellular automata
have not yet been used directly in optimization tasks. Inspired by the
complexity that various evolution rules of cellular automata can offer, the
continuous-state cellular automata algorithm (CCAA) is proposed. In this way,
the CCAA takes advantage of different evolution rules to maintain a balance
that maximizes the exploration and exploitation properties in each iteration.
The efficiency of the CCAA is proven with 33 test problems widely used in the
literature, 4 engineering applications that were also used in recent
literature, and the design of adaptive infinite-impulse response (IIR) filters,
testing 10 full-order IIR reference functions. The numerical results prove its
competitiveness in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms. The source
codes of the CCAA are publicly available at

<p>In a joint work with D. Bennequin, we suggested that the (negative) minima of
the 3-way multivariate mutual information correspond to Borromean links, paving
the way for providing probabilistic analogs of linking numbers. This short note
generalizes the correspondence of the minima of k multivariate interaction
information with k Brunnian links in the binary variable case. Following
Jakulin and Bratsko, we also note that the negativity of the associated K-L
divergence of the joint probability law with its Kirkwood approximation implies
their contextuality in the sens of Abramsky. Those negative k-interactions
links, that cannot be captured in lower dimensions then k, provide a
straightforward definition of collective emergence in complex k-body
interacting systems or dataset.

<p>We show that for neural network functions that have width less or equal to
the input dimension all connected components of decision regions are unbounded.
The result holds for continuous and strictly monotonic activation functions as
well as for the ReLU activation function. This complements recent results on
approximation capabilities by [Hanin 2017 Approximating] and connectivity of
decision regions by [Nguyen 2018 Neural] for such narrow neural networks. Our
results are illustrated by means of numerical experiments.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Topographic organization of the cerebellum is largely segregated into the anterior and posterior lobes that represent its “motor” and “non-motor” functions, respectively. Although patients with damage to the anterior cerebellum often exhibit motor deficits, it remains unclear whether and how such an injury affects cognitive and social behaviors. To address this, we perturbed the activity of major anterior lobule IV/V in mice by either neurotoxic lesion or chemogenetic excitation of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex. We found that both of the manipulations impaired motor coordination, but not general locomotion or anxiety-related behavior. The lesioned animals showed memory deficits in object recognition and social-associative recognition tests, which were confounded by a lack of exploration. Chemogenetic excitation of Purkinje cells disrupted the animals’ social approach in a less-preferred context and social memory, without affecting their overall exploration and object-based memory. In a free social interaction test, the two groups exhibited less interaction with a stranger conspecific. Subsequent <em class="a-plus-plus">c-Fos</em> imaging indicated that decreased neuronal activities in the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampal dentate gyrus, parahippocampal cortices, and basolateral amygdala, as well as disorganized modular structures of the brain networks might underlie the reduced social interaction. These findings suggest that the anterior cerebellum plays an intricate role in processing motor, cognitive, and social functions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Binocular viewing is associated with a superior prehensile performance, which is particularly evident in the latter part of the reach as the hand approaches and makes contact with the target object. However, the visuomotor mechanisms through which binocular vision serves prehension are not fully understood. This study assessed the role of stereopsis in the predictive control of grasping by measuring grip force. Twenty participants performed a precision reach-to-grasp task in four viewing conditions: binocular, monocular, and with reduced stereoacuity (200 arc sec, &gt; 400 arc sec). Monocular, compared to binocular viewing, was associated with a fourfold increase in grasp errors, a 56% increase in grasp duration, 22% decrease in grip force at 50 ms following grasp initiation, and the time of peak force occurred 40% later after grasp initiation (all <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05). Grasp performance was also disrupted when viewing with reduced stereoacuity. Notably, grip force at the time of object lift-off was comparable between all viewing conditions. These results demonstrate that binocular stereopsis contributes to the efficient programming of grip forces. Specifically, stereopsis may provide important sensory information that enables the central nervous system to engage in predictive control of grasping.</p>

<p>The extensive dendritic arbor of neurons is thought to be actively involved in the processing of information. Dendrites contain a rich diversity of ligand- and voltage-activated ion channels as well as metabotropic receptors. In addition, they are capable of releasing calcium from intracellular stores. Under specific conditions, large neurons produce calcium spikes that are locally restricted to a dendritic section. To investigate calcium signaling in dendrites, we introduce TubuTag, a genetically encoded ratiometric calcium sensor anchored to the cytoskeleton. TubuTag integrates cytoplasmic calcium signals by irreversible photoconversion from green to red fluorescence when illuminated with violet light. We used a custom two-photon microscope with a large field of view to image pyramidal neurons in CA1 at subcellular resolution. Photoconversion was strongest in the most distal parts of the apical dendrite, suggesting a gradient in the amplitude of dendritic calcium signals. As the read-out of fluorescence can be performed several hours after photoconversion, TubuTag will help investigating dendritic signal integration and calcium homeostasis in large populations of neurons.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the world’s second most common neurodegenerative disease that is associated with age. With the aging of the population, patients with PD are increasing in number year by year. Most such patients lose their ability to self-care with disease progression, which brings an incalculable burden to individual families and society. The pathogenesis of PD is complex, and its clinical manifestations are diverse. Therefore, it is of great significance to screen for circulating biomarkers associated with PD to reveal its pathogenesis and develop objective diagnostic methods so as to prevent, control, and treat the disease. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered to be effective biomarkers for various diseases due to their stability, and resistance to RNAase digestion and extreme conditions in circulating fluids. Here, we review recent advances in the detection of abnormally expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in PD circulating fluids, and discuss the function and molecular mechanisms of plasma or serum miR-124, miR-132, miR-29, miR-221, miR-7, miR-433, and miR-153 in the regulation and progression of PD. Additionally, application of the differential expression of lncRNAs in circulating fluid in the pathological progression and diagnosis of PD is also reviewed. In short, the determination of abnormally expressed circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs will be valuable for the future diagnosis and treatment of PD.</p>

<p>Since their introduction in the 1840s, one of the largest mysteries of modern anesthesia are how general anesthetics create the state of reversible loss of consciousness. Increasing researchers have shown that neural pathways that regulate endogenous sleep–wake systems are also involved in general anesthesia. Recently, the Lateral Habenula (LHb) was considered as a hot spot for both natural sleep–wake and propofol-induced sedation; however, the role of the LHb and related pathways in the isoflurane-induced unconsciousness has yet to be identified. Here, using real-time calcium fiber photometry recordings in vivo, we found that isoflurane reversibly increased the activity of LHb glutamatergic neurons. Then, we selectively ablated LHb glutamatergic neurons in Vglut2-cre mice, which caused a longer induction time and less recovery time along with a decrease in delta-band power in mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Furthermore, using a chemogenetic approach to specifically activate LHb glutamatergic neurons shortened the induction time and prolonged the recovery time in mice under isoflurane anesthesia with an increase in delta-band power. In contrast, chemogenetic inhibition of LHb glutamatergic neurons was very similar to the effects of selective lesions of LHb glutamatergic neurons. Finally, optogenetic activation of LHb glutamatergic neurons or the synaptic terminals of LHb glutamatergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) produced a hypnosis-promoting effect in isoflurane anesthesia with an increase in slow wave activity. Our results suggest that LHb glutamatergic neurons and pathway are vital in modulating isoflurane anesthesia.</p>

<p>Complement, a feature of the innate immune system that targets pathogens for phagocytic clearance and promotes inflammation, is tightly regulated to prevent damage to host tissue. This regulation is paramount in the central nervous system (CNS) since complement proteins degrade neuronal synapses during development, homeostasis, and neurodegeneration. We propose that dysregulated complement, particularly C1 or C3b, may errantly target synapses for immune-mediated clearance, therefore highlighting regulatory failure as a major potential mediator of neurological disease. First, we explore the mechanics of molecular neuroimmune relationships for the regulatory proteins: Complement Receptor 1, C1-Inhibitor, Factor H, and the CUB-sushi multiple domain family. We propose that biophysical and chemical principles offer clues for understanding mechanisms of dysregulation. Second, we describe anticipated effects to CNS disease processes (particularly Alzheimer's Disease) and nest our ideas within existing basic science, clinical, and epidemiological findings. Finally, we illustrate how the concepts presented within this manuscript provoke new ways of approaching age-old neurodegenerative processes. Every component of this model is testable by straightforward experimentation and highlights the untapped potential of complement dysregulation as a driver of CNS disease. This includes a putative role for complement-based neurotherapeutic agents and companion biomarkers.</p>

<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the world’s most extensively used food additive and is generally recognized as safe according to the FDA. However, it is well reported that MSG is associated with a number of neurological diseases, and in turn, neurological diseases are associated with protein aggregation. This study rationalized the role of MSG in protein aggregation using different biophysical techniques such as absorption, far-UV CD, DLS, and ITC. Kinetic measurements revealed that MSG causes significant enhancement of aggregation of BSA through a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. Also, CTAB-BSA aggregation is enhanced by MSG significantly. MSG-induced BSA aggregation also exhibits the formation of irreversible aggregates, temperature dependence, non-Arrhenius behavior, and enhancement of hydrodynamic diameter. From the isothermal titration calorimetry measurement, the significant endothermic heat of the interaction of BSA-MSG indicates that protein aggregation may be due to the coupling of MSG with the protein. The determined enthalpy change (ΔH) is largely positive, also suggesting an endothermic nature, whereas entropy change (ΔS) is positive and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is largely negative, suggesting the spontaneous nature of the interaction. Furthermore, even a low concentration of MSG is involved in the unfolding of the secondary structure of protein with the disappearance of original peaks and the formation of a unique peak in the far-UV CD, which is an attention-grabbing observation. This is the first investigation which links the dietary MSG with protein aggregation and thus will be very instrumental in understanding the mechanism of various MSG-related human physiological as well as neurological diseases.</p>

<p>Remyelination is a naturally occurring response to demyelination and has a central role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Recently we demonstrated that a novel MRI technique entitled Relaxation Along a Fictitious Field (RAFF) in the rotating frame of rank n (RAFFn) achieved exceptional sensitivity in detecting the demyelination processes induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in rat brain. In the present work, our aim was to test whether RAFF4, along with magnetization transfer (MT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), would be capable of detecting the changes in the myelin content and microstructure caused by modifications of myelin sheets around axons or by gliosis during the remyelination phase after LPC-induced demyelination in the corpus callosum of rats. We collected MRI data with RAFF4, MT and DTI at 3 days after injection (demyelination stage) and at 38 days after injection (remyelination stage) of LPC (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 9). Cell density and myelin content were assessed by histology. All MRI metrics detected differences between LPC-injected and control groups of animals in the demyelination stage, on day 3. In the remyelination phase (day 38), RAFF4, MT parameters, fractional anisotropy, and axial diffusivity detected signs of a partial recovery consistent with the remyelination evident in histology. Radial diffusivity had undergone a further increase from day 3 to 38 and mean diffusivity revealed a complete recovery correlating with the histological assessment of cell density attributed to gliosis. The combination of RAFF4, MT and DTI has the potential to differentiate between normal, demyelinated and remyelinated axons and gliosis and thus it may be able to provide a more detailed assessment of white matter pathologies in several neurological diseases.</p>

<p>Successful surgical treatment of patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy remains challenging, especially in cases for which it is difficult to define the area of cortex from which seizures originate, the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Various diagnostic methods are needed to select surgical candidates and determine the extent of resection. Interictal magnetoencephalography (MEG) with source imaging has proven to be useful for presurgical evaluation, but the use of ictal MEG data remains limited. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether pre-ictal variations of spectral properties of neural activity from ictal MEG recordings are predictive of SOZ location.We performed a 4 h overnight MEG recording in an 8-year-old child with drug-resistant focal epilepsy of suspected right fronto-temporal origin and captured one ~45-s seizure. The patient underwent a right temporal resection from the anterior temporal neocortex and amygdala to the mid-posterior temporal neocortex, sparing the hippocampus proper. She remains seizure-free 21 months postoperatively. The histopathological assessment confirmed frank focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIa in the MEG-defined SOZ, which was based on source imaging of averaged ictal spikes at seizure onset. We investigated temporal changes (inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal periods) together with spatial differences (SOZ vs. control regions) in spectral parameters of background brain activity, namely the aperiodic broadband offset and slope, and assessed how they confounded the interpretation of apparent variations of signal power in typical electrophysiological bands. Our data show that the SOZ was associated with a higher aperiodic offset and exponent during the seizure compared to control regions. Both parameters increased in all regions from 2 min before the seizure onwards. Regions anatomically closer to the SOZ also expressed higher values compared to contralateral regions, potentially indicating ictal spread. We also show that narrow-band power changes were caused by these fluctuations in the aperiodic component of ongoing brain activity. Our results indicate that the broadband aperiodic component of ongoing brain activity cannot be reduced to background noise of no physiological interest, and rather may be indicative of the neuropathophysiology of the SOZ. We believe these findings will inspire future studies of ictal MEG cases and confirm their significance.</p>

<p>Prior work shows that the possibility of action to an object (visual affordance) facilitates attentional deployment. We sought to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this modulation of attention by examining ERPs to target objects that were either congruently or incongruently gripped for their use in the presence of a congruently or incongruently gripped distractor. Participants responded to the presence or absence of a target object matching a preceding action word with a distractor object presented in the opposite location. Participants were faster in responding to congruently gripped targets compared to incongruently gripped targets. There was a reduced N2pc potential when the target was congruently gripped, and the distractor was incongruently gripped compared to the conditions where targets were incongruently gripped or when the distractor, as well as target, was congruently gripped. The N2pc results indicate that target selection is easier when action information is congruent with an object’s use.</p>

<p>Vision is known to improve human postural responses to external perturbations. This study investigates the role of vision for the responses to continuous pseudorandom support surface translations in the body sagittal plane in three visual conditions: with the eyes closed (EC), in stroboscopic illumination (EO/SI; only visual position information) and with eyes open in continuous illumination (EO/CI; position and velocity information) with the room as static visual scene (or the interior of a moving cabin, in some of the trials). In the frequency spectrum of the translation stimulus we distinguished on the basis of the response patterns between a low-frequency, mid-frequency, and high-frequency range (LFR: 0.0165-0.14 Hz; MFR: 0.15–0.57 Hz; HFR: 0.58–2.46 Hz). With EC, subjects’ mean sway response gain was very low in the LFR. On average it increased with EO/SI (although not to a significant degree p = 0.078) and more so with EO/CI (p &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup>). In contrast, the average gain in the MFR decreased from EC to EO/SI (although not to a significant degree, p = 0.548) and further to EO/CI (p = 0.0002). In the HFR, all three visual conditions produced, similarly, high gain levels. A single inverted pendulum (SIP) model controlling center of mass (COM) balancing about the ankle joints formally described the EC response as being strongly shaped by a resonance phenomenon arising primarily from the control’s proprioceptive feedback loop. The effect of adding visual information in these simulations lies in a reduction of the resonance, similar as in the experiments. Extending the model to a double inverted pendulum (DIP) suggested in addition a biomechanical damping effective from trunk sway in the hip joints on the resonance.</p>

<p>Reinforcement learning is a paradigm that can account for how organisms learn to adapt their behavior in complex environments with sparse rewards. To partition an environment into discrete states, implementations in spiking neuronal networks typically rely on input architectures involving place cells or receptive fields specified ad hoc by the researcher. This is problematic as a model for how an organism can learn appropriate behavioral sequences in unknown environments, as it fails to account for the unsupervised and self-organized nature of the required representations. Additionally, this approach presupposes knowledge on the part of the researcher on how the environment should be partitioned and represented and scales poorly with the size or complexity of the environment. To address these issues and gain insights into how the brain generates its own task-relevant mappings, we propose a learning architecture that combines unsupervised learning on the input projections with biologically motivated clustered connectivity within the representation layer. This combination allows input features to be mapped to clusters; thus the network self-organizes to produce clearly distinguishable activity patterns that can serve as the basis for reinforcement learning on the output projections. On the basis of the MNIST and Mountain Car tasks, we show that our proposed model performs better than either a comparable unclustered network or a clustered network with static input projections. We conclude that the combination of unsupervised learning and clustered connectivity provides a generic representational substrate suitable for further computation.</p>

<p>This review focuses on the neuronal and circuit mechanisms involved in the generation of the theta (θ) rhythm and of its participation in behavior. Data have accumulated indicating that θ arises from interactions between medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS-DbB) and intra-hippocampal circuits. The intrinsic properties of MS-DbB and hippocampal neurons have also been shown to play a key role in θ generation. A growing number of studies suggest that θ may represent a timing mechanism to temporally organize movement sequences, memory encoding, or planned trajectories for spatial navigation. To accomplish those functions, θ and gamma (γ) oscillations interact during the awake state and REM sleep, which are considered to be critical for learning and memory processes. Further, we discuss that the loss of this interaction is at the base of various neurophatological conditions.</p>

<p>A presynaptic protein closely related to Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein (α-Syn), has been studied extensively regarding its pathogenic mechanisms. As a physiological protein in presynapses, however, α-Syn's physiological function remains unclear. Its location in nerve terminals and effects on membrane fusion also imply its functional role in synaptic transmission, including its possible interaction with high-curvature membranes via its N-terminus and amorphous C-terminus. PD-related mutants that disrupt the membrane interaction (e.g., A30P and G51D) additionally suggest a relationship between α-Syn's pathogenic mechanisms and physiological roles through the membrane binding. Here, we summarize recent research on how α-Syn and its variants interact with membranes and influence synaptic transmission. We list several membrane-related connections between the protein's physiological function and the pathological mechanisms that stand to expand current understandings of α-Syn.</p>

<p>Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) with neurological involvement are inherited genetic diseases of the metabolism characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and the accumulation of undegraded substrates altering glial and neuronal function. Often, patients with neurological manifestations present with damage to the gray and white matter and irreversible neuronal decline. The use of animal models of LSDs has greatly facilitated studying and identifying potential mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction, including alterations in availability and function of synaptic proteins, modifications of membrane structure, deficits in docking, exocytosis, recycling of synaptic vesicles, and inflammation-mediated remodeling of synapses. Although some extrapolations from findings in adult-onset conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease have been reported, the pathogenetic mechanisms underpinning cognitive deficits in LSDs are still largely unclear. Without being fully inclusive, the goal of this mini-review is to present a discussion on possible mechanisms leading to synaptic dysfunction in LSDs.</p>

<p>Manual ELISA assays are the most commonly used methods for quantification of biomarkers; however, they often show inter- and intra-laboratory variability that limits their wide use. Here, we compared the Innotest ELISA method with two fully automated platforms (Lumipulse and Elecsys) to determine whether these new methods can provide effective substitutes for ELISA assays. We included 149 patients with AD (n = 34), MCI (n = 94) and non-AD dementias (n = 21). Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau were quantified using the ELISA method (Innotest, Fujirebio Europe), CLEIA method on a Lumipulse G600II (Fujirebio Diagnostics), and ECLIA method on a Cobas e 601 (Roche Diagnostics) instrument. We found a high correlation between the three methods, although there were systematic differences between biomarker values measured by each method. Both Lumipulse and Elecsys methods were highly concordant with clinical diagnoses, and the combination of Lumipulse Aβ42 and P-tau had the highest discriminating power (AUC 0.915, 95% CI 0.822–1.000). We also assessed the agreement of AT(N) classification for each method with AD diagnosis. Although differences were not significant, the use of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio instead of Aβ42 alone in AT(N) classification enhanced the diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.798, 95% CI 0.649–0.947 vs. AUC 0.778, 95% CI 0.617–0.939). We determined the cut-offs for the Lumipulse and Elecsys assays based on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio ± status as a marker of amyloid pathology, and these cut-offs were consistent with those recommended by manufacturers, which had been determined based on visual amyloid PET imaging or diagnostic accuracy. Finally, the biomarker ratios (P-tau/Aβ42 and T-tau/Aβ42) were more consistent with the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio for both Lumipulse and Elecsys methods, and Elecsys P-tau/Aβ42 had the highest consistency with amyloid pathology (AUC 0.994, 95% CI 0.986–1.000 and OPA 96.4%) at the ≥0.024 cut-off. The Lumipulse and Elecsys cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD assays showed high analytical and clinical performances. As both automated platforms were standardized for reference samples, their use is recommended for the measurement of CSF AD biomarkers compared with unstandardized manual methods, such as Innotest ELISA, that have demonstrated a high inter and intra-laboratory variability.</p>

The efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment for psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) is hypothesized to depend on induction of molecular and cellular events that trigger structural plasticity in neurons. Electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) in animal models can help to inform our understanding of how electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) impacts the brain. ECS induces structural plasticity in neuronal dendrites in many brain regions, including the piriform cortex, a highly epileptogenic region that has also been implicated in depression. ECS-induced structural plasticity is associated with differential expression of unique isoforms encoding the neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but the functional significance of these transcripts in dendritic plasticity is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that different Bdnf isoforms are expressed non-stochastically across neurons of the piriform cortex following ECS. Specifically, cells expressing Bdnf exon 1-containing transcripts show a unique spatial recruitment pattern in response to ECS. We further demonstrate that Bdnf Ex1 expression in these cells is necessary for ECS-induced dendritic spine plasticity.

Sensitive periods in which experience-driven changes in activity persistently shape circuit function are well-described in sensory cortex. Whether comparable periods govern the development of associative cortical areas, like the prefrontal cortex, remains unclear. Here, we focus on the role of activity in the maturation and circuit integration of prefrontal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, as these cells play an essential role in sensory cortical maturation and develop in lockstep with overall prefrontal circuit function. We found that transiently decreasing prefrontal parvalbumin activity during peripubertal and adolescent development results in persistent impairments in adult functional connectivity, in vivo network function and set-shifting behavior that can be rescued by targeted activation of these interneurons in the adult animal. In contrast, comparable adult inhibition had no lasting effects. These findings identify an activity-dependent sensitive period for prefrontal parvalbumin maturation and highlight how abnormal parvalbumin activity early in life can persistently alter adult circuit function and behavior.

Abstract Background: Chronic stress can produce reward system deficits (i.e. anhedonia) and other common symptoms associated with depressive disorders, as well as neural circuit hypofunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the molecular mechanisms by which chronic stress promotes depressive-like behavior and hypofrontality remain poorly understood. Methods: C57BL/6 adult male mice were subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 4 (NPAS4) or the Npas4 lnc-eRNA were reduced using a viral-mediated shRNA approach. CSDS-induced behaviors, including social avoidance, sucrose preference, natural reward motivation, and anxiety-like behavior, were then measured. CSDS-induced changes in mPFC dendritic spine density were assessed using confocal imaging, and the mPFC NPAS4-regulated transcriptome was assessed using RNA-seq analysis. Results: Social defeat stress induced transient expression of NPAS4 in the mPFC. Viral-mediated knockdown of mPFC NPAS4 blocked CSDS-induced reduction in sucrose preference and changes in natural reward motivation, but without influencing social avoidance. NPAS4 was also required for CSDS-induced reduction of pyramidal neuron dendritic spine density in mPFC. RNA-seq analysis from mPFC tissues revealed that NPAS4 influences expression of numerous genes linked to glutamatergic synapses and ribosomal function, and to genes dysregulated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. Finally, we found that stress-induced expression of NPAS4 in mPFC requires a novel, activity-regulated lnc-eRNA, and that this Npas4 lnc-eRNA in mPFC was required for CSDS-induced anhedonia-like behavior. Conclusion: Together our findings reveal a novel, stress-regulated and lnc-eRNA-dependent transcriptional mechanism in the mPFC that promotes dendritic spine loss and development of anhedonia-like behaviors.

Dopamine and serotonin are important modulators of synaptic plasticity and their action has been linked to our ability to learn the positive or negative outcomes or valence learning. In the hippocampus, both neuromodulators affect long-term synaptic plasticity but play different roles in the encoding of uncertainty or predicted reward. Here, we examine the differential role of these modulators on learning speed and cognitive flexibility in a navigational model. We compare two reward-modulated spike time-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) learning rules to describe the action of these neuromodulators. Our results show that the interplay of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) improves overall learning performance and can explain experimentally reported differences in spatial task performance. Furthermore, this system allows us to make predictions regarding spatial reversal learning.

Predictive coding has been identified as a major driver of computation and learning in corticalmicrocircuits. But it has remained unknown which synaptic plasticity processes install and maintain predictive coding capability. Predictions are inherently uncertain, and learning rules that aim at discriminating linearly separable classes of inputs - such as the perceptron learning rule - are not suitable for learning to predict. We show that experimental data on synaptic plasticity in distal dendrites of pyramidal cells support a functionally more powerful learning rule that produces a spike-based approximation to logistic regression, i.e., to probabilistic prediction. We also show that experimentally found interactions between different dendritic branches support learning of predictions for more complex probability distributions. The resulting learning theory for top-down inputs to pyramidal cells provides a normative framework for evaluating experimental data, and suggests further experiments for tracking the emergence of predictive coding through synaptic plasticity in distal dendrites.

Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_lf2kqbW0e4" width="1" />

<p>by Alejandro Tabas, Katharina von Kriegstein</p>

Frequency modulation (FM) is a basic constituent of vocalisation in many animals as well as in humans. In human speech, short rising and falling FM-sweeps of around 50 ms duration, called formant transitions, characterise individual speech sounds. There are two representations of FM in the ascending auditory pathway: a spectral representation, holding the instantaneous frequency of the stimuli; and a sweep representation, consisting of neurons that respond selectively to FM direction. To-date computational models use feedforward mechanisms to explain FM encoding. However, from neuroanatomy we know that there are massive feedback projections in the auditory pathway. Here, we found that a classical FM-sweep perceptual effect, the sweep pitch shift, cannot be explained by standard feedforward processing models. We hypothesised that the sweep pitch shift is caused by a predictive feedback mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel model of FM encoding incorporating a predictive interaction between the sweep and the spectral representation. The model was designed to encode sweeps of the duration, modulation rate, and modulation shape of formant transitions. It fully accounted for experimental data that we acquired in a perceptual experiment with human participants as well as previously published experimental results. We also designed a new class of stimuli for a second perceptual experiment to further validate the model. Combined, our results indicate that predictive interaction between the frequency encoding and direction encoding neural representations plays an important role in the neural processing of FM. In the brain, this mechanism is likely to occur at early stages of the processing hierarchy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/io_kgaV_ykQ" width="1" />

In the companion paper we apply a model extension to investigate the changes in RBC homeostasis over the approximately 200000 capillary transits during the ~120 days lifespan of the cells. These are topics inaccessible to direct experimentation but rendered mature for a computational modelling approach by the large body of recent and early experimental results which robustly constrain the range of parameter values and model outcomes, offering a unique opportunity for an in depth study of the mechanisms involved. Capillary transit times vary between 0.5 and 1.5s during which the red blood cells squeeze and deform in the capillary stream transiently opening stress-gated PIEZO1 channels allowing ion gradient dissipation and creating minuscule quantal changes in RBC ion contents and volume. Widely accepted views, based on the effects of experimental shear stress on human RBCs, suggested that quantal changes generated during capillary transits add up over time to develop the documented changes in RBC density and composition during their long circulatory lifespan, the quantal hypothesis. Applying the new red cell model (RCM) we investigated here the changes in homeostatic variables that may be expected during single capillary transits resulting from transient PIEZO1 channel activation. The predicted quantal volume changes were infinitesimal in magnitude, biphasic in nature, and essentially irreversible within inter-transit periods. A sub-second transient PIEZO1 activation triggered a sharp swelling peak followed by a much slower recovery period towards lower-than-baseline volumes. The peak response was caused by net CaCl<sub>2</sub> and fluid gain via PIEZO1 channels driven by the steep electrochemical inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient. The ensuing dehydration followed a complex time-course with sequential, but partially overlapping contributions by KCl loss via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Gardos channels, restorative Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by the plasma membrane calcium pump, and chloride efflux by the Jacobs-Steward mechanism. The change in relative cell volume predicted for single capillary transits was around 10<sup>−5</sup>, an infinitesimal volume change incompatible with a functional role in capillary flow. The biphasic response predicted by the RCM appears to conform to the quantal hypothesis, but whether its cumulative effects could account for the documented changes in density during RBC senescence required an investigation of the effects of myriad transits over the full four months circulatory lifespan of the cells, the subject of the next paper.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lj1OPWU3UrY" width="1" />

Mutations in mitochondrial replicative polymerase PolγA lead to progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). While PolγA is the known central player in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, it is unknown whether a regulatory process exists on the mitochondrial outer membrane which controlled its entry into the mitochondria. We now demonstrate that PolγA is ubiquitylated by mitochondrial E3 ligase, MITOL (or MARCH5, RNF153). Ubiquitylation in wild-type (WT) PolγA occurs at Lysine 1060 residue via K6 linkage. Ubiquitylation of PolγA negatively regulates its binding to Tom20 and thereby its mitochondrial entry. While screening different PEO patients for mitochondrial entry, we found that a subset of the PolγA mutants is hyperubiquitylated by MITOL and interact less with Tom20. These PolγA variants cannot enter into mitochondria, instead becomes enriched in the insoluble fraction and undergo enhanced degradation. Hence, mtDNA replication, as observed via BrdU incorporation into the mtDNA, was compromised in these PEO mutants. However, by manipulating their ubiquitylation status by 2 independent techniques, these PEO mutants were reactivated, which allowed the incorporation of BrdU into mtDNA. Thus, regulated entry of non-ubiquitylated PolγA may have beneficial consequences for certain PEO patients.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Q1lc4OzFC2E" width="1" />

<p>by Myriam Zecca, Gary Struhl</p>

Development of the <i>Drosophila</i> wing—a paradigm of organ development—is governed by 2 morphogens, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg, a Wnt). Both proteins are produced by defined subpopulations of cells and spread outwards, forming gradients that control gene expression and cell pattern as a function of concentration. They also control growth, but how is unknown. Most studies have focused on Dpp and yielded disparate models in which cells throughout the wing grow at similar rates in response to the grade or temporal change in Dpp concentration or to the different amounts of Dpp “equalized” by molecular or mechanical feedbacks. In contrast, a model for Wg posits that growth is governed by a progressive expansion in morphogen range, via a mechanism in which a minimum threshold of Wg sustains the growth of cells within the wing and recruits surrounding “pre-wing” cells to grow and enter the wing. This mechanism depends on the capacity of Wg to fuel the autoregulation of <i>vestigial</i> (<i>vg</i>)—the selector gene that specifies the wing state—both to sustain <i>vg</i> expression in wing cells and by a feed-forward (FF) circuit of Fat (Ft)/Dachsous (Ds) protocadherin signaling to induce <i>vg</i> expression in neighboring pre-wing cells. Here, we have subjected Dpp to the same experimental tests used to elucidate the Wg model and find that it behaves indistinguishably. Hence, we posit that both morphogens act together, via a common mechanism, to control wing growth as a function of morphogen range.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VxPNZ5hhW64" width="1" />

<p>Several experiments and models have highlighted the importance of neuronal
heterogeneity in brain dynamics and function. However, how such a cell-to-cell
diversity can affect cortical computation, synchronization, and neuronal
communication is still under debate. Previous studies have focused on the
effect of neuronal heterogeneity in one neuronal population. Here we are
specifically interested in the effect of neuronal variability on the phase
relations between two populations, which can be related to different cortical
communication hypotheses. It has been recently shown that two spiking neuron
populations unidirectionally connected in a sender-receiver configuration can
exhibit anticipated synchronization (AS), which is characterized by a negative
phase-lag. This phenomenon has been reported in electrophysiological data of
non-human primates and human EEG during a visual discrimination cognitive task.
In experiments, the unidirectional coupling could be accessed by Granger
causality and can be accompanied by both positive or negative phase difference
between cortical areas. Here we propose a model of two coupled populations in
which the neuronal heterogeneity can determine the dynamical relation between
the sender and the receiver and can reproduce phase relations reported in
experiments. Depending on the distribution of parameters characterizing the
neuronal firing patterns, the system can exhibit both AS and the usual delayed
synchronization regime (DS, with positive phase) as well as a zero-lag
synchronization regime and phase bistability between AS and DS. Furthermore, we
show that our network can present diversity in their phase relations
maintaining the excitation-inhibition balance.

<p>Spatiotemporal data can be represented as a process over a graph, which
captures their spatial relationships either explicitly or implicitly. How to
leverage such a structure for learning representations is one of the key
challenges when working with graphs. In this paper, we represent the
spatiotemporal relationships through product graphs and develop a first
principle graph-time convolutional neural network (GTCNN). The GTCNN is a
compositional architecture with each layer comprising a graph-time
convolutional module, a graph-time pooling module, and a nonlinearity. We
develop a graph-time convolutional filter by following the shift-and-sum
principles of the convolutional operator to learn higher-level features over
the product graph. The product graph itself is parametric so that we can learn
also the spatiotemporal coupling from data. We develop a zero-pad pooling that
preserves the spatial graph (the prior about the data) while reducing the
number of active nodes and the parameters. Experimental results with synthetic
and real data corroborate the different components and compare with baseline
and state-of-the-art solutions.

<p>In an order-driven financial market, the price of a financial asset is
discovered through the interaction of orders - requests to buy or sell at a
particular price - that are posted to the public limit order book (LOB).
Therefore, LOB data is extremely valuable for modelling market dynamics.
However, LOB data is not freely accessible, which poses a challenge to market
participants and researchers wishing to exploit this information. Fortunately,
trades and quotes (TAQ) data - orders arriving at the top of the LOB, and
trades executing in the market - are more readily available. In this paper, we
present the LOB recreation model, a first attempt from a deep learning
perspective to recreate the top five price levels of the LOB for small-tick
stocks using only TAQ data. Volumes of orders sitting deep in the LOB are
predicted by combining outputs from: (1) a history compiler that uses a Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) module to selectively compile prediction relevant quote
history; (2) a market events simulator, which uses an Ordinary Differential
Equation Recurrent Neural Network (ODE-RNN) to simulate the accumulation of net
order arrivals; and (3) a weighting scheme to adaptively combine the
predictions generated by (1) and (2). By the paradigm of transfer learning, the
source model trained on one stock can be fine-tuned to enable application to
other financial assets of the same class with much lower demand on additional
data. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two real world intraday LOB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently recreate the LOB
with high accuracy using only TAQ data as input.

<p>A fundamental task for artificial intelligence is learning. Deep Neural
Networks have proven to cope perfectly with all learning paradigms, i.e.
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, traditional
deep learning approaches make use of cloud computing facilities and do not
scale well to autonomous agents with low computational resources. Even in the
cloud, they suffer from computational and memory limitations, and they cannot
be used to model adequately large physical worlds for agents which assume
networks with billions of neurons. These issues are addressed in the last few
years by the emerging topic of sparse training, which trains sparse networks
from scratch. This paper discusses sparse training state-of-the-art, its
challenges and limitations while introducing a couple of new theoretical
research directions which has the potential of alleviating sparse training
limitations to push deep learning scalability well beyond its current
boundaries. Nevertheless, the theoretical advancements impact in complex
multi-agents settings is discussed from a real-world perspective, using the
smart grid case study.

<p>The activations of language transformers like GPT2 have been shown to
linearly map onto brain activity during speech comprehension. However, the
nature of these activations remains largely unknown and presumably conflate
distinct linguistic classes. Here, we propose a taxonomy to factorize the
high-dimensional activations of language models into four combinatorial
classes: lexical, compositional, syntactic, and semantic representations. We
then introduce a statistical method to decompose, through the lens of GPT2's
activations, the brain activity of 345 subjects recorded with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the listening of ~4.6 hours of
narrated text. The results highlight two findings. First, compositional
representations recruit a more widespread cortical network than lexical ones,
and encompass the bilateral temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Second,
contrary to previous claims, syntax and semantics are not associated with
separated modules, but, instead, appear to share a common and distributed
neural substrate. Overall, this study introduces a general framework to isolate
the distributed representations of linguistic constructs generated in
naturalistic settings.

<p>The (1+1)-evolution strategy (ES) with success-based step-size adaptation is
analyzed on a general convex quadratic function and its monotone
transformation, that is, $f(x) = g((x - x^*)^\mathrm{T} H (x - x^*))$, where
$g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a strictly increasing function, $H$ is a
positive-definite symmetric matrix, and $x^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the optimal
solution of $f$. The convergence rate, that is, the decrease rate of the
distance from a search point $m_t$ to the optimal solution $x^*$, is proven to
be in $O(\exp( - L / \mathrm{Tr}(H) ))$, where $L$ is the smallest eigenvalue
of $H$ and $\mathrm{Tr}(H)$ is the trace of $H$. This result generalizes the
known rate of $O(\exp(- 1/d ))$ for the case of $H = I_{d}$ ($I_d$ is the
identity matrix of dimension $d$) and $O(\exp(- 1/ (d\cdot\xi) ))$ for the case
of $H = \mathrm{diag}(\xi \cdot I_{d/2}, I_{d/2})$. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study in which the convergence rate of the
(1+1)-ES is derived explicitly and rigorously on a general convex quadratic
function, which depicts the impact of the distribution of the eigenvalues in
the Hessian $H$ on the optimization and not only the impact of the condition
number of $H$.

<p>In this paper, a multi-objective approach for the design of composite
data-driven mathematical models is proposed. It allows automating the
identification of graph-based heterogeneous pipelines that consist of different
blocks: machine learning models, data preprocessing blocks, etc. The
implemented approach is based on a parameter-free genetic algorithm (GA) for
model design called GPComp@Free. It is developed to be part of automated
machine learning solutions and to increase the efficiency of the modeling
pipeline automation. A set of experiments was conducted to verify the
correctness and efficiency of the proposed approach and substantiate the
selected solutions. The experimental results confirm that a multi-objective
approach to the model design allows achieving better diversity and quality of
obtained models. The implemented approach is available as a part of the
open-source AutoML framework FEDOT.

<p>Real-time scene reconstruction from depth data inevitably suffers from
occlusion, thus leading to incomplete 3D models. Partial reconstructions, in
turn, limit the performance of algorithms that leverage them for applications
in the context of, e.g., augmented reality, robotic navigation, and 3D mapping.
Most methods address this issue by predicting the missing geometry as an
offline optimization, thus being incompatible with real-time applications. We
propose a framework that ameliorates this issue by performing scene
reconstruction and semantic scene completion jointly in an incremental and
real-time manner, based on an input sequence of depth maps. Our framework
relies on a novel neural architecture designed to process occupancy maps and
leverages voxel states to accurately and efficiently fuse semantic completion
with the 3D global model. We evaluate the proposed approach quantitatively and
qualitatively, demonstrating that our method can obtain accurate 3D semantic
scene completion in real-time.

<p>The machine learning community has become increasingly interested in the
energy efficiency of neural networks. The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a
promising approach to energy-efficient computing, since its activation levels
are quantized into temporally sparse, one-bit values (i.e., "spike" events),
which additionally converts the sum over weight-activity products into a simple
addition of weights (one weight for each spike). However, the goal of
maintaining state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy when converting a non-spiking
network into an SNN has remained an elusive challenge, primarily due to spikes
having only a single bit of precision. Adopting tools from signal processing,
we cast neural activation functions as quantizers with temporally-diffused
error, and then train networks while smoothly interpolating between the
non-spiking and spiking regimes. We apply this technique to the Legendre Memory
Unit (LMU) to obtain the first known example of a hybrid SNN outperforming SotA
recurrent architectures -- including the LSTM, GRU, and NRU -- in accuracy,
while reducing activities to at most 3.74 bits on average with 1.26 significant
bits multiplying each weight. We discuss how these methods can significantly
improve the energy efficiency of neural networks.

Open Practical Laboratories in Neurosciences are outreach activities aimed towards middle schoo students in the Brazilian Amazon, discussing neuroscience topics. The outreach led to immediate benefits on attitudes towards science and scientists, which led to better understanding of the neurosciences.

Abstract
The Open Practical Laboratory in the Neurosciences is an outreach program that seeks to improve the knowledge of the neurosciences by elementary school students and to promote better attitudes in relation to neuroscience, science in general, and scientists. It consists in practical and demonstration activities on the theme of the neurosciences. This outreach strategy was applied in four public schools in a municipality in Southeastern Pará, Brazil characterized by low performance in educational reviews in Brazil. Students from both sexes from 9th grade (last grade before high school) were enrolled in the program. The outreach program improved students’ knowledge about the neurosciences, and promoted better attitudes in relation to science and scientists, in comparison to students who did not go through the activities. Results suggest that scientific outreach strategies can produce results beyond immediate increases in knowledge, promoting better attitudes in relation to science.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is widely associated with cerebellar dysfunction and altered cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity (FC) that lead to cognitive impairments. Evidence for this association comes from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies that assess time-averaged measures of FC across the duration of a typical scan. This approach, however, precludes the assessment of potentially FC dynamics happening at faster timescales. In this study, using rsfMRI data, we aim at exploring cerebro-cerebellar FC dynamics in AUD patients (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 18) and age- and sex-matched controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 18). In particular, we quantified group-level differences in the temporal variability of FC between the posterior cerebellum and large-scale cognitive systems, and we investigated the role of the cerebellum in large-scale brain dynamics in terms of the temporal flexibility and integration of its regions. We found that, relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited significantly greater FC variability between the cerebellum and both the frontoparietal executive control (<em class="a-plus-plus">F</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">1,31</sub> = 7.01, p(FDR) = 0.028) and ventral attention (<em class="a-plus-plus">F</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">1,31</sub> = 7.35, p(FDR) = 0.028) networks. Moreover, the AUD group exhibited significantly less flexibility (<em class="a-plus-plus">F</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">1,31</sub> = 8.61, p(FDR) = 0.028) and greater integration (<em class="a-plus-plus">F</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">1,31</sub> = 9.11, p(FDR) = 0.028) in the cerebellum. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we found distributed changes in the dynamics of canonical large-scale networks in AUD. Overall, this study brings evidence of AUD-related alterations in dynamic FC within major cerebro-cerebellar networks. This pattern has implications for explaining the development and maintenance of this disorder and improving our understating of the cerebellum’s involvement in addiction.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">We investigate a simple model for motor pattern generation that combines central pattern generator (CPG) dynamics with a sensory feedback (FB) mechanism. Our CPG comprises a half-center oscillator with conductance-based Morris–Lecar model neurons. Output from the CPG drives a push–pull motor system with biomechanics based on experimental data. A sensory feedback conductance from the muscles allows modulation of the CPG activity. We consider parameters under which the isolated CPG system has either “escape” or “release” dynamics, and we study both inhibitory and excitatory feedback conductances. We find that increasing the FB conductance relative to the CPG conductance makes the system more robust against external perturbations, but more susceptible to internal noise. Conversely, increasing the CPG conductance relative to the FB conductance has the opposite effects. We find that the “closed-loop” system, with sensory feedback in place, exhibits a richer repertoire of behaviors than the “open-loop” system, with motion determined entirely by the CPG dynamics. Moreover, we find that purely feedback-driven motor patterns, analogous to a chain reflex, occur only in the inhibition-mediated system. Finally, for pattern generation systems with inhibition-mediated sensory feedback, we find that the distinction between escape- and release-mediated CPG mechanisms is diminished in the presence of internal noise. Our observations support an anti-reductionist view of neuromotor physiology: Understanding mechanisms of robust motor control requires studying not only the central pattern generator circuit in isolation, but the intact closed-loop system as a whole.</p>

<p>This review summarizes our current knowledge of human disease-relevant genetic variants within the family of voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channelopathies cover a wide spectrum of diseases including epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, developmental delay, cerebellar ataxias and degeneration, severe cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, eye disease and endocrine disorders such as congential hyperinsulinism and hyperaldosteronism. A special focus will be on the rapidly increasing number of de novo missense mutations identified in the pore-forming α1-subunits with next generation sequencing studies of well-defined patient cohorts. In contrast to likely gene disrupting mutations these can not only cause a channel loss-of-function but can also induce typical functional changes permitting enhanced channel activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Such gain-of-function mutations could represent therapeutic targets for mutation-specific therapy of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channelopathies with existing or novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel inhibitors. Moreover, many pathogenic mutations affect positive charges in the voltage sensors with the potential to form gating-pore currents through voltage sensors. If confirmed in functional studies, specific blockers of gating-pore currents could also be of therapeutic interest.</p>

<p>Transcriptionally profiling minor cellular populations remains an ongoing challenge in molecular genomics. Single-cell RNA sequencing has provided valuable insights into a number of hypotheses, but practical and analytical challenges have limited its widespread adoption. A similar approach, which we term single-cell type RNA sequencing (sctRNA-seq), involves the enrichment and sequencing of a pool of cells, yielding cell type-level resolution transcriptomes. While this approach offers benefits in terms of mRNA sampling from targeted cell types, it is potentially affected by off-target contamination from surrounding cell types. Here, we leveraged single-cell sequencing datasets to apply a computational approach for estimating and controlling the amount of off-target cell type contamination in sctRNA-seq datasets. In datasets obtained using a number of technologies for cell purification, we found that most sctRNA-seq datasets tended to show some amount of off-target mRNA contamination from surrounding cells. However, using covariates for cellular contamination in downstream differential expression analyses increased the quality of our models for differential expression analysis in case/control comparisons and typically resulted in the discovery of more differentially expressed genes. In general, our method provides a flexible approach for detecting and controlling off-target cell type contamination in sctRNA-seq datasets.</p>

Background<p>Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later stages. In contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve lesions in DN predominate at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the upper limb, nerve functions can be impaired at early stages of DN.</p>Materials and Methods<p>In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study, participants underwent diffusion-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in order to calculate the sciatic nerve’s fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. Results were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue Pegboard Test.</p>Results<p>Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 25 age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with diabetes, the sciatic nerve’s FA showed positive correlations with tibial and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.56; p &lt; 0.001, respectively), and tibial and peroneal nerve compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.63; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve’s FA was correlated with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p &lt; 0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p &lt; 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p = 0.007).</p>Conclusion<p>This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve’s FA is a surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of both upper and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, suggesting that nerve damage in these patients is not restricted to the level of the symptomatic limbs but rather affects the entire peripheral nervous system.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.602798">Word Detection in Individual Subjects Is Difficult to Probe With Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation</a></h4>

<p>Measuring cognition in single subjects presents unique challenges. On the other hand, individually sensitive measurements offer extraordinary opportunities, from informing theoretical models to enabling truly individualised clinical assessment. Here, we test the robustness of fast, periodic, and visual stimulation (FPVS), an emerging method proposed to elicit detectable responses to written words in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of individual subjects. The method is non-invasive, passive, and requires only a few minutes of testing, making it a potentially powerful tool to test comprehension in those who do not speak or who struggle with long testing procedures. In an initial study, Lochy et al. (2015) used FPVS to detect word processing in eight out of 10 fluent French readers. Here, we attempted to replicate their study in a new sample of 10 fluent English readers. Participants viewed rapid streams of pseudo-words with words embedded at regular intervals, while we recorded their EEG. Based on Lochy et al. (2015) we expected that words would elicit a steady-state response at the word-presentation frequency (2 Hz) over parieto-occipital electrode sites. However, across 40 datasets (10 participants, two conditions, and two regions of interest–ROIs), only four datasets met the criteria for a unique response to words. This corresponds to a 10% detection rate. We conclude that FPVS should be developed further before it can serve as an individually-sensitive measure of written word processing.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.541369">Baseline Differences in Anxiety Affect Attention and tDCS-Mediated Learning</a></h4>

<p>Variable responses to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocols across individuals are widely reported, but the reasons behind this variation are unclear. This includes tDCS protocols meant to improve attention. Attentional control is impacted by top-down and bottom-up processes, and this relationship is affected by state characteristics such as anxiety. According to Attentional Control Theory, anxiety biases attention towards bottom-up and stimulus-driven processing. The goal of this study was to explore the extent to which differences in state anxiety and related measures affect visual attention and category learning, both with and without the influence of tDCS. Using discovery learning, participants were trained to classify pictures of European streets into two categories while receiving 30 min of 2.0 mA anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the rVLPFC. The pictures were classifiable according to two separate rules, one stimulus and one hypothesis-driven. The Remote Associates Test (RAT), Profile of Mood States, and Attention Networks Task (ANT) were used to understand the effects of individual differences at baseline on subsequent tDCS-mediated learning. Multinomial logistic regression was fit to predict rule learning based on the baseline measures, with subjects classified according to whether they used the stimulus-driven or hypothesis-driven rule to classify the pictures. The overall model showed a classification accuracy of 74.1%. The type of tDCS stimulation applied, attentional orienting score, and self-reported mood were significant predictors of different categories of rule learning. These results indicate that anxiety can influence the quality of subjects’ attention at the onset of the task and that these attentional differences can influence tDCS-mediated category learning during the rapid assessment of visual scenes. These findings have implications for understanding the complex interactions that give rise to the variability in response to tDCS.</p>

<p>Several studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have reported dysregulation of cerebral metals, particularly decreases in copper and increases in iron in substantia nigra (SN). However, few studies have investigated regions outside the SN, fewer have measured levels of multiple metals across different regions within the same brains, and there are no currently-available reports of metal levels in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). This study aimed to compare concentrations of nine essential metals across nine different brain regions in cases of PDD and controls. Investigated were: primary motor cortex (MCX); cingulate gyrus (CG); primary visual cortex (PVC); hippocampus (HP); cerebellar cortex (CB); SN; locus coeruleus (LC); medulla oblongata (MED); and middle temporal gyrus (MTG), thus covering regions with severe, moderate, or low levels of neuronal loss in PDD. Levels of eight essential metals and selenium were determined using an analytical methodology involving the use of inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and compared between cases and controls, to better understand the extent and severity of metal perturbations. Findings were also compared with those from our previous study of sporadic Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD), which employed equivalent methods, to identify differences and similarities between these conditions. Widespread copper decreases occurred in PDD in seven of nine regions (exceptions being LC and CB). Four PDD-affected regions showed similar decreases in ADD: CG, HP, MTG, and MCX. Decreases in potassium and manganese were present in HP, MTG and MCX; decreased manganese was also found in SN and MED. Decreased selenium and magnesium were present in MCX, and decreased zinc in HP. There was no evidence for increased iron in SN or any other region. These results identify alterations in levels of several metals across multiple regions of PDD brain, the commonest being widespread decreases in copper that closely resemble those in ADD, pointing to similar disease mechanisms in both dementias.</p>

<p>Background: The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein as a potential biomarker has been challenged mainly due to variable preanalytical measures between laboratories. To evaluate the impact of the preanalytical factors contributing to such variability, the different subforms of alpha-synuclein need to be studied individually.</p><p>Method: We investigated the effect of exposing CSF samples to several preanalytical sources of variability: (1) different polypropylene (PP) storage tubes; (2) use of non-ionic detergents; (3) multiple tube transfers; (4) multiple freeze-thaw cycles; and (5) delayed storage. CSF oligomeric- and total-alpha-synuclein levels were estimated using our in-house sandwich-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.</p><p>Results: Siliconized tubes provided the optimal preservation of CSF alpha-synuclein proteins among other tested polypropylene tubes. The use of tween-20 detergent significantly improved the recovery of oligomeric-alpha-synuclein, while multiple freeze-thaw cycles significantly lowered oligomeric-alpha-synuclein in CSF. Interestingly, oligomeric-alpha-synuclein levels remained relatively stable over multiple tube transfers and upon delayed storage.</p><p>Conclusion: Our study showed for the first-time distinct impact of preanalytical factors on the different forms of CSF alpha-synuclein. These findings highlight the need for special considerations for the different forms of alpha-synuclein during CSF samples’ collection and processing.</p>

<p>Background: The reticulospinal tract (RST) is essential for balance, posture, and strength, all functions which falter with age. We hypothesized that age-related strength reductions might relate to differential changes in corticospinal and reticulospinal connectivity.</p><p>Methods: We divided 83 participants (age 20–84) into age groups &lt;50 (n = 29) and ≥50 (n = 54) years; five of which had probable sarcopenia. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied to the left cortex, inducing motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the biceps muscles bilaterally. Contralateral (right, cMEPs) and ipsilateral (left, iMEPs) MEPs are carried by mainly corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways respectively; the iMEP/cMEP amplitude ratio (ICAR) therefore measured the relative importance of the two descending tracts. Grip strength was measured with a dynamometer and normalized for age and sex.</p><p>Results: We found valid iMEPs in 74 individuals (n = 44 aged ≥50, n = 29 &lt; 50). Younger adults had a significant negative correlation between normalized grip strength and ICAR (r = −0.37, p = 0.045); surprisingly, in older adults, the correlation was also significant, but positive (r = 0.43, p = 0.0037).</p><p>Discussion: Older individuals who maintain or strengthen their RST are stronger than their peers. We speculate that reduced RST connectivity could predict those at risk of age-related muscle weakness; interventions that reinforce the RST could be a candidate for treatment or prevention of sarcopenia.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66638">Intact synapse structure and function after combined knockout of PTPδ, PTPσ and LAR</a></h4>

It has long been proposed that Leukocyte common Antigen-Related Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are cell-adhesion proteins that control synapse assembly. Their synaptic nanoscale localization, however, is not established, and synapse fine structure after knockout of the three vertebrate LAR-RPTPs (PTPδ, PTPσ and LAR) has not been tested. Here, superresolution microscopy reveals that PTPδ localizes to the synaptic cleft precisely apposed to postsynaptic scaffolds of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We next assessed synapse structure in newly generated triple-conditional knockout mice for PTPδ, PTPσ and LAR, complementing a recent independent study of synapse function after LAR-RPTP ablation (Sclip and Südhof, 2020). While mild effects on synaptic vesicle clustering and active zone architecture were detected, synapse numbers and their overall structure were unaffected, membrane anchoring of the active zone persisted, and vesicle docking and release were normal. Hence, despite their localization at synaptic appositions, LAR-RPTPs are dispensable for presynapse structure and function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65924">A mobile genetic element increases bacterial host fitness by manipulating development</a></h4>

Horizontal gene transfer is a major force in bacterial evolution. Mobile genetic elements are responsible for much of horizontal gene transfer and also carry beneficial cargo genes. Uncovering strategies used by mobile genetic elements to benefit host cells is crucial for understanding their stability and spread in populations. We describe a benefit that ICE<i>Bs1</i>, an integrative and conjugative element of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, provides to its host cells. Activation of ICE<i>Bs1</i> conferred a frequency-dependent selective advantage to host cells during two different developmental processes: biofilm formation and sporulation. These benefits were due to inhibition of biofilm-associated gene expression and delayed sporulation by ICE<i>Bs1</i>-containing cells, enabling them to exploit their neighbors and grow more prior to development. A single ICE<i>Bs1</i> gene, <i>devI </i>(formerly <i>ydcO</i>), was both necessary and sufficient for inhibition of development. Manipulation of host developmental programs allows ICE<i>Bs1</i> to increase host fitness, thereby increasing propagation of the element.

Calmodulin (CaM) engages in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interactions with numerous proteins, including a still incompletely understood physical and functional interaction with the human Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger NHE1. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype and mutant NHE1, we discovered multiple accessible states of this functionally important complex existing in different NHE1:CaM stoichiometries and structures. We determined the NMR solution structure of a ternary complex in which CaM links two NHE1 cytosolic tails. <i>In vitro</i>, stoichiometries and affinities could be tuned by variations in NHE1:CaM ratio and calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) and by phosphorylation of S648 in the first CaM-binding a-helix<i>.</i> In cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-induced NHE1 activity was reduced by mimicking S648 phosphorylation and by mutation of the first CaM-binding a-helix<i>,</i> whereas it was unaffected by inhibition of Akt, one of several kinases phosphorylating S648. Our results demonstrate a diversity of NHE1:CaM interaction modes and suggest that CaM may contribute to NHE1 dimerization and thereby augment NHE1 regulation. We propose that a similar structural diversity is of relevance to many other CaM complexes.

<p>by Timothy J. Hackmann, Bo Zhang</p>

Microbes can metabolize more chemical compounds than any other group of organisms. As a result, their metabolism is of interest to investigators across biology. Despite the interest, information on metabolism of specific microbes is hard to access. Information is buried in text of books and journals, and investigators have no easy way to extract it out. Here we investigate if neural networks can extract out this information and predict metabolic traits. For proof of concept, we predicted two traits: whether microbes carry one type of metabolism (fermentation) or produce one metabolite (acetate). We collected written descriptions of 7,021 species of bacteria and archaea from <i>Bergey’s Manual</i>. We read the descriptions and manually identified (labeled) which species were fermentative or produced acetate. We then trained neural networks to predict these labels. In total, we identified 2,364 species as fermentative, and 1,009 species as also producing acetate. Neural networks could predict which species were fermentative with 97.3% accuracy. Accuracy was even higher (98.6%) when predicting species also producing acetate. Phylogenetic trees of species and their traits confirmed that predictions were accurate. Our approach with neural networks can extract information efficiently and accurately. It paves the way for putting more metabolic traits into databases, providing easy access of information to investigators.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NvmhGOIwmeU" width="1" />

<p>by Kasper Vinken, Hans Op de Beeck</p>

In the last two decades rodents have been on the rise as a dominant model for visual neuroscience. This is particularly true for earlier levels of information processing, but a number of studies have suggested that also higher levels of processing such as invariant object recognition occur in rodents. Here we provide a quantitative and comprehensive assessment of this claim by comparing a wide range of rodent behavioral and neural data with convolutional deep neural networks. These networks have been shown to capture hallmark properties of information processing in primates through a succession of convolutional and fully connected layers. We find that performance rodent object vision tasks can be captured using low to mid-level convolutional layers only, without any convincing evidence for the need of higher layers known to simulate complex object recognition in primates. Our approach also reveals surprising insights on assumptions made before, for example, that the best performing animals would be the ones using the most abstract representations–which we show to likely be incorrect. Our findings suggest a road ahead for further studies aiming at quantifying and establishing the richness of representations underlying information processing in animal models at large.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DH-8i_4KE7Q" width="1" />

<p>by Su Datt Lam, M. Madan Babu, Jonathan Lees, Christine A. Orengo</p>

Alternative splicing can expand the diversity of proteomes. Homologous mutually exclusive exons (MXEs) originate from the same ancestral exon and result in polypeptides with similar structural properties but altered sequence. Why would some genes switch homologous exons and what are their biological impact? Here, we analyse the extent of sequence, structural and functional variability in MXEs and report the first large scale, structure-based analysis of the biological impact of MXE events from different genomes. MXE-specific residues tend to map to single domains, are highly enriched in surface exposed residues and cluster at or near protein functional sites. Thus, MXE events are likely to maintain the protein fold, but alter specificity and selectivity of protein function. This comprehensive resource of MXE events and their annotations is available at: http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/mxemod/. These findings highlight how small, but significant changes at critical positions on a protein surface are exploited in evolution to alter function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sYPzhby_lWI" width="1" />

<p>by Yanbo Lian, Ali Almasi, David B. Grayden, Tatiana Kameneva, Anthony N. Burkitt, Hamish Meffin</p>

There are two distinct classes of cells in the primary visual cortex (V1): simple cells and complex cells. One defining feature of complex cells is their spatial phase invariance; they respond strongly to oriented grating stimuli with a preferred orientation but with a wide range of spatial phases. A classical model of complete spatial phase invariance in complex cells is the energy model, in which the responses are the sum of the squared outputs of two linear spatially phase-shifted filters. However, recent experimental studies have shown that complex cells have a diverse range of spatial phase invariance and only a subset can be characterized by the energy model. While several models have been proposed to explain how complex cells could learn to be selective to orientation but invariant to spatial phase, most existing models overlook many biologically important details. We propose a biologically plausible model for complex cells that learns to pool inputs from simple cells based on the presentation of natural scene stimuli. The model is a three-layer network with rate-based neurons that describes the activities of LGN cells (layer 1), V1 simple cells (layer 2), and V1 complex cells (layer 3). The first two layers implement a recently proposed simple cell model that is biologically plausible and accounts for many experimental phenomena. The neural dynamics of the complex cells is modeled as the integration of simple cells inputs along with response normalization. Connections between LGN and simple cells are learned using Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity. Connections between simple and complex cells are learned using a modified version of the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) rule. Our results demonstrate that the learning rule can describe a diversity of complex cells, similar to those observed experimentally.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DTbVhPHbb3w" width="1" />

Evolutionary innovations underlie the rise of diversity and complexity—the 2 long-term trends in the history of life. How does natural selection redesign multiple interacting parts to achieve a new emergent function? We investigated the evolution of a biomechanical innovation, the latch-spring mechanism of trap-jaw ants, to address 2 outstanding evolutionary problems: how form and function change in a system during the evolution of new complex traits, and whether such innovations and the diversity they beget are repeatable in time and space. Using a new phylogenetic reconstruction of 470 species, and X-ray microtomography and high-speed videography of representative taxa, we found the trap-jaw mechanism evolved independently 7 to 10 times in a single ant genus (<i>Strumigenys</i>), resulting in the repeated evolution of diverse forms on different continents. The trap mechanism facilitates a 6 to 7 order of magnitude greater mandible acceleration relative to simpler ancestors, currently the fastest recorded acceleration of a resettable animal movement. We found that most morphological diversification occurred after evolution of latch-spring mechanisms, which evolved via minor realignments of mouthpart structures. This finding, whereby incremental changes in form lead to a change of function, followed by large morphological reorganization around the new function, provides a model for understanding the evolution of complex biomechanical traits, as well as insights into why such innovations often happen repeatedly.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rs2fK7Oquks" width="1" />

<p>We recently developed original electroencephalogram indices focusing on
microwaves of flattish period (named $\tau$), which correlated with volatile
anesthesia concentration in dogs. However, this mechanism remains unclear.
$\tau$ was defined as a subthreshold wave and burst wave was defined as an
above-threshold wave. This study shows that these indices well quantified the
morphological features of local field potential waveforms in mice, and made it
possible to discriminate the specific waveforms of the state of consciousness;
awake, shallow sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, and non-rapid eye movement
sleep. In addition, examination of $\tau$ suggested that microwaves are local
fluctuations of the electrode that can be formed for each data sampling, and
that its amplitude may increase with the degree of arousal.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Technologies that enable frequent, objective, and precise measurement of ataxia severity would benefit clinical trials by lowering participation barriers and improving the ability to measure disease state and change. We hypothesized that analyzing characteristics of sub-second movement profiles obtained during a reaching task would be useful for objectively quantifying motor characteristics of ataxia. Participants with ataxia (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>=88), participants with parkinsonism (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>=44), and healthy controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>=34) performed a computer tablet version of the finger-to-nose test while wearing inertial sensors on their wrists. Data features designed to capture signs of ataxia were extracted from participants’ decomposed wrist velocity time-series. A machine learning regression model was trained to estimate overall ataxia severity, as measured by the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). Classification models were trained to distinguish between ataxia participants and controls and between ataxia and parkinsonism phenotypes. Movement decomposition revealed expected and novel characteristics of the ataxia phenotype. The distance, speed, duration, morphology, and temporal relationships of decomposed movements exhibited strong relationships with disease severity. The regression model estimated BARS with a root mean square error of 3.6 points, <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup> = 0.69, and moderate-to-excellent reliability. Classification models distinguished between ataxia participants and controls and ataxia and parkinsonism phenotypes with areas under the receiver-operating curve of 0.96 and 0.89, respectively. Movement decomposition captures core features of ataxia and may be useful for objective, precise, and frequent assessment of ataxia in home and clinic environments.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular malformations that may result in headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and hemorrhage. CCMs occur sporadically (80%) or in familial form (20%), with autosomal dominant inheritance. Among the three CCM-related genes, mutations in <em class="a-plus-plus">KRIT1</em> account for 53–65% of familial cases and more than 100 different mutations have been identified so far. In the present work, we describe the clinical, neuroradiological, and genetic findings of sixteen CCM Italian patients, 13 belonging to 4 unrelated families and 3 sporadic cases. Six distinct <em class="a-plus-plus">KRIT1</em> gene variants, two novel (c.1730+1_1730+3del, c.1664 C&gt;T) and four previously described (c.966G&gt;A, c.1255-1G&gt;A c.1197_1200del, c.1255-1_1256del), were identified, including a possible de novo mutation. All the variants resulted in a premature stop codon. Cerebral 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple CCMs in all the mutation carriers for whom it was available, including sporadic cases. One patient had also cutaneous angiomas. Among the mutation carriers, symptomatic patients constituted 66% and a variable phenotypic expression was observed. Our data confirms phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance of neurological symptoms in <em class="a-plus-plus">KRIT1</em>-positive families, expands the mutational spectrum of this gene, and highlights how sporadic cases with multiple lesions need an approach similar to individuals with familial CCM.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Meta-analyses suggest that the published literature represents only a small minority of the total data collected in biomedical research, with most becoming ‘dark data’ unreported in the literature. Dark data is due to publication bias toward novel results that confirm investigator hypotheses and omission of data that do not. Publication bias contributes to scientific irreproducibility and failures in bench-to-bedside translation. Sharing dark data by making it Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) may reduce the burden of irreproducible science by increasing transparency and support data-driven discoveries beyond the lifecycle of the original study. We illustrate feasibility of dark data sharing by recovering original raw data from the Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study (MASCIS), an NIH-funded multi-site preclinical drug trial conducted in the 1990s that tested efficacy of several therapies after a spinal cord injury (SCI). The original drug treatments did not produce clear positive results and MASCIS data were stored in boxes for more than two decades. The goal of the present study was to independently confirm published machine learning findings that perioperative blood pressure is a major predictor of SCI neuromotor outcome (Nielson et al., <span class="a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r49">2015</span>). We recovered, digitized, and curated the data from 1125 rats from MASCIS. Analyses indicated that high perioperative blood pressure at the time of SCI is associated with poorer health and worse neuromotor outcomes in more severe SCI, whereas low perioperative blood pressure is associated with poorer health and worse neuromotor outcome in moderate SCI. These findings confirm and expand prior results that a narrow window of blood-pressure control optimizes outcome, and demonstrate the value of recovering dark data for assessing reproducibility of findings with implications for precision therapeutic approaches.</p>

<p>Brain network connections rewire adaptively in response to neural activity. Adaptive rewiring may be understood as a process which, at its every step, is aimed at optimizing the efficiency of signal diffusion. In evolving model networks, this amounts to creating shortcut connections in regions with high diffusion and pruning where diffusion is low. Adaptive rewiring leads over time to topologies akin to brain anatomy: small worlds with rich club and modular or centralized structures. We continue our investigation of adaptive rewiring by focusing on three desiderata: specificity of evolving model network architectures, robustness of dynamically maintained architectures, and flexibility of network evolution to stochastically deviate from specificity and robustness. Our adaptive rewiring model simulations show that specificity and robustness characterize alternative modes of network operation, controlled by a single parameter, the rewiring interval. Small control parameter shifts across a critical transition zone allow switching between the two modes. Adaptive rewiring exhibits greater flexibility for skewed, lognormal connection weight distributions than for normally distributed ones. The results qualify adaptive rewiring as a key principle of self-organized complexity in network architectures, in particular of those that characterize the variety of functional architectures in the brain.</p>

<p>Chronic stress as a known risk factor leads to hyperactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in both depression and anxiety. However, the stress-induced dysfunction of the HPA axis in these disorders especially the common and unique molecular dysregulations have not been well-explored. Previously, we utilized a chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm to segregate and gain depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups. In this study, we continue to examine the possible protein expression alterations of the hypothalamus as the center of the HPA axis in these three groups by using a proteomic approach. Though isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative analysis, a total of 593 dysregulated proteins were identified. These were potentially associated with vulnerability and adaptability of CMS-caused depression or anxiety and therefore might become novel investigative protein targets. Further independent analysis using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) indicated that 5, 7, and 21 dysregulated proteins were specifically associated with depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups, respectively, suggesting that the same CMS differently affected the regulation system of the rat hypothalamic proteome. In summary, the current proteomic research on the hypothalamus provided insights into the specific and common molecular basis for the HPA dysfunction mechanisms that underlie resiliency and vulnerability to stress-induced depression or anxiety.</p>

<p>Cell therapy is an emerging approach to stroke treatment with a potential to limit brain damage and enhance its restoration after the acute phase of the disease. In this study we tested directly reprogrammed neural precursor cells (drNPC) derived from adult human bone marrow cells in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of acute ischemic stroke using human placenta mesenchymal stem cells (pMSC) as a positive control with previously confirmed efficacy. Cells were infused into the ipsilateral (right) internal carotid artery of male Wistar rats 24 h after MCAO. The main goal of this work was to evaluate real-time distribution and subsequent homing of transplanted cells in the brain. This was achieved by performing intra-arterial infusion directly inside the MRI scanner and allowed transplanted cells tracing starting from their first pass through the brain vessels. Immediately after transplantation, cells were observed in the periphery of the infarct zone and in the brain stem, 15 min later small numbers of cells could be discovered deep in the infarct core and in the contralateral hemisphere, where drNPC were seen earlier and in greater numbers than pMSC. Transplanted cells in both groups could no longer be detected in the rat brain 48–72 h after infusion. Histological and histochemical analysis demonstrated that both the drNPC and pMSC were localized inside blood vessels in close contact with the vascular wall. No passage of labeled cells through the blood brain barrier was observed. Additionally, the therapeutic effects of drNPC and pMSC were compared. Both drNPC and pMSC induced substantial attenuation of neurological deficits evaluated at the 7th and 14th day after transplantation using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Some of the effects of drNPC and pMSC, such as the influence on the infarct volume and the survival rate of animals, differed. The results suggest a paracrine mechanism of the positive therapeutic effects of IA drNPC and pMSC infusion, potentially enhanced by the cell-cell interactions. Our data also indicate that the long-term homing of transplanted cells in the brain is not necessary for the brain’s functional recovery.</p>

<p>In recent years, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been hugely beneficial for cognitive neuroscience by making new experiment designs possible and by increasing the inferential power of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and other neuroimaging methodologies. In a similar time frame, “deep learning” (a term for the use of artificial neural networks with convolutional, recurrent, or similarly sophisticated architectures) has produced a parallel revolution in the field of machine learning and has been employed across a wide variety of applications. Traditional MVPA also uses a form of machine learning, but most commonly with much simpler techniques based on linear calculations; a number of studies have applied deep learning techniques to neuroimaging data, but we believe that those have barely scratched the surface of the potential deep learning holds for the field. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to deep learning for those new to the technique, explore the logistical pros and cons of using deep learning to analyze neuroimaging data – which we term “deep MVPA,” or dMVPA – and introduce a new software toolbox (the “Deep Learning In Neuroimaging: Exploration, Analysis, Tools, and Education” package, DeLINEATE for short) intended to facilitate dMVPA for neuroscientists (and indeed, scientists more broadly) everywhere.</p>

<p>Is brain structure related to function? Can one predict the other? These are questions that are still waiting to be answered definitively. In this paper we seek to investigate these questions, in particular, we are interested in the relation between brain structure and theory of mind (ToM). ToM is defined as the ability to attribute mental states to others. Previous studies have observed correlations between performance on ToM tasks, and gray-matter size/volume in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and precuneus (PCu). Despite these findings, there are concerns about false positive results and replicability issues. In this study we used two different tasks to evaluate ToM, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), and the Short Story Task (SST). Performance in these tasks was correlated to brain anatomy measures including voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness (CT) analysis, from ninety-one neurotypical participants. High-resolution structural brain images were acquired, and whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses were implemented. The analyses did not show statistically significant associations between ToM performance and brain structural measures after correction. Significant associations between performance on ToM tests and a widespread array of regions loosely associated with ToM were observed only for whole brain uncorrected analysis (p &lt; 0.001). These results do not replicate a previous study with neurotypical participants. We tested two different ToM tests, two different softwares for VBM and CT, and we used two samples, one with 91 and a sub-sample with 69 participants. Neither of these conditions made a difference in the results obtained. Consequently, these results suggest that if the population is neurotypical and homogenous, it is unlikely that a reliable association between brain anatomy measures and ToM performance, as measured with these tasks, may be found.</p>

<p>Direct electrical stimulation (DES) has been widely applied in both guidance of lesion resection and scientific research; however, the design and selection of intraoperative cognitive mapping tasks have not been updated in a very long time. We introduce updated mapping tasks for language and non-language functions and provide recommendations for optimal design and selection of intraoperative mapping tasks. In addition, with DES becoming more critical in current neuroscientific research, a task design that has not been widely used in DES yet (subtraction and conjunction paradigms) was introduced for more delicate mapping of brain functions especially for research purposes. We also illustrate the importance of designing a common task series for DES and other non-invasive mapping techniques. This review gives practical updated guidelines for advanced application of DES in clinical and neuroscientific research.</p>

<p>The globus pallidus externa (GPe) functions as a central hub in the basal ganglia for processing motor and non-motor information through the creation of complex connections with the other basal ganglia nuclei and brain regions. Recently, with the adoption of sophisticated genetic tools, substantial advances have been made in understanding the distinct molecular, anatomical, electrophysiological, and functional properties of GPe neurons and non-neuronal cells. Impairments in dopamine transmission in the basal ganglia contribute to Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder that severely affects the patients' life quality. Altered GPe neuron activity and synaptic connections have also been found in both PD patients and pre-clinical models. In this review, we will summarize the main findings on the composition, connectivity and functionality of different GPe cell populations and the potential GPe-related mechanisms of PD symptoms to better understand the cell type and circuit-specific roles of GPe in both normal and PD conditions.</p>

<p>The past decade has seen growing support for the critical brain hypothesis, i.e., the possibility that the brain could operate at or very near a critical state between two different dynamical regimes. Such critical states are well-studied in different disciplines, therefore there is potential for a continued transfer of knowledge. Here, I revisit foundations of bifurcation theory, the mathematical theory of transitions. While the mathematics is well-known it's transfer to neural dynamics leads to new insights and hypothesis.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs movement as well as causing multiple other symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, and cognitive changes. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and loss of dopamine terminals in the striatum contribute to characteristic motor features. Although therapies ease the symptoms of PD, there are no treatments to slow its progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that synaptic impairments and axonal degeneration precede neuronal cell body loss. Early synaptic changes may be a target to prevent disease onset and slow progression. Imaging of PD patients with radioligands, post-mortem pathologic studies in sporadic PD patients, and animal models of PD demonstrate abnormalities in presynaptic terminals as well as postsynaptic dendritic spines. Dopaminergic and excitatory synapses are substantially reduced in PD, and whether other neuronal subtypes show synaptic defects remains relatively unexplored. Genetic studies implicate several genes that play a role at the synapse, providing additional support for synaptic dysfunction in PD. In this review article we: (1) provide evidence for synaptic defects occurring in PD before neuron death; (2) describe the main genes implicated in PD that could contribute to synapse dysfunction; and (3) show correlations between the expression of Snca mRNA and mouse homologs of PD GWAS genes demonstrating selective enrichment of Snca and synaptic genes in dopaminergic, excitatory and cholinergic neurons. Altogether, these findings highlight the need for novel therapeutics targeting the synapse and suggest that future studies should explore the roles for PD-implicated genes across multiple neuron types and circuits.</p>

<p>Afferent neurons and their mechanoreceptors provide critical sensory feedback for gait. The anatomical distribution and density of afferents and mechanoreceptors influence sensory feedback, as does mechanoreceptor function. Electrophysiological studies of hind paw skin reveal the different types of afferent responses and their receptive fields, however, the anatomical distribution of mechanoreceptor endings is unknown. Also, the role of integrin α1β1 in mechanoreceptor function is unclear, though it is expressed by keratinocytes in the stratum basale where it is likely involved in a variety of mechanotransduction pathways and ion channel functionalities. For example, it has been shown that integrin α1β1 is necessary for the function of TRPV4 that is highly expressed by afferent units. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine and compare the distribution of mechanoreceptors across the hind paw skin and the footfall patterns of itga1-null and wild type mice. The itga1-null mouse is lacking the integrin α1 subunit, which binds exclusively to the β1 subunit, thus rendering integrin α1β1 nonfunctional while leaving the numerous other pairings of the β1 subunit undisturbed. Intact hind paws were processed, serially sectioned, and stained to visualize mechanoreceptors. Footfall patterns were analyzed as a first step in correlating mechanoreceptor distribution and functionality. Merkel cells and Meissner-like corpuscles were present, however, Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles were not observed. Meissner-like corpuscles were located exclusively in the glabrous skin of the footpads and digit tips, however, Merkel cells were found throughout hairy and glabrous skin. The increased density of Merkel cells and Meissner-like corpuscles in footpads 1 and 3 and Meissner-like corpuscles in footpad 4 suggests their role in anteroposterior balance, while Meissner-like corpuscle concentrations in digits 2 and 5 support their role in mediolateral balance. Finally, a larger density of Meissner-like corpuscles in footpads 3 and 4 in male itga1-null mice compared to wild type controls paves the way for future site-specific single fiber in vivo recordings to provide insight into the role of integrin α1β1 in tactile mechanotransduction.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65587">Archaeal chromatin 'slinkies' are inherently dynamic complexes with deflected DNA wrapping pathways</a></h4>

Eukaryotes and many archaea package their DNA with histones. While the four eukaryotic histones wrap ~147 DNA base pairs into nucleosomes, archaeal histones form 'nucleosome-like' complexes that continuously wind between 60 - 500 base pairs of DNA ('archaeasomes'), suggested by crystal contacts and analysis of cellular chromatin. Solution structures of large archaeasomes (&gt;90 DNA base pairs) have never been directly observed. Here, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations, analytical ultracentrifugation, and cryoEM to structurally characterize the solution state of archaeasomes on longer DNA. Simulations reveal dynamics of increased accessibility without disruption of DNA-binding or tetramerization interfaces. Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentration influences compaction, and cryoEM densities illustrate that DNA is wrapped in consecutive substates arranged 90<sup>o</sup> out-of-plane with one another. Without ATP-dependent remodelers, archaea may leverage these inherent dynamics to balance chromatin packing and accessibility.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65427">Ciliary neuropeptidergic signaling dynamically regulates excitatory synapses in postnatal neocortical pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

Primary cilia are compartmentalized sensory organelles present on the majority of neurons in the mammalian brain throughout adulthood. Recent evidence suggests that cilia regulate multiple aspects of neuronal development, including the maintenance of neuronal connectivity. However, whether ciliary signals can dynamically modulate postnatal circuit excitability is unknown. Here we show that acute cell-autonomous knockdown of ciliary signaling rapidly strengthens glutamatergic inputs onto cultured rat neocortical pyramidal neurons, and increases spontaneous firing. This increased excitability occurs without changes to passive neuronal properties or intrinsic excitability. Further, the neuropeptide receptor somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is localized nearly exclusively to excitatory neuron cilia both <i>in vivo</i> and in culture, and pharmacological manipulation of SSTR3 signaling bidirectionally modulates excitatory synaptic inputs onto these neurons. Our results indicate that ciliary neuropeptidergic signaling dynamically modulates excitatory synapses, and suggest that defects in this regulation may underlie a subset of behavioral and cognitive disorders associated with ciliopathies.

Numerous aspects of early hominin biology remain debated or simply unknown. However, recent developments in high-resolution imaging techniques have opened new avenues in the field of paleoanthropology. More specifically, X-ray synchrotron-based analytical imaging techniques have the potential to provide crucial details on the ontogeny, physiology, biomechanics, and biological identity of fossil specimens. Here we present preliminary results of our X-ray synchrotron-based investigation of the skull of the 3.67-million-year-old <i>Australopithecus</i> specimen StW 573 (‘Little Foot’) at the I12 beamline of the Diamond Light Source (United Kingdom). Besides showing fine details of the enamel (i.e., hypoplasias) and cementum (i.e., incremental lines), as well as of the cranial bone microarchitecture (e.g., diploic channels), our synchrotron-based investigation reveals for the first time the 3D spatial organization of the Haversian systems in the mandibular symphysis of an early hominin.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64767">Endoglycan plays a role in axon guidance by modulating cell adhesion</a></h4>

Axon navigation depends on the interactions between guidance molecules along the trajectory and specific receptors on the growth cone. However, our in vitro and in vivo studies on the role of Endoglycan demonstrate that in addition to specific guidance cue – receptor interactions, axon guidance depends on fine-tuning of cell-cell adhesion. Endoglycan, a sialomucin, plays a role in axon guidance in the central nervous system of chicken embryos, but it is neither an axon guidance cue nor a receptor. Rather Endoglycan acts as a negative regulator of molecular interactions based on evidence from <i>in vitro</i> experiments demonstrating reduced adhesion of growth cones . In the absence of Endoglycan, commissural axons fail to properly navigate the midline of the spinal cord. Taken together, our <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> results support the hypothesis that Endoglycan acts as a negative regulator of cell-cell adhesion, in commissural axon guidance.

COVID-19 poses a major challenge to care homes, as SARS-CoV-2 is readily transmitted and causes disproportionately severe disease in older people. Here, 1,167 residents from 337 care homes were identified from a dataset of 6,600 COVID-19 cases from the East of England. Older age and being a care home resident were associated with increased mortality. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available for 700 residents from 292 care homes. By integrating genomic and temporal data, 409 viral clusters within the 292 homes were identified, indicating two different patterns - outbreaks among care home residents and independent introductions with limited onward transmission. Approximately 70% of residents in the genomic analysis were admitted to hospital during the study, providing extensive opportunities for transmission between care homes and hospitals. Limiting viral transmission within care homes should be a key target for infection control to reduce COVID-19 mortality in this population.

Liquid-like condensates have been thought to be sphere-like. Recently, various condensates with filamentous morphology have been observed in cells. One such condensate is the TIS granule network that shares a large surface area with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is important for membrane protein trafficking. It has been unclear how condensates with mesh-like shapes, but dynamic protein components are formed. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> reconstitution experiments revealed that the minimal components are a multivalent RNA-binding protein that concentrates RNAs that are able to form extensive intermolecular mRNA-mRNA interactions. mRNAs with large unstructured regions have a high propensity to form a pervasive intermolecular interaction network that acts as condensate skeleton. The underlying RNA matrix prevents full fusion of spherical liquid-like condensates, thus driving the formation of irregularly shaped membraneless organelles. The resulting large surface area may promote interactions at the condensate surface and at the interface with other organelles.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63591">Functional specialization within the inferior parietal lobes across cognitive domains</a></h4>

The inferior parietal lobe (IPL) is a key neural substrate underlying diverse mental processes, from basic attention to language and social cognition, that define human interactions. Its putative domain-global role appears to tie into poorly understood differences between cognitive domains in both hemispheres. Across attentional, semantic, and social cognitive tasks, our study explored functional specialization within the IPL. The task specificity of IPL subregion activity was substantiated by distinct predictive signatures identified by multivariate pattern-learning algorithms. Moreover, the left and right IPL exerted domain-specific modulation of effective connectivity among their subregions. Task-evoked functional interactions of the anterior and posterior IPL subregions involved recruitment of distributed cortical partners. While anterior IPL subregions were engaged in strongly lateralized coupling links, both posterior subregions showed more symmetric coupling patterns across hemispheres. Our collective results shed light on how under-appreciated functional specialization in the IPL supports some of the most distinctive human mental capacities.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63431">tRNA sequences can assemble into a replicator</a></h4>

Can replication and translation emerge in a single mechanism via self-assembly? The key molecule, transfer RNA (tRNA), is one of the most ancient molecules and contains the genetic code. Our experiments show how a pool of oligonucleotides, adapted with minor mutations from tRNA, spontaneously formed molecular assemblies and replicated information autonomously using only reversible hybridization under thermal oscillations. The pool of cross-complementary hairpins self-selected by agglomeration and sedimentation. The metastable DNA hairpins bound to a template and then interconnected by hybridization. Thermal oscillations separated replicates from their templates and drove an exponential, cross-catalytic replication. The molecular assembly could encode and replicate binary sequences with a replication fidelity corresponding to 85–90 % per nucleotide. The replication by a self-assembly of tRNA-like sequences suggests that early forms of tRNA could have been involved in molecular replication. This would link the evolution of translation to a mechanism of molecular replication.

Microdosing is the practice of regularly using low doses of psychedelic drugs. Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing enhances well-being and cognition; however, such accounts are potentially biased by the placebo effect. This study used a ‘self-blinding’ citizen science initiative, where participants were given online instructions on how to incorporate placebo control into their microdosing routine without clinical supervision. The study was completed by 191 participants, making it the largest placebo-controlled trial on psychedelics to-date. All psychological outcomes improved significantly from baseline to after the 4 weeks long dose period for the microdose group; however, the placebo group also improved and no significant between-groups differences were observed. Acute (emotional state, drug intensity, mood, energy, and creativity) and post-acute (anxiety) scales showed small, but significant microdose vs. placebo differences; however, these results can be explained by participants breaking blind. The findings suggest that anecdotal benefits of microdosing can be explained by the placebo effect.

Falciparum malaria is clinically heterogeneous and the relative contribution of parasite and host in shaping disease severity remains unclear. We explored the interaction between inflammation and parasite variant surface antigen (VSA) expression, asking whether this relationship underpins the variation observed in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). We uncovered marked heterogeneity in the host response to blood challenge; some volunteers remained quiescent, others triggered interferon-stimulated inflammation and some showed transcriptional evidence of myeloid cell suppression. Significantly, only inflammatory volunteers experienced hallmark symptoms of malaria. When we tracked temporal changes in parasite VSA expression to ask whether variants associated with severe disease rapidly expand in naive hosts, we found no transcriptional evidence to support this hypothesis. These data indicate that parasite variants that dominate severe malaria do not have an intrinsic growth or survival advantage; instead, they presumably rely upon infection-induced changes in their within-host environment for selection.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61241">Loss of circadian protection against influenza infection in adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as neonates</a></h4>

Adverse early-life exposures have a lasting negative impact on health. Neonatal hyperoxia that is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia confers susceptibility to influenza A virus (IAV) infection later in life. Given our previous findings that the circadian clock protects against IAV, we asked if the long-term impact of neonatal hyperoxia vis-à-vis IAV infection includes circadian disruption. Here, we show that neonatal hyperoxia abolishes the clock-mediated time of day protection from IAV in mice, independent of viral burden through host tolerance pathways. We discovered that the lung intrinsic clock (and not the central or immune clocks) mediated this dysregulation. Loss of circadian protein, <i>Bmal1</i>, in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells recapitulates the increased mortality, loss of temporal gating, and other key features of hyperoxia-exposed animals. Our data suggest a novel role for the circadian clock in AT2 cells in mediating long-term effects of early-life exposures to the lungs.

The naÃ¯ve antibody/B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires of different individuals ought to exhibit significant functional commonality, given that most pathogens trigger an effective antibody response to immunodominant epitopes. Sequence-based repertoire analysis has so far offered little evidence for this phenomenon. For example, a recent study estimated the number of shared (‘public’) antibody clonotypes in circulating baseline repertoires to be around 0.02% across ten unrelated individuals. However, to engage the same epitope, antibodies only require a similar binding site structure and the presence of key paratope interactions, which can occur even when their sequences are dissimilar. Here, we search for evidence of geometric similarity/convergence across human antibody repertoires. We first structurally profile naÃ¯ve (‘baseline’) antibody diversity using snapshots from 41 unrelated individuals, predicting all modellable distinct structures within each repertoire. This analysis uncovers a high (much greater than random) degree of structural commonality. For instance, around 3% of distinct structures are common to the ten most diverse individual samples (‘Public Baseline’ structures). Our approach is the first computational method to find levels of BCR commonality commensurate with epitope immunodominance and could therefore be harnessed to find more genetically distant antibodies with same-epitope complementarity. We then apply the same structural profiling approach to repertoire snapshots from three individuals before and after flu vaccination, detecting a convergent structural drift indicative of recognising similar epitopes (‘Public Response’ structures). We show that Antibody Model Libraries derived from Public Baseline and Public Response structures represent a powerful geometric basis set of low-immunogenicity candidates exploitable for general or target-focused therapeutic antibody screening.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cwym7GH65-E" width="1" />

Human pluripotent stem cells hold significant promise for regenerative medicine. However, long differentiation protocols and immature characteristics of stem cell-derived cell types remain challenges to the development of many therapeutic applications. In contrast to the slow differentiation of human stem cells <i>in vitro</i> that mirrors a nine-month gestation period, mouse stem cells develop according to a much faster three-week gestation timeline. Here, we tested if co-differentiation with mouse pluripotent stem cells could accelerate the differentiation speed of human embryonic stem cells. Following a six-week RNA-sequencing time course of neural differentiation, we identified 929 human genes that were upregulated earlier and 535 genes that exhibited earlier peaked expression profiles in chimeric cell cultures than in human cell cultures alone. Genes with accelerated upregulation were significantly enriched in Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis, neuron differentiation and maturation, and synapse signaling. Moreover, chimeric mixed samples correlated with <i>in utero</i> human embryonic samples earlier than human cells alone, and acceleration was dose-dependent on human-mouse co-culture ratios. The altered gene expression patterns and developmental rates described in this report have implications for accelerating human stem cell differentiation and the use of interspecies chimeric embryos in developing human organs for transplantation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R_ZWkRZkSEY" width="1" />

Repurposed drugs that are safe and immediately available constitute a first line of defense against new viral infections. Despite limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs are being tested as medication or as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Using a stochastic model of early phase infection, we evaluate the success of prophylactic treatment with different drug types to prevent viral infection. We find that there exists a critical efficacy that a treatment must reach in order to block viral establishment. Treatment by a combination of drugs reduces the critical efficacy, most effectively by the combination of a drug blocking viral entry into cells and a drug increasing viral clearance. Below the critical efficacy, the risk of infection can nonetheless be reduced. Drugs blocking viral entry into cells or enhancing viral clearance reduce the risk of infection more than drugs that reduce viral production in infected cells. The larger the initial inoculum of infectious virus, the less likely is prevention of an infection. In our model, we find that as long as the viral inoculum is smaller than 10 infectious virus particles, viral infection can be prevented almost certainly with drugs of 90% efficacy (or more). Even when a viral infection cannot be prevented, antivirals delay the time to detectable viral loads. The largest delay of viral infection is achieved by drugs reducing viral production in infected cells. A delay of virus infection flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, possibly reducing transmission and symptom severity. Thus, antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uMOozT2lkZE" width="1" />

<p>by Kseniia Cheloshkina, Maria Poptsova</p>

Understanding mechanisms of cancer breakpoint mutagenesis is a difficult task and predictive models of cancer breakpoint formation have to this time failed to achieve even moderate predictive power. Here we take advantage of a machine learning approach that can gather important features from big data and quantify contribution of different factors. We performed comprehensive analysis of almost 630,000 cancer breakpoints and quantified the contribution of genomic and epigenomic features–non-B DNA structures, chromatin organization, transcription factor binding sites and epigenetic markers. The results showed that transcription and formation of non-B DNA structures are two major processes responsible for cancer genome fragility. Epigenetic factors, such as chromatin organization in TADs, open/closed regions, DNA methylation, histone marks are less informative but do make their contribution. As a general trend, individual features inside the groups show a relatively high contribution of G-quadruplexes and repeats and CTCF, GABPA, RXRA, SP1, MAX and NR2F2 transcription factors. Overall, the cancer breakpoint landscape can be represented by well-predicted hotspots and poorly predicted individual breakpoints scattered across genomes. We demonstrated that hotspot mutagenesis has genomic and epigenomic factors, and not all individual cancer breakpoints are just random noise but have a definite mutation signature. Besides we found a long-range action of some features on breakpoint mutagenesis. Combining omics data, cancer-specific individual feature importance and adding the distant to local features, predictive models for cancer breakpoint formation achieved 70–90% ROC AUC for different cancer types; however precision remained low at 2% and the recall did not exceed 50%. On the one hand, the power of models strongly correlates with the size of available cancer breakpoint and epigenomic data, and on the other hand finding strong determinants of cancer breakpoint formation still remains a challenge. The strength of predictive signals of each group and of each feature inside a group can be converted into cancer-specific breakpoint mutation signatures. Overall our results add to the understanding of cancer genome rearrangement processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xh0PAVy_OrE" width="1" />

While mortality from malaria continues to decline globally, incidence rates in many countries are rising. Within countries, spatial and temporal patterns of malaria vary across communities due to many different physical and social environmental factors. To identify those areas most suitable for malaria elimination or targeted control interventions, we used Bayesian models to estimate the spatiotemporal variation of malaria risk, rates, and trends and determine areas of high or low malaria burden compared to their geographical neighbours. We present a methodology using Bayesian hierarchical models with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based inference to fit a generalised linear mixed model with a conditional autoregressive structure. We modelled clusters of similar spatiotemporal trends in malaria risk, using trend functions with constrained shapes and visualised high and low burden districts using a multi-criterion index derived by combining spatiotemporal risk, rates and trends of districts in Zambia. Our results indicate that over 3 million people in Zambia live in high-burden districts with either high mortality burden or high incidence burden coupled with an increasing trend over 16 years (2000 to 2015) for all age, under-five and over-five cohorts. Approximately 1.6 million people live in high-incidence burden areas alone. Using our method, we have developed a platform that can enable malaria programs in countries like Zambia to target those high-burden areas with intensive control measures while at the same time pursue malaria elimination efforts in all other areas. Our method enhances conventional approaches and measures to identify those districts, which had higher rates and increasing trends and risk. This study provides a method, and a means that can help policy makers evaluate intervention impact over time and adopt appropriate geographically targeted strategies that address the issues of both high-burden areas, through intensive control approaches, and low-burden areas, via specific elimination programs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ltKHubuqHHw" width="1" />

<p>by Jilt Sebastian, Mriganka Sur, Hema A. Murthy, Mathew Magimai-Doss</p>

Spiking information of individual neurons is essential for functional and behavioral analysis in neuroscience research. Calcium imaging techniques are generally employed to obtain activities of neuronal populations. However, these techniques result in slowly-varying fluorescence signals with low temporal resolution. Estimating the temporal positions of the neuronal action potentials from these signals is a challenging problem. In the literature, several generative model-based and data-driven algorithms have been studied with varied levels of success. This article proposes a neural network-based signal-to-signal conversion approach, where it takes as input raw-fluorescence signal and learns to estimate the spike information in an end-to-end fashion. Theoretically, the proposed approach formulates the spike estimation as a single channel source separation problem with unknown mixing conditions. The source corresponding to the action potentials at a lower resolution is estimated at the output. Experimental studies on the spikefinder challenge dataset show that the proposed signal-to-signal conversion approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art-methods in terms of Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and yields comparable performance for the area under the receiver operating characteristics measure. We also show that the resulting system: (a) has low complexity with respect to existing supervised approaches and is reproducible; (b) is layer-wise interpretable, and (c) has the capability to generalize across different calcium indicators.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m7z83a4wkUQ" width="1" />

Recent concerns about the reproducibility of science have led to several calls for more open and transparent research practices and for the monitoring of potential improvements over time. However, with tens of thousands of new biomedical articles published per week, manually mapping and monitoring changes in transparency is unrealistic. We present an open-source, automated approach to identify 5 indicators of transparency (data sharing, code sharing, conflicts of interest disclosures, funding disclosures, and protocol registration) and apply it across the entire open access biomedical literature of 2.75 million articles on PubMed Central (PMC). Our results indicate remarkable improvements in some (e.g., conflict of interest [COI] disclosures and funding disclosures), but not other (e.g., protocol registration and code sharing) areas of transparency over time, and map transparency across fields of science, countries, journals, and publishers. This work has enabled the creation of a large, integrated, and openly available database to expedite further efforts to monitor, understand, and promote transparency and reproducibility in science.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l0TdCjmsGF0" width="1" />

The blink reflex is critical for protecting the eyes and spreading the tear film, and is a commonly used for learning model. We demonstrate monosynaptic trigeminal (shown here) and disynaptic reticular formation pathways connecting the principal and the spinal trigeminal nucleus (pars caudalis) with orbicularis oculi motoneurons in the macaque monkey.







Abstract
The trigeminal blink reflex plays an important role in protecting the corneal surface from damage and preserving visual function in an unpredictable environment. The closing phase of the human reflex, produced by activation of the orbicularis oculi (ObOc) muscles, consists of an initial, small, ipsilateral R1 component, followed by a larger, bilateral R2 component. We investigated the circuitry that underlies this reflex in macaque (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta) monkeys by the use of single and dual tracer methods. Injection of retrograde tracer into the facial nucleus labeled neurons in the principal trigeminal nucleus, and in the spinal nucleus pars oralis and interpolaris, bilaterally, and in pars caudalis, ipsilaterally. Injection of anterograde tracer into the principal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ObOc motoneurons, with an ipsilateral predominance. Injection of anterograde tracer into pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ipsilateral ObOc motoneurons. The observed pattern of labeling indicates that the reticular formation ventromedial to the principal and spinal nuclei also contributes extensive bilateral input to ObOc motoneurons. Thus, much of the trigeminal sensory complex is in a position to supply a monosynaptic drive for lid closure, and the adjacent reticular formation can supply a disynaptic drive. These findings indicate that the assignment of the R1 and R2 components of the blink reflex to different parts of the trigeminal sensory complex cannot be exclusively based on subdivision connectional relationships with facial motoneurons. The characteristics of the R2 component may be due, instead, to other circuit properties.

Objective
This study was undertaken to describe a novel biomarker of germ cell tumor and associated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS).


Methods
Archival sera from patients with germ cell tumor–associated PNS were evaluated. We identified a common autoantigen in a human testicular cancer cell line (TCam‐2) by Western blot and mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein Western blot, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cell‐based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/cerebrospinal fluid.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)–immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected in 28 patients' sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range = 28–84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &gt;1:6,400, normal value &lt; 1:50). Coexistent kelchlike protein 11–IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28, 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n = 5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n = 2, 7%), and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n = 4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27, 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan (43%) were extratesticular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ cell tumors were found in 4 patients. Exposure of T‐cell–dendritic‐cell cocultures from chronic immunosuppression‐naïve LUZP4‐IgG–seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+ T‐cell–mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and antitumor potential. ANN NEUROL 2021

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.643526">Making the World Behave: A New Embodied Account on Mobile Paradigm</a></h4>

<p>In this review article, we describe the mobile paradigm, a method used for more than 50 years to assess how infants learn and remember sensorimotor contingencies. The literature on the mobile paradigm demonstrates that infants below 6 months of age can remember the learning environment weeks after when reminded periodically and integrate temporally distributed information across modalities. The latter ability is only possible if events occur within a temporal window of a few days, and the width of this required window changes as a function of age. A major critique of these conclusions is that the majority of this literature has neglected the embodied experience, such that motor behavior was considered an equivalent developmental substitute for verbal behavior. Over recent years, simulation and empirical work have highlighted the sensorimotor aspect and opened up a discussion for possible learning mechanisms and variability in motor preferences of young infants. In line with this recent direction, we present a new embodied account on the mobile paradigm which argues that learning sensorimotor contingencies is a core feature of development forming the basis for active exploration of the world and body. In addition to better explaining recent findings, this new framework aims to replace the dis-embodied approach to the mobile paradigm with a new understanding that focuses on variance and representations grounded in sensorimotor experience. Finally, we discuss a potential role for the dorsal stream which might be responsible for guiding action according to visual information, while infants learn sensorimotor contingencies in the mobile paradigm.</p>

<p>Modular organization is an emergent property of brain networks, responsible for shaping communication processes and underpinning brain functioning. Moreover, brain networks are intrinsically multilayer since their attributes can vary across time, subjects, frequency, or other domains. Identifying the modular structure in multilayer brain networks represents a gateway toward a deeper understanding of neural processes underlying cognition. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, thanks to their high temporal resolution, can give rise to multilayer networks able to follow the dynamics of brain activity. Despite this potential, the community organization has not yet been thoroughly investigated in brain networks estimated from EEG. Furthermore, at the state of the art, there is still no agreement about which algorithm is the most suitable to detect communities in multilayer brain networks, and a way to test and compare them all under a variety of conditions is lacking. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of three algorithms at the state of the art for multilayer community detection (namely, genLouvain, DynMoga, and FacetNet) as compared with an approach based on the application of a single-layer clustering algorithm to each slice of the multilayer network. We test their ability to identify both steady and dynamic modular structures. We statistically evaluate their performances by means of ad hoc benchmark graphs characterized by properties covering a broad range of conditions in terms of graph density, number of clusters, noise level, and number of layers. The results of this simulation study aim to provide guidelines about the choice of the more appropriate algorithm according to the different properties of the brain network under examination. Finally, as a proof of concept, we show an application of the algorithms to real functional brain networks derived from EEG signals collected at rest with closed and open eyes. The test on real data provided results in agreement with the conclusions of the simulation study and confirmed the feasibility of multilayer analysis of EEG-based brain networks in both steady and dynamic conditions.</p>

<p>The ability to extinguish fear memories when threats are no longer present is critical for adaptive behavior. Fear extinction represents a new learning process that eventually leads to the formation of extinction memories. Understanding the neural basis of fear extinction has considerable clinical significance as deficits in extinction learning are the hallmark of human anxiety disorders. In recent years, the dopamine (DA) system has emerged as one of the key regulators of fear extinction. In this review article, we highlight recent advances that have demonstrated the crucial role DA plays in mediating different phases of fear extinction. Emerging concepts and outstanding questions for future research are also discussed.</p>

Objective<p>Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are commonly classified into subtypes based on motor symptoms. The aims of the present study were to determine the consistency between PD motor subtypes, to assess the stability of PD motor subtypes over time, and to explore the variables influencing PD motor subtype stability.</p>Methods<p>This study was part of a longitudinal study of de novo PD patients at a single center. Based on three different motor subtype classification systems proposed by Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang, patients were respectively categorized as tremor-dominant/indeterminate/postural instability and gait difficulty (TD/indeterminate/PIGD), TD<sub>S</sub>/mixed<sub>S</sub>/akinetic-rigid<sub>S</sub> (ARS), or TD<sub>K</sub>/mixed<sub>K</sub>/AR<sub>K</sub> at baseline evaluation and then re-assessed 1 month later. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded at each evaluation. The consistency between subtypes at baseline evaluation was assessed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ). Additional variables were compared between PD subtype groups using the two-sample t-test, Mann–Whitney U-test or Chi-squared test.</p>Results<p>Of 283 newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients, 79 were followed up at 1 month. There was fair agreement between the Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang classification systems (κ<sub>S</sub> = 0.383 ± 0.044, κ<sub>K</sub> = 0.360 ± 0.042, κ<sub>SK</sub> = 0.368 ± 0.038). Among the three classification systems, the Schiess classification was the most stable and the Jankovic classification was the most unstable. The non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMSQuest) scores differed significantly between PD patients with stable and unstable subtypes based on the Jankovic classification (p = 0.008), and patients with a consistent subtype had more severe NMSQuest scores than patients with an inconsistent subtype.</p>Conclusion<p>Fair consistency was observed between the Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang classification systems. For the first time, non-motor symptoms (NMSs) scores were found to influence the stability of the TD/indeterminate/PIGD classification. Our findings support combining NMSs with motor symptoms to increase the effectiveness of PD subtypes.</p>

<p>Mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment (CI) in hypertensive patients remain relatively unclear. The present study aimed to explore the relationship among serum exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), and cognitive function in hypertensive patients. Seventy-three hypertensive patients with CI (HT-CI), 67 hypertensive patients with normal cognition (HT-NC), and 37 healthy controls underwent identification of exosomal miRNA, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and neuropsychological tests. CVR mapping was investigated based on resting-state functional MRI data. Compared with healthy subjects and HT-NC subjects, HT-CI subjects displayed decreased serum exosomal miRNA-330-3p. The group difference of CVR was mainly found in the left frontal lobe and demonstrated that HT-CI group had a lower CVR than both HT-NC group and control group. Furthermore, both the CVR in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the miRNA-330-3p level were significantly correlated with executive function (r = −0.275, P = 0.021, and r = −0.246, P = 0.04, respectively) in HT-CI subjects, and the CVR was significantly correlated with the miRNA-330-3p level (r = 0.246, P = 0.040). Notably, path analysis showed that the CVR mediated the association between miRNA-330-3p and executive function. In conclusion, decreased miRNA-330-3p might contribute to CI in hypertensive patients by decreasing frontal CVR and could be a biomarker of early diagnosis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634714">Social Exclusion Down-Regulates Pain Empathy at the Late Stage of Empathic Responses: Electrophysiological Evidence</a></h4>

<p>Social exclusion has a significant impact on cognition, emotion, and behavior. Some behavioral studies investigated how social exclusion affects pain empathy. Conclusions were inconsistent, and there is a lack of clarity in identifying which component of pain empathy is more likely to be affected. To investigate these issues, we used a Cyberball task to manipulate feelings of social exclusion. Two groups (social exclusion and social inclusion) participated in the same pain empathy task while we recorded event-related potentials (ERP) when participants viewed static images of body parts in painful and neutral situations. The results showed early N2 differentiation between painful and neutral pictures in the central regions in both groups. The pattern at the late controlled processing stage was different. Parietal P3 amplitudes for painful pictures were significantly smaller than those for neutral pictures in the social exclusion group; they did not differ in the social inclusion group. We observed a parietal late positive potential (LPP) differentiation between painful and neutral pictures in both groups. LPP amplitudes were significantly smaller in the social exclusion group than those in the social inclusion group for painful stimuli. Our results indicate that social exclusion does not affect empathic responses during the early emotional sharing stage. However, it down-regulates empathic responses at the late cognitive controlled stage, and this modulation is attenuated gradually. The current study provides neuroscientific evidence of how social exclusion dynamically influences pain empathy.</p>

<p>Background: Treating medication-refractory freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains challenging despite several trials reporting improvements in motor symptoms using subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS). Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region DBS has been used for medication-refractory FoG, with mixed findings. FoG, as a paroxysmal phenomenon, provides an ideal framework for the possibility of closed-loop DBS (CL-DBS).</p><p>Methods: In this clinical trial (NCT02318927), five subjects with medication-refractory FoG underwent bilateral GPi DBS implantation to address levodopa-responsive PD symptoms with open-loop stimulation. Additionally, PPN DBS leads were implanted for CL-DBS to treat FoG. The primary outcome of the study was a 40% improvement in medication-refractory FoG in 60% of subjects at 6 months when “on” PPN CL-DBS. Secondary outcomes included device feasibility to gauge the recruitment potential of this four-lead DBS approach for a potentially larger clinical trial. Safety was judged based on adverse events and explantation rate.</p><p>Findings: The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated as we recruited five subjects with both “on” and “off” medication freezing. The safety for this population of patients receiving four DBS leads was suboptimal and associated with a high explantation rate of 40%. The primary clinical outcome in three of the five subjects was achieved at 6 months. However, the group analysis of the primary clinical outcome did not reveal any benefit.</p><p>Interpretation: This study of a human PPN CL-DBS trial in medication-refractory FoG showed feasibility in recruitment, suboptimal safety, and a heterogeneous clinical effect in FoG outcomes.</p>

<p>Traditional synaptic plasticity experiments and models depend on tight temporal correlations between pre- and postsynaptic activity. These tight temporal correlations, on the order of tens of milliseconds, are incompatible with significantly longer behavioral time scales, and as such might not be able to account for plasticity induced by behavior. Indeed, recent findings in hippocampus suggest that rapid, bidirectional synaptic plasticity which modifies place fields in CA1 operates at behavioral time scales. These experimental results suggest that presynaptic activity generates synaptic eligibility traces both for potentiation and depression, which last on the order of seconds. These traces can be converted to changes in synaptic efficacies by the activation of an instructive signal that depends on naturally occurring or experimentally induced plateau potentials. We have developed a simple mathematical model that is consistent with these observations. This model can be fully analyzed to find the fixed points of induced place fields and how these fixed points depend on system parameters such as the size and shape of presynaptic place fields, the animal's velocity during induction, and the parameters of the plasticity rule. We also make predictions about the convergence time to these fixed points, both for induced and pre-existing place fields.</p>

<p>Depressive conditions precipitated by repeated stress are a major socio-economical burden in Western countries. Previous studies showed that ATP-P<sub>2X7</sub> receptors (P<sub>2X7</sub>R) and adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>R) antagonists attenuate behavioral modifications upon exposure to repeated stress. Since it is unknown if these two purinergic modulation systems work independently, we now investigated a putative interplay between P<sub>2X7</sub>R and A<sub>2A</sub>R. Adult rats exposed to restraint stress for 14 days displayed an anxious (thigmotaxis, elevated plus maze), depressive (anhedonia, increased immobility), and amnesic (modified Y maze, object displacement) profile, together with increased expression of Iba-1 (a marker of microglia “activation”) and interleukin-1β (IL1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα; proinflammatory cytokines) and an up-regulation of P<sub>2X7</sub>R (mRNA) and A<sub>2A</sub>R (receptor binding) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. All these features were attenuated by the P<sub>2X7</sub>R-preferring antagonist brilliant blue G (BBG, 45 mg/kg, i.p.) or by caffeine (0.3 g/L, p.o.), which affords neuroprotection through A<sub>2A</sub>R blockade. Notably, BBG attenuated A<sub>2A</sub>R upregulation and caffeine attenuated P<sub>2X7</sub>R upregulation. In microglial N9 cells, the P<sub>2X7</sub>R agonist BzATP (100 μM) or the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist CGS26180 (100 nM) increased calcium levels, which was abrogated by the P<sub>2X7</sub>R antagonist JNJ47965567 (1 μM) and by the A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist SCH58261 (50 nM), respectively; notably JNJ47965567 prevented the effect of CGS21680 and the effect of BzATP was attenuated by SCH58261 and increased by CGS21680. These results provide the first demonstration of a functional interaction between P<sub>2X7</sub>R and A<sub>2A</sub>R controlling microglia reactivity likely involved in behavioral adaptive responses to stress and are illustrative of a cooperation between the two arms of the purinergic system in the control of brain function.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.617989">Spontaneous Ca2+ Fluctuations Arise in Thin Astrocytic Processes With Real 3D Geometry</a></h4>

<p>Fluctuations of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in astrocytes are regarded as a critical non-neuronal signal to regulate neuronal functions. Although such fluctuations can be evoked by neuronal activity, rhythmic astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations may also spontaneously arise. Experimental studies hint that these spontaneous astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations may lie behind different kinds of emerging neuronal synchronized activities, like epileptogenic bursts or slow-wave rhythms. Despite the potential importance of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in astrocytes, the mechanism by which they develop is poorly understood. Using simple 3D synapse models and kinetic data of astrocytic Glu transporters (EAATs) and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX), we have previously shown that NCX activity alone can generate markedly stable, spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in the astrocytic leaflet microdomain. Here, we extend that model by incorporating experimentally determined real 3D geometries of 208 excitatory synapses reconstructed from publicly available ultra-resolution electron microscopy datasets. Our simulations predict that the surface/volume ratio (SVR) of peri-synaptic astrocytic processes prominently dictates whether NCX-mediated spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations emerge. We also show that increased levels of intracellular astrocytic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration facilitate the appearance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations. These results further support the principal role of the dynamical reshaping of astrocyte processes in the generation of intrinsic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and their spreading over larger astrocytic compartments.</p>

<p>Background: The locus coeruleus (LC) is a nucleus in the human brainstem with a variety of noradrenaline-driven functions involved in cognition, emotions, and perception. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) constitutes a neurodegenerative disease involving deposits of alpha-synuclein, first appearing in the brainstem. The goal of this narrative review is to delineate the relationship between the expression of psychiatric symptoms as an early-onset of DLB and the degeneration of the LC's noradrenaline system.</p><p>Methods: We searched in PubMed for relevant articles concerning LC degeneration and psychiatric symptoms in prodromal DLB in this narrative review. We rely on the McKeith criteria for prodromal psychiatric DLB.</p><p>Results: We found four studies that document neuronal loss, deposits of Lewy bodies and other hints for neurodegeneration in the LC in patients with DLB. Furthermore, we reviewed theories and studies on how the degenerated noradrenaline LC system contributes to psychiatric DLB's phenotype. We hypothesized how anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, and depressive symptoms might occur in DLB patients due to degenerated noradrenergic neurons entailing consecutive altered noradrenergic transmission in the LC's projection areas.</p><p>Conclusions: LC degeneration in prodromal DLB might cause psychiatric symptoms as the first and non-motor manifestation of DLB, as the LC is affected earlier by degeneration than are dopaminergic structures such as the substantia nigra, which are impaired later in the disease course.</p>

<p>The decline of speech intelligibility in presbycusis can be regarded as resulting from the combined contribution of two main groups of factors: (1) audibility-related factors and (2) age-related factors. In particular, there is now an abundant scientific literature on the crucial role of suprathreshold auditory abilities and cognitive functions, which have been found to decline with age even in the absence of audiometric hearing loss. However, researchers investigating the direct effect of aging in presbycusis have to deal with the methodological issue that age and peripheral hearing loss covary to a large extent. In the present study, we analyzed a dataset of consonant-identification scores measured in quiet and in noise for a large cohort (n = 459, age = 42–92) of hearing-impaired (HI) and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. HI listeners were provided with a frequency-dependent amplification adjusted to their audiometric profile. Their scores in the two conditions were predicted from their pure-tone average (PTA) and age, as well as from their Extended Speech Intelligibility Index (ESII), a measure of the impact of audibility loss on speech intelligibility. We relied on a causal-inference approach combined with Bayesian modeling to disentangle the direct causal effects of age and audibility on intelligibility from the indirect effect of age on hearing loss. The analysis revealed that the direct effect of PTA on HI intelligibility scores was 5 times higher than the effect of age. This overwhelming effect of PTA was not due to a residual audibility loss despite amplification, as confirmed by a ESII-based model. More plausibly, the marginal role of age could be a consequence of the relatively little cognitively-demanding task used in this study. Furthermore, the amount of variance in intelligibility scores was smaller for NH than HI listeners, even after accounting for age and audibility, reflecting the presence of additional suprathreshold deficits in the latter group. Although the non-sense-syllable materials and the particular amplification settings used in this study potentially restrict the generalization of the findings, we think that these promising results call for a wider use of causal-inference analysis in audiology, e.g., as a way to disentangle the influence of the various cognitive factors and suprathreshold deficits associated to presbycusis.</p>

<p>Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnoses once depended on neuropathologic examination. Now, many widely used, validated biomarkers benefits for monitoring of AD neuropathologic changes. Exosome-derived biomarker studies have reported them to be significantly related to AD's early occurrence and development, although the findings are inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify exosome-derived biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p><p>Methods: PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic value of biomarkers, including data describing the pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR+), negative diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR–), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC). The quality of the included studies was assessed using RevMan 5.3 software. Publication bias was analyzed.</p><p>Results: In total, 19 eligible studies, including 3,742 patients, were selected for this meta-analysis. The SEN, SPE, DLR+, DLR–, DOR, and AUC (95% confidence intervals) of exosome-derived biomarkers in the diagnosis of AD or MCI were 0.83 (0.76–0.87), 0.82 (0.77–0.86), 4.53 (3.46–5.93), 0.21 (0.15–0.29), 17.27 (11.41–26.14), and 0.89 (0.86–0.92), respectively. Sub-group analyses revealed that studies based on serum or microRNA (miRNA) analysis, and those of Caucasian populations, AD patients, patient sample size &gt;50, neuron-derived exosomes (NDE) from plasma and p-tau had higher sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values.</p><p>Conclusion: Exosome-derived biomarkers have shown potential diagnostic value in AD and MCI, although further research is required for confirmation.</p>

<p>Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disorders, resulting in disability, and loss of self-sufficiency.</p><p>Objective: To establish an AD-like mice model, investigate the behavioral performance, and explore the potential mechanism.</p><p>Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ, 3 mg/kg) was microinjected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice, and the behavioral performance was observed. The serum concentrations of insulin and nesfatin-1 were measured by ELISA, and the activation of hippocampal microglia and astrocytes was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The protein expression of several molecular associated with the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) was detected via western blotting.</p><p>Results: The STZ-microinjected model mice showed a slower bodyweight gain and higher serum concentration of insulin and nesfatin-1. Although there was no significant difference between groups with regard to the ability of balance and motor coordination, the model mice presented a decline of spontaneous movement and exploratory behavior, together with an impairment of learning and memory ability. Increased activated microglia was aggregated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of model mice, together with an increase abundance of Aβ<sub>1−42</sub> and Tau in the hippocampus and PFC. Moreover, the protein expression of NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, SynGAP, PSD95, BDNF, and p-β-catenin/β-catenin were remarkably decreased in the hippocampus and the PFC of model mice, and the expression of p-GSK-3β (ser9)/GSK-3β were reduced in the hippocampus.</p><p>Conclusion: A bilateral hippocampal microinjection of STZ could induce not only AD-like behavioral performance in mice, but also adaptive changes of synaptic plasticity against neuroinflammatory and endocrinal injuries. The underlying mechanisms might be associated with the imbalanced expression of the key proteins of Wnt signaling pathway in the hippocampus and the PFC.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammation has been recognized as a major cause for neurocognitive diseases. Although the hippocampus has been considered an important region for cognitive dysfunction, the influence of hippocampal neuroinflammation on brain functional connectivity (FC) has been rarely studied.

Systemic and hippocampal inflammation were determined using ELISA, while astrocyte responses during hippocampal neuroinflammation were determined by interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β)/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) double staining immunofluorescence. Oxidative stress was determined by reactive oxidative species (ROS), electron transport chain (ETC) complex, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Short- (&lt;7 days) and long-term (&gt;30 days) learning and spatial working memory were tested by the Morris water maze (MWM). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to analyze the brain FC by placing seed voxels on the left and right hippocampus. Compared with the vehicle group, rats with the LPS exposure showed an impaired MWM performance, higher oxidative stress, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus. The neuroimaging examination showed decreased FC on the right orbital cortex, right olfactory bulb, and left hippocampus on day 3, 7, and 31, respectively, after treatment. In contrast, rats with SS-31 treatment showed lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, less astrocyte activation in the hippocampus, and improved MWM performance. Neuroimaging examination showed increased FC on the left-parietal association cortex (L-PAC), left sensory cortex, and left motor cortex on day 7 with the right flocculonodular lobe on day 31 as compared with those without SS-31 treatment. Our study demonstrated that inhibiting neuroinflammation in the hippocampus not only reduces inflammatory responses in the hippocampus but also improves the brain FC in regions related to the hippocampus. Furthermore, early anti-inflammatory treatment with SS-31 has a long-lasting effect on reducing the impact of LPS-induced neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Background: Normal aging is associated with working memory decline. A decrease in working memory performance is associated with age-related changes in functional activation patterns in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive training can improve cognitive performance in healthy older adults. We implemented a cognitive training study to assess determinants of generalization of training gains to untrained tasks, a key indicator for the effectiveness of cognitive training. We aimed to investigate the association of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of DLPFC with working memory performance improvement and cognitive gains after the training.</p><p>Method: A sample of 60 healthy older adults (mean age: 68 years) underwent a 4-week neuropsychological training, entailing a working memory task. Baseline resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) images were acquired in order to investigate the FC of DLPFC. To evaluate training effects, participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment before and after the training. A second follow-up assessment was applied 12 weeks after the training. We used cognitive scores of digit span backward and visual block span backward tasks representing working memory function. The training group was divided into subjects who had and who did not have training gains, which was defined as a higher improvement in working memory tasks than the control group (N = 19).</p><p>Results: A high FC of DLPFC of the right hemisphere was significantly associated with training gains and performance improvement in the visuospatial task. The maintenance of cognitive gains was restricted to the time period directly after the training. The training group showed performance improvement in the digit span backward task.</p><p>Conclusion: Functional activation patterns of the DLPFC were associated with the degree of working memory training gains and visuospatial performance improvement. Although improvement through cognitive training and acquisition of training gains are possible in aging, they remain limited.</p>

The study revealed a significant reduction of frequency and severity of seizure in patients of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults who were treated with valproate and melatonin

Abstract
Epilepsy treatment is challenging because of multiple impediments like lack of efficacy of monotherapy, adverse drug reactions, and different comorbidities. Add‐on therapy to first‐line antiepileptics may be the option to overcome therapeutic hurdles. The present randomized, double‐blind, add‐on placebo‐controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of add‐on melatonin in the treatment of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizure in adults. The control group (n = 52) received add‐on placebo, and the test group (n = 52) received add‐on melatonin (3 mg/day) with valproate (20 mg/kg in two divided doses). Clinical evaluation of seizure frequency, Chalfont‐National Hospital seizure severity scale (NHS3), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), quality of life in epilepsy inventory, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and biochemical estimation of serum neuron‐specific enolase (NSE) and glutathione reductase were done at baseline and compared with follow‐up at 8 weeks. Among 104 patients randomized [mean (SD) age of 27.6 (11.5); 84 (80.8%) male], 88 (84.6%) completed the trial. The responder rate and seizure‐free rate in the test group were significantly (p = 0.006 and 0.034) higher than the control group. There was a significantly higher reduction in the frequency of seizures (p = 0.016) and NHS3 (−2.39; 95%CI: −4.56 to −0.21; p = 0.032) in the test group compared to the control group. Similarly, improvement in PSQI (−1.40; 95%CI: −2.64 to −0.15; p = 0.029) was significantly better in the test group. There was no significant difference in the change in ESS (p = 0.621) and quality of life scoring (p = 0.456) between the study groups. The decrease in serum NSE was significantly higher with the test group compared to the control group (−2.01; 95% CI: −3.74 to −0.27; p = 0.024). Add‐on melatonin increased serum glutathione reductase significantly (p = 0.038), but there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.685). Add‐on melatonin with valproate for generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults can achieve a significantly better clinical outcome by reducing the seizure frequency, severity and attaining a better seizure‐free rate in comparison to the control group.

Objective
During PREVENT (NCT01892345), eculizumab significantly reduced relapse risk versus placebo in patients with aquaporin‐4 immunoglobulin G‐positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD). We report an interim analysis of PREVENT's ongoing open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02003144) evaluating eculizumab's long‐term safety and efficacy.


Methods
Patients who completed PREVENT could enroll in the OLE to receive eculizumab (maintenance dose = 1,200 mg/2 weeks, after a blinded induction phase). Safety and efficacy data from PREVENT and its OLE (interim data cut, July 31, 2019) were combined for this analysis.


Results
Across PREVENT and the OLE, 137 patients received eculizumab and were monitored for a median (range) of 133.3 weeks (5.1–276.9 weeks), for a combined total of 362.3 patient‐years (PY). Treatment‐related adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were 183.5 in 100 PY and 8.6 in 100 PY, respectively. Serious infection rates were 10.2 in 100 PY in eculizumab‐treated patients versus 15.1 in 100 PY in the PREVENT placebo group. No patient developed a meningococcal infection. At 192 weeks (3.7 years), 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6–97.3) of patients remained adjudicated relapse‐free. The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.025 (95% CI = 0.013–0.048) in all eculizumab‐treated patients versus 0.350 (95% CI = 0.199–0.616) in the PREVENT placebo group. During the OLE, 37% of patients (44 of 119 patients) stopped or decreased background immunosuppressive therapy use.


Interpretation
This analysis demonstrates that eculizumab's long‐term safety profile in NMOSD is consistent with its established profile across other indications. This analysis also demonstrated the sustained ability of long‐term eculizumab treatment to reduce relapse risk in patients with AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2021

Abstract
A prevailing view in cognitive neuroscience suggests that different forms of learning are mediated by dissociable memory systems, with a mesolimbic (i.e., midbrain and basal ganglia) system supporting incremental trial‐and‐error reinforcement learning and a hippocampal‐based system supporting episodic memory. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the hippocampus may also be important for trial‐and‐error learning, particularly value or reward‐based learning. In the present report, we use a lesion‐based neuropsychological approach to clarify hippocampal contributions to such learning. Six amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe damage and a group of healthy controls were administered a simple value‐based learning task involving probabilistic trial‐and‐error acquisition of stimulus–response‐outcome (reward or none) contingencies modeled after Li et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, 2011, 108
(1), 55–60). As predicted, patients were significantly impaired on the task, demonstrating reduced learning of the contingencies. Our results provide further supportive evidence that the hippocampus' role in cognition extends beyond episodic memory tasks and call for further refinement of theoretical models of hippocampal functioning.

Abstract
The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is evolutionarily conserved as one of the few sites of adult neurogenesis in mammals. Although there is clear evidence that neurogenesis is necessary for healthy hippocampal function, whether adult‐born neurons are simply integrated into existing hippocampal networks to serve a similar purpose to that of developmentally born neurons or whether they represent a discrete cell population with unique functions remains less clear. In this review, we consider evidence for discrete cellular, synaptic, and structural features of adult‐born DG neurons, suggesting that neurogenesis contributes to the formation of a heterogeneous DG. We therefore propose that hippocampal neurogenesis creates a specialized neuronal subpopulation that may play a key role in hippocampal functions like episodic memory. We note critical gaps in this extensive body of work, including a general failure to include female animals in relevant research and a need for more precise consideration of intrahippocampal neuroanatomy.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess early predictors of 9‐year disability in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis.


Methods
Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of 123 pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis were obtained at disease onset and after 1 and 2 years. A 9‐year clinical follow‐up was also performed. Cox proportional hazard and multivariable regression models were used to assess independent predictors of time to first relapse and 9‐year outcomes.


Results
Time to first relapse was predicted by optic nerve lesions (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10, p = 0.02) and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (HR = 0.31, p = 0.005). Predictors of annualized relapse rate were: at baseline, presence of cerebellar (β = −0.15, p &lt; 0.001), cervical cord lesions (β = 0.16, p = 0.003), and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (β = −0.14, p = 0.01); considering also 1‐year variables, number of relapses (β = 0.14, p = 0.002), and the previous baseline predictors; considering 2‐year variables, time to first relapse (2‐year: β = −0.12, p = 0.01) entered, whereas high‐efficacy treatment exposure exited the model. Predictors of 9‐year disability worsening were: at baseline, presence of optic nerve lesions (odds ratio [OR] = 6.45, p = 0.01); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) changes (1‐year: OR = 26.05, p &lt; 0.001; 2‐year: OR = 16.38, p = 0.02), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions in 2 years (2‐year: OR = 4.91, p = 0.02). Predictors of higher 9‐year EDSS score were: at baseline, EDSS score (β = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001), presence of brainstem lesions (β = 0.31, p = 0.04), and number of cervical cord lesions (β = 0.22, p = 0.05); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, EDSS changes (1‐year: β = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001; 2‐year: β = 0.55, p &lt; 0.001), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions (1‐year: β = 0.28, p = 0.03; 2‐year: β = 0.35, p = 0.01).


Interpretation
A complete baseline MRI assessment and an accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first 2 years of disease contribute to predict 9‐year prognosis in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2021

Two‐dimensional (2D) gene expression snapshots cannot properly reflect the volumes, positions, or overlapped domains of multiple genes in tissues that are organized in three‐dimensional (3D) naturally. Novel approach, combing fluorescent antisense mRNA labeling, confocal z‐stack acquisition, and 3D image alignment tool, has uncovered what have been overlooked by 2D images.

Abstract
The conserved bilateral habenular nuclei (HA) in vertebrate diencephalon develop into compartmentalized structures containing neurons derived from different cell lineages. Despite extensive studies demonstrated that zebrafish larval HA display distinct left–right (L‐R) asymmetry in gene expression and connectivity, the spatial gene expression domains were mainly obtained from two‐dimensional (2D) snapshots of colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization staining which could not properly reflect different HA neuronal lineages constructed in three‐dimension (3D). Combing the tyramide‐based fluorescent mRNA in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy and customized imaging processing procedures, we have created spatial distribution maps of four genes for 4‐day‐old zebrafish and in sibling fish whose L‐R asymmetry was spontaneously reversed. 3D volumetric analyses showed that ratios of cpd2, lov, ron, and nrp1a expression in L‐R reversed HA were reversed according to the parapineal positions. However, the quantitative changes of gene expression in reversed larval brains do not mirror the gene expression level in the obverse larval brains. There were a total 87.78% increase in lov+nrp1a+ and a total 12.45% decrease in lov+ron+ double‐positive neurons when the L‐R asymmetry of HA was reversed. Thus, our volumetric analyses of the 3D maps indicate that changes of HA neuronal cell fates are associated with the reversal of HA laterality. These changes likely account for the behavior changes associated with HA laterality alterations.

<p>by Inês G. Gonçalves, Jose Manuel Garcia-Aznar</p>

In this work, we show how the mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment modulate the growth of tumour spheroids. Based on the composition of the extracellular matrix, its stiffness and architecture can significantly vary, subsequently influencing cell movement and tumour growth. However, it is still unclear exactly how both of these processes are regulated by the matrix composition. Here, we present a centre-based computational model that describes how collagen density, which modulates the steric hindrance properties of the matrix, governs individual cell migration and, consequently, leads to the formation of multicellular clusters of varying size. The model was calibrated using previously published experimental data, replicating a set of experiments in which cells were seeded in collagen matrices of different collagen densities, hence producing distinct mechanical properties. At an initial stage, we tracked individual cell trajectories and speeds. Subsequently, the formation of multicellular clusters was also analysed by quantifying their size. Overall, the results showed that our model could accurately replicate what was previously seen experimentally. Specifically, we showed that cells seeded in matrices with low collagen density tended to migrate more. Accordingly, cells strayed away from their original cluster and thus promoted the formation of small structures. In contrast, we also showed that high collagen densities hindered cell migration and produced multicellular clusters with increased volume. In conclusion, this model not only establishes a relation between matrix density and individual cell migration but also showcases how migration, or its inhibition, modulates tumour growth.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sFxlUIOZPQE" width="1" />

<p>by Alex Hawkins-Hooker, Florence Depardieu, Sebastien Baur, Guillaume Couairon, Arthur Chen, David Bikard</p>

The vast expansion of protein sequence databases provides an opportunity for new protein design approaches which seek to learn the sequence-function relationship directly from natural sequence variation. Deep generative models trained on protein sequence data have been shown to learn biologically meaningful representations helpful for a variety of downstream tasks, but their potential for direct use in the design of novel proteins remains largely unexplored. Here we show that variational autoencoders trained on a dataset of almost 70000 luciferase-like oxidoreductases can be used to generate novel, functional variants of the <i>luxA</i> bacterial luciferase. We propose separate VAE models to work with aligned sequence input (MSA VAE) and raw sequence input (AR-VAE), and offer evidence that while both are able to reproduce patterns of amino acid usage characteristic of the family, the MSA VAE is better able to capture long-distance dependencies reflecting the influence of 3D structure. To confirm the practical utility of the models, we used them to generate variants of <i>luxA</i> whose luminescence activity was validated experimentally. We further showed that conditional variants of both models could be used to increase the solubility of <i>luxA</i> without disrupting function. Altogether 6/12 of the variants generated using the unconditional AR-VAE and 9/11 generated using the unconditional MSA VAE retained measurable luminescence, together with all 23 of the less distant variants generated by conditional versions of the models; the most distant functional variant contained 35 differences relative to the nearest training set sequence. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep generative models to explore the space of possible protein sequences and generate useful variants, providing a method complementary to rational design and directed evolution approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QpiAk3DhhIo" width="1" />

<p>by Viktor Sip, Julia Scholly, Maxime Guye, Fabrice Bartolomei, Viktor Jirsa</p>

Intracranial electroencephalography is a standard tool in clinical evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy. Various early electrographic seizure patterns differing in frequency, amplitude, and waveform of the oscillations are observed. The pattern most common in the areas of seizure propagation is the so-called theta-alpha activity (TAA), whose defining features are oscillations in the <i>θ</i> − <i>α</i> range and gradually increasing amplitude. A deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying the generation of the TAA pattern is however lacking. In this work we evaluate the hypothesis that the TAA patterns are caused by seizures spreading across the cortex. To do so, we perform simulations of seizure dynamics on detailed patient-derived cortical surfaces using the spreading seizure model as well as reference models with one or two homogeneous sources. We then detect the occurrences of the TAA patterns both in the simulated stereo-electroencephalographic signals and in the signals of recorded epileptic seizures from a cohort of fifty patients, and we compare the features of the groups of detected TAA patterns to assess the plausibility of the different models. Our results show that spreading seizure hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with the evidence available in the seizure recordings, and it can explain the features of the detected TAA groups best among the examined models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/G9bY6GLE3wg" width="1" />

<p>by Judith A. Bouman, Julien Riou, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Roland R. Regoes</p>

Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method—referred to as <i>mixture-model approach</i>—for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test’s ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3sv3SljaHIQ" width="1" />

<p>by Markus J. Sommer, Steven L. Salzberg</p>

Low-cost, high-throughput sequencing has led to an enormous increase in the number of sequenced microbial genomes, with well over 100,000 genomes in public archives today. Automatic genome annotation tools are integral to understanding these organisms, yet older gene finding methods must be retrained on each new genome. We have developed a universal model of prokaryotic genes by fitting a temporal convolutional network to amino-acid sequences from a large, diverse set of microbial genomes. We incorporated the new model into a gene finding system, Balrog (Bacterial Annotation by Learned Representation Of Genes), which does not require genome-specific training and which matches or outperforms other state-of-the-art gene finding tools.

<p>by Sander van Bree, Ediz Sohoglu, Matthew H. Davis, Benedikt Zoefel</p>

Rhythmic sensory or electrical stimulation will produce rhythmic brain responses. These rhythmic responses are often interpreted as endogenous neural oscillations aligned (or “entrained”) to the stimulus rhythm. However, stimulus-aligned brain responses can also be explained as a sequence of evoked responses, which only appear regular due to the rhythmicity of the stimulus, without necessarily involving underlying neural oscillations. To distinguish evoked responses from true oscillatory activity, we tested whether rhythmic stimulation produces oscillatory responses which continue after the end of the stimulus. Such sustained effects provide evidence for true involvement of neural oscillations. In Experiment 1, we found that rhythmic intelligible, but not unintelligible speech produces oscillatory responses in magnetoencephalography (MEG) which outlast the stimulus at parietal sensors. In Experiment 2, we found that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) leads to rhythmic fluctuations in speech perception outcomes after the end of electrical stimulation. We further report that the phase relation between electroencephalography (EEG) responses and rhythmic intelligible speech can predict the tACS phase that leads to most accurate speech perception. Together, we provide fundamental results for several lines of research—including neural entrainment and tACS—and reveal endogenous neural oscillations as a key underlying principle for speech perception.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2tSmh3oY5ds" width="1" />

Cerebral palsy (CP) neurologic care and research efforts typically focus on children. However, most people with CP are adults. Adults with CP are at increased risk of new neurologic conditions, such as stroke and myelopathy, that require ongoing neurologic surveillance to distinguish them from baseline motor impairments. Neurologic factors could also contribute to the motor function decline, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue that are commonly experienced by adults with CP. Based on a systematic literature review, we suggest (1) guidelines for neurologic surveillance and neurologist referral and (2) clinical research questions regarding the evolving neurologic risks for adults with CP.

We show how mindfulness training changes functional connectivity in the right putamen, cerebellum, and insula, as well as effective connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, right cerebellum, and bilateral putamen. Results suggest a rearrangement of dorsal striatum functional and effective connectivity, with changes in cortico‐subcortical‐cerebellar modulatory dynamics.

Abstract
Mindfulness is a meditation practice frequently associated with changes in subjective evaluation of cognitive and sensorial experience, as well as with modifications of brain activity and morphometry. Aside from the anatomical localization of functional changes induced by mindfulness practice, little is known about changes in functional and effective functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity. Here we performed a connectivity fMRI analysis in a group of healthy individuals participating in an 8‐week mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) training program. Data from both a “mind‐wandering” and a “meditation” state were acquired before and after the MBSR course. Results highlighted decreased local connectivity after training in the right anterior putamen and insula during spontaneous mind‐wandering and the right cerebellum during the meditative state. A further effective connectivity analysis revealed (a) decreased modulation by the anterior cingulate cortex over the anterior portion of the putamen, and (b) a change in left and right posterior putamen excitatory input and inhibitory output with the cerebellum, respectively. Results suggest a rearrangement of dorsal striatum functional and effective connectivity in response to mindfulness practice, with changes in cortico‐subcortical‐cerebellar modulatory dynamics. Findings might be relevant for the understanding of widely documented mindfulness behavioral effects, especially those related to pain perception.

Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 patients with dysferlinopathy over 3 years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and nonambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3 to 8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinical practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

Neurodegenerative disease (ND) may lead to aberrant changes in glycoenzymes, including glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, which further regulate the key ND‐related molecules, such as amyloid precursor protein, nicastrin, β‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1β‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1, a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10), neprilysin, etc.

Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are incurable and can develop progressively debilitating disorders, including dementia and ataxias. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the most common NDs that mainly affect the elderly people. There is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic tools so that patients can be accurately stratified at an early stage. As a common post‐translational modification, protein glycosylation plays a key role in physiological and pathological processes. The abnormal changes in glycosylation are associated with the altered biological pathways in NDs. The pathogenesis‐related proteins, like amyloid‐β and microtubule‐associated protein tau, have altered glycosylation. Importantly, specific glycosylation changes in cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine are valuable for revealing neurodegeneration in the early stages. This review describes the emerging biomarkers based on glycoproteomics in NDs, highlighting the potential applications of glycoprotein biomarkers in the early detection of diseases, monitoring of the disease progression, and measurement of the therapeutic responses. The mass spectrometry‐based strategies for characterizing glycoprotein biomarkers are also introduced.

Abstract
Sex differences in brain activity have been reported across various types of long‐term memory. To our knowledge, sex differences in functional connectivity during long‐term memory have not been investigated. A previous study on the structural connectome identified that female brains have a greater degree of interhemispheric connectivity than males, whereas males have a greater degree of intrahemispheric connectivity than females. The aim of the current investigation was twofold: (a) identify which brain regions were functionally connected to the hippocampus during spatial long‐term memory, and (b) determine if there were sex differences in the functionally connected regions. During the study phase, abstract shapes were presented to the left or right of fixation. During the test phase, abstract shapes were presented at fixation and participants classified each item as previously on the “left” or “right”. A hippocampal region of interest (ROI) was identified by contrasting spatial memory hits and misses. The peak coordinate from this ROI was used to define the center of a sphere that was used as the seed for the functional connectivity analysis. The connectivity analysis produced many connected activations including the medial posterior frontal cortex, lateral posterior frontal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and caudate/putamen. Although there were no regions with greater connectivity in females than males, the male versus female comparison produced connected activations in the medial posterior frontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and cingulate sulcus. Females also had greater interhemispheric connectivity than males. The current findings suggest collapsing across sex in cognitive neuroscience studies may not be warranted.

<p>Prolonged mastication may induce an asymmetric modification of the local perfusion of the trigeminal principal nucleus. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of vitamin C (vit. C) on such effect. Four groups of healthy volunteers underwent arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) to evaluate the local perfusion of the trigeminal nuclei after a vit. C-enriched lunch or a control lunch. Two ASL-MRI scans were acquired, respectively, before and after a 1 h-long masticating exercise or a 1 h long resting period. The results showed (i) an increased global perfusion of the brain in the vit. C-enriched lunch groups, (ii) an increased local perfusion of the right principal trigeminal nucleus (Vp) due to mastication, and (iii) a reduction of the rightward asymmetry of the Vp perfusion, due to mastication, after the vit C-enriched meal compared to the control meal. These results confirmed a long-lasting effect of prolonged mastication on Vp perfusion and also suggest a possible effect of vit. C on cerebral vascular tone regulation. Moreover, the data strongly draw attention on the side-to-side relation in Vp perfusion as a possible physiological parameter to be considered to understand the origin of pathological conditions like migraine.</p>

<p>The loss of dopamine (DA)-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) underlies the core motor symptoms of the progressive movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no treatment to prevent or slow SN DA neurodegeneration exists; thus, the identification of the underlying factors contributing to the high vulnerability of these neurons represents the basis for the development of novel therapies. Disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction seem to be key players in the pathophysiology of PD. The autonomous pacemaker activity of SN DA neurons, in combination with low cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, leads to large somatodendritic fluctuations of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels that are linked to elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress. L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCCs) contribute to these Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in dendrites, and LTCC inhibition was beneficial in cellular and in vivo animal models of PD. However, in a recently completed phase 3 clinical trial, the dihydropyridine (DHP) LTCC inhibitor isradipine failed to slow disease progression in early PD patients, questioning the feasibility of DHPs for PD therapy. Novel evidence also suggests that R- and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (RTCCs and TTCCs, respectively) represent potential PD drug targets. This short review aims to (re)evaluate the therapeutic potential of LTCC, RTCC, and TTCC inhibition in light of novel preclinical and clinical data and the feasibility of available Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers to modify PD disease progression. I also summarize their cell-specific roles for SN DA neuron function and describe how their gating properties allow activity (and thus their contribution to stressful Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations) during pacemaking.</p>

<p>Dopaminergic (DA) midbrain neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) display an autonomous pacemaker activity that is crucial for dopamine release and voluntary movement control. Their progressive degeneration is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Their metabolically demanding activity-mode affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, elevates metabolic stress, and renders SN DA neurons particularly vulnerable to degenerative stressors. Accordingly, their activity is regulated by complex mechanisms, notably by dopamine itself, via inhibitory D2-autoreceptors and the neuroprotective neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor NCS-1. Analyzing regulation of SN DA neuron activity-pattern is complicated by their high vulnerability. We studied this activity and its control by dopamine, NCS-1, and glucose with extracellular multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings from midbrain slices of juvenile and adult mice. Our tailored MEA- and spike sorting-protocols allowed high throughput and long recording times. According to individual dopamine-responses, we identified two distinct SN cell-types, in similar frequency: dopamine-inhibited and dopamine-excited neurons. Dopamine-excited neurons were either silent in the absence of dopamine, or they displayed pacemaker-activities, similar to that of dopamine-inhibited neurons. Inhibition of pacemaker-activity by dopamine is typical for SN DA neurons, and it can undergo prominent desensitization. We show for adult mice, that the number of SN DA neurons with desensitized dopamine-inhibition was increased (~60–100%) by a knockout of NCS-1, or by prevention of NCS-1 binding to D2-autoreceptors, while time-course and degrees of desensitization were not altered. The number of neurons with desensitized D2-responses was also higher (~65%) at high glucose-levels (25 mM), compared to lower glucose (2.5 mM), while again desensitization-kinetics were unaltered. However, spontaneous firing-rates were significantly higher at high glucose-levels (~20%). Moreover, transient glucose-deprivation (1 mM) induced a fast and fully-reversible pacemaker frequency reduction. To directly address and quantify glucose-sensing properties of SN DA neurons, we continuously monitored their electrical activity, while altering extracellular glucose concentrations stepwise from 0.5 mM up to 25 mM. SN DA neurons were excited by glucose, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.35 to 2.3 mM. In conclusion, we identified a novel, common subtype of dopamine-excited SN neurons, and a complex, joint regulation of dopamine-inhibited neurons by dopamine and glucose, within the range of physiological brain glucose-levels.</p>

<p>Once membrane potential changes or ligand binding activates the ion channel, the activity of the channel is finely modulated by the fluctuating membrane environment, involving local lipid composition and membrane tension. In the age of post-structural biology, the factors in the membrane that affect the ion channel function and how they affect it are a central concern among ion channel researchers. This review presents our strategies for elucidating the molecular mechanism of membrane effects on ion channel activity. The membrane’s diverse and intricate effects consist of chemical and physical processes. These elements can be quantified separately using lipid bilayer methods, in which a membrane is reconstructed only from the components of interest. In our advanced lipid bilayer platform (contact bubble bilayer, CBB), physical features of the membrane, such as tension, are freely controlled. We have elucidated how the specific lipid or membrane tension modulates the gating of a prototypical potassium channel, KcsA, embedded in the lipid bilayer. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism of the channel for sensing and responding to the membrane environment.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide; currently available treatment approaches for ischemic stroke are to restore blood flow, which reduce disability but are time limited. The interruption of blood flow in ischemic stroke contributes to intricate pathophysiological processes. Oxidative stress and inflammatory activity are two early events in the cascade of cerebral ischemic injury. These two factors are reciprocal causation and directly trigger the development of autophagy. Appropriate autophagy activity contributes to brain recovery by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory activity, while autophagy dysfunction aggravates cerebral injury. Abundant evidence demonstrates the beneficial impact of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and secretome on cerebral ischemic injury. MSCs reduce oxidative stress through suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generation and transferring healthy mitochondria to damaged cells. Meanwhile, MSCs exert anti-inflammation properties by the production of cytokines and extracellular vesicles, inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells activation, suppressing pyroptosis, and alleviating blood–brain barrier leakage. Additionally, MSCs regulation of autophagy imbalances gives rise to neuroprotection against cerebral ischemic injury. Altogether, MSCs have been a promising candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke due to their pleiotropic effect.</p>

<p>Despite striking progress in the understanding of the neurobiology of insomnia disorder (ID), about 40% of ID patients do not reach sustained remission with the primary treatments. It is necessary to reveal novel neuroimaging biomarkers for sleep quality in ID. The hypothalamus has a central role in sleep-wake regulation by communicating with different brain regions. However, the functional implications of hypothalamus circuitry with other brain areas remains largely unknown in ID. It may be speculated that dysfunctional circuitry in the hypothalamus is involved in the pathogenesis of ID. Thus, we investigated the different network organizations of the bilateral hypothalamus during the resting-state between 26 ID patients and 28 healthy controls (HC). Correlation analysis has been carried out to link the neuroimaging findings and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores. Group comparisons reveal that the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the left hypothalamic region and a few other brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and pallidum, are significantly higher in ID compared with HC. The right inferior temporal cortex showed reduced RSFC with the left hypothalamus. No significantly different RSFC between ID and HC was detected for the right hypothalamus. Positive correlations with PSQI scores were observed for RSFC strength between the left hypothalamus and bilateral mPFC (left: r = 0.2985, p = 0.0393; right: r = 0.3723, p = 0.0056). Similarly, the RSFC strength between the right hypothalamus and bilateral mPFC (left: r = 0.3980, p = 0.0029; right: r = 0.2972, p = 0.0291) also showed significant positive correlations with PSQI scores. In conclusion, we reveal a novel neuroimaging biomarker for sleep quality, i.e., the RSFC strength of the hypothalamus-mPFC pathway. Consistent with the hyperarousal model of ID, our results shed new insights into the implications of the hyper-connection within hypothalamus circuits in the pathology of the ID.</p>

<p>Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves by implanted electrodes is an effective treatment for certain pelvic floor diseases. As well as intravesical electrical stimulation, this predominantly includes stimulation of the sacral nerve, tibial nerve, and pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve is one of the main nerves that stimulate pelvic floor muscles, external urethral meatus, and the anal sphincter and pelvic organs, and it may have effects on frequent urination, urgency, dysuria, and perineal pain. It is difficult to locate because of its anatomical course, however, leading to difficulties fixing the electrode, which increases the difficulty of pudendal nerve electrical stimulation in clinical practice. In the current study 3D printed navigation was used to solve these problems. Combined with autopsy data and patient pelvic and nerve data, a personalized design was generated. Neural modulation of the pudendal nerve was achieved by implanting the lead with the guidance of 3D printed navigation. 3D printed navigation can maximize the phase II conversion rate, reduce the difficulty of surgery, shorten the operation time, reduce damage to additional organs and blood vessels, and increase the accuracy of electrode implantation, and it can be performed while the patient is awake. It is an accurate, reversible, efficient, and minimally invasive surgery.</p>

<p>Memory reconsolidation holds great hope for memory modification approaches and clinical treatments of mental disorders associated with maladaptive memories. However, it remains controversial as to whether reconsolidation is a general property of all types of memory. Especially, discrepancies have been reported in research focusing on whether declarative memory undergoes reconsolidation, and whether old memories can be reorganized after retrieval. Here, we discuss how these inconsistent results can be reconciled and what information we need to uncover for the general use of reconsolidation.</p>

<p>The peripersonal space is an adaptive and flexible interface between the body and the environment that fulfills a dual-motor function: preparing the body for voluntary object-oriented actions to interact with incentive stimuli and preparing the body for defensive responses when facing potentially harmful stimuli. In this position article, we provide arguments for the sensorimotor rooting of the peripersonal space representation and highlight the variables that contribute to its flexible and adaptive characteristics. We also demonstrate that peripersonal space represents a mediation zone between the body and the environment contributing to not only the control of goal-directed actions but also the organization of social life. The whole of the data presented and discussed led us to the proposal of a new theoretical framework linking the peripersonal action space and the interpersonal social space and we highlight how this theoretical framework can account for social behaviors in populations with socio-emotional deficits.</p>

<p>CYBATHLON is an international championship where people with severe physical disabilities compete with the aid of state-of-the-art assistive technology. In one of the disciplines, the BCI Race, tetraplegic pilots compete in a computer game race by controlling an avatar with a brain-computer interface (BCI). This competition offers a perfect opportunity for BCI researchers to study long-term training effects in potential end-users, and to evaluate BCI performance in a realistic environment. In this work, we describe the BCI system designed by the team Mirage91 for participation in the CYBATHLON BCI Series 2019, as well as in the CYBATHLON 2020 Global Edition. Furthermore, we present the BCI’s interface with the game and the main methodological strategies, along with a detailed evaluation of its performance over the course of the training period, which lasted 14 months. The developed system was a 4-class BCI relying on task-specific modulations of brain rhythms. We implemented inter-session transfer learning to reduce calibration time, and to reinforce the stability of the brain patterns. Additionally, in order to compensate for potential intra-session shifts in the features’ distribution, normalization parameters were continuously adapted in an unsupervised fashion. Across the aforementioned 14 months, we recorded 26 game-based training sessions. Between the first eight sessions, and the final eight sessions leading up to the CYBATHLON 2020 Global Edition, the runtimes significantly improved from 255 ± 23 s (mean ± std) to 225 ± 22 s, respectively. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the classifier’s accuracy from 46 to 53%, driven by more distinguishable brain patterns. Compared to conventional single session, non-adaptive BCIs, the inter-session transfer learning and unsupervised intra-session adaptation techniques significantly improved the performance. This long-term study demonstrates that regular training helped the pilot to significantly increase the distance between task-specific patterns, which resulted in an improvement of performance, both with respect to class separability in the calibration data, and with respect to the game. Furthermore, it shows that our methodological approaches were beneficial in transferring the performance across sessions, and most importantly to the CYBATHLON competitions.</p>

<p>Socio-emotional impairments are key symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders. This work proposes to analyze the neuronal activity related to the discrimination of emotional prosodies in autistic children (aged 9 to 11-year-old) as follows. Firstly, a database for single words uttered in Mexican Spanish by males, females, and children will be created. Then, optimal acoustic features for emotion characterization will be extracted, followed of a cubic kernel function Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to validate the speech corpus. As a result, human-specific acoustic properties of emotional voice signals will be identified. Secondly, those identified acoustic properties will be modified to synthesize the recorded human emotional voices. Thirdly, both human and synthesized utterances will be used to study the electroencephalographic correlate of affective prosody processing in typically developed and autistic children. Finally, and on the basis of the outcomes, synthesized voice-enhanced environments will be created to develop an intervention based on social-robot and Social Story<sup>TM</sup> for autistic children to improve affective prosodies discrimination.

<p>Substantial evidence indicates that cognitive training can be efficacious for older adults, but findings regarding training-related brain plasticity have been mixed and vary depending on the imaging modality. Recent years have seen a growth in recognition of the importance of large-scale brain networks on cognition. In particular, task-induced deactivation within the default mode network (DMN) is thought to facilitate externally directed cognition, while aging-related decrements in this neural process are related to reduced cognitive performance. It is not yet clear whether task-induced deactivation within the DMN can be enhanced by cognitive training in the elderly. We previously reported durable cognitive improvements in a sample of healthy older adults (age range = 60–75) who completed 6 weeks of process-based object-location memory training (N = 36) compared to an active control training group (N = 31). The primary aim of the current study is to evaluate whether these cognitive gains are accompanied by training-related changes in task-related DMN deactivation. Given the evidence for heterogeneity of the DMN, we examine task-related activation/deactivation within two separate DMN branches, a ventral branch related to episodic memory and a dorsal branch more closely resembling the canonical DMN. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an untrained object-location memory task at four time points before, during, and after the training period. Task-induced (de)activation values were extracted for the ventral and dorsal DMN branches at each time point. Relative to visual fixation baseline: (i) the dorsal DMN was deactivated during the scanner task, while the ventral DMN was activated; (ii) the object-location memory training group exhibited an increase in dorsal DMN deactivation relative to the active control group over the course of training and follow-up; (iii) changes in dorsal DMN deactivation did not correlate with task improvement. These results indicate a training-related enhancement of task-induced deactivation of the dorsal DMN, although the specificity of this improvement to the cognitive task performed in the scanner is not clear.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.612777">Effects of Emotional Stimulations on the Online Operation of a P300-Based Brain–Computer Interface</a></h4>

<p>Using P300-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) in daily life should take into account the user’s emotional state because various emotional conditions are likely to influence event-related potentials (ERPs) and consequently the performance of P300-based BCIs. This study aimed at investigating whether external emotional stimuli affect the performance of a P300-based BCI, particularly built for controlling home appliances. We presented a set of emotional auditory stimuli to subjects, which had been selected for each subject based on individual valence scores evaluated a priori, while they were controlling an electric light device using a P300-based BCI. There were four conditions regarding the auditory stimuli, including high valence, low valence, noise, and no sound. As a result, subjects controlled the electric light device using the BCI in real time with a mean accuracy of 88.14%. The overall accuracy and P300 features over most EEG channels did not show a significant difference between the four auditory conditions (p &gt; 0.05). When we measured emotional states using frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and compared FAA across the auditory conditions, we also found no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05). Our results suggest that there is no clear evidence to support a hypothesis that external emotional stimuli influence the P300-based BCI performance or the P300 features while people are controlling devices using the BCI in real time. This study may provide useful information for those who are concerned with the implementation of a P300-based BCI in practice.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.593108">Language Familiarity and Proficiency Leads to Differential Cortical Processing During Translation Between Distantly Related Languages</a></h4>

<p>In the midst of globalization, English is regarded as an international language, or Lingua Franca, but learning it as a second language (L2) remains still difficult to speakers of other languages. This is true especially for the speakers of languages distantly related to English such as Japanese. In this sense, exploring neural basis for translation between the first language (L1) and L2 is of great interest. There have been relatively many previous researches revealing brain activation patterns during translations between L1 and English as L2. These studies, which focused on language translation with close or moderate linguistic distance (LD), have suggested that the Broca area (BA 44/45) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA 46) may play an important role on translation. However, the neural mechanism of language translation between Japanese and English, having large LD, has not been clarified. Thus, we used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the brain activation patterns during word translation between Japanese and English. We also assessed the effects of translation directions and word familiarity. All participants’ first language was Japanese and they were learning English. Their English proficiency was advanced or elementary. We selected English and Japanese words as stimuli based on the familiarity for Japanese people. Our results showed that the brain activation patterns during word translation largely differed depending on their English proficiency. The advanced group elicited greater activation on the left prefrontal cortex around the Broca’s area while translating words with low familiarity, but no activation was observed while translating words with high familiarity. On the other hand, the elementary group evoked greater activation on the left temporal area including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) irrespective of the word familiarity. These results suggested that different cognitive process could be involved in word translation corresponding to English proficiency in Japanese learners of English. These difference on the brain activation patterns between the advanced and elementary group may reflect the difference on the cognitive loads depending on the levels of automatization in one’s language processing.</p>

<p>Background: The rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm is a high-speed paradigm of brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. The target stimuli evoke event-related potential (ERP) activity of odd-ball effect, which can be used to detect the onsets of targets. Thus, the neural control can be produced by identifying the target stimulus. However, the ERPs in single trials vary in latency and length, which makes it difficult to accurately discriminate the targets against their neighbors, the near-non-targets. Thus, it reduces the efficiency of the BCI paradigm.</p><p>Methods: To overcome the difficulty of ERP detection against their neighbors, we proposed a simple but novel ternary classification method to train the classifiers. The new method not only distinguished the target against all other samples but also further separated the target, near-non-target, and other, far-non-target samples. To verify the efficiency of the new method, we performed the RSVP experiment. The natural scene pictures with or without pedestrians were used; the ones with pedestrians were used as targets. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of 10 subjects were acquired during presentation. The SVM and CNN in EEGNet architecture classifiers were used to detect the onsets of target.</p><p>Results: We obtained fairly high target detection scores using SVM and EEGNet classifiers based on MEG data. The proposed ternary classification method showed that the near-non-target samples can be discriminated from others, and the separation significantly increased the ERP detection scores in the EEGNet classifier. Moreover, the visualization of the new method suggested the different underling of SVM and EEGNet classifiers in ERP detection of the RSVP experiment.</p><p>Conclusion: In the RSVP experiment, the near-non-target samples contain separable ERP activity. The ERP detection scores can be increased using classifiers of the EEGNet model, by separating the non-target into near- and far-targets based on their delay against targets.</p>

<p>The organ of Corti (OC) comprises two types of sensory cells: outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs). While both are mechanotransducers, OHCs serve as cochlear amplifiers, whereas IHCs transform sound into transmitter release. Reliable sound encoding is ensured by indefatigable exocytosis of synaptic vesicles associated with efficient replenishment of the vesicle pool. Vesicle reformation requires retrieval of vesicle membrane from the hair cell’s membrane via endocytosis. So far, the protein machinery for endocytosis in pre-mature and terminally differentiated hair cells has only partially been deciphered. Here, we studied three endocytic proteins, dynamin-1, dynamin-3, and endophilin-A1, by assessing their transcription profiles in pre-mature and mature mouse OCs. State-of-the-art RNAscope<sup>®</sup> fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of whole-mount OCs was used for quantification of target mRNAs on single-cell level. We found that pre-mature IHCs contained more mRNA transcripts of dnm1 (encoding dynamin-1) and sh3gl2 (endophilin-A1), but less of dnm3 (dynamin-3) than OHCs. These differential transcription profiles between OHCs and IHCs were sharpened upon maturation. It is noteworthy that low but heterogeneous signal numbers were found between individual negative controls, which highlights the importance of corresponding analyses in RNAscope<sup>®</sup> assays. Complementary immunolabeling revealed strong expression of dynamin-1 in the soma of mature IHCs, which was much weaker in pre-mature IHCs. By contrast, dynamin-3 was predominantly found in the soma and at the border of the cuticular plates of pre-mature and mature OHCs. In summary, using quantitative RNAscope<sup>®</sup> FISH and immunohistochemistry on whole-mount tissue of both pre-mature and mature OCs, we disclosed the cellular upregulation of endocytic proteins at the level of transcription/translation during terminal differentiation of the OC. Dynamin-1 and endophilin-A1 likely contribute to the strengthening of the endocytic machinery in IHCs after the onset of hearing, whereas expression of dynamin-3 at the cuticular plate of pre-mature and mature OHCs suggests its possible involvement in activity-independent apical endocytosis.</p>

<p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially neovascular AMD with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Although matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in pathological ocular angiogenesis, including CNV, the cellular origin of MMPs in AMD remains unknown. The present study investigated the role of microglial MMPs in CNV. MMP activities were analyzed by gelatin zymography in aqueous humor samples from patients with CNV and laser-induced CNV mice. Active MMP-9 was increased in the aqueous humor samples from neovascular AMD patients compared with control subjects. In the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid from CNV mice, active MMP-9 increased, beginning 1 h post-CNV induction, and remained upregulated until Day 7. In RPE/choroid from CNV mice, active MMP-9 was suppressed by minocycline, a known microglial inhibitor, at 6 h and 1-day post-CNV induction. Flow cytometry revealed that the proportion of activated microglia increased very early, beginning at 1 h post-CNV induction, and was maintained until Day 7. Similarly, immunohistochemistry revealed increased microglial activation and MMP-9 expression on CNV lesions at 6 h and 1-day post-CNV induction. SB-3CT, an MMP inhibitor, decreased vascular leakage and lesion size in laser-induced CNV mice. These findings indicated nearly immediate recruitment of activated microglia and very early MMP-9 activation in the RPE/choroid. The present study newly identified a potential role for early microglial MMP-9 expression in CNV, and furthermore that modulating microglial MMP expression is a novel putative therapeutic for CNV.</p>

<p>Stem cell therapy, which has become a potential regenerative medical treatment and a promising approach for treating brain injuries induced by different types of cerebrovascular disease, has various application methods. Activation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) can enable infarcted neuron replacement and promote neural networks’ regeneration without the technical and ethical issues associated with the transplantation of exogenous stem cells. Thus, NSC activation can be a feasible strategy to treat central nervous system (CNS) injury. The potential molecular mechanisms of drug therapy for the activation of endogenous NSCs have gradually been revealed by researchers. Traditional Chinese medicine monomers (TCMs) are active components extracted from Chinese herbs, and some of them have demonstrated the potential to activate proliferation and neurogenesis of NSCs in CNS diseases. Ginsenoside Rg1, astragaloside IV (AST), icariin (ICA), salvianolic acid B (Sal B), resveratrol (RES), curcumin, artesunate (ART), and ginkgolide B (GB) have positive effects on NSCs via different signaling pathways and molecules, such as the Wingless/integrated/β-catenin (Wnt/β-catenin) signaling pathway, the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). This article may provide further motivation for researchers to take advantage of TCMs in studies on CNS injury and stem cell therapy.</p>

<p>Elderly patients suffer more brain damage in comparison with young patients from the same ischemic stroke. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that suppressed hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription activity is responsible for defective recovery after ischemic stroke in the elders. Aged and young rats underwent 1-h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to produce cerebral ischemic injury. The initial cerebral infarct volume in the young gradually declined as time elapsed, but in the aged rats remained the same. The defective recovery in the aged was associated with depressed angiogenesis and retarded neurorestoration. There was no difference in HIF-1α accumulation in the brain between the two age groups, but the expression of HIF-1 regulated genes involved in cerebral recovery was suppressed in the aged. In confirmation, inhibition of HIF-1 transactivation of gene expression in the young suppressed cerebral recovery from MCAO as the same as that observed in the aged rats. Furthermore, a copper metabolism MURR domain 1 (COMMD1) was significantly elevated after MCAO only in the brain of aged rats, and suppression of COMMD1 by siRNA targeting COMMD1 restored HIF-1 transactivation and improved recovery from MCAO-induced damage in the aged brain. These results demonstrate that impaired HIF-1 transcription activity, due at least partially to overexpression of COMMD1, is associated with the defective cerebral recovery from ischemic stroke in the aged rats.</p>

<p>Hispanics/Latinos are at an equal or a greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet risk factors remain more poorly characterized as compared to non-Hispanic/Latino Whites. Among non-Hispanic/Latino White cohorts, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is one of the strongest risk factors for AD with subtle declines in episodic memory and brain volumes detectable in the preclinical stages. We examined whether the APOE ε4 status had a differential impact on cognition and brain volumes among cognitively healthy and mild cognitively impaired Hispanics/Latinos (n = 86; ε4 n = 23) compared to a well-matched group of non-Hispanic/Latino Whites (n = 92; ε4 n = 29). Neither the APOE ε4 status nor the interaction between the ε4 status and ethnicity was associated with cognitive performance. The APOE ε4 status was associated with white matter and not with gray matter volumes. APOE ε4 carriers had a significantly smaller total brain white matter volumes, as well as smaller right middle temporal and left superior temporal volumes. The Hispanics/Latinos had significantly smaller left middle frontal gray matter volumes, yet marginally larger overall white matter volumes, than the non-Hispanic/Latino Whites. Exploratory analysis within the Hispanic/Latino sample found that those people whose primary language was Spanish had larger total brain white matter volumes compared primarily to the English speakers. Importantly, primary language differences only held for Hispanic/Latino ε4 carriers and did not differentiate Hispanic/Latino non-carriers, underscoring the need for further investigation into the impacts of language and acculturation on cognitive aging among the fastest growing ethnic minority group in the United States.</p>

The Hippo-YAP pathway responds to diverse environmental cues to manage tissue homeostasis, organ regeneration, tumorigenesis, and immunity. However, how phosphatase(s) directly target Yes-associated protein (YAP) and determine its physiological activity are still inconclusive. Here, we utilized an unbiased phosphatome screening and identified protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A/PP2Cα) as the bona fide and physiological YAP phosphatase. We found that PPM1A was associated with YAP/TAZ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to directly eliminate phospho-S127 on YAP, which conferring YAP the nuclear distribution and transcription potency. Accordingly, genetic ablation or depletion of PPM1A in cells, organoids, and mice elicited an enhanced YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic retention and resulted in the diminished cell proliferation, severe gut regeneration defects in colitis, and impeded liver regeneration upon injury. These regeneration defects in murine model were largely rescued via a genetic large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) deficiency or the pharmacological inhibition of Hippo-YAP signaling. Therefore, we identify a physiological phosphatase of YAP/TAZ, describe its critical effects in YAP/TAZ cellular distribution, and demonstrate its physiological roles in mammalian organ regeneration.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CX2-Qjoj_E0" width="1" />

The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a worldwide pandemic causing substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic devastation. In response, many laboratories have redirected attention to SARS-CoV-2, meaning there is an urgent need for tools that can be used in laboratories unaccustomed to working with coronaviruses. Here we report a range of tools for SARS-CoV-2 research. First, we describe a facile single plasmid SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system that is simple to genetically manipulate and can be used to rescue infectious virus through transient transfection (without in vitro transcription or additional expression plasmids). The rescue system is accompanied by our panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (against nearly every viral protein), SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, and SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, which are all openly available to the scientific community. Using these tools, we demonstrate here that the controversial ORF10 protein is expressed in infected cells. Furthermore, we show that the promising repurposed antiviral activity of apilimod is dependent on TMPRSS2 expression. Altogether, our SARS-CoV-2 toolkit, which can be directly accessed via our website at https://mrcppu-covid.bio/, constitutes a resource with considerable potential to advance COVID-19 vaccine design, drug testing, and discovery science.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/aHtVPdXDMZQ" width="1" />

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early diagnosis is essential for both current and potential treatments. To find a supportive approach for the diagnosis, we constructed an artificial intelligence‐based prediction model of ALS using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Images of spinal motor neurons derived from healthy control subject and ALS patient iPSCs were analyzed by a convolutional neural network, and the algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.97 for classifying healthy control and ALS. This prediction model by deep learning algorithm with iPSC technology could support the diagnosis and may provide proactive treatment of ALS through future prospective research. ANN NEUROL 2021

Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, degradation, and retrograde pathways. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, and abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion, suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD‐like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans‐Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever,” has been reported. Whereas we know a great deal about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has yet been identified. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD‐like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets. ANN NEUROL 2021

Abstract
l‐Lactate is an energetic and signaling molecule that may be produced through astrocyte‐specific aerobic glycolysis and is elevated in striatal muscle during intensive exercise. l‐Lactate has been shown to promote neurotrophic gene expression through astrocytes within the hippocampus, however, its role in neuroplasticity within the striatum remains unknown. This study sought to investigate the role of peripheral sources of l‐lactate in promoting astrocyte‐specific gene expression and morphology as well as its role in neuroplasticity within the striatum of healthy animals. Using in vitro primary astrocyte cell culture, administration of l‐lactate increased the expression of the neurotrophic factors Bdnf, Gdnf, Cntf, and the immediate early gene cFos. l‐Lactate's promotion of neurotrophic factor expression was mediated through the lactate receptor HCAR1 since application of the HCAR1 agonist 3,5‐DHBA also increased expression of Bdnf in primary astrocytes. Similar to our previous report demonstrating exercise‐induced changes in astrocytic structure within the striatum, l‐lactate administration to healthy mice led to increased astrocyte morphological complexity as well as astrocyte‐specific neurotrophic expression within the striatum. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of peripheral l‐lactate on synaptogenesis or motor behavior. Insufficient levels and/or inadequate delivery of l‐lactate through regional cerebral blood flow within the striatum may account for the lack of these benefits. Taken together, these novel findings suggest a potential framework that links peripheral l‐lactate production within muscle and intensive exercise with neuroplasticity of specific brain regions through astrocytic function.

<p>Brain computer interfaces (BCI) provide a direct communication link between the brain and a computer or other external devices. They offer an extended degree of freedom either by strengthening or by substituting human peripheral working capacity and have potential applications in various fields such as rehabilitation, affective computing, robotics, gaming, and neuroscience. Significant research efforts on a global scale have delivered common platforms for technology standardization and help tackle highly complex and non-linear brain dynamics and related feature extraction and classification challenges. Time-variant psycho-neurophysiological fluctuations and their impact on brain signals impose another challenge for BCI researchers to transform the technology from laboratory experiments to plug-and-play daily life. This review summarizes state-of-the-art progress in the BCI field over the last decades and highlights critical challenges.</p>

<p>Neuropathic pain is a kind of chronic pain that remains difficult to treat due to its complicated underlying mechanisms. Accumulating evidence has indicated that enhanced synaptic plasticity of nociceptive interneurons in the superficial spinal dorsal horn contributes to the development of neuropathic pain. Neuroligin1 (NL1) is a type of excitatory postsynaptic adhesion molecule, which can mediate excitatory synaptic activity, hence promoting neuronal activation. Vglut2 is the most common marker of excitatory glutamatergic neurons. To explore the role of NL1 in excitatory neurons in nociceptive regulation, we used transgenic mice with cre recombinase expression driven by the Vglut2 promoter combined with viral vectors to knockdown the expression of NL1 in excitatory neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. We found that NL1 was upregulated in the L4–L6 spinal dorsal horn in Vglut2-cre<sup>+/–</sup> mouse subjected to spared nerve injury (SNI). Meanwhile, the expression of phosphorylated cofilin (p-cofilin) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) was also increased. Spinal microinjection of a cre-dependent NL1-targeting RNAi in Vglut2-cre<sup>+/–</sup> mouse alleviated the neuropathic pain-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced the increase in p-cofilin and GluR1 caused by SNI. Taken together, NL1 in excitatory neurons regulates neuropathic pain by promoting the SNI-dependent increase in p-cofilin and GluR1 in the spinal dorsal horn. Our study provides a better understanding of the role of NL1 in excitatory neurons, which might represent a possible therapeutic target for alleviating neuropathic pain.</p>

<p>Protein homeostasis serves as an important step in regulating diverse cellular processes underlying the function and development of the nervous system. In particular, the ubiquitination proteasome system (UPS), a universal pathway mediating protein degradation, contributes to the development of numerous synaptic structures, including the Drosophila olfactory-associative learning center mushroom body (MB), thereby affecting associated function. Here, we describe the function of a newly characterized Drosophila F-box protein CG5003, an adaptor for the RING-domain type E3 ligase (SCF complex), in MB development. Lacking CG5003 ubiquitously causes MB γ axon pruning defects and selective CG5003 expression in pan-neurons leads to both γ axon and α/β lobe abnormalities. Interestingly, change in CG5003 expression in MB neurons does not cause any abnormalities in axons, suggesting that CG5003 functions in cells extrinsic to MB to regulate its development. Mass spectrum analysis indicates that silencing CG5003 expression in all neurons affects expression levels of proteins in the cell and structural morphogenesis, transcription regulator activity, and catalytic activity. Our findings reinforce the importance of UPS and identify a new factor in regulating neuronal development as exemplified by the synaptic structure MB.</p>

<p>Genome-wide sequencing technologies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Interestingly, a number of ASD-related genes express natural antisense transcripts (NATs). In some cases, these NATs have been shown to play a regulatory role in sense strand gene expression and thus contribute to brain function. However, a detailed study examining the transcriptional relationship between ASD-related genes and their NAT partners is lacking. We performed strand-specific, deep RNA sequencing to profile expression of sense and antisense reads with a focus on 100 ASD-related genes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and striatum across mouse post-natal development (P7, P14, and P56). Using de novo transcriptome assembly, we generated a comprehensive long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptome. We conducted BLAST analyses to compare the resultant transcripts with the human genome and identified transcripts with high sequence similarity and coverage. We assembled 32861 de novo antisense transcripts mapped to 12182 genes, of which 1018 are annotated by Ensembl as lncRNA. We validated the expression of a subset of selected ASD-related transcripts by PCR, including Syngap1 and Cntnap2. Our analyses revealed that more than 70% (72/100) of the examined ASD-related genes have one or more expressed antisense transcripts, suggesting more ASD-related genes than previously thought could be subject to NAT-mediated regulation in mice. We found that expression levels of antisense contigs were mostly positively correlated with their cognate coding sense strand RNA transcripts across developmental age. A small fraction of the examined transcripts showed brain region specific enrichment, indicating possible circuit-specific roles. Our BLAST analyses identified 110 of 271 ASD-related de novo transcripts with &gt;90% identity to the human genome at &gt;90% coverage. These findings, which include an assembled de novo antisense transcriptome, contribute to the understanding of NAT regulation of ASD-related genes in mice and can guide NAT-mediated gene regulation strategies in preclinical investigations toward the ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutic targets for ASD.</p>

<p>One of the major unsolved mysteries of biological science concerns the question of where and in what form information is stored in the brain. I propose that memory is stored in the brain in a mechanically encoded binary format written into the conformations of proteins found in the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions that organise each and every synapse. The MeshCODE framework outlined here represents a unifying theory of data storage in animals, providing read-write storage of both dynamic and persistent information in a binary format. Mechanosensitive proteins that contain force-dependent switches can store information persistently, which can be written or updated using small changes in mechanical force. These mechanosensitive proteins, such as talin, scaffold each synapse, creating a meshwork of switches that together form a code, the so-called MeshCODE. Large signalling complexes assemble on these scaffolds as a function of the switch patterns and these complexes would both stabilise the patterns and coordinate synaptic regulators to dynamically tune synaptic activity. Synaptic transmission and action potential spike trains would operate the cytoskeletal machinery to write and update the synaptic MeshCODEs, thereby propagating this coding throughout the organism. Based on established biophysical principles, such a mechanical basis for memory would provide a physical location for data storage in the brain, with the binary patterns, encoded in the information-storing mechanosensitive molecules in the synaptic scaffolds, and the complexes that form on them, representing the physical location of engrams. Furthermore, the conversion and storage of sensory and temporal inputs into a binary format would constitute an addressable read-write memory system, supporting the view of the mind as an organic supercomputer.</p>

Background<p>Structural network alterations in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are related to worse cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to quantify the alterations in gray matter associated with impaired cognition and their pathological biomarkers in AD-spectrum patients.</p>Methods<p>We extracted gray matter networks from 3D-T1 magnetic resonance imaging scans, and a graph theory analysis was used to explore alterations in the network metrics in 34 healthy controls, 70 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 40 AD patients. Spearman correlation analysis was computed to investigate the relationships among network properties, neuropsychological performance, and cerebrospinal fluid pathological biomarkers (i.e., Aβ, t-tau, and p-tau) in these subjects.</p>Results<p>AD-spectrum individuals demonstrated higher nodal properties and edge properties associated with impaired memory function, and lower amyloid-β or higher tau levels than the controls. Furthermore, these compensations at the brain regional level in AD-spectrum patients were mainly in the medial temporal lobe; however, the compensation at the whole-brain network level gradually extended from the frontal lobe to become widely distributed throughout the cortex with the progression of AD.</p>Conclusion<p>The findings provide insight into the alterations in the gray matter network related to impaired cognition and pathological biomarkers in the progression of AD. The possibility of compensation was detected in the structural networks in AD-spectrum patients; the compensatory patterns at regional and whole-brain levels were different and the clinical significance was highlighted.</p>

<p>Modulating endogenous regenerative processes may represent a suitable treatment for central nervous system (CNS) injuries, such as stroke or trauma. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs), which naturally reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain, proliferate and differentiate to other cell types, and therefore may compensate the negative consequences of ischemic injury. The fate of NS/PCs in the developing brain is largely influenced by Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) signaling; however, its role in the differentiation of adult NS/PCs under ischemic conditions is still enigmatic. In our previous study, we identified the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a factor promoting neurogenesis at the expense of gliogenesis in neonatal mice. In this study, we used adult transgenic mice in order to assess the impact of the canonical Wnt pathway modulation (inhibition or hyper-activation) on NS/PCs derived from the SVZ, and combined it with the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to disclose the effect of focal cerebral ischemia (FCI). Based on the electrophysiological properties of cultured cells, we first identified three cell types that represented in vitro differentiated NS/PCs – astrocytes, neuron-like cells, and precursor cells. Following FCI, we detected fewer neuron-like cells after Wnt signaling inhibition. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical analysis revealed an overall higher expression of cell-type-specific proteins after FCI, indicating increased proliferation and differentiation rates of NS/PCs in the SVZ. Remarkably, Wnt signaling hyper-activation increased the abundance of proliferating and neuron-like cells, while Wnt pathway inhibition had the opposite effect. Finally, the expression profiling at the single cell level revealed an increased proportion of neural stem cells and neuroblasts after FCI. These observations indicate that Wnt signaling enhances NS/PCs-based regeneration in the adult mouse brain following FCI, and supports neuronal differentiation in the SVZ.</p>

<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous electroencephalography applied to the primary motor cortex provides two parameters for cortical excitability: motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of systematic coil shifts on both the TEP N100 component and MEPs in addition to the relationship between both parameters. In 12 healthy adults, the center of a standardized grid was fixed above the hot spot of the target muscle of the left primary motor cortex. Twelve additional positions were arranged in a quadratic grid with positions between 5 and 10 mm from the hot spot. At each of the 13 positions, TMS single pulses were applied. The topographical maximum of the resulting N100 was located ipsilateral and slightly posterior to the stimulation site. A source analysis revealed an equivalent dipole localized more deeply than standard motor cortex coordinates that could not be explained by a single seeded primary motor cortex dipole. The N100 topography might not only reflect primary motor cortex activation, but also sum activation of the surrounding cortex. N100 amplitude and latency decreased significantly during stimulation anterior-medial to the hot spot although MEP amplitudes were smaller at all other stimulation sites. Therefore, N100 amplitudes might be suitable for detecting differences in local cortical excitability. The N100 topography, with its maximum located posterior to the stimulation site, possibly depends on both anatomical characteristics of the stimulated cortex and differences in local excitability of surrounding cortical areas. The less excitable anterior cortex might contribute to a more posterior maximum. There was no correlation between N100 and MEP amplitudes, but a single-trial analysis revealed a trend toward larger N100 amplitudes in trials with larger MEPs. Thus, functionally efficient cortical excitation might increase the probability of higher N100 amplitudes, but TEPs are also generated in the absence of MEPs.</p>

<p>There is great interest in drug discovery programs targeted at the aggregation of the 42-residue form of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ42), since this molecular process is closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The use of bicyclic peptides may offer novel opportunities for the effective modification of Aβ42 aggregation and the inhibition of its cytotoxicity, as these compounds combine the molecular recognition ability of antibodies with a relatively small size of about 2 kD. Here, to pursue this approach, we rationally designed a panel of six bicyclic peptides targeting various epitopes along the sequence of Aβ42 to scan its most amyloidogenic region (residues 13–42). Our kinetic analysis and structural studies revealed that at sub-stoichiometric concentrations the designed bicyclic peptides induce a delay in the condensation of Aβ42 and the subsequent transition to a fibrillar state, while at higher concentrations they inhibit such transition. We thus suggest that designed bicyclic peptides can be employed to inhibit amyloid formation by redirecting the aggregation process toward amorphous assemblies.</p>

<p>The impairment of microvessels can lead to neurologic diseases such as stroke and vascular dementia. The imaging of lumen and vessel wall of perforating arteries requires an extremely high resolution due to their small caliber size. Current imaging techniques have the difficulty in observing the wall of perforating arteries. In this study, we developed a 3D inner-volume (IV) TSE (SPACE) sequence with optimized 2D spatially selective excitation (SSE) RF pulses. The optimized SSE RF pulses were designed through a series of optimization including iterative RF pulse design, trajectory optimization, and phase convention of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) condition to meet the perforating arteries imaging demands. High resolution of isotropic 0.30 mm within 10 min was achieved for the black- blood images of lenticulostriate artery (LSA). The LSA lumen and vessel wall were imaged by the IV-SPACE sequence simultaneously. Images obtained by the optimized RF pulse has fewer aliasing artifacts from outside of ROI than the traditional pulse. The IV-SPACE images showed clearer delineation of vessel wall and lumen of LSA than conventional SPACE images. IV-SPACE might be a promising method for detecting microvasculopathies of cerebral vascular diseases.</p>

<p>The reason why dopamine neurons die in Parkinson’s disease remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence points to a role for brain inflammation in neurodegeneration. Essential questions are whether brain inflammation happens sufficiently early so that interfering with this process can be expected to slow down neuronal death and whether the contribution from inflammation is large enough so that anti-inflammatory agents can be expected to work. Here I discuss data from human PD studies indicating that brain inflammation is an early event in PD. I also discuss the role of T-lymphocytes and peripheral inflammation for neurodegeneration. I critically discuss the failure of clinical trials targeting inflammation in PD.</p>

<p>Background: Maximum safe resection of infiltrative brain tumors in eloquent area is the primary objective in surgical neuro-oncology. This goal can be achieved with direct electrical stimulation (DES) to perform a functional mapping of the brain in patients awake intraoperatively. When awake surgery is not possible, we propose a pipeline procedure that combines advanced techniques aiming at performing a dissection that respects the anatomo-functional connectivity of the peritumoral region. This procedure can benefit from intraoperative monitoring with computerized tomography scan (iCT-scan) and brain shift correction. Associated with this intraoperative monitoring, the additional value of preoperative investigation combining brain mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) with various neuroimaging modalities (tractography and resting state functional MRI) has not yet been reported.</p><p>Case Report: A 42-year-old left-handed man had increased intracranial pressure (IICP), left hand muscle deficit, and dysarthria, related to an infiltrative tumor of the right frontal lobe with large mass effect and circumscribed contrast enhancement in motor and premotor cortical areas. Spectroscopy profile and intratumoral calcifications on CT-scan suggested an WHO grade III glioma, later confirmed by histology. The aforementioned surgical procedure was considered, since standard awake surgery was not appropriate for this patient. In preoperative time, nTMS mapping of motor function (deltoid, first interosseous, and tibialis anterior muscles) was performed, combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tractography reconstruction of 6 neural tracts (arcuate, corticospinal, inferior fronto-occipital, uncinate and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi) and resting-state functional MRI connectivity (rs-fMRI) of sensorimotor and language networks. In intraoperative time, DES mapping was performed with motor evoked response recording and tumor resection was optimized using non-rigid image transformation of the preoperative data (nTMS, tractography, and rs-fMRI) to iCT data. Image guidance was updated with correction for brain shift and tissue deformation using biomechanical modeling taking into account brain elastic properties. This correction was done at crucial surgical steps, i.e., when tumor bulged through the craniotomy after dura mater opening and when approaching the presumed eloquent brain regions. This procedure allowed a total resection of the tumor region with contrast enhancement as well as a complete regression of IICP and dysarthria. Hand paresis remained stable with no additional deficit. Postoperative nTMS mapping confirmed the good functional outcome.</p><p>Conclusion: This case report and technical note highlights the value of preoperative functional evaluation by nTMS updated intraoperatively with correction of brain deformation by iCT. This multimodal approach may become the optimized technique of reference for patients with brain tumors in eloquent areas that are unsuitable for awake brain surgery.</p>

Background<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) targeting the primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) may induce lasting shifts in corticospinal excitability, but after-effects show substantial inter-individual variability. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can probe after-effects of TDCS on regional neural activity on a whole-brain level.</p>Objective<p>Using a double-blinded cross-over design, we investigated whether the individual change in corticospinal excitability after TDCS of M1-HAND is associated with changes in task-related regional activity in cortical motor areas.</p>Methods<p>Seventeen healthy volunteers (10 women) received 20 min of real (0.75 mA) or sham TDCS on separate days in randomized order. Real and sham TDCS used the classic bipolar set-up with the anode placed over right M1-HAND. Before and after each TDCS session, we recorded motor evoked potentials (MEP) from the relaxed left first dorsal interosseus muscle after single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) of left M1-HAND and performed whole-brain fMRI at 3 Tesla while participants completed a visuomotor tracking task with their left hand. We also assessed the difference in MEP latency when applying anterior-posterior and latero-medial TMS pulses to the precentral hand knob (AP-LM MEP latency).</p>Results<p>Real TDCS had no consistent aftereffects on mean MEP amplitude, task-related activity or motor performance. Individual changes in MEP amplitude, measured directly after real TDCS showed a positive linear relationship with individual changes in task-related activity in the supplementary motor area and AP-LM MEP latency.</p>Conclusion<p>Functional aftereffects of classical bipolar anodal TDCS of M1-HAND on the motor system vary substantially across individuals. Physiological features upstream from the primary motor cortex may determine how anodal TDCS changes corticospinal excitability.</p>

<p>Prediction is essential for the efficiency of many cognitive processes; however, this process is not always perfect. Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain generates and updates a prediction to respond to an upcoming event. Although an electrophysiological index of prediction, the stimulus preceding negativity (SPN), has been reported, it remains unknown whether the SPN reflects the prediction accuracy, or whether it is associated with the prediction error, which corresponds to a mismatch between a prediction and an actual input. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate this question using electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were asked to predict the original pictures from pictures that had undergone different levels of pixelation. The SPN amplitude was affected by the level of pixelation and correlated with the subjective evaluation of the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, late positive components (LPC) were negatively correlated with SPN. These results suggest that the amplitude of SPN reflects the prediction accuracy; more accurate prediction increases the SPN and reduces the prediction error, resulting in reduced LPC amplitudes.</p>

<p>Introduction: Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. Studies showed that older adults can reduce the risk of falls after participation in an unexpected perturbation-based balance training (PBBT), a relatively novel approach that challenged reactive balance control. This study aims to investigate the effect of the practice schedule (i.e., contextual interference) on reactive balance function and its transfer to proactive balance function (i.e., voluntary step execution test and Berg balance test). Our primary hypothesis is that improvements in reactive balance control following block PBBT will be not inferior to the improvements following random PBBT.</p><p>Methods and Analysis: This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty community-dwelling older adults (over 70 years) will be recruited and randomly allocated to a random PBBT group (n = 25) or a block PBBT group (n = 25). The random PBBT group will receive eight training sessions over 4 weeks that include unexpected machine-induced perturbations of balance during hands-free treadmill walking. The block PBBT group will be trained by the same perturbation treadmill system, but only one direction will be trained in each training session, and the direction of the external perturbations will be announced. Both PBBT groups (random PBBT and block PBBT) will receive a similar perturbation intensity during training (which will be customized to participant’s abilities), the same training period, and the same concurrent cognitive tasks during training. The generalization and transfer of learning effects will be measured by assessing the reactive and proactive balance control during standing and walking before and after 1 month of PBBT, for example, step and multiple steps and fall thresholds, Berg balance test, and fear of falls. The dependent variable will be rank transformed prior to conducting the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to allow for nonparametric analysis.</p><p>Discussion: This research will explore which of the balance retraining paradigms is more effective to improve reactive balance and proactive balance control in older adults (random PBBT vs. block PBBT) over 1 month. The research will address key issues concerning balance retraining: older adults’ neuromotor capacities to optimize training responses and their applicability to real-life challenges.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration: Helsinki research ethics approval has been received (Soroka Medical Center approval #0396-16-SOR; MOH_2018-07-22_003536; www.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04455607).</p>

<p>The present study is the first to measure event-related potentials associated with the processing of the emotional Stroop task (EST) with the use of an orthogonal factorial manipulation for emotional valence, arousal, and subjective significance (the importance of the current experience for goals and plans for the future). The current study aimed to investigate concurrently the role of the three dimensions describing the emotion-laden words for interference control measured in the classical version of the EST paradigm. The results showed that reaction times were affected by the emotional valence of presented words and the interactive effect of valence and arousal. The expected emotional arousal effect was only found in behavioral results for neutrally valenced words. Electrophysiological results showed valence and subjective significance correlated with the amplitude differences in the P2 component. Moreover, the amplitude of the N450 component varied with the level of subjective significance. This study also demonstrated that exploratory event-related potential analysis provides additional information beyond the classical component-based analysis. The obtained results show that cognitive control effects in the EST may be altered by manipulation in the subjective significance dimension.</p>

<p>Patients with Wilson’s disease (WD) suffer from prospective memory (PM) impairment, and some of patients develop cognitive impairment. However, very little is known about how brain structure and function changes effect PM in WD. Here, we employed multimodal neuroimaging data acquired from 22 WD patients and 26 healthy controls (HC) who underwent three-dimensional T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We investigated gray matter (GM) volumes with voxel-based morphometry, DTI metrics using the fiber tractography method, and RS-fMRI using the seed-based functional connectivity method. Compared with HC, WD patients showed GM volume reductions in the basal ganglia (BG) and occipital fusiform gyrus, as well as volume increase in the visual association cortex. Moreover, whiter matter (WM) tracks of WD were widely impaired in association and limbic fibers. WM tracks in association fibers are significant related to PM in WD patients. Relative to HC, WD patients showed that the visual association cortex functionally connects to the thalamus and hippocampus, which is associated with global cognitive function in patients with WD. Together, these findings suggested that PM impairment in WD may be modulated by aberrant WM in association fibers, and that GM volume changes in the association cortex has no direct effect on cognitive status, but indirectly affect global cognitive function by its aberrant functional connectivity (FC) in patients with WD. Our findings may provide a new window to further study how WD develops into cognitive impairment, and deepen our understanding of the cognitive status and neuropathology of WD.</p>

<p>An increasing number of studies demonstrated the involvement of the cerebellum in (social) sequence processing. The current preliminary study is the first to investigate the causal involvement of the cerebellum in sequence generation, using low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS). By targeting the posterior cerebellum, we hypothesized that the induced neuro-excitability modulation would lead to altered performance on a Picture and Story sequencing task, which involve the generation of the correct chronological order of various social and non-social stories depicted in cartoons or sentences. Our results indicate that participants receiving LF-rTMS over the cerebellum, as compared to sham participants, showed a stronger learning effect from pre to post stimulation for both tasks and for all types of sequences (i.e. mechanical, social scripts, false belief, true belief). No differences between sequence types were observed. Our results suggest a positive effect of LF-rTMS on sequence generation. We conclude that the cerebellum is causally involved in the generation of sequences of social and nonsocial events. Our discussion focuses on recommendations for future studies.</p>

<p>The prelimbic (PL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in both driving and suppressing motivated behaviors, including cocaine-seeking in rats. These seemingly opposing functions may be mediated by different efferent targets of PL projections, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which have contrasting roles in reward-seeking behaviors. We sought to characterize the anatomical connectivity differences between PL neurons projecting to NAc core and RMTg. We used conventional retrograde tracers to reveal distinct subpopulations of PL neurons projecting to NAc core vs. RMTg in rats, with very little overlap. To examine potential differences in input specificity for these two PL subpopulations, we then used Cre-dependent rabies virus (EnvA-RV-EGFP) as a monosynaptic retrograde tracer and targeted specific PL neurons via injections of retrograde CAV2-Cre in either NAc core or RMTg. We observed a similar catalog of cortical, thalamic, and limbic afferents for both NAc- and RMTg-projecting populations, with the primary source of afferent information arising from neighboring prefrontal neurons in ipsilateral PL and infralimbic cortex (IL). However, when the two subpopulations were directly compared, we found that RMTg-projecting PL neurons received a greater proportion of input from ipsilateral PL and IL, whereas NAc-projecting PL neurons received a greater proportion of input from most other cortical areas, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, and several other subcortical areas. NAc-projecting PL neurons also received a greater proportion of contralateral cortical input. Our findings reveal that PL subpopulations differ not only in their efferent target but also in the input specificity from afferent structures. These differences in connectivity are likely to be critical to functional differences of PL subpopulations.</p>

<p>There are more than 1000 odorant receptor (OR) genes in the mouse genome. Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one of these genes, in a monoallelic fashion. The transcript abundance of homologous OR genes vary between distinct mouse strains. Here we analyzed the expression of the OR gene Olfr17 (also named P2) in different genomic contexts. Olfr17 is expressed at higher levels in the olfactory epithelium from 129 mice than from C57BL/6 (B6) mice. However, we found that in P2-IRES-tauGFP knock-in mice, the transcript levels of the 129 Olfr17 allele are highly reduced when compared to the B6 Olfr17 allele. To address the mechanisms involved in this variation we compared the 5′ region sequence and DNA methylation patterns of the B6 and 129 Olfr17 alleles. Our results show that genetic variations in cis regulatory regions can lead to differential DNA methylation frequencies in these OR gene alleles. They also show that expression of the Olfr17 alleles is largely affected by the genetic background, and suggest that in knock-in mice, expression can be affected by epigenetic modifications in the region of the targeted locus.</p>

<p>Noradrenaline is a major neuromodulator in the central nervous system (CNS). It is released from varicosities on neuronal efferents, which originate principally from the main noradrenergic nuclei of the brain – the locus coeruleus – and spread throughout the parenchyma. Noradrenaline is released in response to various stimuli and has complex physiological effects, in large part due to the wide diversity of noradrenergic receptors expressed in the brain, which trigger diverse signaling pathways. In general, however, its main effect on CNS function appears to be to increase arousal state. Although the effects of noradrenaline have been researched extensively, the majority of studies have assumed that noradrenaline exerts its effects by acting directly on neurons. However, neurons are not the only cells in the CNS expressing noradrenaline receptors. Astrocytes are responsive to a range of neuromodulators – including noradrenaline. In fact, noradrenaline evokes robust calcium transients in astrocytes across brain regions, through activation of α1-adrenoreceptors. Crucially, astrocytes ensheath neurons at synapses and are known to modulate synaptic activity. Hence, astrocytes are in a key position to relay, or amplify, the effects of noradrenaline on neurons, most notably by modulating inhibitory transmission. Based on a critical appraisal of the current literature, we use this review to argue that a better understanding of astrocyte-mediated noradrenaline signaling is therefore essential, if we are ever to fully understand CNS function. We discuss the emerging concept of astrocyte heterogeneity and speculate on how this might impact the noradrenergic modulation of neuronal circuits. Finally, we outline possible experimental strategies to clearly delineate the role(s) of astrocytes in noradrenergic signaling, and neuromodulation in general, highlighting the urgent need for more specific and flexible experimental tools.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.638686">Inflammation Spreading: Negative Spiral Linking Systemic Inflammatory Disorders and Alzheimer’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>As a physiological response to injury in the internal body organs, inflammation is responsible for removing dangerous stimuli and initiating healing. However, persistent and exaggerative chronic inflammation causes undesirable negative effects in the organs. Inflammation occurring in the brain and spinal cord is known as neuroinflammation, with microglia acting as the central cellular player. There is increasing evidence suggesting that chronic neuroinflammation is the most relevant pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), regulating other pathological features, such as the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Systemic inflammatory signals caused by systemic disorders are known to strongly influence neuroinflammation as a consequence of microglial activation, inflammatory mediator production, and the recruitment of peripheral immune cells to the brain, resulting in neuronal dysfunction. However, the neuroinflammation-accelerated neuronal dysfunction in AD also influences the functions of peripheral organs. In the present review, we highlight the link between systemic inflammatory disorders and AD, with inflammation serving as the common explosion. We discuss the molecular mechanisms that govern the crosstalk between systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. In our view, inflammation spreading indicates a negative spiral between systemic diseases and AD. Therefore, “dampening inflammation” through the inhibition of cathepsin (Cat)B or CatS may be a novel therapeutic approach for delaying the onset of and enacting early intervention for AD.</p>

<p>Strokes are the most common types of cerebrovascular disease and remain a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Cerebral ischemic stroke is caused by a reduction in blood flow to the brain. In this disease, two major zones of injury are identified: the lesion core, in which cells rapidly progress toward death, and the ischemic penumbra (surrounding the lesion core), which is defined as hypoperfusion tissue where cells may remain viable and can be repaired. Two methods that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include intravenous thrombolytic therapy and endovascular thrombectomy, however, the narrow therapeutic window poses a limitation, and therefore a low percentage of stroke patients actually receive these treatments. Developments in stem cell therapy have introduced renewed hope to patients with ischemic stroke due to its potential effect for reversing the neurological sequelae. Over the last few decades, animal tests and clinical trials have been used to treat ischemic stroke experimentally with various types of stem cells. However, several technical and ethical challenges must be overcome before stem cells can become a choice for the treatment of stroke. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms, processes, and challenges of using stem cells in stroke treatment. We also discuss new developing trends in this field.</p>

<p>Dorsal and median raphe nuclei (DR and MR, respectively) are members of the reticular activating system and play important role in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle, movement, and affective states. M-current is a voltage-gated potassium current under the control of neuromodulatory mechanisms setting neuronal excitability. Our goal was to determine the proportion of DR and MR serotonergic neurons possessing M-current and whether they are organized topographically. Electrophysiological parameters of raphe serotonergic neurons influenced by this current were also investigated. We performed slice electrophysiology on genetically identified serotonergic neurons. Neurons with M-current are located rostrally in the DR and dorsally in the MR. M-current determines firing rate, afterhyperpolarization amplitude, and adaptation index (AI) of these neurons, but does not affect input resistance, action potential width, and high threshold oscillations.These findings indicate that M-current has a strong impact on firing properties of certain serotonergic neuronal subpopulations and it might serve as an effective contributor to cholinergic and local serotonergic neuromodulatory actions.</p>

<p>Background and Aims: Numerous studies have demonstrated thalamus-related structural, functional, and metabolic abnormalities in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). We conducted the first study to investigate thalamic structural connectivity alterations in MHE.</p>Methods<p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based probabilistic tractography was employed to determine the structural linkage between the thalamus and cortical/subcortical regions in 52 cirrhotic patients [22 with MHE; 30 without MHE (NHE)] and 30 controls. We measured these thalamic connections, which included connectivity strength (CS), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), and then compared these among the three groups. Neurocognitive assessment was also performed. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between neurocognitive performance and the above measurements. Classification analysis was performed to determine whether thalamic connection measurements can distinguish MHE from NHE.</p>Results<p>The probabilistic tractography revealed thalamic structural connections, which were disrupted in cirrhotic patients (as reflected by a decrease in CS/FA and an increase in MD/AD/RD). Abnormal thalamic connections primarily involved the prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, parietal cortex, medial temporal cortex and hippocampus, and striatum. Thalamic connectivity abnormalities deteriorated from NHE to MHE, and they were correlated with patients’ neurocognitive performance. The moderate classification accuracy was obtained using CS and MD as discriminating indexes.</p>Conclusion<p>Our results demonstrated the altered thalamic structural connectivity involving both cortical and subcortical regions in MHE, which could be regarded as representative of MHE-related widespread impairments in white matter pathways. The disturbed thalamic connectivity may underlie the mechanism of cognitive deficits in MHE and may potentially be utilized as a biomarker for diagnosing MHE and in monitoring disease progression. In addition to thalamic–cortical/subcortical connections, further studies are recommended to explore the structural alterations in other white matter pathways in MHE.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646924">Cellular Senescence in Brain Aging</a></h4>

<p>Aging of the brain can manifest itself as a memory and cognitive decline, which has been shown to frequently coincide with changes in the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Decreased number and maturity of spines in aged animals and humans, together with changes in synaptic transmission, may reflect aberrant neuronal plasticity directly associated with impaired brain functions. In extreme, a neurodegenerative disease, which completely devastates the basic functions of the brain, may develop. While cellular senescence in peripheral tissues has recently been linked to aging and a number of aging-related disorders, its involvement in brain aging is just beginning to be explored. However, accumulated evidence suggests that cell senescence may play a role in the aging of the brain, as it has been documented in other organs. Senescent cells stop dividing and shift their activity to strengthen the secretory function, which leads to the acquisition of the so called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells have also other characteristics, such as altered morphology and proteostasis, decreased propensity to undergo apoptosis, autophagy impairment, accumulation of lipid droplets, increased activity of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), and epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modifications that, in consequence, result in altered gene expression. Proliferation-competent glial cells can undergo senescence both in vitro and in vivo, and they likely participate in neuroinflammation, which is characteristic for the aging brain. However, apart from proliferation-competent glial cells, the brain consists of post-mitotic neurons. Interestingly, it has emerged recently, that non-proliferating neuronal cells present in the brain or cultivated in vitro can also have some hallmarks, including SASP, typical for senescent cells that ceased to divide. It has been documented that so called senolytics, which by definition, eliminate senescent cells, can improve cognitive ability in mice models. In this review, we ask questions about the role of senescent brain cells in brain plasticity and cognitive functions impairments and how senolytics can improve them. We will discuss whether neuronal plasticity, defined as morphological and functional changes at the level of neurons and dendritic spines, can be the hallmark of neuronal senescence susceptible to the effects of senolytics.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640677">Passive Immunization With a Novel Monoclonal Anti-PrP Antibody TW1 in an Alzheimer’s Mouse Model With Tau Pathology</a></h4>

<p>Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a major pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Several studies have shown that amyloid β oligomers (Aβo) and tau oligomers mediate their toxicity, in part, via binding to cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) and that some anti-PrP antibodies can block this interaction. We have generated a novel monoclonal anti-PrP antibody (TW1) and assessed the efficacy of passive immunization with it in a mouse model of AD with extensive tau pathology: hTau/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. These mice were injected intraperitoneally once a week with TW1 starting at 5 months of age. Behavior was assessed at 8 months of age and brain tissue was subsequently harvested for analysis of treatment efficacy at 9 months. Mice treated with TW1 did not show any significant difference in sensorimotor testing including traverse beam, rotarod, and locomotor activity compared to controls. Significant cognitive benefits were observed with the novel object recognition test (ORT) in the immunized mice (two-tailed, t-test p = 0.0019). Immunized mice also showed cognitive benefits on the closed field symmetrical maze (day 1 two-tailed t-test p = 0.0001; day 2 two-tailed t-test p = 0.0015; day 3 two-tailed t-test p = 0.0002). Reduction of tau pathology was observed with PHF-1 immunohistochemistry in the piriform cortex by 60% (two-tailed t-test p = 0.01) and in the dentate gyrus by 50% (two-tailed t-test p = 0.02) in animals treated with TW1 compared to controls. There were no significant differences in astrogliosis or microgliosis observed between treated and control mice. As assessed by Western blots using PHF-1, the TW1 therapy reduced phosphorylated tau pathology (two-tailed t-test p = 0.03) and improved the ratio of pathological soluble tau to tubulin (PHF1/tubulin; two-tailed t-test p = 0.0006). Reduction of tau pathology also was observed using the CP13 antibody (two-tailed t-test p = 0.0007). These results indicate that passive immunization with the TW1 antibody can significantly decrease tau pathology as assessed by immunohistochemical and biochemical methods, resulting in improved cognitive function in a tau transgenic mouse model of AD.</p>

<p>Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) promotes neuronal survival downstream. This longitudinal study evaluated whether the TNFRSF1B gene encoding TNFR2 and levels of its soluble form (sTNFR2) affect Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Data analyzed included 188 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. Further, a replication study was performed in 48 patients with MCI with positive AD biomarkers who were treated at a memory clinic. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTNFR2 levels along with two related TNFRSF1B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs976881 and rs1061622 were assessed. General linear models were used to evaluate the effect of CSF sTNFR2 levels and each SNP in relationship to CSF t-tau and p-tau, cognitive domains, MRI brain measures, and longitudinal cognitive changes after adjustments were made for covariates such as APOE ε4 status. In the ADNI cohort, a significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 modulates CSF t-tau and p-tau levels; hippocampal and whole brain volumes; and Digit Span Forwards subtest scores. In the replication cohort, a significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 modulates CSF p-tau. A significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 also impacts Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scores over 12 months in the ADNI cohort. The interaction between TNFRSF1B variant rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 levels was noted to modulate multiple AD-associated severity markers and cognitive domains. This interaction impacts resilience-related clinical outcomes in AD and lends support to sTNFR2 as a promising candidate for therapeutic targeting to improve clinical outcomes of interest.</p>

<p>Purpose: The retina and the brain share similar neuronal and microvascular features, therein we aimed to assess the structural and microvascular changes in the macula and choriocapillaris (CC) in patients with cerebral infarction when compared with healthy controls using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).</p><p>Methods: OCTA was used to image and measure the capillary density in the radial peripapillary capillaries (RPC), superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), choriocapillaris (CC), and mean area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in all participants. Twenty-two cerebral infarction patients based on their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 25 healthy controls were included in our study.</p><p>Results: Density of the RPC (P &lt; 0.001), SCP (P = 0.001), DCP (P &lt; 0.001) and CC (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly reduced in cerebral infarction patients when compared with healthy controls, respectively. Retinal thickness measurements (P &lt; 0.05) were significantly reduced in cerebral infarction patients when compared with healthy controls. The mean FAZ area was significantly larger (P = 0.012) in cerebral infarction patients when compared with healthy controls. National Institute of HealthStroke Scale (NIHSS) inversely correlated with SCP density in cerebral infarction patients (Rho = −0.409, P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that the blood flow of the choriocapillaris had the highest index [area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic (AUROC) = 0.964] to discriminate cerebral infarction patients from the healthy controls.</p><p>Conclusions: Our study suggests that cerebral microcirculation dysfunction which occurs in cerebral infarction is mirrored in the macula and choroidal microcirculation. OCTA has the potential to non-invasively characterize the macula and choroidal changes in cerebral infarction in vivo.</p>

<p>Background: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum uric acid (UA) and the risk of dementia and its subtypes.</p><p>Methods: Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched from inception to July 2020. Random-effect models were employed to analyze the standard mean difference (SMD) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).</p><p>Results: Twenty-three eligible studies involving 5,575 participants were identified. The overall results showed lower levels of UA in dementia relative to non-dementia controls [SMD = −0.32 (−0.64; −0.01) p = 0.04]. The subgroup analysis of the type of dementia demonstrated a significant association of UA with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [SMD = −0.58 (−1.02; −0.15) p = 0.009] and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) [SMD = −0.33 (−0.52; −0.14) p = 0.001] but not with vascular dementia (VaD). The stratification analysis of the concentrations of UA revealed that the UA quartile 1–2 was negatively correlated with dementia and neurodegenerative subtypes (p &lt; 0.05), whereas a positive correlation of UA quartile 4 with dementia was noted (p = 0.028). Additionally, the meta-regression analysis on confounders showed that not age, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or smoking but education (p = 0.003) exerted an influence of the UA in the risk estimate of dementia.</p><p>Conclusions: Low concentrations of UA (&lt; 292 μmol/L or 4.91 mg/dL) is a potential risk factor for AD and PDD but not for VaD. The mechanism of different concentrations of the UA in dementia needs to be confirmed through further investigation.</p>

<p>Older adults with mild or no hearing loss make more errors and expend more effort listening to speech. Cochlear implants (CI) restore hearing to deaf patients but with limited fidelity. We hypothesized that patient-reported hearing and health-related quality of life in CI patients may similarly vary according to age. Speech Spatial Qualities (SSQ) of hearing scale and Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI) questionnaires were administered to 543 unilaterally implanted adults across Europe, South Africa, and South America. Data were acquired before surgery and at 1, 2, and 3 years post-surgery. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models with visit, age group (18–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and 65+), and side of implant as main factors and adjusted for other covariates. Tinnitus and dizziness prevalence did not vary with age, but older groups had more preoperative hearing. Preoperatively and postoperatively, SSQ scores were significantly higher (Δ0.75–0.82) for those aged &lt;45 compared with those 55+. However, gains in SSQ scores were equivalent across age groups, although postoperative SSQ scores were higher in right-ear implanted subjects. All age groups benefited equally in terms of HUI gain (0.18), with no decrease in scores with age. Overall, younger adults appeared to cope better with a degraded hearing before and after CI, leading to better subjective hearing performance.</p>

<p>by Mengmeng Niu, Yajun He, Jing Xu, Liangping Ding, Tao He, Yong Yi, Mengyuan Fu, Rongtian Guo, Fengtian Li, Hu Chen, Ye-Guang Chen, Zhi-Xiong Jim Xiao</p>

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a critical role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis. ΔNp63α, the major isoform of p63 protein expressed in epithelial cells, is a key transcriptional regulator of cell adhesion program and functions as a critical metastasis suppressor. It has been documented that the expression of ΔNp63α is tightly controlled by oncogenic signaling and is frequently reduced in advanced cancers. However, whether TGF-β signaling regulates ΔNp63α expression in promoting metastasis is largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of TGF-β signaling leads to stabilization of E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO3, which, in turn, targets ΔNp63α for proteasomal degradation in a Smad-independent but Erk-dependent manner. Knockdown of FBXO3 or restoration of ΔNp63α expression effectively rescues TGF-β-induced EMT, cell motility, and tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, clinical analyses reveal a significant correlation among TGF-β receptor I (TβRI), FBXO3, and p63 protein expression and that high expression of TβRI/FBXO3 and low expression of p63 are associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS). Together, these results demonstrate that FBXO3 facilitates ΔNp63α degradation to empower TGF-β signaling in promoting tumor metastasis and that the TβRI-FBXO3-ΔNp63α axis is critically important in breast cancer development and clinical prognosis. This study suggests that FBXO3 may be a potential therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/26UgbajAt_Y" width="1" />

<p>by Tracey L. Weissgerber</p>

Meta-research, or the science of science, is a powerful technique that scientists can use to improve science, however most scientists are unaware that meta-research exists and courses are rare. This initiative demonstrates the feasibility of a participant-guided “learn by doing” approach, in which a multidisciplinary, global team of early career researchers learned meta-research skills by working together to design, conduct and publish a meta-research study.

This Community Page article describes a participant-guided "learn by doing" initiative, in which a multidisciplinary, global team of early career researchers learned meta-research skills by working together to design, conduct and publish a meta-research (science of science) study. Participants can now apply these skills to solve problems in their own fields.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TWxZFIH1WvY" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26043?af=R">Apolipoprotein E4 Reduction with Antisense Oligonucleotides Decreases Neurodegeneration in a Tauopathy Model</a></h4>

Objective
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease, with the ε4 allele increasing risk in a dose‐dependent fashion. In addition to ApoE4 playing a crucial role in amyloid‐β deposition, recent evidence suggests that it also plays an important role in tau pathology and tau‐mediated neurodegeneration. It is not known, however, whether therapeutic reduction of ApoE4 would exert protective effects on tau‐mediated neurodegeneration.


Methods
Herein, we used antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against human APOE to reduce ApoE4 levels in the P301S/ApoE4 mouse model of tauopathy. We treated P301S/ApoE4 mice with ApoE or control ASOs via intracerebroventricular injection at 6 and 7.5 months of age and performed brain pathological assessments at 9 months of age.


Results
Our results indicate that treatment with ApoE ASOs reduced ApoE4 protein levels by ~50%, significantly protected against tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration, decreased neuroinflammation, and preserved synaptic density. These data were also corroborated by a significant reduction in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in plasma of ASO‐treated mice.


Interpretation
We conclude that reducing ApoE4 levels should be explored further as a therapeutic approach for APOE4 carriers with tauopathy including Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021

Objective
The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with current diagnostic criteria (revised El Escorial [rEEC] and Awaji) being complex and prone to error. Consequently, the diagnostic utility of the recently proposed Gold Coast criteria was determined in ALS.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 506 patients (302 males, 204 females) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Gold Coast criteria to that of the Awaji and rEEC criteria (defined by the proportion of patients categorized as definite, probable, or possible ALS) in accordance with standards of reporting of diagnostic accuracy criteria.


Results
The sensitivity of Gold Coast criteria (92%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.7–94.6%) was comparable to that of Awaji (90.3%, 95% CI = 86.69–93.2%) and rEEC (88.6, 95% CI = 84.8–91.7%) criteria. Additionally, the Gold Coast criteria sensitivity was maintained across different subgroups, defined by site of onset, disease duration, and functional disability. In atypical ALS phenotypes, the Gold Coast criteria exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity.


Interpretation
The present study established the diagnostic utility of the Gold Coast criteria in ALS, with benefits evident in bulbar and limb onset disease patients, as well as atypical phenotypes. The Gold Coast criteria should be considered in clinical practice and therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2021

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐12, chemokine (C‐X‐C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL‐6, CXCL8, and active tumor growth factor β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system in COVID‐19 can appear early, as a parainfectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines. ANN NEUROL 2021

The orientation of radial glia in the dorsal telencephalon of teleost fish follows a morphogenetic process called eversion. We studied the radial glia in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni and found that glial processes get increasingly displaced by central pallial areas during growth. New cells are added to the growing brain subventricularly consistent with a stacking growth pattern (Cell Addition I). In addition, our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating astroglial cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions (Cell Addition II).







Abstract
In the brain of teleost fish, radial glial cells are the main astroglial cell type. To understand how radial glia structures are adapting to continuous growth of the brain, we studied the astroglial cells in the telencephalon of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni in small fry to large specimens. These animals grow to a standard length of 10–12 cm in this fish species, corresponding to a more than 100‐fold increase in brain volume. Focusing on the telencephalon where glial cells are arranged radially in the everted (dorsal) pallium, immunocytochemistry for glial markers revealed an aberrant pattern of radial glial fibers in the central division of the dorsal pallium (DC, i.e., DC4 and DC5). The main glial processes curved around these nuclei, especially in the posterior part of the telencephalon. This was verified in tissue‐cleared brains stained for glial markers. We further analyzed the growth of radial glia by immunocytochemically applied stem cell (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], Sox2) and differentiation marker (doublecortin) and found that these markers were expressed at the ventricular surface consistent with a stacking growth pattern. In addition, we detected doublecortin and Sox2 positive cells in deeper nuclei of DC areas. Our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions. This results in expansion of the central pallial areas and displacement of existing radial glial. In summary, we show that radial glial cells can adapt to morphological growth processes in the adult fish brain and contribute to this growth.

In this randomized controlled trial, we found little evidence that the Cogmed working memory training program influenced brain structural connectivity networks compared with a placebo program in children born extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight. There was also little evidence for relationships between structural connectivity and working memory performance.

Abstract
Children born extremely preterm (EP, &lt;28 weeks’ gestation) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW, &lt;1,000 g) are a vulnerable population at high risk of working memory impairments. We aimed to examine changes in the brain structural connectivity networks thought to underlie working memory performance, after completion of a working memory training program (Cogmed) compared with a placebo program in EP/ELBW children. This was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled randomized trial (the Improving Memory in a Preterm Randomised Intervention Trial). Children born EP/ELBW received either the Cogmed or placebo program at 7 years of age (n = 91). A subset of children had magnetic resonance imaging of the brain immediately pre‐ and 2 weeks post‐training (Cogmed n = 28; placebo n = 27). T1‐weighted and diffusion‐weighted images were used to perform graph theoretical analysis of structural connectivity networks. Changes from pre‐training to post‐training in structural connectivity metrics were generally similar between randomized groups. There was little evidence that changes in structural connectivity metrics were related to changes in working memory performance from pre‐ to post‐training. Overall, our results provide little evidence that the Cogmed working memory training program has training‐specific effects on structural connectivity networks in EP/ELBW children.

<p>Beside its widely studied role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), β-amyloid (Aβ) is a normal and soluble product of neuronal metabolism that regulates several key physiological functions, exerting neuromodulatory effects on synaptic plasticity, memory, and neurotransmitter release. Such effects have been observed to occur in a hormetic fashion, with Aβ exhibiting a dual role influenced by its concentration, the different isoforms, or aggregation forms of the peptide. However, to date, our knowledge about the physiological functions of Aβ and, in particular, its modulatory role on synaptic activity and neurotransmission in the normal brain is fragmentary, thus hindering a clear comprehension of the biological mechanisms underlying the derangement from function to dysfunction. In particular, according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the switch from physiology to pathology is linked to the abnormal increase in Aβ levels, due to an imbalance in Aβ production and clearance. In this regard, increased Aβ levels have been hypothesized to induce early defects in synaptic function and such alterations have been suggested to account, at least in part, for the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., apathy, anxiety, changes in mood, depression, and agitation/aggression), frequently observed in the prodromal stage of AD. Therefore, understanding the biological mechanisms underlying early synaptic alterations in AD is a key starting point to frame the relevant time windows for AD treatment and to gain insight into AD etiopathogenesis.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked with tauopathy. However, imaging methods that can non-invasively detect tau-protein abnormalities following TBI need further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect tauopathy following TBI in P301L mutant-tau-transgenic-pR5-mice. A total of 24 9-month-old pR5 mice were randomly assigned to sham and TBI groups. Controlled cortical injuries/craniotomies were performed for TBI/sham groups followed by DTI data acquisition on days 1 and 7 post-injury. DTI data were analyzed by using voxelwise analysis and track-based spatial statistics for gray matter and white matter. Further, immunohistochemistry was performed for total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, astrocytes, and microglia. To detect the association of DTI with these pathological markers, a correlation analysis was performed between DTI and histology findings. At day 1 post-TBI, DTI revealed a widespread reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AxD) in the TBI group compared to shams. On day 7, further reduction in FA, AxD, and mean diffusivity and increased radial diffusivity were observed. FA was significantly increased in the amygdala and cortex. Correlation results showed that in the ipsilateral hemisphere FA reduction was associated with increased phosphorylated-tau and glial-immunoreactivity, whereas in the contralateral regions, the FA increase was associated with increased immunostaining for astrocytes. This study is the first to exploit DTI to investigate the effect of TBI in tau-transgenic mice. We show that alterations in the DTI signal were associated with glial activity following TBI and would most likely reflect changes that co-occur with/without phosphorylated-tau. In addition, FA may be a promising measure to identify discrete pathological processes such as increased astroglia activation, tau-hyperphosphorylation or both in the brain following TBI.</p>

<p>The clinical characteristics and biological effects on the nervous system of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain poorly understood. The aim of this study is to advance epidemiological and mechanistic understanding of the neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using stroke as a case study. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies reporting stroke history, intensive inflammatory response, and procoagulant state C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), and coagulation indicator (D-dimer) in patients with COVID-19. Via network-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 host genes and stroke-associated genes in the human protein-protein interactome, we inspected the underlying inflammatory mechanisms between COVID-19 and stroke. Finally, we further verified the network-based findings using three RNA-sequencing datasets generated from SARS-CoV-2 infected populations. We found that the overall pooled prevalence of stroke history was 2.98% (95% CI, 1.89–4.68; I<sup>2</sup>=69.2%) in the COVID-19 population. Notably, the severe group had a higher prevalence of stroke (6.06%; 95% CI 3.80–9.52; I<sup>2</sup> = 42.6%) compare to the non-severe group (1.1%, 95% CI 0.72–1.71; I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%). There were increased levels of CRP, PCT, and D-dimer in severe illness, and the pooled mean difference was 40.7 mg/L (95% CI, 24.3–57.1), 0.07 μg/L (95% CI, 0.04–0.10) and 0.63 mg/L (95% CI, 0.28–0.97), respectively. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), one of the leukocyte adhesion molecules, is suspected to play a vital role of SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammatory responses. RNA-sequencing data analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients further revealed the relative importance of inflammatory responses in COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. In summary, we identified an elevated vulnerability of those with a history of stroke to severe COVID-19 underlying inflammatory responses (i.e., VCAM-1) and procoagulant pathways, suggesting monotonic relationships, thus implicating causality.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.598693">A Deep Learning Approach for the Photoacoustic Tomography Recovery From Undersampled Measurements</a></h4>

<p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a propitious imaging modality, which is helpful for biomedical study. However, fast PAT imaging and denoising is an exigent task in medical research. To address the problem, recently, methods based on compressed sensing (CS) have been proposed, which accede the low computational cost and high resolution for implementing PAT. Nevertheless, the imaging results of the sparsity-based methods strictly rely on sparsity and incoherence conditions. Furthermore, it is onerous to ensure that the experimentally acquired photoacoustic data meets CS’s prerequisite conditions. In this work, a deep learning–based PAT (Deep-PAT)method is instigated to overcome these limitations. By using a neural network, Deep-PAT is not only able to reconstruct PAT from a fewer number of measurements without considering the prerequisite conditions of CS, but also can eliminate undersampled artifacts effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that Deep-PAT is proficient at recovering high-quality photoacoustic images using just 5% of the original measurement data. Besides this, compared with the sparsity-based method, it can be seen through statistical analysis that the quality is significantly improved by 30% (approximately), having average SSIM = 0.974 and PSNR = 29.88 dB with standard deviation ±0.007 and ±0.089, respectively, by the proposed Deep-PAT method. Also, a comparsion of multiple neural networks provides insights into choosing the best one for further study and practical implementation.</p>

<p>In this work fMRI BOLD datasets are shown to contain slice-dependent non-stationarities. A model containing slice-dependent, non-stationary signal power is proposed to address time-varying signal power during BOLD data acquisition. The impact of non-stationary power on functional MRI connectivity is analytically derived, establishing that pairwise connectivity estimates are scaled by a function of the time-varying signal power, with magnitude upper bound by 1, and that the variance of sample correlation is increased, thereby inducing spurious connectivity. Consequently, we make the observation that time-varying power during acquisition of BOLD timeseries has the propensity to diminish connectivity estimates. To ameliorate the impact of non-stationary signal power, a simple correction for slice-dependent non-stationarity is proposed. Our correction is analytically shown to restore both signal stationarity and, subsequently, the integrity of connectivity estimates. Theoretical results are corroborated with empirical evidence demonstrating the utility of our correction. In addition, slice-dependent non-stationary variance is experimentally determined to be optimally characterized by an inverse Gamma distribution. The resulting distribution of a voxel's signal intensity is analytically derived to be a generalized Student's-t distribution, providing support for the Gaussianity assumption typically imposed by fMRI connectivity methods.</p>

<p>Objective: To examine changes in patients’ desired control of the deep brain stimulator (DBS) and perception of global life control throughout DBS.</p><p>Methods: A consecutive cohort of 52 patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) was recruited to participate in a prospective longitudinal study over three assessment points (pre-surgery, post-surgery months 3 and 6).

These changes were unrelated to improvements in motor symptoms. Improvements in global control were negatively correlated with a decline in desired stimulation control. Qualitative data indicate that participants have changed, nuanced levels of desired control over their stimulators. Increased global life control following DBS may be attributed to increased control over PD symptoms, increased ability to engage in valued activities, and increased overall self-regulation, while other domains related to global control remained unaffected by DBS.</p><p>Conclusions: There are few empirical data documenting patients’ desire for stimulation control throughout neuromodulation and how stimulation control is related to other aspects of control despite the growing application of neuromodulation devices to treat a variety of disorders. Our data highlight distinctions in different types of control and have implications for the development of patient-controlled neurostimulation devices.</p>

<p>The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents is reported to be as high as 20%; thus, MDD constitutes a significant social and public health burden. MDD is often associated with nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) behavior, but the contributing factors including cognitive function have not been investigated in detail. To this end, the present study evaluated cognitive impairment and psychosocial factors in associated with MDD with NSSI behavior. Eighteen and 21 drug-naïve patients with first-episode MDD with or without NSSI (NSSI+/– group) and 24 healthy control subjects (HC) were enrolled in the study. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Adolescent Self-injury Questionnaire, Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation–Chinese Version (BSI-CV), Shame Scale for Middle School Students, Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were used to assess depression-related behaviors, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded as a measure of cognitive function. The latency of the N1, N2, P3a, P3b, and P50 components of ERPs at the Cz electrode point; P50 amplitude and P50 inhibition (S1/S2) showed significant differences between the 3 groups. CTQ scores also differed across three groups, and the NSSI– and NSSI+ groups showed significant differences in scores on the Shame Scale for Middle School Students. Thus, cognitive function was impaired in adolescents with MDD with NSSI behavior, which was mainly manifested as memory decline, attention and executive function deficits, and low anti-interference ability. We also found that childhood abuse, lack of social support, and a sense of shame contributed to NSSI behavior. These findings provide insight into the risk factors for MDD with NSSI behavior, which can help mental health workers more effectively diagnose and treat these patients.</p>

<p>A high percent of oxidative energy metabolism is needed to support brain growth during infancy. Unhealthy diets and limited nutrition, as well as other environmental insults, can compromise these essential developmental processes. In particular, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) has been found to undermine both normal brain growth and neurobehavioral development. Even moderate ID may affect neural maturation because when iron is limited, it is prioritized first to red blood cells over the brain. A primate model was used to investigate the neural effects of a transient ID and if deficits would persist after iron treatment. The large size and postnatal growth of the monkey brain makes the findings relevant to the metabolic and iron needs of human infants, and initiating treatment upon diagnosis of anemia reflects clinical practice. Specifically, this analysis determined whether brain maturation would still be compromised at 1 year of age if an anemic infant was treated promptly once diagnosed. The hematology and iron status of 41 infant rhesus monkeys was screened at 2-month intervals. Fifteen became ID; 12 met clinical criteria for anemia and were administered iron dextran and B vitamins for 1–2 months. MRI scans were acquired at 1 year. The volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures from the ID infants were compared with monkeys who remained continuously iron sufficient (IS). A prior history of ID was associated with smaller total brain volumes, driven primarily by significantly less total gray matter (GM) and smaller GM volumes in several cortical regions. At the macrostructual level, the effect on white matter volumes (WM) was not as overt. However, DTI analyses of WM microstructure indicated two later-maturating anterior tracts were negatively affected. The findings reaffirm the importance of iron for normal brain development. Given that brain differences were still evident even after iron treatment and following recovery of iron-dependent hematological indices, the results highlight the importance of early detection and preemptive supplementation to limit the neural consequences of ID.</p>

<p>Recurrent cortical networks provide reservoirs of states that are thought to play a crucial role for sequential information processing in the brain. However, classical reservoir computing requires manual adjustments of global network parameters, particularly of the spectral radius of the recurrent synaptic weight matrix. It is hence not clear if the spectral radius is accessible to biological neural networks. Using random matrix theory, we show that the spectral radius is related to local properties of the neuronal dynamics whenever the overall dynamical state is only weakly correlated. This result allows us to introduce two local homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanisms, termed flow control and variance control, that implicitly drive the spectral radius toward the desired value. For both mechanisms the spectral radius is autonomously adapted while the network receives and processes inputs under working conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two adaptation mechanisms under different external input protocols. Moreover, we evaluated the network performance after adaptation by training the network to perform a time-delayed XOR operation on binary sequences. As our main result, we found that flow control reliably regulates the spectral radius for different types of input statistics. Precise tuning is however negatively affected when interneural correlations are substantial. Furthermore, we found a consistent task performance over a wide range of input strengths/variances. Variance control did however not yield the desired spectral radii with the same precision, being less consistent across different input strengths. Given the effectiveness and remarkably simple mathematical form of flow control, we conclude that self-consistent local control of the spectral radius via an implicit adaptation scheme is an interesting and biological plausible alternative to conventional methods using set point homeostatic feedback controls of neural firing.</p>

<p>The advent of optogenetics has revolutionized experimental research in the field of Neuroscience and the possibility to selectively stimulate neurons in 3D volumes has opened new routes in the understanding of brain dynamics and functions. The combination of multiphoton excitation and optogenetic methods allows to identify and excite specific neuronal targets by means of the generation of cloud of excitation points. The most widely employed approach to produce the points cloud is through a spatial light modulation (SLM) which works with a refresh rate of tens of Hz. However, the computational time requested to calculate 3D patterns ranges between a few seconds and a few minutes, strongly limiting the overall performance of the system. The maximum speed of SLM can in fact be employed either with high quality patterns embedded into pre-calculated sequences or with low quality patterns for real time update. Here, we propose the implementation of a recently developed compressed sensing Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm on a consumer graphical processor unit allowing the generation of high quality patterns at video rate. This, would in turn dramatically reduce dead times in the experimental sessions, and could enable applications previously impossible, such as the control of neuronal network activity driven by the feedback from single neurons functional signals detected through calcium or voltage imaging or the real time compensation of motion artifacts.</p>

<p>Increased innate immune activation and inflammation are common findings in psychotic and affective (mood) disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), including increased numbers and activation of monocytes and macrophages. These findings often differ depending on the disorder, for example, we previously found increases in circulating inflammatory cytokines associated with monocytes and macrophages in SCZ, while BD had increases in anti-inflammatory cytokines. Despite these differences, few studies have specifically compared immune dysfunction in affective versus non-affective psychotic disorders and none have compared functional monocyte responses across these disorders. To address this, we recruited 25 first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and 23 healthy controls (HC). FEP patients were further grouped based on the presence (AFF) or absence (NON) of mood disorder. We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cultured them for 1 week with M-CSF to obtain monocyte-derived macrophages. These cells were then stimulated for 24 h to skew them to inflammatory and alternative phenotypes, in order to identify differences in these responses. Following stimulation with LPS and LPS plus IFNγ, we found that macrophages from the NON-group had diminished inflammatory responses compared to both HC and AFF groups. Interestingly, when skewing macrophages to an alternative phenotype using LPS plus IL-4, the AFF macrophages increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Receiver operating curve analysis showed predictive power of inflammatory cytokine concentrations after LPS stimulation in the AFF group versus NON-group. Our results suggest dysfunctional monocyte responses in both affective and non-affective psychotic disorder, with varying types of immune dysfunction depending on the presence or absence of a mood component.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative maladies with unforeseen complex pathologies. While this neurodegenerative disorder’s neuropathology is reasonably well known, its etiology remains a mystery, making it challenging to aim therapy. Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) remains an auspicious therapeutic molecule for treating PD. Neurotrophic factor derived from glial cell lines is effective in rodents and nonhuman primates, but clinical findings have been equivocal. Laborious exertions have been made over the past few decades to improve and assess GDNF in treating PD (clinical studies). Definitive clinical trials have, however, failed to demonstrate a survival advantage. Consequently, there seemed to be a doubt as to whether GDNF has merit in the potential treatment of PD. The purpose of this cutting edge review is to speculate as to why the clinical trials have failed to meet the primary endpoint. We introduce a hypothesis, “Failure of GDNF in clinical trials succumbed by nuclear receptor-related factor 1 (Nurr1) shortfall.” We demonstrate how Nurr1 binds to GDNF to induce dopaminergic neuron synthesis. Due to its undisputable neuro-protection aptitude, we display Nurr1 (also called Nr4a2) as a promising therapeutic target for PD.</p>

<p>Background: Despite known associations between low blood hemoglobin level and Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cognitive impairment, the underlying neuropathological links are poorly understood. We aimed to examine the relationships of blood hemoglobin levels with in vivo AD pathologies (i.e., cerebral beta-amyloid [Aβ] deposition, tau deposition, and AD-signature degeneration) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which are a measure of cerebrovascular injury. We also investigated the association between hemoglobin level and cognitive performance, and then assessed whether such an association is mediated by brain pathologies.</p><p>Methods: A total of 428 non-demented older adults underwent comprehensive clinical assessments, hemoglobin level measurement, and multimodal brain imaging, including Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PET), AV-1451 PET, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging. Episodic memory score and global cognition scores were also measured.</p><p>Results: A lower hemoglobin level was significantly associated with reduced AD-signature cerebral glucose metabolism (AD-CM), but not Aβ deposition, tau deposition, or WMH volume. A lower hemoglobin level was also significantly associated with poorer episodic memory and global cognition scores, but such associations disappeared when AD-CM was controlled as a covariate, indicating that AD-CM has a moderating effect.</p><p>Conclusion: The present findings suggest that low blood hemoglobin in older adults is associated with cognitive decline via reduced brain metabolism, which seems to be independent of those aspects of AD-specific protein pathologies and cerebrovascular injury that are reflected in PET and MRI measures.</p>

<p>Aging affects the overall physiology, including the image-forming and non-image forming visual systems. Among the components of the latter, the thalamic retinorecipient inter-geniculate leaflet (IGL) and ventral lateral geniculate (vLGN) nucleus conveys light information to subcortical regions, adjusting visuomotor, and circadian functions. It is noteworthy that several visual related cells, such as neuronal subpopulations in the IGL and vLGN are neurochemically characterized by the presence of calcium binding proteins. Calretinin (CR), a representative of such proteins, denotes region-specificity in a temporal manner by variable day–night expression. In parallel, age-related brain dysfunction and neurodegeneration are associated with abnormal intracellular concentrations of calcium. Here, we investigated whether daily changes in the number of CR neurons are a feature of the aged IGL and vLGN in rats. To this end, we perfused rats, ranging from 3 to 24 months of age, within distinct phases of the day, namely zeitgeber times (ZTs). Then, we evaluated CR immunolabeling through design-based stereological cell estimation. We observed distinct daily rhythms of CR expression in the IGL and in both the retinorecipient (vLGNe) and non-retinorecipient (vLGNi) portions of the vLGN. In the ZT 6, the middle of the light phase, the CR cells are reduced with aging in the IGL and vLGNe. In the ZT 12, the transition between light to dark, an age-related CR loss was found in all nuclei. While CR expression predominates in specific spatial domains of vLGN, age-related changes appear not to be restricted at particular portions. No alterations were found in the dark/light transition or in the middle of the dark phase, ZTs 0, and 18, respectively. These results are relevant in the understanding of how aging shifts the phenotype of visual related cells at topographically organized channels of visuomotor and circadian processing.</p>

<p>Objective: To define resilience metrics for cognitive decline based on plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ) and examine the demographic, genetic, and neuroimaging factors associated with interindividual differences among metrics of resilience and to demonstrate the ability of such metrics to predict the diagnostic conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p><p>Methods: In this study, cognitively normal (CN) participants with Aβ-positive were included from the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE, n = 100) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 144). Using a latent variable model of data, metrics of resilience [brain resilience (BR), cognitive resilience (CR), and global resilience (GR)] were defined based on the plasma Aβ and CSF Aβ. Linear regression analyses were applied to investigate the association between characteristics of individuals (age, sex, educational level, genetic, and neuroimaging factors) and their resilience. The plausibility of these metrics was tested using linear mixed-effects models and Cox regression models in longitudinal analyses. We also compared the effectiveness of these metrics with conventional metrics in predicting the clinical progression.</p><p>Results: Although individuals in the ADNI cohort were older (74.68 [5.65] vs. 65.38 [4.66], p &lt; 0.001) and had higher educational levels (16.3 [2.6] vs. 12.6 [2.8], p &lt; 0.001) than those in the SILCODE cohort, similar loadings between resilience and its indicators were found within both models. BR and GR were mainly associated with age, women, and brain volume in both cohorts. Prediction models showed that higher CR and GR were related to better cognitive performance, and specifically, all types of resilience to CSF Aβ could predict longitudinal cognitive decline.</p><p>Conclusion: Different phenotypes of resilience depending on cognition and brain volumes were associated with different factors. Such comprehensive resilience provided insight into the mechanisms of susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the individual level, and interindividual differences in resilience had the potential to predict the disease progression in CN people.</p>

<p>Background: The incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the elderly is high, and the disorder is associated with a variety of chronic diseases. Microvesicles (MVs) are extracellular vesicles secreted by various cells during stimulation or apoptosis that play an important role in the pathogenesis of OSA. However, concentrations of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA remain unclear.</p><p>Methods: Patients aged &gt;60 years old were recruited and underwent polysomnography. Circulating plasma MV concentrations, including annexin V<sup>+</sup>MVs, endothelial MVs (EMVs), platelet MVs (PMVs), and leukocyte MVs (LMVs) levels, were measured using a flow cytometer with different labeling methods. Potential factors affecting the concentration of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA were determined via Spearman's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis.</p><p>Results: Levels of circulating MVs, including both single- (annexin V<sup>+</sup>MVs, CD144<sup>+</sup>EMVs, CD41a<sup>+</sup>PMVs, and CD45<sup>+</sup>LMVs) and dual-labeled MVs (annexin V<sup>+</sup>CD144<sup>+</sup>EMVs), were elevated in elderly patients with OSA. Circulating MVs were positively correlated with OSA severity (AHI, ODI, and SPO<sub>2min</sub>). To some extent, obesity affected the MV concentrations in elderly patients with OSA. In addition, age and comorbidities may be associated with MV levels, but the correlations between the MV levels and age or comorbidities were not significant.</p><p>Conclusion: Concentrations of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA are associated with the labeling method used, OSA severity, and obesity. The effects of age and comorbidities on circulating MV levels require further verification using a larger sample size.</p>

<p>Network efficiency characterizes how information flows within a network, and it has been used to study the neural basis of cognitive intelligence in adolescence, young adults, and elderly adults, in terms of the white matter in the human brain and functional connectivity networks. However, there were few studies investigating whether the human brain at different ages exhibited different underpins of cognitive and emotional intelligence (EI) from young adults to the middle-aged group, especially in terms of the morphological similarity networks in the human brain. In this study, we used 65 datasets (aging 18–64), including sMRI and behavioral measurements, to study the associations of network efficiency with cognitive intelligence and EI in young adults and the middle-aged group. We proposed a new method of defining the human brain morphological networks using the morphological distribution similarity (including cortical volume, surface area, and thickness). Our results showed inverted age × network efficiency interactions in the relationship of surface-area network efficiency with cognitive intelligence and EI: a negative age × global efficiency (nodal efficiency) interaction in cognitive intelligence, while a positive age × global efficiency (nodal efficiency) interaction in EI. In summary, this study not only proposed a new method of morphological similarity network but also emphasized the developmental effects on the brain mechanisms of intelligence from young adult to middle-aged groups and may promote mental health study on the middle-aged group in the future.</p>

<p>Aberrant secretion and accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) as well as the loss of parkin function are associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our previous study suggested a functional interaction between those two proteins, showing that the extracellular α-Syn evoked post-translational modifications of parkin, leading to its autoubiquitination and degradation. While parkin plays an important role in mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover, including mitochondrial fission/fusion as well as mitophagy, the involvement of parkin deregulation in α-Syn-induced mitochondrial damage is largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that treatment with exogenous α-Syn triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, reflected by the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, elevated synthesis of the mitochondrial superoxide anion, and a decrease in cellular ATP level. At the same time, we observed a protective effect of parkin overexpression on α-Syn-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. α-Syn-dependent disturbances of mitophagy were also shown to be directly related to reduced parkin levels in mitochondria and decreased ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins. Also, α-Syn impaired mitochondrial biosynthesis due to the parkin-dependent reduction of PGC-1α protein levels. Finally, loss of parkin function as a result of α-Syn treatment induced an overall breakdown of mitochondrial homeostasis that led to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria. These findings may thus provide the first compelling evidence for the direct association of α-Syn-mediated parkin depletion to impaired mitochondrial function in PD. We suggest that improvement of parkin function may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent mitochondrial impairment and neurodegeneration in PD (thereby slowing the progression of the disease).</p>
