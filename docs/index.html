	<p>Motor imagery (MI) describes a dynamic cognitive process where a movement is mentally simulated without taking place and holds potential as a means of stimulating motor learning and regaining motor skills. There is growing evidence that imagined and executed actions have common neural circuitry. Since MI counteracts cognitive and motor decline, a growing interest in MI-based mental exercise for older individuals has emerged. Here we review the last decade&amp;amp;rsquo;s scientific literature on age-related changes in MI skills. Heterogeneity in the experimental protocols, as well as the use of populations with unrepresentative age, is making it challenging to draw unambiguous conclusions about MI skills preservation. Self-report and behavioural tasks have shown that some MI components are preserved, while others are impaired. Evidence from neuroimaging studies revealed that, during MI tasks, older individuals hyperactivate their sensorimotor and attentional networks. Some studies have argued that this represents a compensatory mechanism, others claim that this is a sign of cognitive decline. However, further studies are needed to establish whether MI could be used as a promotion factor to improve cognitive functioning and well-being in older people.</p>

	<p>Fatigue, depression, and sleep inertia are frequently underdiagnosed manifestations in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Our cross-sectional study design included diagnostic interview accompanied by assessment instruments and aimed to explore how these factors influence disease severity as well as to elucidate any sex predisposition. One hundred and forty-eight subjects (female 63%) were divided into narcolepsy type 1 (NT1; n = 87, female = 61%), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2; n = 22, female = 59%), and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH; n = 39, female = 69%). All subjects completed a set of questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Sleep Inertia Questionnaire (SIQ). In narcoleptic subjects, questionnaire data were correlated with the Narcolepsy Severity Scale (NSS), and in subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia, with the Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS). The highest correlation in narcoleptic subjects was found between NSS and ESS (r = 0.658; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), as well as FSS (r = 0.506; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), while in subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia, the most prominent positive correlations were found between IHSS and SIQ (r = 0.894; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), FSS (r = 0.812; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), HADS depression scale (r = 0.649; p = 0.0005), and HADS anxiety scale (r = 0.528; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). ESS showed an analogic correlation with disease severity (r = 0.606; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). HADS anxiety and depression scores were higher in females (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), with similar results for FSS and SIQ scales (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 for both), and a trend toward higher ESS values in females (p = 0.057). Our study illustrates that more attention should be focused on pathophysiological mechanisms and associations of fatigue, depression, as well as sleep inertia in these diseases; they influence the course of both illnesses, particularly in women.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Psychosocial- and disclosure-related challenges among HIV-serodiscordant couples: an interpretative phenomenological analysis study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Serodiscordant refers to a couple where one has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the other partner is HIV negative. HIV-serodiscordancy often results in diverse psychological and emotional challenges. Evidence demonstrates that the dynamics of living in an HIV-serodiscordant relationship are often stressful. This study explored the psychosocial- and disclosure-related challenges faced by couples in HIV-serodiscordant relationships in South Africa. Methods: An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) design was followed. A total of 13 HIV-serodiscordant partners were purposively sampled. Data were collected through individual face-to-face interviews and analysed using the IPA framework. Results: The findings indicated that HIV-serodiscordant couples experienced diverse psychosocial challenges such as shock, sadness, hurt, denial and disbelief. Participants also experienced challenges such as selective disclosure and fear of further disclosure. Conclusions: The findings have implications for public health and are critical in programming and designing couple-based HIV care interventions. Couples in HIV-serodiscordant relationships would benefit more from differentiated, client-centred psychosocial support. To contribute to the HIV epidemic control and reduction of new HIV infections, specific interventions such as couples counselling, disclosure counselling, support groups, health education and safer conception risk reduction strategies need to be implemented.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of sleep and health behaviours among people with diabetes and a nondiabetic group in Phitsanulok, Thailand: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global public health problem. To avoid disease complications, people with diabetes have to control their blood glucose and maintain a healthy lifestyle including a healthy diet, weight control, moderate exercise, and smoking cessation. Methods: This study aimed to survey sleep, eating, and exercise behaviours of people with diabetes in the Bang Rakam district, a rural community in Phitsanulok province, Thailand. The data on sleep and other health behaviours were taken from 1,385 T2DM patients and 1,394 non-T2DM controls, who were aged 30 - 85 years and were free from other chronic diseases. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Compared to the control group, the people with diabetes had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI).  However, only a few of them smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Most of the participants were ‘morning people’ who slept 7-9 hours per day. It was found that sleep ≥8 hours increased the risk of diabetes among women (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.56). The people with diabetes also reported eating chicken and vegetables more than the control group. They also avoided eating beef and eating more than a cup of rice per meal. However, the T2DM group did fewer physical activities, such as walking, biking, or playing sports, during their leisure time. Conclusions: Most people with diabetes (T2DM) in a rural community of Thailand had healthy behaviours regarding sleep duration, sleep pattern, lifestyle, eating, smoking and alcohol consumption, except exercise and physical activity. The findings here contrast with the common perception that people with diabetes have bad lifestyle patterns, instead it showed that a healthy lifestyle pattern based on dietary patterns alone may not be sufficient and that lifestyle prevention of diabetes should always include physical activity as an integral part.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tsh Induces Agrp1 Neuron Proliferation in Oatp1c1-Deficient Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Thyroid hormones (THs), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3), regulate growth, metabolism, and neurodevelopment. THs secretion is controlled by the pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;thyroid (HPT) axis. The organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1/SLCO1C1) and the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8/SLC16A2) actively transport THs, which bind to their nuclear receptors and induce gene expression. A mutation in <I>OATP1C1</I> is associated with brain hypometabolism, gradual neurodegeneration, and impaired cognitive and motor functioning in adolescent patients. To understand the role of Oatp1c1 and the mechanisms of the disease, we profiled the transcriptome of <I>oatp1c1</I> mutant (<I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) and <I>mct8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup><I>xoatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> adult male and female zebrafish brains. Among dozens of differentially expressed genes, agouti-related neuropeptide 1 (<I>agrp1</I>) expression increased in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> adult brains. Imaging in the hypothalamus revealed enhanced proliferation of Agrp1 neurons in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae and adults, and increased food consumption in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae. Similarly, feeding and the number of Agrp1 neurons increased in thyroid gland-ablated zebrafish. Pharmacological treatments showed that the T3 analog TRIAC (3,3',5-tri-iodothyroacetic acid), but not T4, normalized the number of Agrp1 neurons in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> zebrafish. Since the HPT axis is hyperactive in the <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brain, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knockdown <I>tsh</I> in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae, and inducibly enhanced the HPT axis in wild-type larvae. These manipulations showed that Tsh promotes proliferation of Agrp1 neurons and increases food consumption in zebrafish. The results revealed upregulation of both the HPT axis&ndash;Agrp1 circuitry and feeding in a zebrafish model for OATP1C1 deficiency.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mutation in the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter <I>OATP1C1</I> is associated with cognitive and motor functioning disturbances in humans. Here, we used an <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> zebrafish to understand the role of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (Oatp1c1), and the characteristics of OATP1C1 deficiency. Transcriptome profiling identified upregulation of <I>agrp1</I> expression in the <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brain. The <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae showed increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (<I>tsh</I>) levels, proliferation of Agrp1 neurons and food consumption. Genetic manipulations of the hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;thyroid (HPT) axis showed that Tsh increases the number of Agrp1 neurons and food consumption. The T3 analog TRIAC (3,3',5-tri-iodothyroacetic acid) normalizes the number of Agrp1 neurons and may have potential for the treatment of Oatp1c1 deficiency. The findings demonstrate a functional interaction between the thyroid and feeding systems in the brain of zebrafish and suggest a neuroendocrinological mechanism for OATP1C1 deficiency.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">PDE2A Inhibition Enhances Axonal Sprouting, Functional Connectivity, and Recovery after Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors have been safely and effectively used in the clinic and increase the concentration of intracellular cyclic nucleotides (cAMP/cGMP). These molecules activate downstream mediators, including the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which controls neuronal excitability and growth responses. CREB gain of function enhances learning and allocates neurons into memory engrams. CREB also controls recovery after stroke. PDE inhibitors are linked to recovery from neural damage and to stroke recovery in specific sites within the brain. PDE2A is enriched in cortex. In the present study, we use a mouse cortical stroke model in young adult and aged male mice to test the effect of PDE2A inhibition on functional recovery, and on downstream mechanisms of axonal sprouting, tissue repair, and the functional connectivity of neurons in recovering cortex. Stroke causes deficits in use of the contralateral forelimb, loss of axonal projections in cortex adjacent to the infarct, and functional disconnection of neuronal networks. PDE2A inhibition enhances functional recovery, increases axonal projections in peri-infarct cortex, and, through two-photon <I>in vivo</I> imaging, enhances the functional connectivity of motor system excitatory neurons. PDE2A inhibition after stroke does not have an effect on other aspects of tissue repair, such as angiogenesis, gliogenesis, neurogenesis, and inflammatory responses. These data suggest that PDE2A inhibition is an effective therapeutic approach for stroke recovery in the rodent and that it simultaneously enhances connectivity in peri-infarct neuronal populations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inhibition of PDE2A enhances motor recovery, axonal projections, and functional connectivity of neurons in peri-infarct tissue. This represents an avenue for a pharmacological therapy for stroke recovery.</p>

However, little is known about the large-scale intrinsic cortical network changes that occur during childhood because of methodological challenges in scanning young children. Here, we overcome this barrier by using sophisticated acquisition and analysis tools to investigate functional network development in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years (<f></f>; 50 female, 42 male). At multiple spatial scales, age is positively associated with brain network segregation. At the system level, age was associated with segregation of systems involved in attention from those involved in abstract cognition, and with integration among attentional and perceptual systems. Associations between age and functional connectivity are most pronounced in visual and medial prefrontal cortex, the two ends of a gradient from perceptual, externally oriented cortex to abstract, internally oriented cortex. These findings suggest that both ends of the sensory-association gradient may develop early, in contrast to the classical theories that cortical maturation proceeds from back to front, with sensory areas developing first and association areas developing last. More mature patterns of brain network architecture, controlling for age, were associated with better visuospatial reasoning abilities. Our results suggest that as cortical architecture becomes more specialized, children become more able to reason about the world and their place in it.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anthropologists have called the transition from early to middle childhood the "age of reason", when children across cultures become more independent. We employ cutting-edge neuroimaging acquisition and analysis approaches to investigate associations between age and functional brain architecture in childhood. Age was positively associated with segregation between cortical systems that process the external world and those that process abstract phenomena like the past, future, and minds of others. Surprisingly, we observed pronounced development at both ends of the sensory-association gradient, challenging the theory that sensory areas develop first and association areas develop last. Our results open new directions for research into how brains reorganize to support rapid gains in cognitive and socioemotional skills as children reach the age of reason.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Large-Scale Mapping of Vocalization-Related Activity in the Functionally Diverse Nuclei in Rat Posterior Brainstem</a></h4>

              
                <p>The identity and location of vocalization pattern generating (VPG) circuits in mammals is debated. Based on physiological experiments, investigators suggested anterior brainstem circuits in the reticular formation, and anatomic evidence suggested the nucleus retroambiguus (NRA) in the posterior brainstem, or combinations of these sites as the putative mammalian VPG. Additionally, vocalization loudness is a critical factor in acoustic communication. However, many of the underlying neuronal mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we evoked calls by stimulation of the periaqueductal gray in anesthetized male rats, performed a large-scale mapping of vocalization-related activity using the activity marker c-<I>fos</I>, and high-density recordings of brainstem circuits using Neuropixels probes. Both c-<I>fos</I> expression and recording of vocalization-related activity point to a participation of the NRA in vocalization. More important, among our recorded structures, we found that the NRA is the only brainstem area showing a strong correlation between unit activity and call intensity. In addition, we observed functionally diverse patterns of vocalization-related activity in a set of regions around NRA. Dorsal to NRA, we observed activity specific to the beginning and end of vocalizations in the posterior level of the medullary reticular nucleus, dorsal part, whereas medial and lateral to the NRA, we observed activity related to call initiation. No clear vocalization-related activity was observed at anterior brainstem sites. Our findings suggest a set of functionally heterogeneous regions around the NRA contribute to vocal pattern generation in rats.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Vocalization patterns are shaped in the mammalian brainstem, but the identity and location of the circuits involved is debated. Additionally, the neuronal mechanisms of vocal intensity control are still unknown. This study consisted of a large-scale mapping of brainstem vocalization circuits based on the activity marker c-<I>fos</I> and high-density recordings with Neuropixels probes. The results confirm the role of nucleus retroambiguus in call production and point to a key role of neurons in this nucleus in loudness control. Dorsal to the nucleus retroambiguus and in the posterior medulla, the authors identify neurons with activity specific to the beginning and end of vocalizations. The results point to specific neural dials for various aspects of rat vocalization control in the posterior brainstem.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Midbrain Inspired Recurrent Neural Network Model for Robust Change Detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>We present a biologically inspired recurrent neural network (RNN) that efficiently detects changes in natural images. The model features sparse, topographic connectivity (st-RNN), closely modeled on the circuit architecture of a "midbrain attention network." We deployed the st-RNN in a challenging change blindness task, in which changes must be detected in a discontinuous sequence of images. Compared with a conventional RNN, the st-RNN learned 9x faster and achieved state-of-the-art performance with 15x fewer connections. An analysis of low-dimensional dynamics revealed putative circuit mechanisms, including a critical role for a global inhibitory (GI) motif, for successful change detection. The model reproduced key experimental phenomena, including midbrain neurons' sensitivity to dynamic stimuli, neural signatures of stimulus competition, as well as hallmark behavioral effects of midbrain microstimulation. Finally, the model accurately predicted human gaze fixations in a change blindness experiment, surpassing state-of-the-art saliency-based methods. The st-RNN provides a novel deep learning model for linking neural computations underlying change detection with psychophysical mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> For adaptive survival, our brains must be able to accurately and rapidly detect changing aspects of our visual world. We present a novel deep learning model, a sparse, topographic recurrent neural network (st-RNN), that mimics the neuroanatomy of an evolutionarily conserved "midbrain attention network." The st-RNN achieved robust change detection in challenging change blindness tasks, outperforming conventional RNN architectures. The model also reproduced hallmark experimental phenomena, both neural and behavioral, reported in seminal midbrain studies. Lastly, the st-RNN outperformed state-of-the-art models at predicting human gaze fixations in a laboratory change blindness experiment. Our deep learning model may provide important clues about key mechanisms by which the brain efficiently detects changes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Early Life Pain Experience Changes Adult Functional Pain Connectivity in the Rat Somatosensory and the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Early life pain (ELP) experience alters adult pain behavior and increases injury-induced pain hypersensitivity, but the effect of ELP on adult functional brain connectivity is not known. We have performed continuous local field potential (LFP) recording in the awake adult male rats to test the effect of ELP on functional cortical connectivity related to pain behavior. Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) LFPs evoked by mechanical hindpaw stimulation were recorded simultaneously with pain reflex behavior for 10 d after adult incision injury. We show that, after adult injury, sensory evoked S1 LFP  and  energy and S1 LFP / frequency coupling are significantly increased in ELP rats compared with controls. Adult injury also induces increases in S1-mPFC functional connectivity, but this is significantly prolonged in ELP rats, lasting 4 d compared with 1 d in controls. Importantly, the increases in LFP energy and connectivity in ELP rats were directly correlated with increased behavioral pain hypersensitivity. Thus, ELP alters adult brain functional connectivity, both within and between cortical areas involved in sensory and affective dimensions of pain. The results reveal altered brain connectivity as a mechanism underlying the effects of ELP on adult pain perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pain and stress in early life has a lasting impact on pain behavior and may increase vulnerability to chronic pain in adults. Here, we record pain-related cortical activity and simultaneous pain behavior in awake adult male rats previously exposed to pain in early life. We show that functional connectivity within and between the somatosensory cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is increased in these rats and that these increases are correlated with their behavioral pain hypersensitivity. The results reveal that early life pain (ELP) alters adult brain connectivity, which may explain the impact of childhood pain on adult chronic pain vulnerability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Autonomic Nerve Fibers Aberrantly Reinnervate Denervated Facial Muscles and Alter Muscle Fiber Population</a></h4>

              
                <p>The surgical redirection of efferent neural input to a denervated muscle via a nerve transfer can reestablish neuromuscular control after nerve injuries. The role of autonomic nerve fibers during the process of muscular reinnervation remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neurobiological mechanisms behind the spontaneous functional recovery of denervated facial muscles in male rodents. Recovered facial muscles demonstrated an abundance of cholinergic axonal endings establishing functional neuromuscular junctions. The parasympathetic source of the neuronal input was confirmed to be in the pterygopalatine ganglion. Furthermore, the autonomically reinnervated facial muscles underwent a muscle fiber change to a purely intermediate muscle fiber population myosin heavy chain type IIa. Finally, electrophysiological tests revealed that the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel to the facial muscles via the sensory infraorbital nerve. Our findings demonstrated expanded neuromuscular plasticity of denervated striated muscles enabling functional recovery via alien autonomic fibers. These findings may further explain the underlying mechanisms of sensory protection implemented to prevent atrophy of a denervated muscle.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nerve injuries represent significant morbidity and disability for patients. Rewiring motor nerve fibers to other target muscles has shown to be a successful approach in the restoration of motor function. This demonstrates the remarkable capacity of the CNS to adapt to the needs of the neuromuscular system. Yet, the capability of skeletal muscles being reinnervated by nonmotor axons remains largely unknown. Here, we show that under deprivation of original efferent input, the neuromuscular system can undergo functional and morphologic remodeling via autonomic nerve fibers. This may explain neurobiological mechanisms of the sensory protection phenomenon, which is because of parasympathetic reinnervation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prolactin Action Is Necessary for Parental Behavior in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parental care is critical for successful reproduction in mammals. Recent work has implicated the hormone prolactin in regulating male parental behavior, similar to its established role in females. Male laboratory mice show a mating-induced suppression of infanticide (normally observed in virgins) and onset of paternal behavior 2 weeks after mating. Using this model, we sought to investigate how prolactin acts in the forebrain to regulate paternal behavior. First, using c-fos immunoreactivity in prolactin receptor (Prlr) <I>Prlr</I>-IRES-Cre-tdtomato reporter mouse sires, we show that the circuitry activated during paternal interactions contains prolactin-responsive neurons in multiple sites, including the medial preoptic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and medial amygdala. Next, we deleted <I>Prlr</I> from three prominent cell types found in these regions: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and CaMKII&alpha;. Prlr deletion from CaMKII&alpha;, but not glutamatergic or GABAergic cells, had a profound effect on paternal behavior as none of these KO males completed the pup-retrieval task. Prolactin was increased during mating, but not in response to pups, suggesting that the mating-induced secretion of prolactin is important for establishing the switch from infanticidal to paternal behavior. Pharmacological blockade of prolactin secretion at mating, however, had no effect on paternal behavior. In contrast, suppressing prolactin secretion at the time of pup exposure resulted in failure to retrieve pups, with exogenous prolactin administration rescuing this behavior. Together, our data show that paternal behavior in sires is dependent on basal levels of circulating prolactin acting at the time of interaction with pups, mediated through Prlr on CaMKII&alpha;-expressing neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parental care is critical for offspring survival. Compared with maternal care, however, the neurobiology of paternal care is less well understood. Here we show that the hormone prolactin, which is most well known for its female-specific role in lactation, has a role in the male brain to promote paternal behavior. In the absence of prolactin signaling specifically during interactions with pups, father mice fail to show normal retrieval behavior of pups. These data demonstrate that prolactin has a similar action in both males and females to promote parental care.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stable Working Memory and Perceptual Representations in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex during Naturalistic Vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primates use perceptual and mnemonic visuospatial representations to perform everyday functions. Neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) have been shown to encode both of these representations during tasks where eye movements are strictly controlled and visual stimuli are reduced in complexity. This raises the question of whether perceptual and mnemonic representations encoded by LPFC neurons remain robust during naturalistic vision&mdash;in the presence of a rich visual scenery and during eye movements. Here we investigate this issue by training macaque monkeys to perform working memory and perception tasks in a visually complex virtual environment that requires navigation using a joystick and allows for free visual exploration of the scene. We recorded the activity of 3950 neurons in the LPFC (areas 8a and 9/46) of two male rhesus macaques using multielectrode arrays, and measured eye movements using video tracking. We found that navigation trajectories to target locations and eye movement behavior differed between the perception and working memory tasks, suggesting that animals used different behavioral strategies. Single neurons were tuned to target location during cue encoding and working memory delay, and neural ensemble activity was predictive of the behavior of the animals. Neural decoding of the target location was stable throughout the working memory delay epoch. However, neural representations of similar target locations differed between the working memory and perception tasks. These findings indicate that during naturalistic vision, LPFC neurons maintain robust and distinct neural codes for mnemonic and perceptual visuospatial representations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that lateral prefrontal cortex neurons encode working memory and perceptual representations during a naturalistic task set in a virtual environment. We show that despite eye movement and complex visual input, neurons maintain robust working memory representations of space, which are distinct from neuronal representations for perception. We further provide novel insight into the use of virtual environments to construct behavioral tasks for electrophysiological experiments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sustained Activity of Hippocampal Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneurons Supports Trace Eyeblink Conditioning in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although recent studies have revealed an involvement of hippocampal interneurons in learning the association among time-separated events, its underlying cellular mechanisms remained not fully clarified. Here, we combined multichannel recording and optogenetics to elucidate how the hippocampal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) support associative learning. To address this issue, we trained the mice (both sexes) to learn hippocampus-dependent trace eyeblink conditioning (tEBC) in which they associated a light flash conditioned stimulus (CS) with a corneal air puff unconditioned stimuli (US) separated by a 250 ms time interval. We found that the hippocampal PV-INs exhibited learning-associated sustained activity at the early stage of tEBC acquisition. Moreover, the PV-IN sustained activity was positively correlated with the occurrence of conditioned eyeblink responses at the early learning stage. Suppression of the PV-IN sustained activity impaired the acquisition of tEBC, whereas the PV-IN activity suppression had no effect on the acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampus-independent learning task. Learning-associated augmentation in the excitatory pyramidal cell-to-PVIN drive may contribute to the formation of PV-IN sustained activity. Suppression of the PV-IN sustained activity disrupted hippocampal gamma but not theta band oscillation during the CS-US interval period. Gamma frequency (40 Hz) activation of the PV-INs during the CS-US interval period facilitated the acquisition of tEBC. Our current findings highlight the involvement of hippocampal PV-INs in tEBC acquisition and reveal insights into the PV-IN activity kinetics which are of key importance for the hippocampal involvement in associative learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cellular mechanisms underlying associative learning have not been fully clarified. Previous studies focused on the involvement of hippocampal pyramidal cells in associative learning, whereas the activity and function of hippocampal interneurons were largely neglected. We herein demonstrated the hippocampal PV-INs exhibited learning-associated sustained activity, which was required for the acquisition of tEBC. Furthermore, we showed evidence that the PV-IN sustained activity might have arisen from the learning-associated augmentation in excitatory pyramidal cell-to-PVIN drive and contributed to learning-associated augmentation in gamma band oscillation during tEBC acquisition. Our findings provide more mechanistic understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the hippocampal involvement in associative learning.</p>

                <p>The outer hair cells in the mammalian cochlea are cellular actuators essential for sensitive hearing. The geometry and stiffness of the structural scaffold surrounding the outer hair cells will determine how the active cells shape mammalian hearing by modulating the organ of Corti (OoC) vibrations. Specifically, the tectorial membrane and the Deiters cell are mechanically in series with the hair bundle and soma, respectively, of the outer hair cell. Their mechanical properties and anatomic arrangement must determine the relative motion among different OoC structures. We measured the OoC mechanics in the cochleas acutely excised from young gerbils of both sexes at a resolution fine enough to distinguish the displacement of individual cells. A three-dimensional finite element model of fully deformable OoC was exploited to analyze the measured data in detail. As a means to verify the computer model, the basilar membrane deformations because of static and dynamic stimulations were measured and simulated. Two stiffness ratios have been identified that are critical to understand cochlear physics, which are the stiffness of the tectorial membrane with respect to the hair bundle and the stiffness of the Deiters cell with respect to the outer hair cell body. Our measurements suggest that the Deiters cells act like a mechanical equalizer so that the outer hair cells are constrained neither too rigidly nor too weakly.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mammals can detect faint sounds thanks to the action of mammalian-specific receptor cells called the outer hair cells. It is getting clearer that understanding the interactions between the outer hair cells and their surrounding structures such as the tectorial membrane and the Deiters cell is critical to resolve standing debates. Depending on theories, the stiffness of those two structures ranges from negligible to rigid. Because of their perceived importance, their properties have been measured in previous studies. However, nearly all existing data were obtained <I>ex situ</I> (after they were detached from the outer hair cells), which obscures their interaction with the outer hair cells. We quantified the mechanical properties of the tectorial membrane and the Deiters cell <I>in situ</I>.</p>

                <p>The chromatin remodeler CHD8 represents a high-confidence risk factor in autism, a multistage progressive neurologic disorder, however the underlying stage-specific functions remain elusive. In this study, by analyzing <I>Chd8</I> conditional knock-out mice (male and female), we find that CHD8 controls cortical neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) proliferation and survival in a stage-dependent manner. Strikingly, inducible genetic deletion reveals that CHD8 is required for the production and fitness of transit-amplifying intermediate progenitors (IPCs) essential for upper-layer neuron expansion in the embryonic cortex. p53 loss of function partially rescues apoptosis and neurogenesis defects in the <I>Chd8</I>-deficient brain. Further, transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling indicates that CHD8 regulates the chromatin accessibility landscape to activate neurogenesis-promoting factors including TBR2, a key regulator of IPC neurogenesis, while repressing DNA damage- and p53-induced apoptotic programs. In the adult brain, CHD8 depletion impairs forebrain neurogenesis by impeding IPC differentiation from NSCs in both subventricular and subgranular zones; however, unlike in embryos, it does not affect NSC proliferation and survival. Treatment with an antidepressant approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), fluoxetine, partially restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis in <I>Chd8</I>-ablated mice. Together, our multistage functional studies identify temporally specific roles for CHD8 in developmental and adult neurogenesis, pointing to a potential strategy to enhance neurogenesis in the CHD8-deficient brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The role of the high-confidence autism gene <I>CHD8</I> in neurogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify a stage-specific function of CHD8 in development of NSCs in developing and adult brains by conserved, yet spatiotemporally distinct, mechanisms. In embryonic cortex, CHD8 is critical for the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of both NSC and IPCs during cortical neurogenesis. In adult brain, CHD8 is required for IPC generation but not the proliferation and survival of adult NSCs. Treatment with FDA-approved antidepressant fluoxetine partially rescues the adult neurogenesis defects in CHD8 mutants. Thus, our findings help resolve CHD8 functions throughout life during embryonic and adult neurogenesis and point to a potential avenue to promote neurogenesis in CHD8 deficiency.</p>

                Background: E-government is an initiative taken by governments worldwide to align the administration of their countries. Governments have utilized the internet as part of a transition into a globalized economy. This helps reduce red tape and procedures in dealing with people in government agencies. This study aims to develop an e-government model as an anti-corruption strategy by applying the Penta-helix model and religiosity as the moderating variable. Methods: The data was gathered from government officials, representatives in business, media, academia, and NGOs, in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2021. Online questionnaires were distributed to 240 respondents from Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition, SPSS v.25 and SEM AMOS v.25 were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings indicate that the Penta-helix elements and religiosity could help to reduce corruption in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Malaysia must increase its human resource competency and embed the religiosity element as a tool to reduce corruption. Conclusion: Penta-helix and religious factors should be incorporated by organizations in Malaysia and Indonesia as part of their strategy in combating corruption.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of antepartum breathing exercises on the outcome of labour: A randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Childbirth is a life-transforming intense event to a woman and her family. Even though a variety of non-pharmacological techniques are readily available to alleviate the distress of women in labour, the majority of women are unaware of its benefits. The objective of the study was to explore the impact of a simple non-pharmacological technique i.e., antepartum breathing exercises on maternal outcomes of labour among primigravid women. Methods A single centre prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at the antenatal outpatient clinic of a secondary healthcare institution. Eligible primigravid women were randomized into intervention and standard care groups. Both groups received standard obstetrical care. In addition, the intervention group were taught antepartum breathing exercises and were advised to practise daily and also during the active stage of labour. The primary outcome of the trial was the maternal outcome of labour measured in terms of onset of labour, nature of delivery, duration of labour, and need for augmentation of labour. Data was collected using World Health Organization (WHO) partograph, structured observational record on the outcome of labour. Results A total of 98 (70%) primigravid women who practised antepartum breathing exercises had spontaneous onset of labour. The odds of spontaneous onset of labour after randomization in the intervention group was 2.192 times more when compared to standard care at a (95% confidence interval 1.31–3.36, p<.001). Also, the requirement for augmentation of labour was minimal and there was a reduction in the rate of caesarean deliveries (p <.05) based on the χ2 test. The overall mean duration of labour was less compared to standard care group F(1)= 133.800, p <.001. Conclusion Antepartum breathing exercises during labour can facilitate spontaneous vaginal birth, shorten the duration of labour, and reduce the need for operative interference.

                Background: The lung microbiome is composed of bacteria, viruses and fungi that interplay with each other and participate in mucosal defense protecting the lungs from colonization and infection by pathogenic microorganisms. In intensive care, a change in the composition of the lung microbiome, called dysbiosis, could be associated to the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The objective of the study was to test a method to assess the lung virome. Methods: We applied a protocol including the same nucleic acid extraction methods as used for bacterial lung microbiome and a metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to detect eukaryotic RNA, DNA viruses and bacteriophages. Results: Our method was able to detect all viruses identified with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), other eukaryotic viruses not included in the multiplex PCR panel, and bacteriophages. Notably persistent viruses, mainly Herpesviridae, associated with opportunistic infections and those showing immunodepression such as Anellovirus have been identified. Conclusions: A better description of the global composition and evolution of the lung microbiome, including viruses, could help to better understand ventilator-associated pneumonia occurrence and outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Caecal volvulus management from diagnosis to treatment in a young patient [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Caecal volvulus (CV) is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, defined by an axial torsion of the caecum, ascending colon, and terminal ileum around the mesenteric vascular pedicles, leading to ischemia and bowel necrosis. A 20-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, was admitted for generalized abdominal pain evolving for three days, along with constipation and abdominal distension, but with no vomiting. Physical examination showed a generalized abdominal tenderness with no rigidity or rebound tenderness, associated with abdominal distension and tympanic upon percussion. Laboratory findings were within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed distension of a loop of the large bowel with its long axis extending from the right lower quadrant to the epigastrium or left upper quadrant. Colonic haustral pattern was absent. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a rounded focal collection of air-distended bowel with haustral creases in the upper left quadrant. In addition, spiraled loops of the collapsed cecum (giving a whirl sign) were noted, along with low-attenuating fatty mesentery from the twisted bowel. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy and caecectomy using GEA 80 charges. The patient had no complaints post-operation. CV is a rare cause of bowel obstruction, mainly caused by an exceedingly mobile caecum. Despite its rareness, CV represents the second most common cause of large bowel volvulus, behind sigmoid volvulus. For acute obstruction by CV, it is hard to differentiate it clinically from obstruction of the small bowel; therefore, radiological exams are needed. Surgery is the gold standard treatment for CV. We report a rare case of CV to highlight the rarity of this pathology, specify its diagnostic and therapeutic means, and its clinical and biological evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Early detection of biliary atresia in primary health care: still a problem [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biliary atresia is the leading cause of liver transplantation in children. Early detection of biliary atresia is crucial for diagnosis and disease progression. The purpose of this study was to analyze knowledge about biliary atresia and the effectiveness of health education in increasing the knowledge of primary health care providers. Methods:  A quasi-experimental study with pretest and posttest designs was carried out in Sidoarjo, East Java using a self-administered questionnaire. The intervention using health education was delivered by pediatrician and consultant of pediatric gastro hepatology. There were 13 questions on the questionnaire, question numbers 1 to 6 were about normal and abnormal neonatal jaundice, question numbers 7 to 13 were about biliary atresia. Results: A total of 252 participants were involved, the mean age of the participants was 40.7 ± 9.4 years old. Most of the participants were midwives (61.9%) and 77.8% of participants have years of service in primary health care > 5 years.  A total of 40.5% participants stated that newborns may have physiological jaundice, which was characterized by icteric sclera, pale stools, and dark urine. A total of 27,4% and 24,2% participants said that all jaundice in newborn will always improve on their own and newborn with prolonged jaundice does not need further examination, respectively. There was an increase in the median value in the pretest and posttest knowledge scores  after interventional health education (p < 0,05). Conclusions: The primary health care provider understands about biliary atresia, however, the initial knowledge about early detection of biliary atresia is not evenly distributed in all primary health care providers. These findings suggest that improving knowledge to early detection of biliary atresia is needed. Health education can be used effectively in increasing knowledge about biliary atresia.

                Background: Nurses have a pivotal role in initiating and managing enteral nutrition (EN) and monitoring any potential complications. Yet, it is unclear whether Yemeni nurses have adequate knowledge to deliver and manage enteral nutrition safely. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the level of ICU nurses’ knowledge regarding the care of EN. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2019 to March 2019. A probability sampling method was used to recruit 174 nurses from four public hospitals in the capital city of Yemen. A self-administered 17-item questionnaire related to ICU nurses' knowledge regarding EN intervention was used to collect the data. Results: Based on our findings, only 10.9% of the respondents had an adequate level of knowledge about EN care, while 43.1% of them had a moderate level of knowledge, and 46.0% of them had an inadequate level of knowledge. Only 16.1% of the participants were knowledgeable of EN pre-administration care, whereas 5.80% of them were knowledgeable of EN administration care, and 9.20% were knowledgeable of EN post-administration care. There were significant associations between ICU nurses’ level of knowledge of EN care and their level of education and knowledge sources. Conclusions: The significant gap in ICU nurses’ knowledge regarding EN care identified implies the need to upgrade and refresh of the ICU nurses' knowledge by implementing a regular training program concerning EN care.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Training diversity promotes absolute-value-guided choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Levi Solomyak, Paul B. Sharp, Eran Eldar</p>

Many decision-making studies have demonstrated that humans learn either expected values or relative preferences among choice options, yet little is known about what environmental conditions promote one strategy over the other. Here, we test the novel hypothesis that humans adapt the degree to which they form absolute values to the diversity of the learning environment. Since absolute values generalize better to new sets of options, we predicted that the more options a person learns about the more likely they would be to form absolute values. To test this, we designed a multi-day learning experiment comprising twenty learning sessions in which subjects chose among pairs of images each associated with a different probability of reward. We assessed the degree to which subjects formed absolute values and relative preferences by asking them to choose between images they learned about in separate sessions. We found that <i>concurrently</i> learning about more images within a session enhanced absolute-value, and suppressed relative-preference, learning. Conversely, <i>cumulatively</i> pitting each image against a larger number of other images across multiple sessions did not impact the form of learning. These results show that the way humans encode preferences is adapted to the diversity of experiences offered by the immediate learning context.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Strength-dependent perturbation of whole-brain model working in different regimes reveals the role of fluctuations in brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yonatan Sanz Perl, Anira Escrichs, Enzo Tagliazucchi, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco</p>

Despite decades of research, there is still a lack of understanding of the role and generating mechanisms of the ubiquitous fluctuations and oscillations found in recordings of brain dynamics. Here, we used whole-brain computational models capable of presenting different dynamical regimes to reproduce empirical data’s turbulence level. We showed that the model’s fluctuations regime fitted to turbulence more faithfully reproduces the empirical functional connectivity compared to oscillatory and noise regimes. By applying global and local strength-dependent perturbations and subsequently measuring the responsiveness of the model, we revealed each regime’s computational capacity demonstrating that brain dynamics is shifted towards fluctuations to provide much-needed flexibility. Importantly, fluctuation regime stimulation in a brain region within a given resting state network modulates that network, aligned with previous empirical and computational studies. Furthermore, this framework generates specific, testable empirical predictions for human stimulation studies using strength-dependent rather than constant perturbation. Overall, the whole-brain models fitted to the level of empirical turbulence together with functional connectivity unveil that the fluctuation regime best captures empirical data, and the strength-dependent perturbative framework demonstrates how this regime provides maximal flexibility to the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Synaptic loss in frontotemporal dementia revealed by [11C]UCB‐J PET</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Synaptic loss is an early feature of neurodegenerative disease models, and is severe in <i>post mortem</i> clinical studies, including frontotemporal dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiotracers that bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A enables quantification of synaptic density <i>in vivo.</i> This study used [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET in participants with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), testing the hypothesis that synaptic loss is severe and related to clinical severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eleven participants with clinically probable bvFTD and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Participants underwent dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET, structural MRI and a neuropsychological battery, including the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), and INECO frontal screening (IFS). General linear models compared [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential maps and grey-matter volume between groups, and assessed associations between synaptic density and clinical severity in patients. Analyses were also performed using partial-volume corrected [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential from regions of interest (ROIs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with bvFTD showed severe synaptic loss compared to controls. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding was reduced bilaterally in medial and dorsolateral frontal regions, inferior frontal gyri, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and medial temporal lobe. Synaptic loss in the frontal and cingulate regions correlated significantly with cognitive impairments. Synaptic loss was more severe than atrophy. Results from ROI-based analyses mirrored the voxel-wise results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In accordance with preclinical models, and human <i>post mortem</i> evidence, there is widespread frontotemporal loss of synapses in symptomatic bvFTD, in proportion to severity. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET could support translational studies and experimental medicine strategies for new disease-modifying treatments for neurodegeneration.</p>

                <p>Risk of sudden death in multiple system atrophy (MSA) is greatest during sleep with unknown mechanisms. We compared nocturnal pulse event frequency in 46 MSA patients and age-/sex-matched controls undergoing overnight pulse oximetry. Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation indices and pulse event indices (PEIs) were recorded, and relationships between pulse oximetry variables and survival were analyzed. MSA patients had lower PEI (3.1 ± 5.3 vs. 12.8 ± 10.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) despite greater hypoxic burden and similar frequency of respiratory events. Nocturnal pulse events were not associated with severity of daytime autonomic failure. Two MSA patients had suspected sudden death, both with severely reduced PEI. MSA patients have fewer nocturnal pulse events compared with controls, despite similar respiratory event frequency, suggesting abnormal cardiac responses to sleep-disordered breathing. Whether this contributes to sudden death in MSA requires further study. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Ocrelizumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, counteracts induction of humoral immune responses after severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccinations in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess if serum ocrelizumab concentration measured at the time of vaccination could predict the humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In 52 patients with MS, we found ocrelizumab concentration at the time of vaccination to be a good predictor for SARS-CoV-2 IgG anti-RBD titers after vaccination (comparable to B-cell count). As the course of ocrelizumab concentration may be predicted using pharmacokinetic models, this may be a superior biomarker to guide optimal timing for vaccinations in B-cell depleted patients with MS.

                In this special issue of Neuron, we present a series of opinions and reviews on neuro-immune interactions. Recent insights into how profoundly the nervous and immune systems affect each other, bolstered by trans-disciplinary collaboration, have revolutionized both neuroscience and immunology. Like a forest ecosystem, an organism thrives or withers depending on the balance of its components. Highlighted in this special issue is a small sampling of the ever-growing list of diseases influenced by dysfunctional neuro-immune crosstalk, ranging from multiple sclerosis and brain cancer to long COVID and Alzheimer’s.

                The emerging understanding of homeostatic neuroimmune interactions requires developing relevant terminology. In this NeuroView, Koren and Rolls define “immunoception” as the brain’s bidirectional monitoring and control of immunity. They propose that the physiological trace storing immune-related information, the “immunengram,” is distributed between the brain and memory cells residing in peripheral tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visual experience has opposing influences on the quality of stimulus representation in adult primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Transient dark exposure, typically 7–10 days in duration, followed by light reintroduction is an emerging treatment for improving the restoration of vision in amblyopic subjects whose occlusion is removed in adulthood. Dark exposure initiates homeostatic mechanisms that together with light-induced changes in cellular signaling pathways result in the re-engagement of juvenile-like plasticity in the adult such that previously deprived inputs can gain cortical territory. It is possible that dark exposure itself degrades visual responses, and this could place constraints on the optimal duration of dark exposure treatment. To determine whether eight days of dark exposure has a lasting negative impact on responses to classic grating stimuli, neural activity was recorded before and after dark exposure in awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Neural discriminability, assessed using classifiers, was transiently reduced following dark exposure; a decrease in response reliability across a broad range of spatial frequencies likely contributed to the disruption. Both discriminability and reliability recovered. Fixed classifiers were used to demonstrate that stimulus representation rebounded to the original, pre-deprivation state, thus dark exposure did not appear to have a lasting negative impact on visual processing. Unexpectedly, we found that dark exposure significantly stabilized orientation preference and signal correlation. Our results reveal that natural vision exerts a disrupting influence on the stability of stimulus preference for classic grating stimuli and, at the same time, improves neural discriminability for both low and high-spatial frequency stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microglia shape the embryonic development of mammalian respiratory networks</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, brain-resident macrophages, play key roles during prenatal development in defining neural circuitry function, including ensuring proper synaptic wiring and maintaining homeostasis. Mammalian breathing rhythmogenesis arises from interacting brainstem neural networks that are assembled during embryonic development, but the specific role of microglia in this process remains unknown. Here, we investigated the anatomical and functional consequences of respiratory circuit formation in the absence of microglia. We first established the normal distribution of microglia within the wild-type (WT, <i>Spi1<sup>+/+</sup></i> (Pu.1 WT)) mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) brainstem at embryonic ages when the respiratory networks are known to emerge (embryonic day (E) 14.5 for the parafacial respiratory group (epF) and E16.5 for the preBötzinger complex (preBötC)). In transgenic mice depleted of microglia (<i>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></i> (Pu.1 KO) mutant), we performed anatomical staining, calcium imaging, and electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activities in vitro to assess the status of these circuits at their respective times of functional emergence. Spontaneous respiratory-related activity recorded from reduced in vitro preparations showed an abnormally slow rhythm frequency expressed by the epF at E14.5, the preBötC at E16.5, and in the phrenic motor nerves from E16.5 onwards. These deficits were associated with a reduced number of active epF neurons, defects in commissural projections that couple the bilateral preBötC half-centers, and an accompanying decrease in their functional coordination. These abnormalities probably contribute to eventual neonatal death, since plethysmography revealed that E18.5 <i>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></i> embryos are unable to sustain breathing activity ex utero. Our results thus point to a crucial contribution of microglia in the proper establishment of the central respiratory command during embryonic development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">R-spondin 3 deletion induces Erk phosphorylation to enhance Wnt signaling and promote bone formation in the appendicular skeleton</a></h4>

              
                Activation of Wnt signaling leads to high bone density. The R-spondin family of four secreted glycoproteins (Rspo1-4) amplifies Wnt signaling. In humans, RSPO3 variants are strongly associated with bone density. Here we investigated the role of Rspo3 in skeletal homeostasis in mice. Using a comprehensive set of mouse genetic and mechanistic studies, we show that in the appendicular skeleton, <i>Rspo3</i> haplo-insufficiency and <i>Rspo3</i> targeted deletion in <i>Runx2<sup>+</sup></i> osteoprogenitors lead to an increase in trabecular bone mass, with increased number of osteoblasts and bone formation. In contrast and highlighting the complexity of Wnt signaling in the regulation of skeletal homeostasis, we show that <i>Rspo3</i> deletion in osteoprogenitors results in the opposite phenotype in the axial skeleton, i.e., low vertebral trabecular bone mass. Mechanistically, <i>Rspo3</i> deficiency impairs the inhibitory effect of Dkk1 on Wnt signaling activation and bone mass. We demonstrate that <i>Rspo3</i> deficiency leads to activation of Erk signaling which in turn, stabilizes b-catenin and Wnt signaling activation. Our data demonstrate that <i>Rspo3</i> haplo-insufficiency/deficiency boosts canonical Wnt signaling by activating Erk signaling, to favor osteoblastogenesis, bone formation and bone mass.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Altered basal ganglia output during self-restraint</a></h4>

              
                Suppressing actions is essential for flexible behavior. Multiple neural circuits involved in behavioral inhibition converge upon a key basal ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). To examine how changes in basal ganglia output contribute to self-restraint, we recorded SNr neurons during a proactive behavioral inhibition task. Rats responded to <i>Go!</i> cues with rapid leftward or rightward movements, but also prepared to cancel one of these movement directions on trials when a <i>Stop!</i> cue might occur. This action restraint - visible as direction-selective slowing of reaction times - altered both rates and patterns of SNr spiking. Overall firing rate was elevated before the <i>Go!</i> cue, and this effect was driven by a subpopulation of direction-selective SNr neurons. In neural state space, this corresponded to a shift away from the restrained movement. SNr neurons also showed more variable inter-spike-intervals during proactive inhibition. This corresponded to more variable state-space trajectories, which may slow reaction times via reduced preparation to move. These findings open new perspectives on how basal ganglia dynamics contribute to movement preparation and cognitive control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional interactions among neurons within single columns of macaque V1</a></h4>

              
                Recent developments in high-density neurophysiological tools now make it possible to record from hundreds of single neurons within local, highly interconnected neural networks. Among the many advantages of such recordings is that they dramatically increase the quantity of identifiable, functional interactions between neurons thereby providing an unprecedented view of local circuits. Using high-density, Neuropixels recordings from single neocortical columns of primary visual cortex in nonhuman primates, we identified 1000s of functionally interacting neuronal pairs using established crosscorrelation approaches. Our results reveal clear and systematic variations in the synchrony and strength of functional interactions within single cortical columns. Despite neurons residing within the same column, both measures of interactions depended heavily on the vertical distance separating neuronal pairs, as well as on the similarity of stimulus tuning. In addition, we leveraged the statistical power afforded by the large numbers of functionally interacting pairs to categorize interactions between neurons based on their crosscorrelation functions. These analyses identified distinct, putative classes of functional interactions within the full population. These classes of functional interactions were corroborated by their unique distributions across defined laminar compartments and were consistent with known properties of V1 cortical circuitry, such as the lead-lag relationship between simple and complex cells. Our results provide a clear proof-of-principle for the use of high-density neurophysiological recordings to assess circuit-level interactions within local neuronal networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanisms governing target search and binding dynamics of hypoxia-inducible factors</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factors (TFs) are classically attributed a modular construction, containing well-structured sequence specific DNA-binding domains (DBDs) paired with disordered activation domains (ADs) responsible for protein-protein interactions targeting cofactors or the core transcription initiation machinery. However, this simple division of labor model struggles to explain why TFs with identical DNA binding sequence specificity determined <i>in vitro</i> exhibit distinct binding profiles <i>in vivo</i>. The family of Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) offer a stark example: aberrantly expressed in several cancer types, HIF-1α and HIF-2α subunit isoforms recognize the same DNA motif <i>in vitro </i>- the hypoxia response element (HRE) - but only share a subset of their target genes <i>in vivo</i>, while eliciting contrasting effects on cancer development and progression under certain circumstances. To probe the mechanisms mediating isoform-specific gene regulation, we used live cell single particle tracking (SPT) to investigate HIF nuclear dynamics and how they change upon genetic perturbation or drug treatment. We found that HIF-α subunits and their dimerization partner HIF-1β exhibit distinct diffusion and binding characteristics that are exquisitely sensitive to concentration and subunit stoichiometry. Using domain-swap variants, mutations, and a HIF-2α specific inhibitor, we found that although the DBD and dimerization domains are important, another main determinant of chromatin binding and diffusion behavior is the AD-containing intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Using Cut&amp;Run and RNA-seq as orthogonal genomic approaches we also confirmed IDR-dependent binding and activation of a specific subset of HIF-target genes. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of IDRs in regulating the TF search and binding process that contribute to functional target site selectivity on chromatin.

                Apicobasal cell-polarity loss is a founding event in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and epithelial tumorigenesis, yet how pathological polarity loss links to plasticity remains largely unknown. To understand the mechanisms and mediators regulating plasticity upon polarity loss, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of <i>Drosophila</i> ovaries, where inducing polarity-gene <i>l(2)gl</i>-knockdown (Lgl-KD) causes invasive multilayering of the follicular epithelia. Analyzing the integrated Lgl-KD and <i>wildtype</i> transcriptomes, we discovered the cells specific to the various discernible phenotypes and characterized the underlying gene expression. A genetic requirement of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in promoting multilayer formation of Lgl-KD cells was further identified. Ectopic expression of Keap1 increased the volume of delaminated follicle cells that showed enhanced invasive behavior with significant changes to the cytoskeleton. Overall, our findings describe the comprehensive transcriptome of cells within the follicle-cell tumor model at the single-cell resolution and identify a previously unappreciated link between Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and cell plasticity at early tumorigenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-scale structural alterations of basal ganglia in focal epilepsy as demonstrated by 7T MRI</a></h4>

              
                Focal epilepsy is characterized by repeated spontaneous seizures that originate from one or multiple epileptogenic zones (EZ). These epileptic activities rapidly propagate to other regions in the brain following a hierarchical organization defined by a decrease in epileptogenicity and the anatomical specificity of subnetworks, also known as EZ networks (EZN). More recently, analysis of intracerebral recordings showed that subcortical structures, and in particular the thalamus, play an important role in facilitating and/or propagating epileptic activity. This supports previously reported structural alterations of these structures. Nonetheless, between-patient differences in EZN (e.g., temporal vs. non-temporal lobe epilepsy) as well as other clinical features (e.g., number of EZs) might impact the magnitude and spatial distribution of subcortical structural changes. Here we used 7 Tesla MRI T1 data to provide a comprehensive description of subcortical morphological (volume, tissue deformation, and shape) and longitudinal relaxation (T1) changes in focal epilepsy patients to evaluate the impact of the EZN and patient-specific clinical features. Our results revealed widespread morphometric alterations as well as reduction in T1, with volume acting as the dominant discriminator between patients and controls, while thalamic T1 measures looked promising to further differentiate patients based on EZN. In particular, the observed differences in T1 changes between thalamic nuclei indicated differential involvement of thalamic nuclei based on EZN. Finally, the number of EZs was found to best explain the observed variability between patients. To conclude, this work revealed multi-scale subcortical alterations in focal epilepsy as well their dependence on several clinical characteristics. Our results provide a basis for further, in-depth investigations using (quantitative) MRI and SEEG data and warrant further personalization of intervention strategies, such as deep brain stimulation, for treating focal epilepsy patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic ablation of dentate hilar somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons is sufficient to induce cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                Aging is often associated with a decline in cognitive function. A reduction in the number of somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons in the DG has been described in cognitively impaired but not in unimpaired aged rodents. However, it remains unclear whether the reduction in SOM+ interneurons in the DG hilus is causal for age-related cognitive dysfunction. We hypothesized that hilar (SOM+) interneurons play an essential role in maintaining cognitive function and that a reduction in the number of hilar (SOM+) interneurons might be sufficient to induce cognitive dysfunction. Hilar (SOM+) interneurons were ablated by expressing a diptheria toxin transgene specifically in these interneurons. An AAV-EF1-mCherry-flex-dtA construct was stereotaxically injected (bilaterally) into the DG hilus of young adult Sst-IRES-Cre mice, which resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in the number of SOM+ neurons and also a reduction in the number of GAD-67+ neurons in the DG hilus. c-Fos staining was increased in DG and CA3 but not in CA1. Behavioral testing, which started 21 days after the stereotaxic injections, revealed a reduced recognition index in the novel object recognition test, a reduction in the percentage of correct alternations in the Y maze tests, and increased latencies and path lengths in the learning and the reversal learning phase of the Morris water maze. Our results show that partial genetic ablation of SOM+ hilar interneurons is sufficient to increase activity in DG and CA3, as has been described to occur with aging, and to induce an impairment of learning and memory functions. Thus, partial ablation of hilar SOM+ interneurons may be a significant contributing factor to age-related cognitive dysfunction. These mice may also be useful as a cellularly defined model of hippocampal aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do we perform as well as we think we do? A systematic scoping review of self-evaluation of upper-extremity motor performance</a></h4>

              
                The ability to self-evaluate motor performance or estimate performance errors is beneficial for motor learning or relearning in the context of neurologic injury. Some evidence suggests those with injury like stroke may be unable to accurately self-evaluate their performance; however, it is unclear if individuals who are absent of injury are accurate in this domain. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of self-evaluation and potential influencing factors by conducting a systematic search to identify literature involving the self- and objective-evaluation of upper-extremity motor tasks. Twenty-three studies satisfied inclusion criteria. Data revealed a moderate positive correlation between self- and objective evaluations across a variety of tasks, from trivial button pressing to specialized surgical suturing. Both under- and overestimation of performance was found across the papers. Key factors identified to influence the accuracy of self-evaluation were the task purpose, familiarity, difficulty, and whether an individual received a demonstration. This review identified some limitations in this field of research. Most notably, we found that very few studies have investigated the accuracy of self-evaluation of motor performance with the primary goal of comparison to objective performance. Many studies reported the data but did not make direct statistical comparisons. Moreover, due to inconsistencies between how self and objective-evaluations were conducted, we argue that in this area of investigation self-evaluation tools need to replicate the objective evaluation method, or at minimum the self-evaluation tool should ask questions specific to the construct of performance that is being measured objectively

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neuroprotective effects of estrogen and estrogenic compounds in spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) occurs when the spinal cord is damaged from either a traumatic event or disease. SCI is characterised by multiple injury phases that affect the transmission of sensory and motor signals and lead to temporary or long-term functional deficits. There are few treatments for SCI. Estrogens and estrogenic compounds, however, may effectively mitigate the effects of SCI and therefore represent viable treatment options. This review systematically examines the pre-clinical literature on estrogen and estrogenic compound neuroprotection after SCI. Several estrogens were examined by the included studies: estrogen, estradiol benzoate, Premarin, isopsoralen, genistein, and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Across these pharmacotherapies, we find significant evidence that estrogens indeed offer protection against myriad pathophysiological effects of SCI and lead to improvements in functional outcomes, including locomotion. A STRING functional network analysis of proteins modulated by estrogen after SCI demonstrated that estrogen simultaneously upregulates known neuroprotective pathways, such as HIF-1, and downregulates pro-inflammatory pathways, including IL-17. These findings highlight the strong therapeutic potential of estrogen and estrogenic compounds after SCI.

	<p>This systematic review examined available findings on spatial and temporal characteristics of cortical activity in response to unpredicted mechanical perturbations. Secondly, this review investigated associations between cortical activity and behavioral/biomechanical measures. Databases were searched from 1980&amp;amp;ndash;2021 and a total of 35 cross-sectional studies (31 EEG and 4 fNIRS) were included. Majority of EEG studies assessed perturbation-evoked potentials (PEPs), whereas other studies assessed changes in cortical frequencies. Further, fNIRS studies assessed hemodynamic changes. The PEP-N1, commonly identified at sensorimotor areas, was most examined and was influenced by context prediction, perturbation magnitude, motor adaptation and age. Other PEPs were identified at frontal, parietal and sensorimotor areas and were influenced by task position. Further, changes in cortical frequencies were observed at prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal areas and were influenced by task difficulty. Lastly, hemodynamic changes were observed at prefrontal and frontal areas and were influenced by task prediction. Limited studies reported associations between cortical and behavioral outcomes. This review provided evidence regarding the involvement of cerebral cortex for sensory processing of unpredicted perturbations, error-detection of expected versus actual postural state, and planning and execution of compensatory stepping responses. There is still limited evidence examining cortical activity during reactive balance tasks in populations with high fall-risk.</p>

	<p>In recent years, the information crosstalk between the central nervous system and the periphery has been a hot topic, such as the brain&amp;amp;ndash;gut axis, brain&amp;amp;ndash;lung axis, etc. Among them, some studies have shown that brainstem nuclei activity can significantly affect the progression of peripheral tumor; however, regarding lung cancer, our understanding of the basic characteristics of the lung-innervating brain nuclei responsive to lung cancer progression remains deficient. Therefore, we used the pseudorabies virus for retrograde labeling of nerves to study the neural circuits between the lung and brain. We then established a mouse orthotopic lung cancer model and used the expression of the c-Fos gene in brain regions to characterize activated brain circuits and compared these results with those of the control group. We focused on c-Fos activity in nuclei associated with retrograde tracing regions of the brainstem. We found over 16 nuclei in the whole brain with direct or indirect lung innervation through neural retrograde labeling with the pseudorabies virus. We further revealed that the neuronal activity of the rostral ventrolateral reticular nucleus (RVL), caudal nucleus of Raphe (raphe obscurus nucleus, ROb), Raphe pallidus nucleus (RPa), and ventral gigantocellular reticular nucleus (GiV) in the rostral ventromedial and lateral medulla were significantly changed in an orthotopic lung cancer mouse model by the immunostaining of c-Fos early responsive protein. Thus, the distinctive rostroventral medulla area, functionally closely related to the vagus nerve, likely plays a role in central neural interaction with peripheral lung tumors and deserves future investigation.</p>

	<p>Alcohol abuse dramatically affects individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; lives nationwide. The 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) estimated that 10.2% of Americans suffer from alcohol use disorder. Although social support has been shown to aid in general addiction prevention and rehabilitation, the benefits of social support are not entirely understood. The present study sought to compare the benefits of social interaction on the conditioned ethanol approach behavior in rats through a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in which a drug is paired with one of two distinct contexts. In experiment 1A, rats were single-housed and received conditioning trials in which ethanol was paired with the less preferred context. In experiment 1B, rats underwent procedures identical to experiment 1A, but were pair-housed throughout the paradigm. In experiment 1C, rats were single-housed, but concurrently conditioned to a socially-paired context and an ethanol-paired context. By comparing the time spent between the ethanol-paired environment and the saline-paired or socially-paired environment, we extrapolated the extent of ethanol approach behavior in the pair-housed, single-housed, and concurrently conditioned rats. Our results revealed that social interaction, both in pair-housed animals or concurrently socially-conditioned animals, diminished the ethanol approach behavior, which highlights the importance of social support in addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery programs.</p>

	<p>The drug 25H-NBOMe is a new psychoactive substance (NPS). The use of these substances is likely to pose a threat to public health because they elicit effects similar to those of known psychoactive substances with similar chemical structures. However, data regarding the abuse potential of 25H-NBOMe are lacking. Here, we evaluated the abuse liability of 25H-NBOMe in rodents. The rewarding and reinforcing effects were evaluated through conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration (SA) tests after administration of 25H-NBOMe. To investigate the effects of 25H-NBOMe on the central nervous system, we determined the changes in dopamine levels by in vivo microdialysis. In the locomotor activity test, 25H-NBOme significantly increased locomotor activity in mice. In the place conditioning test, the 25H-NBOMe (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) groups showed a significantly increase in CPP in mice. In the SA test, the 25H-NBOMe (0.01 mg/kg) administered group showed a significant increased number of infusions and active lever presses. In microdialysis, the 25H-NBOMe (10 mg/kg) administered group was significantly increased in rats.</p>

	<p>To assess the interactions between individual cofactors and multisensory inputs on the postural sway of adults with type 2 diabetes and healthy subjects, 69 adults accepted to participate in the study (48 with/ 21 without diabetes). Assessments included neuro-otology (sinusoidal-rotation and unilateral-centrifugation), ophthalmology and physiatry evaluations, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, quadriceps strength, the ankle/brachial index and polypharmacy. Postural sway was recorded on hard/soft surface, either with eyes open/closed, or without/with 30&amp;amp;deg; neck extension. The proportional differences from the baseline of each condition were analyzed using Multivariate and Multivariable analyses. Patients with polyneuropathy and no retinopathy showed visual dependence, while those with polyneuropathy and retinopathy showed adaptation. Across sensory challenges, the vestibulo-ocular gain at 1.28 Hz and the BMI were mainly related to changes in sway area, while the dynamic visual vertical was mainly related to changes in sway length. The ankle/brachial index was related to the effect of neck extension, with contributions from quadriceps strength/physical activity, polyneuropathy and polypharmacy. Across conditions, men showed less sway than women did. In conclusion, in adults with diabetes, sensory inputs and individual cofactors differently contribute to postural stability according to context. Rehabilitation programs for adults with diabetes may require an individualized approach.</p>

	<p>Choices between smaller certain reward and larger riskier reward are referred to as risky decision making. Numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated the neural substrates of risky decision making via conventional univariate analytical approaches, revealing dissociable activation of decisions involving certain rewards and risky rewards. However, it is still unclear how the patterns of brain activity predict the choice that the individual will make. With the help of multi-voxel pattern analyses, which is more sensitive for evaluating information encoded in spatially distributed patterns, we showed that fMRI activity patterns represent viable signatures of certain and risky choice and individual differences. Notably, the regions involved in representation of value and risk and cognitive control play prominent roles in differentiating certain and risky choices as well as individuals with distinct risk preference. These results deepen our understanding of the neural correlates of risky decision making as well as emphasize the important roles of regions involved in representation of value and risk cognitive control in predicting risky decision making and individual differences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Authentic leadership and innovative work behavior through organizational culture: A study in Indonesian state-owned enterprises [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Innovation is one of the keys for organizations to win the competition and be able to survive. State-owned enterprises require employees to face the competition by showing innovative work behavior where leadership factors and organizational culture could influence this behavior. This study examines the role of authentic leadership in innovative work behavior through organizational culture as a mediator. Methods: Participants in this survey study were 272 employees of Indonesian state-owned enterprises, but only 153 employees from 17 work teams were involved in data analysis at the group level. The research instrument was adapted from the innovative work behavior scale, authentic leadership questionnaire, and the Indonesian state-owned enterprises culture scale, which consists of six core values: trustworthy, competent, harmonious, loyal, adaptive, and collaborative. Data collection in this study was carried out by distributing questionnaires in the form of a Likert scale online via a google form. The data were analyzed using partial-least square analysis. Results: The results showed that organizational culture mediated the relationship between authentic leadership and innovative work behavior. Conclusions: The group experience of the presence of an authentic leader can improve the implementation of organizational culture, which in turn may increase innovative work behavior at the group level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ex vivo comparative investigation of suprachiasmatic nucleus excitotoxic resiliency [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Glutamate signaling in the brain is regulated by release, reuptake, and receptor responsiveness. In diseased conditions, glutamate signaling can exceed normal regulatory processes, giving rise to a condition called excitotoxicity. Although regional differences in the excitotoxic effects of glutamate in the brain have been reported, the extent and characteristics of these potential differences are not clear.  Here we compared the excitotoxic resiliency of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), anterior hypothalamus (AH) and cortex.  Methods: We treated acute brain slices containing either the SCN and AH or the cortex from adult male mice at different times across the diurnal cycle with varying concentrations of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), NMDA+ α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or control medium. The extent of cell damage was assessed using propidium iodide (PI), a cell death marker. Results: The results indicate that all three brain regions exhibited increasing cell damage/death when treated with increasing concentrations of NMDA. However, higher concentrations of NMDA were needed to significantly increase cell damage in the SCN compared to the cortex and AH.  All three brain regions also exhibited greater cell death/damage when treated in the nighttime compared to the daytime, although the SCN exhibited increased cell death during a more restricted time interval compared to the AH and cortex.  Conclusions: Together, these data confirm previous studies showing excitotoxic resiliency in the SCN, while extending them in two ways.  First, we demonstrate a dose-dependency in excitotoxic susceptibility that differentiates the SCN from the surrounding AH and the cortex using a brain slice preparation. Second, we demonstrate a diurnal rhythm in excitotoxic susceptibility with a broadly similar phase across all three brain regions. These data increase our understanding of the extent and nature of the SCN excitotoxic resiliency, which will inform future studies on the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pesticide exposure and lung cancer risk: A case-control study in Nakhon Sawan, Thailand [version 6; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pesticide exposure might increase risk of lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the historical use of pesticides and lung cancer using a case-control design. Methods: This case-control study compared a lifetime pesticide exposure of 233 lung cancer cases, and 447 healthy neighbours matched for gender, and age (±5 years). Data on demographic, pesticide exposure and other related factors were collected using a face-to-face interview questionnaire. Associations between lung cancer and types of pesticides as well as individual pesticides were analysed using logistic regression adjusted for gender, age, cigarette smoking, occupation, cooking fumes exposure, and exposure to air pollution. Results: It was found that lung cancer was positively associated with lifetime use of herbicides and insecticides. Compared to people in the non-exposed groups, those in Q3-Q4 days of using herbicides and insecticides had an elevated risk of lung cancer, with odds ratio (OR) between 2.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-3.89), and 3.99 (95% CI 1.62-7.11) (p < 0.001). For individual pesticides, those presenting a significant association with lung cancer were dieldrin (OR = 2.56; 95% CI 1.36-4.81), chlorpyrifos (OR = 3.29; 95 % CI 1.93-5.61), and carbofuran (OR = 2.10; 95% CI 1.28-3.42). It was also found, for the first time, carbofuran, glyphosate, and paraquat to be significantly associated with lung cancer. Conclusions: The results reconfirmed the association between pesticides exposure and lung cancer. In the study, five individual pesticides, e.g. dieldrin, chlorpyrifos, carbofuran, glyphosate, and paraquat were identified as a potential risk factors for the disease. More studies are still required to confirm the results and to identify more individual pesticides that could cause lung cancer. The issues should receive more attention since these chemicals are used widely.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pancreatic cancer grading in pathological images using deep learning convolutional neural networks [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The cancer grades define how aggressively the cancer will spread and give indication for doctors to make proper prognosis and treatment. The current method of pancreatic cancer grading, by means of manual examination of the cancerous tissue following a biopsy, is time consuming and often results in misdiagnosis and thus incorrect treatment. This paper presents an automated grading system for pancreatic cancer from pathology images developed by comparing deep learning models on two different pathological stains. Methods: A transfer-learning technique was adopted by testing the method on 14 different ImageNet pre-trained models. The models were fine-tuned to be trained with our dataset. Results: From the experiment, DenseNet models appeared to be the best at classifying the validation set with up to 95.61% accuracy in grading pancreatic cancer despite the small sample set. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in grading pancreatic cancer based on pathology images. Previous works have either focused only on detection (benign or malignant), or on radiology images (computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] etc.). The proposed system can be very useful to pathologists in facilitating an automated or semi-automated cancer grading system, which can address the problems found in manual grading.

                Background: The purpose of this study is to explore the trends and causes of established and emerging nations' stock market integration with India. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) indices act as a counterweight to international market indices. This study investigates the sustained interest of foreign investors in the Indian stock market in the wake of capital market reforms, as well as whether it moves in tandem with other markets in Asia and the United States. Methods: Our study examined the possibility of cross-country cointegration between the largest economies and indices around the world using multiple financial econometric models, such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Unit Root, Correlation, and Johansen Cointegration. Results: The findings of this study significantly support the notion that Indian and international financial markets are highly integrated. Vector error correction model indicates that the Indian market (NSE) is highly cointegrated with the US market (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) and increased volatility signifies global contagion. Conclusion: A cursory examination of the data reveals distinct investment and portfolio diversification options for global investors. This could assist regulators in formulating more effective rules regarding price discovery processes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of problem-based learning on students’ attitude towards learning physics: a cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attitude is a learning scale that informs which approach should be used to call students to school. It can be seen a supporting tool that informs teachers, policymakers, and researchers of the needs for raising interest in learning a certain subject, such as physics. This study aimed at determining the effect of problem-based learning on students’ attitude towards learning physics. Methods: The study followed a quantitative approach with a quasi-experimental design employing cross-sectional survey techniques. The participants of the study were 419 13th-grade physics students of the 2020/2021 school year in both Ugandan government and private secondary schools. Among these students, one group was taught using problem-based learning instruction while another group was taught using traditional instruction for 12 weeks. Data were collected using a standardized tool called Views About Science Survey. Using Microsoft Excel 2016 and Statistical Package for Social Scientist version 23.0, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to determine a significant difference between experiment and control groups. Results: It was found that both problem-based learning and traditional instructions caused a statistically significant positive effect on students’ attitudes towards physics. However, the experimental group gained more positive attitude than the control group as they were more inclined towards the expert-like attitude (thinking like a scientist in a domain) than their counterparts due to the problem-based learning approach they learned in. Conclusions: Therefore, it was concluded that problem-based learning is a more effective method of teaching physics than traditional methods. Hence, we suggest that secondary school teachers need to adopt the use of problem-based learning in the teaching of science concepts, especially physics.

                The Chalan ravine is a deep bed creek that runs through Licto (Ecuador). It has been known since the 19th century for the abundance of paleontological remains of Pleiostocene fauna and megafauna in its profiles, where entire remains of mastodons were recovered. The abundance of these remains made one of the high areas, where marmites exist in different forms, was traditionally considered as mastodon footprints. Archaeological prospecting, geographic information system (GIS) technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), photogrammetry, and the geological study of the place, allowed us to determine that the mythical traces of mastodon were marmites made by the water erosion produced in the same ravine over time.

                Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with high morbidity and disability. The routines involved in taking medications, side effects, the nature of medicines, difficulties with the healthcare system, and disruptions to social activities all contribute to patients frequently experiencing medication-related burdens (MRB). The current study aimed to assess the perceived MRB among a sample of SLE patients from Iraq and to look for any possible relationship between MRB and disease activity. Methods: The current study was cross-sectional on diagnosed SLE patients who arrived at Baghdad Teaching Hospital/Medical City/Rheumatology department from September 2021 to January 2022. MRB was measured using the Living with Medicines Questionnaire (LMQ). Results: The study recruited 156 SLE patients. The patients were 35.8 ±11.7 years old on average. Great majority of them were women (96.8 %). The average LMQ score was 117.30± 18.37. The results showed that most patients (69.87%) experienced a moderate level of burden, followed by a low level (19.87%), high level (7.69%), and no burden at all (2.56%). No patients experienced an extremely high level of burden (0.0%). The mean burden scores for two LMQ domains—relationships with health care professionals (HCPs) and effectiveness of prescription medications—were the lowest (below average). Conclusions: Many of the SLE patients in this study reported experiencing MRB. Healthcare professionals should implement strategies to reduce this burden, particularly for low-income patients.

                Background: Research Software is a concept that has been only recently clarified. In this paper we address the need for a similar enlightenment concerning the Research Data concept. Methods: Our contribution begins by reviewing the Research Software definition, which includes the analysis of software as a legal concept, followed by the study of its production in the research environment and within the Open Science framework. Then we explore the challenges of a data definition and some of the Research Data definitions proposed in the literature. Results: We propose a Research Data concept featuring three characteristics: the data should be produced (collected, processed, analyzed, shared & disseminated) to answer a scientific question, by a scientific team, and has yield a result published or disseminated in some article or scientific contribution of any kind. Conclusions: The analysis of this definition and the context in which it is proposed provides some answers to the Borgman’s conundrum challenges, that is, which Research Data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. They are completed with answers to the questions: how? and where?

                Background: Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes and burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the early warning signs of mental distress is very important to ensure the provision of quality patient care. Methods: In this facility-based cross-sectional study, HCWs of the teaching hospitals affiliated to Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore were assessed regarding their mental health status using a semi-structured questionnaire. All doctors and nurses who were willing to participate from these teaching hospitals were included in the study. Data was collected over a period of four months (1st March -30th June 2021) till the required sample size was reached and analysed using IBM SPSS and expressed using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range), and proportions. Univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with mental health outcomes among the HCWs and the corresponding unadjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were reported. Results: A total of 245 HCWs [52.2% (n=128) doctors and 47.8% (n=117) nurses] were included in our study. The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia assessed using PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI-7 scales were 49% (n=119), 38% (n=93), and 42% (n=102) respectively. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were more likely to be experienced by HCWs aged > 27 years, females, and involved in COVID-19 patient care. (p>0.05) Conclusions:  Our findings that 38% of the examined HCWs had clinically relevant anxiety symptoms and 49% had clinically relevant depression symptoms draws attention to the importance of systematically tracking the mental health of HCWs during this ongoing pandemic. HCWs should monitor their stress reactions and seek appropriate help both on a personal and professional level. Appropriate workplace interventions including psychological support should be provided to HCWs, to ensure provision of uncompromised quality patient care.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How public can public goods be? Environmental context shapes the evolutionary ecology of partially private goods</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brian A. Lerch, Derek A. Smith, Thomas Koffel, Sarah C. Bagby, Karen C. Abbott</p>

The production of costly public goods (as distinct from metabolic byproducts) has largely been understood through the realization that spatial structure can minimize losses to non-producing “cheaters” by allowing for the positive assortment of producers. In well-mixed systems, where positive assortment is not possible, the stable production of public goods has been proposed to depend on lineages that become indispensable as the sole producers of those goods while their neighbors lose production capacity through genome streamlining (the Black Queen Hypothesis). Here, we develop consumer-resource models motivated by nitrogen-fixing, siderophore-producing bacteria that consider the role of colimitation in shaping eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our models demonstrate that in well-mixed environments, single “public goods” can only be ecologically and evolutionarily stable if they are partially privatized (i.e., if producers reserve a portion of the product pool for private use). Colimitation introduces the possibility of subsidy: strains producing a fully public good can exclude non-producing strains so long as the producing strain derives sufficient benefit from the production of a second partially private good. We derive a lower bound for the degree of privatization necessary for production to be advantageous, which depends on external resource concentrations. Highly privatized, low-investment goods, in environments where the good is limiting, are especially likely to be stably produced. Coexistence emerges more rarely in our mechanistic model of the external environment than in past phenomenological approaches. Broadly, we show that the viability of production depends critically on the environmental context (i.e., external resource concentrations), with production of shared resources favored in environments where a partially-privatized resource is scarce.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mycn regulates intestinal development through ribosomal biogenesis in a zebrafish model of Feingold syndrome 1</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yun-Fei Li, Tao Cheng, Ying-Jie Zhang, Xin-Xin Fu, Jing Mo, Guo-Qin Zhao, Mao-Guang Xue, Ding-Hao Zhuo, Yan-Yi Xing, Ying Huang, Xiao-Zhi Sun, Dan Wang, Xiang Liu, Yang Dong, Xiao-Sheng Zhu, Feng He, Jun Ma, Dong Chen, Xi Jin, Peng-Fei Xu</p>

Feingold syndrome type 1, caused by loss-of-function of MYCN, is characterized by varied phenotypes including esophageal and duodenal atresia. However, no adequate model exists for studying the syndrome’s pathological or molecular mechanisms, nor is there a treatment strategy. Here, we developed a zebrafish Feingold syndrome type 1 model with nonfunctional <i>mycn</i>, which had severe intestinal atresia. Single-cell RNA-seq identified a subcluster of intestinal cells that were highly sensitive to Mycn, and impaired cell proliferation decreased the overall number of intestinal cells in the <i>mycn</i> mutant fish. Bulk RNA-seq and metabolomic analysis showed that expression of ribosomal genes was down-regulated and that amino acid metabolism was abnormal. Northern blot and ribosomal profiling analysis showed abnormal rRNA processing and decreases in free 40S, 60S, and 80S ribosome particles, which led to impaired translation in the mutant. Besides, both Ribo-seq and western blot analysis showed that mTOR pathway was impaired in <i>mycn</i> mutant, and blocking mTOR pathway by rapamycin treatment can mimic the intestinal defect, and both L-leucine and Rheb, which can elevate translation via activating TOR pathway, could rescue the intestinal phenotype of <i>mycn</i> mutant. In summary, by this zebrafish Feingold syndrome type 1 model, we found that disturbance of ribosomal biogenesis and blockage of protein synthesis during development are primary causes of the intestinal defect in Feingold syndrome type 1. Importantly, our work suggests that leucine supplementation may be a feasible and easy treatment option for this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The microbiota promotes social behavior by modulating microglial remodeling of forebrain neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joseph J. Bruckner, Sarah J. Stednitz, Max Z. Grice, Dana Zaidan, Michelle S. Massaquoi, Johannes Larsch, Alexandra Tallafuss, Karen Guillemin, Philip Washbourne, Judith S. Eisen</p>

Host-associated microbiotas guide the trajectory of developmental programs, and altered microbiota composition is linked to neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. Recent work suggests that microbiotas modulate behavioral phenotypes associated with these disorders. We discovered that the zebrafish microbiota is required for normal social behavior and reveal a molecular pathway linking the microbiota, microglial remodeling of neural circuits, and social behavior in this experimentally tractable model vertebrate. Examining neuronal correlates of behavior, we found that the microbiota restrains neurite complexity and targeting of forebrain neurons required for normal social behavior and is necessary for localization of forebrain microglia, brain-resident phagocytes that remodel neuronal arbors. The microbiota also influences microglial molecular functions, including promoting expression of the complement signaling pathway and the synaptic remodeling factor <i>c1q</i>. Several distinct bacterial taxa are individually sufficient for normal microglial and neuronal phenotypes, suggesting that host neuroimmune development is sensitive to a feature common among many bacteria. Our results demonstrate that the microbiota influences zebrafish social behavior by stimulating microglial remodeling of forebrain circuits during early neurodevelopment and suggest pathways for new interventions in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sleep and wake cycles dynamically modulate hippocampal inhibitory synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kunwei Wu, Wenyan Han, Wei Lu</p>

Sleep is an essential process that consolidates memories by modulating synapses through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we report that GABAergic synapses in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons undergo daily rhythmic alterations. Specifically, wake inhibits phasic inhibition, whereas it promotes tonic inhibition compared to sleep. We further utilize a model of chemically induced inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) to examine inhibitory plasticity. Intriguingly, while CA1 pyramidal neurons in both wake and sleep mice undergo iLTP, wake mice have a much higher magnitude. We also employ optogenetics and observe that inhibitory inputs from parvalbumin-, but not somatostatin-, expressing interneurons contribute to dynamic iLTP during sleep and wake. Finally, we demonstrate that synaptic insertion of α5-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors underlies the wake-specific enhancement of iLTP at parvalbumin-synapses, which is independent of time of the day. These data reveal a previously unappreciated daily oscillation of inhibitory LTP in hippocampal neurons and uncover a dynamic contribution of inhibitory synapses in memory mechanisms across sleep and wake.

                Background: Developing countries need funding for researchers to maximize the evidence base, especially in stunting research. This short policy is expected to provide opportunities for Indonesia to receive more research funding to stunt philanthropists. Policy and implications: Multi-sector cooperation is arguably the leading player in acceleration programs to reduce growth delays. The Stunted Reduction Acceleration Program, complemented by higher research and development expenditures (RDEs) and open policies to support philanthropic activities in Indonesia, will help improve the efficiency of stunted stunt reduction through adequate funding and investment. As evidenced by Singapore and Thailand, the increase in government budgets focused on research and development (R&D) and supportive environments, as shown by Global Philanthropy Environment Index (GPEI), prove that evidence-based and practical researches can lead to the reduction of estimated prevalence of stunting rather than innovation-stage research. Recommendations: Attention needs to be directed in proposing major changes in law and policy which regulate the allocation of research-development expenditure, which will initiate the creation of a supportive environment for philanthropy acts regarding stunting. The challenges associated with these issues are: (1) Stunted research and innovation are still left behind, (2) The availability of data and the lack of transparency, (3) Subpar performance in relation to philanthropists, (4) Inconsistent legal definitions and a lack of industry-specific guidelines, (5) Inadequate law enforcement, (6) Local leaders must engage in evidence-based advocacy, (7) Philanthropists have limited opportunities to learn.

                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 can spread rapidly. Surgery in the oral cavity poses a high risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of mouthwash containing 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 0.2% povidone iodine (PI) to reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory tract and decrease the risk of transmission. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water on the cycle threshold (CT) value obtained by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: This study is a randomized single blind controlled clinical trial which has been registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry on the 3rd February 2022 (Registration number: ISRCTN18356379). In total, 69 subjects recruited from Persahabatan General Hospital who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups or the control group. The subjects were instructed to gargle with 15 mL of mouthwash for 30 s in the oral cavity followed by 30 s in the back of the throat, three times per day for 5 days. CT values were collected on postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Results: The results of the Friedman test significantly differed among the groups (n=15). The CT values increased from baseline (day 0) to postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Conclusions: Mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water increased the CT value.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVDs) are a major cause of stroke and dementia. We used cutting-edge 7T-MRI techniques in patients with Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), to establish which aspects of cerebral small vessel function are affected by this monogenic form of cSVD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 23 CADASIL patients (age 51.1 ± 10.1 years, 52% women) and 13 age- and sex-matched controls (46.1 ± 12.6, 46% women). Small vessel function measures included: basal ganglia and centrum semiovale perforating artery blood flow velocity and pulsatility, vascular reactivity to a visual stimulus in the occipital cortex and reactivity to hypercapnia in the cortex, subcortical gray matter, white matter, and white matter hyperintensities.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with controls, CADASIL patients showed lower blood flow velocity and higher pulsatility index within perforating arteries of the centrum semiovale (mean difference − 0.09 cm/s, <i>p</i> = 0.03 and 0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and basal ganglia (mean difference − 0.98 cm/s, <i>p</i> = 0.003 and 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.06). Small vessel reactivity to a short visual stimulus was decreased (blood-oxygen-level dependent [BOLD] mean difference −0.21%, <i>p</i> = 0.04) in patients, while reactivity to hypercapnia was preserved in the cortex, subcortical gray matter, and normal appearing white matter. Among patients, reactivity to hypercapnia was decreased in white matter hyperintensities compared to normal appearing white matter (BOLD mean difference −0.29%, <i>p</i> = 0.02).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Multiple aspects of cerebral small vessel function on 7T-MRI were abnormal in CADASIL patients, indicative of increased arteriolar stiffness and regional abnormalities in reactivity, locally also in relation to white matter injury. These observations provide novel markers of cSVD for mechanistic and intervention studies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Albisetti et al. have developed a new tool (“roxed Cre”) for intersectional targeting of inhibitory Kcnip2 neurons of the spinal dorsal horn. They show that these neurons are key elements of neural circuits that control sensitivity to environmental cold in mice. The neurons may also contribute to cold-induced analgesia.

                Blood-tumor barrier (BTB) and tumor cell quiescence are two major obstacles in brain cancer treatment. Chen, Momin, and Wanggou et al. show that mechanosensitive tumor cells construct the BTB. Targeting Piezo2 perturbs the BTB and decreases tumor cell quiescence to enhance chemosensitivity of medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain cancer.

                Deak et al. characterize a dendritic cell subpopulation with increased uptake of micron-sized particles. They show that the cells, “first responders” (FRs), generate high levels of early inflammatory cytokines and initialize innate immune responses. By targeting FRs selectively, they demonstrate that modulating FR activity can drastically alter adaptive immune responses.

                Neuropsychiatric symptoms often occur in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Zhang et al. provide evidence that the hyper-excitability of corticothalamic pyramidal tract (PT) neurons contributes to increased aggressive behaviors in the mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease and reveal that decreased kv6.3 is a key contributor to the hyper-excitability of PT neurons.

                The brain encodes the statistical regularities of the environment in a task-specific yet flexible and generalizable format. Here, we seek to understand this process by bridging two parallel lines of research, one centered on sensorimotor timing, and the other on cognitive mapping in the hippocampal system. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a fast-paced time-to-contact (TTC) estimation task, we found that the hippocampus signaled behavioral feedback received in each trial as well as performance improvements across trials along with reward-processing regions. Critically, it signaled performance improvements independent from the tested intervals, and its activity accounted for the trial-wise regression-to-the-mean biases in TTC estimation. This is in line with the idea that the hippocampus supports the rapid encoding of temporal context even on short time scales in a behavior-dependent manner. Our results emphasize the central role of the hippocampus in statistical learning and position it at the core of a brain-wide network updating sensorimotor representations in real time for flexible behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microplankton life histories revealed by holographic microscopy and deep learning</a></h4>

              
                The marine microbial food web plays a central role in the global carbon cycle. However, our mechanistic understanding of the ocean is biased toward its larger constituents, while rates and biomass fluxes in the microbial food web are mainly inferred from indirect measurements and ensemble averages. Yet, resolution at the level of the individual microplankton is required to advance our understanding of the microbial food web. Here, we demonstrate that, by combining holographic microscopy with deep learning, we can follow microplanktons throughout their lifespan, continuously measuring their three-dimensional position and dry mass. The deep-learning algorithms circumvent the computationally intensive processing of holographic data and allow rapid measurements over extended time periods. This permits us to reliably estimate growth rates, both in terms of dry mass increase and cell divisions, as well as to measure trophic interactions between species such as predation events. The individual resolution provides information about selectivity, individual feeding rates, and handling times for individual microplanktons. The method is particularly useful to detail the rates and routes of organic matter transfer in micro-zooplankton, the most important and least known group of primary consumers in the oceans. Studying individual interactions in idealized small systems provides insights that help us understand microbial food webs and ultimately larger-scale processes. We exemplify this by detailed descriptions of micro-zooplankton feeding events, cell divisions, and long-term monitoring of single cells from division to division.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Instructions and experiential learning have similar impacts on pain and pain-related brain responses but produce dissociations in value-based reversal learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent data suggest that interactions between systems involved in higher order knowledge and associative learning drive responses during value-based learning. However, it is unknown how these systems impact subjective responses, such as pain. We tested how instructions and reversal learning influence pain and pain-evoked brain activation. Healthy volunteers (n = 40) were either instructed about contingencies between cues and aversive outcomes or learned through experience in a paradigm where contingencies reversed three times. We measured predictive cue effects on pain and heat-evoked brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Predictive cues dynamically modulated pain perception as contingencies changed, regardless of whether participants received contingency instructions. Heat-evoked responses in the insula, anterior cingulate, and other regions updated as contingencies changed, and responses in the prefrontal cortex mediated dynamic cue effects on pain, whereas responses in the brainstem's rostroventral medulla (RVM) were shaped by initial contingencies throughout the task. Quantitative modeling revealed that expected value was shaped purely by instructions in the Instructed Group, whereas expected value updated dynamically in the Uninstructed Group as a function of error-based learning. These differences were accompanied by dissociations in the neural correlates of value-based learning in the rostral anterior cingulate, thalamus, and posterior insula, among other regions. These results show how predictions dynamically impact subjective pain. Moreover, imaging data delineate three types of networks involved in pain generation and value-based learning: those that respond to initial contingencies, those that update dynamically during feedback-driven learning as contingencies change, and those that are sensitive to instruction. Together, these findings provide multiple points of entry for therapies designs to impact pain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Collective dynamics support group drumming, reduce variability, and stabilize tempo drift</a></h4>

              
                Humans are social animals who engage in a variety of collective activities requiring coordinated action. Among these, music is a defining and ancient aspect of human sociality. Human social interaction has largely been addressed in dyadic paradigms and it is yet to be determined whether the ensuing conclusions generalize to larger groups. Studied more extensively in nonhuman animal behaviour, the presence of multiple agents engaged in the same task space creates different constraints and possibilities than in simpler dyadic interactions. We addressed whether collective dynamics play a role in human circle drumming. The task was to synchronize in a group with an initial reference pattern and then maintain synchronization after it was muted. We varied the number of drummers, from solo to dyad, quartet, and octet. The observed lower variability, lack of speeding up, smoother individual dynamics, and leader-less inter-personal coordination indicated that stability increased as group size increased, a sort of temporal wisdom of crowds. We propose a hybrid continuous-discrete Kuramoto model for emergent group synchronization with pulse-based coupling that exhibits a mean field positive feedback loop. This research suggests that collective phenomena are among the factors that play a role in social cognition.

Specific populations of PBN neurons are involved in behaviors including food and water intake, nociceptive responses, breathing regulation, as well as learning and responding appropriately to threatening stimuli. However, it is unclear how many PBN neuron populations exist and how different behaviors may be encoded by unique signaling molecules or receptors. Here we provide a repository of data on the molecular identity, spatial location, and projection patterns of dozens of PBN neuron subclusters. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified 21 subclusters of neurons in the PBN and neighboring regions. Multiplexed <i>in situ</i> hybridization showed many of these subclusters are enriched within specific PBN subregions with scattered cells in several other regions. We also provide detailed visualization of the axonal projections from 21 Cre-driver lines of mice. These results are all publicly available for download and provide a foundation for further interrogation of PBN functions and connections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A low-cost, open-source evolutionary bioreactor and its educational use</a></h4>

              
                A morbidostat is a bioreactor that uses antibiotics to control the growth of bacteria, making it well-suited for studying the evolution of antibiotic resistance. However, morbidostats are often too expensive to be used in educational settings. Here we present a low-cost morbidostat called the EVolutionary biorEactor (EVE) that can be built by students with minimal engineering and programming experience. We describe how we validated EVE in a real classroom setting by evolving replicate <i>Escherichia coli</i> populations under chloramphenicol challenge, thereby enabling students to learn about bacterial growth and antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is essential for hearing by regulating cholesterol distribution in hair bundles</a></h4>

              
                Unbiased genetic screens implicated a number of uncharacterized genes in hearing loss, suggesting some biological processes required for auditory function remain unexplored. Loss of <i>Kiaa1024L/Minar2</i>, a previously understudied gene, caused deafness in mice, but how it functioned in the hearing was unclear. Here we show that disruption of <i>kiaa1024L/minar2</i> causes hearing loss in the zebrafish. Defects in mechanotransduction, longer and thinner hair bundles, and enlarged apical lysosomes in hair cells are observed in <i>kiaa1024L/minar2</i> mutant. In cultured cells, Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is mainly localized to lysosomes and its overexpression recruits cholesterol and increases cholesterol labeling. Strikingly, cholesterol is highly enriched in the hair bundle membrane, and loss of <i>kiaa1024L/minar2</i> reduces cholesterol localization to the hair bundles. Lowering cholesterol levels aggravates, while increasing cholesterol levels rescues hair cell defects in <i>kiaa1024L/minar2</i> mutant. Therefore cholesterol plays an essential role in hair bundles, and Kiaa1024L/Minar2 regulates cholesterol distribution and homeostasis to ensure normal hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulated degradation of the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN2 maintains nuclear envelope architecture and function</a></h4>

              
                Nuclear architecture and functions depend on dynamic interactions between nuclear components (such as chromatin) and inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins. Mutations in INM proteins interfering with these interactions result in disease. However, mechanisms controlling the levels and turnover of INM proteins remain unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism of regulated degradation of the INM SUN domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2). We show that Casein Kinase II and the C-terminal domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1) have opposing effects on SUN2 levels by regulating SUN2 binding to the ubiquitin ligase Skp/Cullin1/F-Box<sup>βTrCP </sup>(SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>). Upon binding to phosphorylated SUN2, SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> promotes its ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated SUN2 is membrane extracted by the AAA ATPase p97 and delivered to the proteasome for degradation. Importantly, accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 results in aberrant nuclear architecture, vulnerability to DNA damage and increased lagging chromosomes in mitosis. These findings uncover a central role of proteolysis in INM protein homeostasis.

                Social deficit is a major feature of neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined neuronal discharge characteristics in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of IRSp53/Baiap2-mutant mice, which show social deficits, during social approach. We found a decrease in the proportion of IRSp53-mutant excitatory mPFC neurons encoding social information, but not that encoding non-social information. In addition, the firing activity of IRSp53-mutant neurons was less differential between social and non-social targets. IRSp53-mutant excitatory mPFC neurons displayed an increase in baseline neuronal firing, but decreases in the variability and dynamic range of firing as well as burst firing during social and non-social target approaches compared to wild-type controls. Treatment of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist that rescues social deficit in IRSp53-mutant mice, alleviates the reduced burst firing of IRSp53-mutant pyramidal mPFC neurons<i>.</i> These results suggest that suppressed neuronal activity dynamics and burst firing may underlie impaired cortical encoding of social information and social behaviors in IRSp53-mutant mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">History information emerges in the cortex during learning</a></h4>

              
                We learn from our experience but the underlying neuronal mechanisms incorporating past information to facilitate learning is relatively unknown. Specifically, which cortical areas encode history-related information and how is this information modulated across learning? To study the relationship between history and learning, we continuously imaged cortex-wide calcium dynamics as mice learn to use their whiskers to discriminate between two different textures. We mainly focused on comparing the same trial type with different history information, i.e., a different preceding trial. We found history information in barrel cortex (BC) during stimulus presentation. Importantly, history information in BC emerged only as the mouse learned the task. Next, we also found learning-dependent history information in rostrolateral (RL) association cortex that emerges before stimulus presentation, preceding activity in BC. History information was also found in other cortical areas and was not related to differences in body movements. Interestingly, a binary classifier could discriminate history information at the single trial level just as well as current information both in BC and RL. These findings suggest that past experience emerges in the cortex around the time of learning, starting from higher-order association area RL and propagating down (i.e., top-down projection) to lower-order BC where it can be integrated with incoming sensory information. This integration between the past and present may facilitate learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dlg5 and Cadherins are key to peripheral glia integrity</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells in the peripheral nerve wrap axons to insulate them and ensure efficient conduction of neuronal signals. In the myelin sheath, it is proposed that the autotypic tight junctions and adherens junctions form glia-glia complexes that stabilize the glia sheath in myelinating glia. Yet the role of adhesion junctions in non-myelinating glia of vertebrates or invertebrates has not been clearly established. Many components of adhering junctions contain PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO1) domains or are recruited to these junctions by PDZ binding motifs. To test for the role of PDZ domain proteins in glial sheath formation, we carried out an RNAi screen using Drosophila melanogaster to knockdown each of the 66 predicted PDZ domain proteins in the peripheral glia. We identified six PDZ genes with potential roles in glial morphology, and further investigated Discs-large 5 (Dlg5), a scaffolding protein with no previously known function in glia. Knockdown of Dlg5 disrupts subperineurial glia (SPG) morphology, including gaps in the membrane that coincide with disruption of septate junction proteins. To further our investigation of Dlg5, we focused on cadherins and found both N-Cadherin and E-Cadherin are expressed throughout peripheral glia. Knockdown of Ecad phenocopied the loss of Dlg5 leading to gaps in the SPG and septate junctions while only simultaneous loss of both N-Cadherins (Ncad, and CadN2) had the same effect. The loss of all three Cadherins enhanced these phenotypes as did loss of Dlg5 when paired with Cadherin knockdown. This leads to a model where Dlg5 plays a role in conjunction with Cadherins in glial membrane stabilization and SJ formation in the subperineurial glia.

                Psychedelics have emerged as promising candidate treatments for various psychiatric conditions, and given their clinical potential, there is a need to identify biomarkers that underlie their effects. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) using regression dynamic causal modelling (rDCM), a novel technique that assesses whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We modelled data from two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trials, in which 45 participants were administered 100 g LSD and placebo in two resting-state fMRI sessions. We compared EC against whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) using classical statistics and machine learning methods. Multivariate analyses of EC parameters revealed widespread increases in interregional connectivity and reduced self-inhibition under LSD compared to placebo, with the notable exception of primarily decreased interregional connectivity and increased self-inhibition in occipital brain regions. This finding suggests that LSD perturbs the Excitation/Inhibition balance of the brain. Moreover, random forests classified LSD vs. placebo states based on FC and EC with comparably high accuracy (FC: 85.56%, EC: 91.11%) suggesting that both EC and FC are promising candidates for clinically-relevant biomarkers of LSD effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gasdermin-E mediates mitochondrial damage in axons and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction and axon loss are hallmarks of neurologic diseases. Gasdermin (GSDM) proteins are executioner pore-forming molecules that mediate cell death, yet their roles in the central nervous system (CNS) are not well understood. Here, we find that one GSDM family member, GSDME is expressed by both mouse and human neurons. GSDME plays a role in mitochondrial damage and axon loss. Mitochondrial neurotoxins induced caspase-dependent GSDME cleavage and rapid localization to mitochondria in axons, where GSDME promoted mitochondrial depolarization, trafficking defects, and neurite retraction. The frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated proteins TDP-43 and PR-50 induced GSDME-mediated damage to mitochondria and neurite loss. GSDME deficiency prolonged survival, ameliorated motor dysfunction, and rescued motor neuron loss in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. GSDME knockdown also protected against neurite loss in ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons. Thus, we identify GSDME as an executioner of neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction that contributes to neurodegeneration.

                A subset of patients suffering from a familial retinitis pigmentosa (RP) carry mutations in several spliceosomal components including PRPF8 protein. Here, we established two novel alleles of murine Prpf8 that genocopy or mimic aberrant PRPF8 found in RP patients - the substitution p.Tyr2334Asn and an extended protein variant p.Glu2331ValfsX15. Homozygous mice expressing either of the aberrant Prpf8 variants developed within first 2 months progressive atrophy of the cerebellum due to extensive granule neuron loss. Comparison of transcriptome from pre-degenerative and degenerative tissues revealed a subset of circRNAs that were deregulated in all tissues and both Prpf8-RP mouse strains. To identify potential risk factors that sensitize cerebellum for Prpf8 mutations we monitored expression of several splicing proteins during first eight weeks. We observed downregulation of all selected splicing proteins in wild-type cerebellum, which coincided with neurodegeneration onset. The decrease in splicing protein expression was further pronounced in mouse strains expressing mutated Prpf8. Collectively, we propose a model where physiological reduction of spliceosomal components during postnatal tissue maturation sensitizes cells to expression of aberrant Prpf8 and the subsequent deregulation of circRNAs triggers neuron death.

                Abstract Brain activity during the resting state is widely used to examine brain organization, cognition and alterations in disease states. While it is known that neuromodulation and the state of alertness impact resting-state activity, neural mechanisms behind such modulation of resting-state activity are unknown. In this work, we used a computational model to demonstrate that cholinergic input influences resting-state activity and its functional connectivity through cellular and synaptic modulation. The results from the computational model match closely with experimental work on direct cholinergic modulation of Default Mode Network (DMN) in rodents. We extend those results to the human connectome derived from diffusion-weighted MRI. In the human resting state simulations, an increase in cholinergic input resulted in a brain-wide reduction of functional connectivity. Further, selective cholinergic modulation of DMN closely captured transitions between the baseline resting state and states with suppressed DMN fluctuations associated with attention to external tasks. Our study thus provides insight into potential neural mechanisms for cholinergic neuromodulation on resting state activity and its dynamics.

                Background: Ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression. However, inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine's molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. Methods: We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled study in which 40 healthy participants received acute ketamine (initial bolus 0.23 mg/kg, continuous infusion 0.58 mg/kg/hour). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity, related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation, and compared it to cortical gene expression targets. Results: We found that: i) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; ii) ketamine's data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, implicating the role of SST and PVALB interneurons in ketamine's acute effects; and iii) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings support the possibility for developing individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcranial magnetic stimulation to frontal but not occipital cortex disrupts endogenous attention</a></h4>

              
                Covert endogenous (voluntary) attention improves visual performance. Human neuroimaging studies suggest that the putative human homolog of macaque FEF (FEF+) is critical for this improvement, whereas early visual areas are not. Yet, MRI methods are correlational, as they do not manipulate brain function. Here we investigated whether rFEF+ or V1/V2 play a causal role in endogenous attention. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to alter activity in visual cortex (Exp.1) or rFEF+ (Exp.2) when observers performed an orientation discrimination task while attention was manipulated. On every trial, they received double-pulse TMS at a predetermined site (stimulated region) around the occipital pole or the rFEF+. Two cortically magnified gratings were presented, one in the stimulated region (contralateral to the stimulated cortical area) and another in the symmetric (ipsilateral) non-stimulated region. Grating contrast was varied to measure contrast response functions (CRFs) for all attention and stimulation combinations. In Exp.1, the CRFs were similar at the stimulated and non-stimulated regions, indicating that early visual areas do not modulate endogenous attention during stimulus presentation. In contrast, occipital TMS eliminates exogenous (involuntary) attention effects on performance (1). In Exp.2, rFEF+ stimulation decreased the overall attentional effect; neither benefits at the attended location nor cost at the unattended location were significant. This pattern is mimicked in the frequency and directionality of microsaccades: Whereas occipital stimulation did not affect microsaccades, rFEF+ stimulation caused a higher microsaccade rate selectively directed toward the stimulated hemifield. These results provide causal evidence of the role of this frontal region for endogenous attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontal stimulation disrupts motor memory consolidation at the micro timescale</a></h4>

              
                Functional brain responses in hippocampo- and striato-cortical networks during initial motor sequence learning (MSL) are critical for memory consolidation. We have recently shown that prefrontal stimulation applied prior to initial MSL can alter these learning-related responses. In the present study, we investigated whether such stimulation-induced modulations of brain responses can influence motor memory consolidation at different timescales. Specifically, we examined the effect of prefrontal stimulation on the behavioral and neural responses associated to (i) fast consolidation processes occurring during short rest episodes interspersed with practice during initial learning (i.e., micro timescale) and (ii) slow consolidation process taking place across practice sessions separated by 24h (i.e., macro timescale). To do so, we applied active (inhibitory or facilitatory) or control theta-burst stimulation to the prefrontal cortex of young healthy participants before they were trained on an MSL task while their brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Motor performance was retested, in the MRI scanner, after a night of sleep. Both our behavioral and brain imaging results indicate that while stimulation did not modulate consolidation at the macro timescale, it disrupted the micro-offline consolidation process. Specifically, our behavioral data indicate that active - as compared to control - stimulation resulted in a decrease in micro-offline gains in performance over the short rest intervals. At the brain level, stimulation disrupted activity in the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus during the micro-offline intervals. Additionally, multivariate pattern persistence from task into inter-practice rest episodes - which is thought to reflect the reactivation of learning-related patterns - was hindered by active prefrontal stimulation in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. Importantly, stimulation also altered the link between the brain and the behavioral markers of the micro-offline consolidation process. These results collectively suggest that active prefrontal stimulation prior to MSL disrupted both the behavioral and neural correlates of motor memory consolidation at the micro timescale.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential Patterns of Synaptic Plasticity in the Nucleus Accumbens Caused by Continuous and Interrupted Morphine Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Opioid exposure and withdrawal both cause adaptations in brain circuits that may contribute to abuse liability. These adaptations vary in magnitude and direction following different patterns of opioid exposure, but few studies have systematically manipulated the pattern of opioid administration while measuring neurobiological impact. In this study, we compared cellular and synaptic adaptations in the nucleus accumbens shell caused by morphine exposure that was either continuous, or interrupted by daily bouts of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. At the behavioral level, continuous morphine administration caused psychomotor tolerance, which was reversed when the continuity of morphine action was interrupted by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Using ex vivo slice electrophysiology in female and male mice, we investigated how these patterns of morphine administration altered intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. We found that morphine-evoked adaptations at excitatory synapses were predominately conserved between patterns of administration, but there were divergent effects on inhibitory synapses and the subsequent balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Overall, our data suggest that continuous morphine administration produces adaptations that dampen the output of D1-MSNs, which are canonically thought to promote reward-related behaviors. Interruption of otherwise continuous morphine exposure does not dampen D1-MSN functional output to the same extent, which may enhance behavioral responses to subsequent opioid exposure. Our findings support the hypothesis that maintaining continuity of opioid administration could be an effective therapeutic strategy to minimize the vulnerability to opioid use disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Letrozole delays acquisition of water maze task in female BALB/c mice: possible involvement of anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor (AI), is used as an adjuvant therapy in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Similar to other AIs, it induces many side effects, including impaired cognition. Despite its negative effect in humans, results from animal models are inconsistent and suggest that letrozole can either impair or improve cognition. Here we studied effects of letrozole on cognitive behavior of adult female BALB/c mice, a relevant animal model for breast cancer studies. Mice were continuously treated with once-a-day subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of letrozole (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg/day) or vehicle and subjected to behavioral testing starting on day 21 after treatment initiation. During the treatments, vaginal smears were taken from the mice to evaluate estrous cyclicity. Both doses of letrozole suspended cyclicity and the smears showed that the mice were in constant metestrus. Exposure to letrozole did not significantly affect response to novelty measured as a locomotor activity in open field. However, repeated testing in open field (4 days x 15 min) revealed that letrozole 0.3 mg/kg facilitated locomotor habituation (a form of non-associative learning), significantly reducing locomotor activity on 3rd and 4th day of testing. These findings suggest that certain doses of letrozole may have positive effects on cognitive behavior. Training to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze (15 days x 4 trials), however, indicated that letrozole 0.1 mg/kg-treated mice had significant learning impairment, as, throughout the training, they swam longer times than vehicle-treated mice to reach the hidden platform. Similarly, in a probe test performed 72 h after the last day of the training, letrozole 0.1 mg/kg-treated mice did not show preference for the training platform zones. These results indicate that cognitive impairments reported by women treated with letrozole can be captured in BALB/c mice treated with clinically relevant doses of the drug. Interestingly, most of the letrozole 0.1 mg/kg-treated mice were able to learn the new platform position in reversal training and performed similar to control mice in a reversal probe test. Results of the reversal test suggest that letrozole did not completely disrupt spatial navigation but rather delayed acquisition of spatial information. The current study shows that letrozole dose dependently modulates behavioral response and that its effects are task dependent.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FUS regulates RAN translation through modulating the G-quadruplex structure of GGGGCC repeat RNA in C9orf72-linked ALS/FTD</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal expansions of GGGGCC repeat sequence in the noncoding region of the C9orf72 gene is the most common cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). The expanded repeat sequence is translated into dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) by noncanonical repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Since DPRs play central roles in the pathogenesis of C9-ALS/FTD, we here investigate the regulatory mechanisms of RAN translation, focusing on the effects of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) targeting GGGGCC repeat RNAs. Using C9-ALS/FTD model flies, we demonstrated that the ALS/FTD-linked RBP FUS suppresses RAN translation and neurodegeneration in an RNA-binding activity-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that FUS directly binds to and modulates the G-quadruplex structure of GGGGCC repeat RNA as an RNA chaperone, resulting in the suppression of RAN translation in vitro. These results reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of RAN translation by G-quadruplex-targeting RBPs, providing therapeutic insights for C9-ALS/FTD and other repeat expansion diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Preservation of prehearing spontaneous activityenables early auditory system development in deaf mice</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically generated neural activity propagates through the developing auditory system to promote maturation and refinement of sound processing circuits prior to hearing onset. This early patterned activity is induced by non-sensory supporting cells in the organ of Corti, which are highly interconnected through gap junctions containing connexin 26 (Gjb2). Although loss of function mutations in Gjb2 impair cochlear development and are the most common cause of congenital deafness, it is not known if these mutations disrupt spontaneous activity and the developmental trajectory of sound processing circuits in the brain. Here, we show in a new mouse model of Gjb2-mediated congenital deafness that cochlear supporting cells unexpectedly retained intercellular coupling and the capacity to generate spontaneous activity, exhibiting only modest deficits prior to hearing onset. This coordinated activation of IHCs led to coincident bursts of activity in central auditory neurons that will later process similar frequencies of sound. Despite alterations in the structure of the sensory epithelium, hair cells within the cochlea of Gjb2 deficient mice were intact and central auditory neurons could be activated within appropriate tonotopic domains by loud sounds at hearing onset, indicating that early maturation and refinement of auditory circuits was preserved. Only after cessation of spontaneous activity following hearing onset did progressive hair cell degeneration and enhanced auditory neuron excitability manifest. This preservation of cochlear spontaneous activity in the absence of connexin 26 may increase the effectiveness of early therapeutic interventions to restore hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural basis of melodic learning explains cross-cultural regularities in musical scales</a></h4>

              
                Seeking exposure to unfamiliar experiences constitutes an essential aspect of the human condition, and the brain must adapt to the constantly changing environment by learning the evolving statistical patterns emerging from it. Cultures are shaped by norms and conventions and therefore novel exposure to an unfamiliar culture induces a type of learning that is often described as implicit: when exposed to a set of stimuli constrained by unspoken rules, cognitive systems must rapidly build a mental representation of the underlying grammar. Music offers a unique opportunity to investigate this implicit statistical learning, as sequences of tones forming melodies exhibit structural properties learned by listeners during short- and long-term exposure. Understanding which specific structural properties of music enhance learning in naturalistic learning conditions reveals hard-wired properties of cognitive systems while elucidating the prevalence of these features across cultural variations. Here we provide behavioral and neural evidence that the prevalence of non-uniform musical scales may be explained by their facilitating effects on melodic learning. In this study, melodies were generated using an artificial grammar with either a uniform (rare) or non-uniform (prevalent) scale. After a short exposure phase, listeners had to detect ungrammatical new melodies while their EEG responses were recorded. Listeners' performance on the task suggested that the extent of statistical learning during music listening depended on the musical scale context: non-uniform scales yielded better syntactic learning. This behavioral effect was mirrored by enhanced encoding of musical syntax in the context of non-uniform scales, which further suggests that their prevalence stems from fundamental properties of learning.

                A major challenge in neurosciences is the elucidation of neural mechanisms in brains that are crucial for the processing of sensory information and the generation of adaptive behavior. In conjunction with the ever-growing body of experimental data, computational simulations have become crucial in integrating information and testing hypotheses, requiring fast large-scale simulators. We constructed a whole-brain neural circuit model of the fly Drosophila with biophysically detailed multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models based on the morphologies of individual neurons published in open databases. Performance tuning of the simulator enabled near real-time simulation of the resting state of the Drosophila whole-brain model in the large-scale computational environment of the supercomputer Fugaku, for which we achieved in excess of 630 TFLOPS using 480k cores. In our whole-brain model, neural circuit dynamics related to a standard insect learning paradigm, the association of taste rewards with odors could be simulated.

                As an organism develops, a zygote becomes the body through repeated cell division. This process produces the mitotic family tree, and cells specialize into their ultimate phenotype through interaction with other cells but also through the history of divisions. Biologists often cluster cells in the body into "cell types," using e.g. their morphologies and molecular makeup. While morphomolecular cell type carries information about phenotype and function, there may be unknown, missing information available in this family tree. Emerging methods are making these lineage trees progressively observable. Here, using the complete mitotic family tree and connectome of the nematode C. elegans we ask about the role of cell-types and their family tree. We can thus evaluate how well we can predict synaptic connection with only cell-type information versus with the family tree lineage. We show that neglecting lineage can produce misleading insights into the mechanisms underlying neural wiring: underlying lineage can confound the effect of cell type. These results suggest that the concept of cell-type needs to be re-thought in the context of this emerging knowledge about cell lineage.

                MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that regulate fundamental biological processes. miR-132, a key miRNA with established functions in Tau homeostasis and neuroprotection, is consistently downregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. miR-132 overexpression rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in several AD models. To complement research on miRNA-mimicking oligonucleotides targeting the central nervous system, we developed a high-throughput-screen coupled high-throughput-sequencing (HTS-HTS) in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons to identify small molecule inducers of miR-132. We discovered that cardiac glycosides, which are canonical sodium-potassium ATPase inhibitors, selectively upregulated miR-132 in the sub-M range. Coordinately, cardiac glycoside treatment downregulated total and phosphorylated Tau in rodent and human neurons and protected against toxicity by glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, rotenone, and A{beta} oligomers. In conclusion, we identified small-molecule drugs that upregulated the neuroprotective miR-132 and ameliorated neurodegenerative phenotypes. Our dataset also represents a comprehensive resource for discovering small molecules that modulate specific miRNAs for therapeutic purposes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reconstructing Computational Dynamics from Neural Measurements with Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Mechanistic and computational models in neuroscience usually take the form of systems of differential or time-recursive equations. The spatio-temporal behavior of such systems is the subject of dynamical systems theory (DST). DST provides a powerful mathematical toolbox for describing and analyzing neurobiological processes at any level, from molecules to behavior, and has been a mainstay of computational neuroscience for decades. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) became a popular machine learning tool for studying the nonlinear dynamics underlying neural or behavioral observations. By training RNNs on the same behavioral tasks as employed for animal subjects and dissecting their inner workings, insights and hypotheses about the neuro-computational underpinnings of behavior could be generated. Alternatively, RNNs may be trained directly on the physiological and behavioral time series at hand. Ideally, the once trained RNN would then be able to generate data with the same temporal and geometrical properties as those observed. This is called dynamical systems reconstruction, a burgeoning field in machine learning and nonlinear dynamics. Through this more powerful approach the trained RNN becomes a surrogate for the experimentally probed system, as far as its dynamical and computational properties are concerned. The trained system can then be systematically analyzed, probed and simulated. Here we will review this highly exciting and rapidly expanding field, including recent trends in machine learning that may as yet be less well known in neuroscience. We will also discuss important validation tests, caveats, and requirements of RNN-based dynamical systems reconstruction. Concepts and applications will be illustrated with various examples from neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical microstructural gradients capture memory network reorganization in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), one of the most common pharmaco-resistant epilepsies, is associated with pathology of paralimbic brain regions, particularly in the mesiotemporal lobe. Cognitive dysfunction in TLE is frequent, and particularly affects episodic memory. Crucially, these difficulties challenge the quality of life of patients, sometimes more than seizures, underscoring the need to assess neural processes of cognitive dysfunction in TLE to improve patient management. Our work harnessed a novel conceptual and analytical approach to assess spatial gradients of microstructural differentiation between cortical areas based on high-resolution MRI analysis. Gradients track region-to-region variations in intracortical lamination and myeloarchitecture, serving as a system-level measure of structural and functional reorganization. Comparing cortex-wide microstructural gradients between 21 patients and 35 healthy controls, we observed a contracted gradient in TLE driven by reduced microstructural differentiation between paralimbic cortices and the remaining cortex with marked abnormalities in ipsilateral temporopolar and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Findings were replicated in an independent cohort. Using an independent post mortem dataset, we observed that in vivo findings reflected topographical variations in cortical lamination patterns, confirming that TLE-related changes in the microstructural gradient reflected increased proximity of regions with more dissimilar laminar structure. Disease-related transcriptomics could furthermore show specificity of our findings to TLE over other common epilepsy syndromes. Finally, microstructural dedifferentiation was associated with cognitive network reorganization seen during an episodic memory functional MRI paradigm, and correlated with inter-individual differences in task accuracy. Collectively, our findings showing a pattern of reduced microarchitectural differentiation between paralimbic regions and the remaining cortex provide a parsimonious explanation for functional network reorganization and cognitive dysfunction characteristic of TLE.

                The purpose of this paper is to serve as an instructive resource and a reference catalog for biologically plausible modeling with i) conductance-based models, coupled with ii) strength varying slow synapse models, culminating in iii) two canonical pair-wise rhythm-generating networks. We document the properties of basic network components: cell models and synaptic models, which are prerequisites for proper network assembly. Using the slow-fast decomposition we present a detailed analysis of the cellular dynamics including a discussion of the most relevant bifurcations. Several approaches to model synaptic coupling are also discussed, and a new logistic model of slow synapses is introduced. Finally, we describe and examine two types of bicellular rhythm-generating networks: i) half center oscillators ii) excitatory-inhibitory pairs and elucidate a key principle - the network hysteresis underlying the stable onset of emergent slow bursting in these neural building blocks. These two cell networks are a basis for more complicated neural circuits of rhythmogenesis and feature in our models of swim central pattern generators.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Association of intrinsic functional connectivity between the locus coeruleus and salience network with attentional ability</a></h4>

              
                The LC is a brainstem region associated with broad physiological and neural arousal as part of the release of norepinephrine, but it has increasingly been associated with multiple specific cognitive processes. These include sustained attention, deficits in which are associated with a variety of neuropsychological disorders. Neural models of attention deficits to date have focused on interrupted dynamics between the salience network (SAL) with the fronto-parietal network (FPN), which has been associated with task-switching and processing of external stimuli, respectively. Conflicting findings based on these regions suggest the possibility of upstream signaling leading to attention dysfunction, and recent research suggest the LC may play this role. In this study, resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and behavioral performance on an attention task was examined within 584 individuals. Analysis revealed significant clusters connected to the LC activity in the bilateral insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral ventral striatum, all regions associated with the SAL. Given previous findings that attention deficits may be caused by dysfunctions in network switching by the SAL, our findings here further suggest that dysfunction in LC signaling to the SAL may interfere with attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Biophysical Basis for Learning and Transmitting Sensory Predictions</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic (anti-Hebbian) forms of synaptic are effective at eliminating "prediction errors" that signal the differences between predicted and actual sensory input. However, such mechanisms appear to preclude the possibility of transmitting the resulting predictions to downstream circuits, severely limiting their utility. Using modeling and recordings from the electrosensory lobe of mormyrid fish, we reveal interactions between axonal and dendritic spikes that support both the learning and transmission of predictions. We find that sensory input modulates the rate of dendritic spikes by adjusting the amplitude of backpropagating axonal action potentials. Homeostatic plasticity counteracts these effects through changes in the underlying membrane potential, allowing the dendritic spike rate to be restored to equilibrium while simultaneously transmitting predictions through modulation of the axonal spike rate. These results reveal how two types of spikes dramatically enhance the computational power of single neurons in support of an ethologically relevant multi-layer computation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GluK2 Q/R editing regulates kainate receptor signalling and synaptic AMPA receptor expression and function.</a></h4>

              
                Q/R editing of kainate receptor (KAR) subunit GluK2 pre-mRNA replaces a genetically encoded glutamine to an arginine residue in the channel pore to alter the biophysical and trafficking properties of assembled KARs in recombinant systems. However, the consequences of GluK2 Q/R editing in vivo remain largely unexplored. Here we investigated differences between GluK2-editing deficient mice, that express ~95% unedited GluK2(Q) compared to wild-type counterparts that express ~85% edited GluK2(R). At hippocampal mossy fibre-CA3 (MF-CA3) synapses the editing-deficient (GluK2(Q)) mice displayed enhanced postsynaptic KAR function and increased KAR-mediated presynaptic facilitation, demonstrating heightened ionotropic function. Conversely, KAR-mediated metabotropic function, measured by regulation of afterhyperpolarization currents, was reduced in GluK2(Q) mice. Moreover, GluK2(Q) mice had fewer GluA1-containing synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and reduced postsynaptic AMPAR currents at MF-CA3 synapses. Using patterns of stimulation that replicate physiological activity, we show that GluK2(Q) mice have reduced long-term potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission at Schaffer collateral synapses. These findings indicate that GluK2 Q/R editing influences the balance of ionotropic versus metabotropic KAR signalling and regulates synaptic AMPAR expression and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hearing elliptic movements reveals the imprint of action on prototypical geometries</a></h4>

              
                Within certain categories of geometric shapes, prototypical exemplars that best characterize the category have been evidenced. These geometric prototypes are classically identified through the visual and haptic perception or motor production and are usually characterized by their spatial dimension. However, whether prototypes can be recalled through the auditory channel has not been formally investigated. Here we address this question by using auditory cues issued from timbre-modulated friction sounds evoking human drawing elliptic movements. Since non-spatial auditory cues were previously found useful for discriminating distinct geometric shapes such as circles or ellipses, it is hypothesized that sound dynamics alone can evoke shapes such as an exemplary ellipse. Four experiments were conducted and altogether revealed that a common elliptic prototype emerges from auditory, visual, and motor modalities. This finding supports the hypothesis of a common coding of geometric shapes according to biological rules with a prominent role of sensory-motor contingencies in the emergence of such prototypical geometry.

                Neuropeptides are ancient, widespread signaling molecules that underpin almost all brain functions. They constitute a broad ligand-receptor network, mainly by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the organization of the peptidergic network and roles of many neuropeptides remain elusive, as our insight into neuropeptide-receptor interactions is limited and many peptide GPCRs in animal models and humans are still orphan receptors. Here we report a genome-wide neuropeptide-GPCR interaction map in C. elegans. By reverse pharmacology screening of over 55,384 possible interactions, we identify 461 cognate peptide-GPCR couples that uncover a broad signaling network with specific and complex combinatorial interactions encoded across and within single peptidergic genes. These interactions provide insights into neuropeptide functions and evolution. Combining our dataset with phylogenetic analysis supports peptide-receptor co-evolution and conservation of at least 14 bilaterian peptidergic systems in C. elegans. This resource lays a foundation for system-wide analysis of the peptidergic network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Axon guidance pathways modulate neurotoxicity of ALS-associated UBQLN2</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the ubiquitin (Ub) chaperone Ubiquilin 2 (UBQLN2) cause X-linked forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that aggregation-prone, ALS-associated mutants of UBQLN2 (UBQLN2ALS) trigger heat stress-dependent neurodegeneration in Drosophila. A genetic modifier screen implicated endolysosomal and axon guidance genes, including the netrin receptor, Unc-5, as key modulators of UBQLN2 toxicity. Reduced gene dosage of Unc-5 or its coreceptor Dcc/frazzled diminished neurodegenerative phenotypes, including motor dysfunction, neuromuscular junction defects, and shortened lifespan, in flies expressing UBQLN2ALS alleles. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) harboring UBQLN2ALS knockin mutations exhibited lysosomal defects while inducible motor neurons (iMNs) expressing UBQLN2ALS alleles exhibited cytosolic UBQLN2 inclusions, reduced neurite complexity, and growth cone defects that were partially reversed by silencing of UNC5B and DCC. The combined findings suggest that altered growth cone dynamics are a conserved pathomechanism in UBQLN2-associated ALS/FTD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psychedelics enhance the effects of brain stimulation in rodents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Psychedelics have resurged in neuroscience and psychiatry with promising success in psychedelic-assisted therapy for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and addiction. At the cellular level, psychedelics elicit neuroplastic processes 24 hours after administration, priming neural circuits for change. The acute effects of psychedelics are well characterized with functional imaging and neural oscillations showing an increase in the entropy of spontaneous cortical activity. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that cortical-striatal oscillations recorded in rats would confirm the effects of psychedelics. We also hypothesized that brain stimulation delivered 24 hours after LSD administration would lead to different effects than brain stimulation alone. Methods: We recorded local field potential (LFP) oscillations from rats following lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or saline administration and determined if exposure to these treatments altered the effect of a targeted intervention (brain stimulation) 24 hours later. Results: We confirmed acutely decreased low frequency power across the brain when rats are given LSD. We also demonstrated these altered states return to baseline after 24 hours. Brain stimulation applied in this window of heightened neuroplasticity produced distinct shifts in brain state compared to brain stimulation applied 24 hours after saline. Conclusions: Despite the acute effects of LSD disappearing after 24 hours, there are still latent effects that synergize with brain stimulation to create different changes in brain activity compared to brain stimulation alone. Our findings are the first to suggest that psychedelics could have a role clinically in combination with brain stimulation to achieve enhanced effects on brain activity and clinical outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">YTHDF2 in dentate gyrus is the m6A reader mediating m6A modification in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory</a></h4>

              
                N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been demonstrated to regulate learning and memory in mice. To investigate the mechanism by which m6A modification exerts its function through its reader proteins in the hippocampus, as well as to unveil the specific subregions of the hippocampus that are crucial for memory formation, we generated dentate gyrus (DG)-, CA3-, and CA1-specific Ythdf1 and Ythdf2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice, respectively. Surprisingly, we found that only the DG-specific Ythdf2 cKO mice displayed impaired memory formation, which is inconsistent with the previous report showing that YTHDF1 was involved in this process. YTHDF2 controls the stability of its target transcripts which encode proteins that regulate the elongation of mossy fibers (MF), the axons of granule cells in DG. DG-specific Ythdf2 ablation caused MF overgrowth and impairment of the MF-CA3 excitatory synapse development and transmission in the stratum lucidum. Thus, this study identifies the m6A reader YTHDF2 in dentate gyrus as the only regulator that mediates m6A modification in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.

                CD8 T cell engagement of brain vasculature is a putative mechanism of neuropathology in human cerebral malaria. To define contributions of brain endothelial cell MHC class I antigen-presentation to CD8 T cells in establishing this pathology, we developed novel H-2Kb LoxP and H-2Db LoxP mice crossed with Cdh5-Cre mice to achieve targeted deletion of discrete class I molecules on brain endothelium. Using the Plasmodium berghei ANKA model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), we observe that H-2Kb and H-2Db regulate distinct patterns of disease onset, CD8 T cell infiltration, targeted cell death, and regional blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Strikingly, ablation of H-2Kb or H-2Db from brain endothelial cells resulted in reduced CD8 T cell activation, attenuated T cell interaction with brain vasculature, lessened targeted cell death, preserved BBB integrity, and prevented ECM and the death of the animal. These data demonstrate that interactions of CD8 T cells with discrete MHC class I molecules on brain endothelium regulate development of ECM neuropathology. Therefore, targeting MHC class I interactions therapeutically may hold potential for treatment of cases of severe malaria.

                Mossy cells comprise a large fraction of excitatory neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and their loss is one of the major hallmarks of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The vulnerability of mossy cells in TLE is well known in animal models as well as in patients, however the mechanisms leading to cellular death is unclear. One possible explanation for their sensitivity is linked to their specific ion channel composition. TRPM4 is a Ca2+-activated non-selective cation channel regulating diverse physiological function of excitable cells. Here, we identified that TRPM4 is present and functionally active in hilar mossy cells. Furthermore, we showed that TRPM4 contributes to mossy cells death following status epilepticus and therefore modulates seizure susceptibility and epilepsy-related memory deficits in the chronic phase of TLE.

	<p>This study aimed to determine whether dissociative symptoms and childhood trauma (CT) may help identify a specific subgroup of patients among those hospitalized for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We assessed 587 patients hospitalized for an AUD in a French addiction rehabilitation center (cross-sectional study) regarding dissociative symptoms (DES-taxon), childhood trauma (CTQ), depression (BDI), anxiety (STAI-state and STAI-trait), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; PCL-5), and AUD symptoms (AUDIT). We ran a hierarchical cluster analysis and compared the clusters in terms of dissociation and CT, as well as AUD, depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. We identified three clusters of patients: (1) patients with low AUD severity and low dissociation (LALD); (2) patients with high AUD severity and low dissociation (HALD); (3) patients with high AUD severity and high dissociation (HAHD). Patients from the HAHD group had significantly higher dissociation and more severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms than those with LALD and HALD. They also reported more emotional and sexual abuse than those with LALD. Among patients with an AUD, those with high dissociation may constitute an independent subgroup that exhibits a higher prevalence for CT and higher AUD severity, as well as higher depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Patients with more severe AUD and associated psychiatric symptoms should be systematically screened for dissociation and provided with tailor-based treatments.</p>

	<p>Background: Rathke&amp;amp;rsquo;s cleft cysts (RCC) arise from the pars intermedia because of incomplete regression of the embryologic Rathke pouch. A subset of RCC becomes symptomatic causing headaches, visual and endocrinological disturbances such that surgical intervention is indicated. Several points in surgical management remain controversial including operative strategy (simple fenestration (SF) vs complete cyst wall resection (CWR)) as well as reconstructive techniques. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of pathologically confirmed RCC operated on by endoscopic endonasal approach from 2006 to 2019. Pre-operative symptoms, imaging characteristics, operative strategy, symptom response, complications and recurrences were recorded. Results: Thirty-nine patients were identified. Thirty-three underwent SF and six underwent CWR. Worsening pituitary function was significantly increased with CWR (50%) compared to SF (3%) (p = 0.008). All patients underwent &amp;amp;ldquo;closed&amp;amp;rdquo; reconstruction with a post-operative CSF leak rate of 5% (3% SF vs 16% CWR, p = 0.287). Six (15%) recurrences necessitating surgery were reported. Recurrence rates stratified by surgical technique (18% SF vs 0% CWR, p = 0.564) were not found to be significantly different. Conclusions: The current series illustrates variability in the surgical management of RCCs. SF with closed reconstruction is a reasonable operative strategy for most symptomatic RCCs cases while CWR can be reserved for selected cases.</p>

	<p>Surgical area nurses provide comprehensive care to patients throughout the surgical process. Increases in life expectancy lead to the appearance and development of diseases, translating into an increase in the number of necessary interventions. Increases in the workload can be another risk factor for the development of burnout in professionals in this area. Knowledge of psychological and personality-related variables provides relevant information of level changes in the dimensions of burnout syndrome. Three logistic regression models, based on a cross-sectional study with 214 nurses working in the surgical area in the Andalusian Health Service, Spain, were built for each dimension. These models included different variables related to depression and personality, with some being significant at the population level and consequently true risk or protection factors. Friendliness, responsibility and extraversion are protection factors for the personal accomplishment dimension, whilst neuroticism is a risk factor for this dimension. Friendliness is also a protection factor for depersonalization, whilst depression is a risk factor. Finally, neuroticism, responsibility and depression are risk factors for the emotional exhaustion dimension of burnout. These findings provide relevant information that makes anticipation of this syndrome in this group easier.</p>

	<p>Background: The diagnosis of hydrocephalus is mainly based on imaging findings. However, the significance of many imaging indicators may change, especially in some degenerative diseases, and even lead to misdiagnosis. Methods: This study explored the effectiveness of commonly used morphological parameters and typical radiographic findings in hydrocephalus diagnosis. The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; imaging data were divided into three groups, including the hydrocephalus group, the symptomatic group, and the normal control group. The diagnostic validity and weight of various parameters were compared between groups by multiple machine learning methods. Results: Our results demonstrated that Evans&amp;amp;rsquo; ratio is the most valuable diagnostic indicator compared to the hydrocephalus group and the normal control group. But frontal horns&amp;amp;rsquo; ratio is more useful in diagnosing patients with symptoms. Meanwhile, the sign of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space and third ventricle enlargement could be effective diagnostic indicators in all situations. Conclusion: Both morphometric parameters and radiological features were essential in diagnosing hydrocephalus, but the weights are different in different situations. The machine learning approaches can be applied to optimize the diagnosis of other diseases and consistently update the clinical diagnostic criteria.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Controlling microbial co-culture based on substrate pulsing can lead to stability through differential fitness advantages</a></h4>

Microbial consortia are an exciting alternative for increasing the performances of bioprocesses for the production of complex metabolic products. However, the functional properties of microbial communities remain challenging to control, considering the complex interaction mechanisms occurring between co-cultured microbial species. Indeed, microbial communities are highly dynamic and can adapt to changing environmental conditions through complex mechanisms, such as phenotypic diversification. We focused on stabilizing a co-culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli in continuous cultures. Our preliminary data pointed out that transient diauxic shifts could lead to stable co-culture by providing periodic fitness advantages to the yeast. Based on a computational toolbox called MONCKS (for MONod-type Co-culture Kinetic Simulation), we were able to predict the dynamics of diauxic shift for both species based on a cybernetic approach. This toolbox was further used to predict the frequency of diauxic shift to be applied to reach co-culture stability. These simulations were successfully reproduced experimentally in continuous bioreactors with glucose pulsing. Finally, based on a bet-hedging reporter, we observed that the yeast population exhibited an increased phenotypic diversification process in co-culture compared with mono-culture, suggesting that this mechanism could be the basis of the metabolic fitness of the yeast.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DMFpred: Predicting protein disorder molecular functions based on protein cubic language model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yihe Pang, Bin Liu</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDP/IDRs) are widespread in living organisms and perform various essential molecular functions. These functions are summarized as six general categories, including entropic chain, assembler, scavenger, effector, display site, and chaperone. The alteration of IDP functions is responsible for many human diseases. Therefore, identifying the function of disordered proteins is helpful for the studies of drug target discovery and rational drug design. Experimental identification of the molecular functions of IDP in the wet lab is an expensive and laborious procedure that is not applicable on a large scale. Some computational methods have been proposed and mainly focus on predicting the entropic chain function of IDRs, while the computational predictive methods for the remaining five important categories of disordered molecular functions are desired. Motivated by the growing numbers of experimental annotated functional sequences and the need to expand the coverage of disordered protein function predictors, we proposed DMFpred for disordered molecular functions prediction, covering disordered assembler, scavenger, effector, display site and chaperone. DMFpred employs the Protein Cubic Language Model (PCLM), which incorporates three protein language models for characterizing sequences, structural and functional features of proteins, and attention-based alignment for understanding the relationship among three captured features and generating a joint representation of proteins. The PCLM was pre-trained with large-scaled IDR sequences and fine-tuned with functional annotation sequences for molecular function prediction. The predictive performance evaluation on five categories of functional and multi-functional residues suggested that DMFpred provides high-quality predictions. The web-server of DMFpred can be freely accessed from http://bliulab.net/DMFpred/.

                <p>by Enrui Zhang, Bart Spronck, Jay D. Humphrey, George Em Karniadakis</p>

Many genetic mutations adversely affect the structure and function of load-bearing soft tissues, with clinical sequelae often responsible for disability or death. Parallel advances in genetics and histomechanical characterization provide significant insight into these conditions, but there remains a pressing need to integrate such information. We present a novel genotype-to-biomechanical phenotype neural network (G2Φnet) for characterizing and classifying biomechanical properties of soft tissues, which serve as important functional readouts of tissue health or disease. We illustrate the utility of our approach by inferring the nonlinear, genotype-dependent constitutive behavior of the aorta for four mouse models involving defects or deficiencies in extracellular constituents. We show that G2Φnet can infer the biomechanical response while simultaneously ascribing the associated genotype by utilizing limited, noisy, and unstructured experimental data. More broadly, G2Φnet provides a powerful method and a paradigm shift for correlating genotype and biomechanical phenotype quantitatively, promising a better understanding of their interplay in biological tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mutual influence between language and perception in multi-agent communication games</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xenia Ohmer, Michael Marino, Michael Franke, Peter König</p>

Language interfaces with many other cognitive domains. This paper explores how interactions at these interfaces can be studied with deep learning methods, focusing on the relation between language emergence and visual perception. To model the emergence of language, a sender and a receiver agent are trained on a reference game. The agents are implemented as deep neural networks, with dedicated vision and language modules. Motivated by the mutual influence between language and perception in cognition, we apply systematic manipulations to the agents’ (i) visual representations, to analyze the effects on emergent communication, and (ii) communication protocols, to analyze the effects on visual representations. Our analyses show that perceptual biases shape semantic categorization and communicative content. Conversely, if the communication protocol partitions object space along certain attributes, agents learn to represent visual information about these attributes more accurately, and the representations of communication partners align. Finally, an evolutionary analysis suggests that visual representations may be shaped in part to facilitate the communication of environmentally relevant distinctions. Aside from accounting for co-adaptation effects between language and perception, our results point out ways to modulate and improve visual representation learning and emergent communication in artificial agents.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Getting higher on rugged landscapes: Inversion mutations open access to fitter adaptive peaks in NK fitness landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leonardo Trujillo, Paul Banse, Guillaume Beslon</p>

Molecular evolution is often conceptualised as adaptive walks on rugged fitness landscapes, driven by mutations and constrained by incremental fitness selection. It is well known that epistasis shapes the ruggedness of the landscape’s surface, outlining their topography (with high-fitness peaks separated by valleys of lower fitness genotypes). However, within the strong selection weak mutation (SSWM) limit, once an adaptive walk reaches a local peak, natural selection restricts passage through downstream paths and hampers any possibility of reaching higher fitness values. Here, in addition to the widely used point mutations, we introduce a minimal model of sequence inversions to simulate adaptive walks. We use the well known NK model to instantiate rugged landscapes. We show that adaptive walks can reach higher fitness values through inversion mutations, which, compared to point mutations, allows the evolutionary process to escape local fitness peaks. To elucidate the effects of this chromosomal rearrangement, we use a graph-theoretical representation of accessible mutants and show how new evolutionary paths are uncovered. The present model suggests a simple mechanistic rationale to analyse escapes from local fitness peaks in molecular evolution driven by (intragenic) structural inversions and reveals some consequences of the limits of point mutations for simulations of molecular evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Vigilance, arousal, and acetylcholine: Optimal control of attention in a simple detection task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sahiti Chebolu, Peter Dayan, Kevin Lloyd</p>

Paying attention to particular aspects of the world or being more vigilant in general can be interpreted as forms of ‘internal’ action. Such arousal-related choices come with the benefit of increasing the quality and situational appropriateness of information acquisition and processing, but incur potentially expensive energetic and opportunity costs. One implementational route for these choices is widespread ascending neuromodulation, including by acetylcholine (ACh). The key computational question that elective attention poses for sensory processing is when it is worthwhile paying these costs, and this includes consideration of whether sufficient information has yet been collected to justify the higher signal-to-noise ratio afforded by greater attention and, particularly if a change in attentional state is more expensive than its maintenance, when states of heightened attention ought to persist. We offer a partially observable Markov decision-process treatment of optional attention in a detection task, and use it to provide a qualitative model of the results of studies using modern techniques to measure and manipulate ACh in rodents performing a similar task.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal sequence-based design for multi-antigen HIV-1 vaccines using minimally distant antigens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric Lewitus, Jennifer Hoang, Yifan Li, Hongjun Bai, Morgane Rolland</p>

The immense global diversity of HIV-1 is a significant obstacle to developing a safe and effective vaccine. We recently showed that infections established with multiple founder variants are associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. We propose a novel vaccine design strategy that integrates the variability observed in acute HIV-1 infections with multiple founder variants. We developed a probabilistic model to simulate this variability, yielding a set of sequences that present the minimal diversity seen in an infection with multiple founders. We applied this model to a subtype C consensus sequence for the Envelope (Env) (used as input) and showed that the simulated Env sequences mimic the mutational landscape of an infection with multiple founder variants, including diversity at antibody epitopes. The derived set of multi-founder-variant-like, minimally distant antigens is designed to be used as a vaccine cocktail specific to a HIV-1 subtype or circulating recombinant form and is expected to promote the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Navigation task and action space drive the emergence of egocentric and allocentric spatial representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sandhiya Vijayabaskaran, Sen Cheng</p>

In general, strategies for spatial navigation could employ one of two spatial reference frames: egocentric or allocentric. Notwithstanding intuitive explanations, it remains unclear however under what circumstances one strategy is chosen over another, and how neural representations should be related to the chosen strategy. Here, we first use a deep reinforcement learning model to investigate whether a particular type of navigation strategy arises spontaneously during spatial learning without imposing a bias onto the model. We then examine the spatial representations that emerge in the network to support navigation. To this end, we study two tasks that are ethologically valid for mammals—guidance, where the agent has to navigate to a goal location fixed in allocentric space, and aiming, where the agent navigates to a visible cue. We find that when both navigation strategies are available to the agent, the solutions it develops for guidance and aiming are heavily biased towards the allocentric or the egocentric strategy, respectively, as one might expect. Nevertheless, the agent can learn both tasks using either type of strategy. Furthermore, we find that place-cell-like allocentric representations emerge preferentially in guidance when using an allocentric strategy, whereas egocentric vector representations emerge when using an egocentric strategy in aiming. We thus find that alongside the type of navigational strategy, the nature of the task plays a pivotal role in the type of spatial representations that emerge.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal cellular functional organization for fear memory: Effects of sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is vital to our daily existence. Although a large number of studies have suggested that the hippocampus is dedicated to long-term memory, understanding how memory is anatomically encoded within the hippocampal neuronal network is still lacking. Previously our laboratory showed that hippocampal pyramidal cells are organized in cell clusters to encode both spatial and episodic memory. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that “cluster-type” is a functional organization principal in the hippocampus to encode all types of memory. Here, we tested whether contextual fear, another hippocampus-dependent memory, is also organized in cell clusters. We further investigated the possibility that post-learning sleep may affect functional organization. Cluster formation was examined by assessing the topographic localization of active cells using immediate early gene (IEG, Zif268) imaging methods. The first experiment provides evidence of a cluster-type organization in the hippocampus for fear memory by showing a spatial distribution of adjacent Zif268 positive cells. Exposure to the context itself, without electric shocks, induced a similar cellular formation; however, the degree of clustering was significantly lower. The second experiment provides evidence that sleep plays a role in the refinement and long-term stability of the clusters. The present results confirm the existence of a cluster-type topographic functional neuronal organization in the hippocampus for memory, and further suggest that post-learning sleep enhances the cluster-type organization.</p>

                The circadian clock is a fundamental biological mechanism that orchestrates essential cellular and physiological processes to optimize fitness and health. The basic functional unit is the cell-autonomous oscillator, consisting of intersecting negative feedback loops. Whereas the core loop is primarily responsible for rhythm generation, auxiliary loops, most notably the secondary or stabilization loop, play pivotal roles to confer temporal precision and molecular robustness. The stabilization loop contains opposing nuclear receptor subfamilies REV-ERBs and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs), competing to modulate rhythmic expression of the basic helix-loop-helix ARNT like 1 (Bmal1) genes in the core loop as well as other clock-controlled genes. Therefore, REV-ERBs and RORs are strategically located to interface the oscillator and the global transcriptomic network, promoting cellular homeostasis and physiological fitness throughout lifespan. Disruption of REV-ERB and ROR functions has been linked with diseases and aging, and pharmacological manipulation of these factors has shown promise in various mouse disease models. Nobiletin is a natural compound that directly binds to and activates RORα/γ, modulating circadian rhythms, and shows robust in vivo efficacies to combat clock-associated pathophysiologies and age-related decline. Results from several studies demonstrate an inverse relation between nobiletin efficacy and clock functional state, where nobiletin elicits little effect in young and healthy mice with growing efficacy as the clock is perturbed by environmental and genetic challenges. This mode of action is consistent with the function of the stabilization loop to promote circadian and physiological resilience. Future studies should further investigate the function and mechanism of REV-ERBs and RORs, and test strategies targeting these factors against disease and aging.

                Background: Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of death in patients with cardiovascular disease. Natural products containing high antioxidant activity have been used as an alternative therapy to improve the living conditions of patients. In this study, we examine the protective effect of tamarind seed (TS) on myocardial hypoxic injury. Methods: The hypoxia model was mimicked by mineral oil overlayed on H9c2 cardiomyoblasts for 4 h. TS extract was pretreated and administered during the hypoxic condition. Radical scavenging activity of TS extract was measured and exhibited very potent antioxidant activities on 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays. Results: TS extract at a concentration of 10 µg/ml significantly reversed the effect of hypoxia-induced cell death and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We also observed hypoxia-induced over-expression of both inflammatory cytokine mRNA and activation of cellular apoptosis. Pretreatment of TS extract significantly reduced hypoxia-induced HIF-1α and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, IL-1β and IL-6. The Western blot analysis for apoptotic regulatory molecules, caspase 3, caspase 8 and Bax proteins, also showed hypoxic injury reversal by TS extract treatment. Conclusions: The results suggest that the anti-ischemic effect of TS extract protects against hypoxia-induced injury and has potential to be an effective alternative therapy for ischemic heart disease and oxidative-damage related disease.

                Natural compounds are increasingly becoming an important source of drug leads for computer-aided drug design approaches. Cucurbita maxima has been observed to have medicinal properties and can, therefore, be a potential source of novel drug leads. However, before compounds can be synthesized in the lab for tests, modern approaches require that the candidate compounds be screened for drug-likeness characteristics and toxicity, among others. In this work, the computational tools, SwissADME and DataWarrior were used to screen C. maxima compounds for their potential consideration as drug leads. A total of 130 compounds, downloaded from the LOTUS natural products database, were computationally analysed. The data set presented in this work will be useful to researchers searching for novel drug leads based on natural compounds.

                It is well known that typical antipsychotic drugs have been implicated as a cause of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest; studies have shown that conventional antipsychotics increase the risk of hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest nearly 2-fold. However, atypical antipsychotics are not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. The use of atypical antipsychotics increased since they were first discovered and now are the mainstay of treatment, but with their broad use, heart effects have been documented, such as prolonged QT interval. Clozapine has been linked to severe cardiac problems, and risperidone has been linked to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. We present a case of a patient with bipolar disorder who presented with symptomatic bradycardia secondary to aripiprazole.

                Teinopalpus aureus Mell (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) is distributed throughout China, Vietnam and Laos, and is listed as a Class I species in China. To identify whether the exuviae of larva is belonging to Teinopalpus aureus Mell, 1923 or not, and to compare the gene structure and genetic differences among the known populations, ten mitogenomes of T. aureus from the exuviae of larva collected in the Michelia maudiae were sequenced. This method of sequencing the mitogenomes of exuviae of larva can give us the chance to monitor the conservation of rare butterflies. Ten mitogenomes of T. aureus showed typical gene arrangements and contained 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and a non-coding control region (D-loop). The two haplotypes with one base different in T. aureus were found. We also conducted phylogenetic analyses including all different populations of T. aureus to assess the phylogenetic relationship of T. aureus. The lengths of the 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes from both haplotypes were 776 base pairs (bp) and 1,334 bp, respectively. The genetic distance of the ten samples was calculated as 0-0.000065 on the basis of the whole mitogenomes. T. aureus found in Taishun, Zhejiang province, China had a close phylogenetic relationship with the clade of T. aureus found in Pingshan, Jiangxi province, China, which was supported by neighbour-joining analysis.

                Background: Difficulties in translating the in vitro potency determined by cellular assays into in vivo efficacy in living organisms complicates the design and development of drugs. However,  the residence time of a drug in its molecular target is becoming a key parameter in the design and optimization of new drugs, as recent studies show that residence time can reliably predict drug efficacy in vivo. Experimental approaches to binding kinetics and target ligand complex solutions are currently available, but known bioinformatics databases do not usually report information about the ligand residence time in its molecular target. Methods: To extend existing databases we developed the Protein Data Bank (PDB) residence time database (PDBrt) which reports drug residence time. The database is implemented as an open access web-based tool. The front end uses Bootstrap with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), jQuery for the interface and 3Dmol.js to visualize the complexes. The server-side code uses Python web application framework, Django Rest Framework and backend database PostgreSQL. Results: The PDBrt database is a free, non-commercial repository for 3D protein-ligand complex data, including the measured ligand residence time inside the binding pocket of the specific biological macromolecules as deposited in The Protein Data Bank. The PDBrt database contains information about both the protein and the ligand separately, as well as the protein-ligand complex, binding kinetics, and time of the ligand residence inside the protein binding site.
