              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">The organization of the zebrafish pallium from a hodological perspective</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the connections (connectome) of the adult zebrafish pallium using carbocyanine dye tracing and ancillary anatomical methods. The everted zebrafish pallium (dorsal telencephalic area, D) is comprised of several major zones (medial, lateral, dorsal, central, anterior and posterior) distinguishable by their topography, cytoarchitecture, immunohistochemistry and genoarchitecture. Our comprehensive study reveals poor interconnectivity between these pallial areas, especially between medial (Dm), lateral/dorsal (Dl, Dd) and posterior (Dp) regions. This suggests that the zebrafish pallium has dedicated modules for different neural processes. Pallial connections with extrapallial regions also show compartmental organization. Major extratelencephalic afferents come from preglomerular nuclei (to Dl, Dd and Dm), posterior tuberal nucleus (to Dm), and lateral recess nucleus (to Dl). The subpallial (ventral, V) zones dorsal Vv, Vd and Vs, considered homologues of the striatum, amygdala and pallidum, are mainly afferent to Dl/Dd and Dp. Regarding the efferent pathways, they also appear characteristic of each pallial region. Rostral Dm projects to the dorsal entopeduncular nucleus. Dp is interconnected with the olfactory bulbs. The central region (Dc) defined here receives mainly projections from Dl-Dd and projects toward the pretectum and optic tectum, connections, which help to delimiting Dc. The connectome of the adult pallium revealed here complements extant studies on the neuroanatomical organization of the brain, and may be useful for neurogenetic studies performed during early stages of development. The connectome of the zebrafish pallium was also compared with the pallial connections reported in other teleosts, a large group showing high pallial diversity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Echolocating toothed whales use ultra-fast echo-kinetic responses to track evasive prey</a></h4>

              
                Visual predators rely on fast-acting optokinetic responses to track and capture agile prey. Most toothed whales, however, rely on echolocation for hunting and have converged on biosonar clicking rates reaching 500/s during prey pursuits. If echoes are processed on a click-by-click basis, as assumed, neural responses 100× faster than those in vision are required to keep pace with this information flow. Using high-resolution biologging of wild predator-prey interactions, we show that toothed whales adjust clicking rates to track prey movement within 50–200 ms of prey escape responses. Hypothesising that these stereotyped biosonar adjustments are elicited by sudden prey accelerations, we measured echo-kinetic responses from trained harbour porpoises to a moving target and found similar latencies. High biosonar sampling rates are, therefore, not supported by extreme speeds of neural processing and muscular responses. Instead, the neurokinetic response times in echolocation are similar to those of tracking responses in vision, suggesting a common neural underpinning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Infrared molecular fingerprinting of blood-based liquid biopsies for the detection of cancer</a></h4>

              
                Recent omics analyses of human biofluids provide opportunities to probe selected species of biomolecules for disease diagnostics. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy investigates the full repertoire of molecular species within a sample at once. Here, we present a multi-institutional study in which we analysed infrared fingerprints of plasma and serum samples from 1639 individuals with different solid tumours and carefully matched symptomatic and non-symptomatic reference individuals. Focusing on breast, bladder, prostate, and lung cancer, we find that infrared molecular fingerprinting is capable of detecting cancer: training a support vector machine algorithm allowed us to obtain binary classification performance in the range of 0.78–0.89 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), with a clear correlation between AUC and tumour load. Intriguingly, we find that the spectral signatures differ between different cancer types. This study lays the foundation for high-throughput onco-IR-phenotyping of four common cancers, providing a cost-effective, complementary analytical tool for disease recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A connectome of the Drosophila central complex                    reveals network motifs suitable for flexible navigation and context-dependent                    action selection</a></h4>

              
                Flexible behaviors over long timescales are thought to engage recurrent neural                    networks in deep brain regions, which are experimentally challenging to study.                    In insects, recurrent circuit dynamics in a brain region called the central                    complex (CX) enable directed locomotion, sleep, and context- and                    experience-dependent spatial navigation. We describe the first complete                    electron-microscopy-based connectome of the <i>Drosophila</i> CX,                    including all its neurons and circuits at synaptic resolution. We identified new                    CX neuron types, novel sensory and motor pathways, and network motifs that                    likely enable the CX to extract the fly’s head-direction, maintain it with                    attractor dynamics, and combine it with other sensorimotor information to                    perform vector-based navigational computations. We also identified numerous                    pathways that may facilitate the selection of CX-driven behavioral patterns by                    context and internal state. The CX connectome provides a comprehensive blueprint                    necessary for a detailed understanding of network dynamics underlying sleep,                    flexible navigation, and state-dependent action selection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Septal cholinergic input to CA2 hippocampal region controls social novelty discrimination via nicotinic receptor-mediated disinhibition</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine (ACh), released in the hippocampus from fibers originating in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) complex, is crucial for learning and memory. The CA2 region of the hippocampus has received increasing attention in the context of social memory. However, the contribution of ACh to this process remains unclear. Here, we show that in mice, ACh controls social memory. Specifically, MSDB cholinergic neurons inhibition impairs social novelty discrimination, meaning the propensity of a mouse to interact with a novel rather than a familiar conspecific. This effect is mimicked by a selective antagonist of nicotinic AChRs delivered in CA2. Ex vivo recordings from hippocampal slices provide insight into the underlying mechanism, as activation of nAChRs by nicotine increases the excitatory drive to CA2 principal cells via disinhibition. In line with this observation, optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons in MSDB increases the firing of CA2 principal cells in vivo. These results point to nAChRs as essential players in social novelty discrimination by controlling inhibition in the CA2 region.

	<p>Gulf War illness (GWI) encompasses a constellation of persistent debilitating symptoms associated with significant changes in central nervous system (CNS) and immune functioning. Currently, there is no validated biomarker for GWI risk susceptibility. Given the impact of immune responses linked to GWI symptomology, genetic variability that causes persistent inflammatory/immune alterations may be key. This Boston University-based Gulf War Illness Consortium (GWIC) study investigated the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in variants of immune and pain genetic markers IL1B, IL2, IL6, IL6R, IL10, TNF, TGF, TLR2, TLR4, MD2, MYD88, BDNF, CRP, ICE, COMT and OPRM1 on GWI occurrence in a Caucasian subset of Gulf War (GW) veterans with (cases, n = 170) and without (controls, n = 34) GWI. Logistic regression modeling created a prediction model of GWI risk that associated genetic variability in TGF (rs1800469, p = 0.009), IL6R (rs8192284, p = 0.004) and TLR4 (rs4986791, p = 0.013) with GWI occurrence. This prediction model was specific and sensitive, with a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of 71.4%. This is the first report of immune genetic variability being predictive of GWI and warrants validation in larger independent cohorts. Future reports will present interactions of these genetic risk factors with other characteristics of GW service.</p>

	<p>In this article, we detail the advantages of self-face identification latencies over more traditional tests of mirror self-recognition. Using reaction time latencies (measured in milliseconds) to identify different dimensions of the self, instead of relying on a simple dichotomous pass/fail mirror mark-test outcome, enables investigators to examine individual differences in self-processing time. This is a significant methodological step forward with important implications. The point of departure for our article is to detail research we and others have conducted on latencies for self-face identification, to show how self-processing occurs in the right side of the brain, how schizophrenia is a self-processing disorder, how self-face reaction time latencies implicate the existence of an underlying multiple modal self-processing system, and to explore ideas for future research.</p>

                Background: Despite many studies on COVID-19, our knowledge of it remains incomplete. In some cases, treating SARS-CoV-2 infection concomitant with other diseases can be particularly challenging, as finding an appropriate treatment may involve some risks. Case presentation: A 34-year-old SARS-CoV-2 positive patient admitted due to fever, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and pneumonia, developed alveolar haemorrhage and acute kidney injury. Due to his severe state, abnormalities in laboratory tests and rapidly progressing loss of kidney function, kidney biopsy, as well as antibody panel were carried out, in which perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) were found with a high titer (>200; N: <1:20). The results of kidney biopsy, combined with clinical manifestation and laboratory findings prompted the diagnosis of rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN) in the course of p-ANCA vasculitis. Initial treatment consisted of heamodialyses, remdesivir, plasmaphereses, intravenous immunoglobulins, antibiotics, corticosteroids and nadroparin. Once the haemorrhage had subsided, kidney function had been partially retrieved and heamodialyses had no longer been necessary, cyclophosphamide treatment was initiated, despite being contraindicated in COVID-19 according to its summary of product characteristics. Immunotherapy is still continued. The patient has already received a total of 2.4g of cyclophosphamide (4 cycles of 600mg each every three weeks). Pulmonary and radiological regression, as well as improvement of renal parameters have been achieved.        Conclusions: We suspect that cyclophosphamide, the drug of choice in p-ANCA vasculitis, could be a potential factor providing regression of the radiological changes in the lungs and it could have prevented the patient from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19 diagnosis should not exclude searching for other diseases which can have a similar course. When treating a patient in a life-threatening condition, a departure from trying to find the perfect timing of cyclophosphamide delivery should be considered, as delaying it could cause potentially greater harm.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Aperiodic and Periodic Components of Ongoing Oscillatory Brain Dynamics Link Distinct Functional Aspects of Cognition across Adult Lifespan</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Signal transmission in the brain propagates via distinct oscillatory frequency bands but the aperiodic component, 1/f activity, almost always co-exists which most of the previous studies have not sufficiently taken into consideration. We used a recently proposed parameterization model that delimits the oscillatory and aperiodic components of neural dynamics on lifespan aging data collected from human participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Since healthy aging underlines an enormous change in local tissue properties, any systematic relationship of 1/f activity would highlight their impact on the self-organized critical functional states. Furthermore, we have used patterns of correlation between aperiodic background and metrics of behavior to understand the domain general effects of 1/f activity. We suggest that age-associated global change in 1/f baseline alters the functional critical states of the brain affecting the global information processing impacting critically all aspects of cognition, e.g., metacognitive awareness, speed of retrieval of memory, cognitive load, and accuracy of recall through adult lifespan. This alteration in 1/f crucially impacts the oscillatory features peak frequency (PF) and band power ratio, which relates to more local processing and selective functional aspects of cognitive processing during the visual short-term memory (VSTM) task. In summary, this study leveraging on big lifespan data for the first time tracks the cross-sectional lifespan-associated periodic and aperiodic dynamical changes in the resting state to demonstrate how normative patterns of 1/f activity, PF, and band ratio (BR) measures provide distinct functional insights about the cognitive decline through adult lifespan.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The benefits of mindfulness in mental healthcare professionals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout is a widely reported syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lowered sense of accomplishment. Mindfulness practices have been shown to be useful in lowering distress and burnout in clinical and non-clinical cohorts. Our aim was to explore the potential personal and occupational benefits of a structured mindfulness intervention on a cohort of mental health professionals. A mixed-methods approach was utilised in order to enhance the exploratory power of the study. Methods: We conducted a pilot study involving healthcare practitioners employed at a community outpatient mental health clinic. As a pilot, we relied on a single group and implemented a quasi-experimental, simultaneous mixed methods design by incorporating both quantitative pre- and post- testing alongside written qualitative post-test responses. Results: Analysis of the data demonstrated a significant difference between overall mindfulness when comparing post-test (mean=140.8, standard deviation=18.9) with pre-test data (mean=128.3, standard deviation=28.6). Participants also showed a statistically significant difference in three of the subscales: observation, describing, and non-reactivity. A moderate effect size was seen for each of the above differences.  Analysis of the qualitative data revealed a range of potential themes which may be used to explain the differences exhibited across participants’ personal and professional lives, which can be grouped into two thematic overarching groups: emotional reactivity and listening/communicating. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study indicate that a structured, six-week mindfulness program has the potential to benefit clinicians, personally by reducing emotional reactivity and professionally by promoting deep listening and communication.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Complexity and diversity in sparse code priors improve receptive field characterization of Macaque V1 neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ziniu Wu, Harold Rockwell, Yimeng Zhang, Shiming Tang, Tai Sing Lee</p>

System identification techniques—projection pursuit regression models (PPRs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—provide state-of-the-art performance in predicting visual cortical neurons’ responses to arbitrary input stimuli. However, the constituent kernels recovered by these methods are often noisy and lack coherent structure, making it difficult to understand the underlying component features of a neuron’s receptive field. In this paper, we show that using a dictionary of diverse kernels with complex shapes learned from natural scenes based on efficient coding theory, as the front-end for PPRs and CNNs can improve their performance in neuronal response prediction as well as algorithmic data efficiency and convergence speed. Extensive experimental results also indicate that these sparse-code kernels provide important information on the component features of a neuron’s receptive field. In addition, we find that models with the complex-shaped sparse code front-end are significantly better than models with a standard orientation-selective Gabor filter front-end for modeling V1 neurons that have been found to exhibit complex pattern selectivity. We show that the relative performance difference due to these two front-ends can be used to produce a sensitive metric for detecting complex selectivity in V1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">NanoMethViz: An R/Bioconductor package for visualizing long-read methylation data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shian Su, Quentin Gouil, Marnie E. Blewitt, Dianne Cook, Peter F. Hickey, Matthew E. Ritchie</p>

A key benefit of long-read nanopore sequencing technology is the ability to detect modified DNA bases, such as 5-methylcytosine. The lack of R/Bioconductor tools for the effective visualization of nanopore methylation profiles between samples from different experimental groups led us to develop the <i>NanoMethViz</i> R package. Our software can handle methylation output generated from a range of different methylation callers and manages large datasets using a compressed data format. To fully explore the methylation patterns in a dataset, <i>NanoMethViz</i> allows plotting of data at various resolutions. At the sample-level, we use dimensionality reduction to look at the relationships between methylation profiles in an unsupervised way. We visualize methylation profiles of classes of features such as genes or CpG islands by scaling them to relative positions and aggregating their profiles. At the finest resolution, we visualize methylation patterns across individual reads along the genome using the <i>spaghetti plot</i> and heatmaps, allowing users to explore particular genes or genomic regions of interest. In summary, our software makes the handling of methylation signal more convenient, expands upon the visualization options for nanopore data and works seamlessly with existing methylation analysis tools available in the Bioconductor project. Our software is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/NanoMethViz.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">OutbreakFlow: Model-based Bayesian inference of disease outbreak dynamics with invertible neural networks and its application to the COVID-19 pandemics in Germany</a></h4>

Mathematical models in epidemiology are an indispensable tool to determine the dynamics and important characteristics of infectious diseases. Apart from their scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political decisions and interventional measures during an ongoing outbreak. However, reliably inferring the epidemical dynamics by connecting complex models to real data is still hard and requires either laborious manual parameter fitting or expensive optimization methods which have to be repeated from scratch for every application of a given model. In this work, we address this problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with specialized neural networks. Our approach entails two computational phases: In an initial training phase, a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used as a coach for a neural network, which acquires global knowledge about the full range of possible disease dynamics. In the subsequent inference phase, the trained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and infers the parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the observed dynamics and reliably predict future progression. With its flexible framework, our simulation-based approach is applicable to a variety of epidemiological models. Moreover, since our method is fully Bayesian, it is designed to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter values and returns complete joint posterior distributions over these parameters. Application of our method to the early Covid-19 outbreak phase in Germany demonstrates that we are able to obtain reliable probabilistic estimates for important disease characteristics, such as generation time, fraction of undetected infections, likelihood of transmission before symptom onset, and reporting delays using a very moderate amount of real-world observations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Building and experimenting with an agent-based model to study the population-level impact of CommunityRx, a clinic-based community resource referral intervention</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stacy Tessler Lindau, Jennifer A. Makelarski, Chaitanya Kaligotla, Emily M. Abramsohn, David G. Beiser, Chiahung Chou, Nicholson Collier, Elbert S. Huang, Charles M. Macal, Jonathan Ozik, Elizabeth L. Tung</p>

CommunityRx (CRx), an information technology intervention, provides patients with a personalized list of healthful community resources (HealtheRx). In repeated clinical studies, nearly half of those who received clinical “doses” of the HealtheRx shared their information with others (“social doses”). Clinical trial design cannot fully capture the impact of information diffusion, which can act as a force multiplier for the intervention. Furthermore, experimentation is needed to understand how intervention delivery can optimize social spread under varying circumstances. To study information diffusion from CRx under varying conditions, we built an agent-based model (ABM). This study describes the model building process and illustrates how an ABM provides insight about information diffusion through <i>in silico</i> experimentation. To build the ABM, we constructed a synthetic population (“agents”) using publicly-available data sources. Using clinical trial data, we developed empirically-informed processes simulating agent activities, resource knowledge evolution and information sharing. Using RepastHPC and chiSIM software, we replicated the intervention <i>in silico</i>, simulated information diffusion processes, and generated emergent information diffusion networks. The CRx ABM was calibrated using empirical data to replicate the CRx intervention <i>in silico</i>. We used the ABM to quantify information spread via social versus clinical dosing then conducted information diffusion experiments, comparing the social dosing effect of the intervention when delivered by physicians, nurses or clinical clerks. The synthetic population (N = 802,191) exhibited diverse behavioral characteristics, including activity and knowledge evolution patterns. <i>In silico</i> delivery of the intervention was replicated with high fidelity. Large-scale information diffusion networks emerged among agents exchanging resource information. Varying the propensity for information exchange resulted in networks with different topological characteristics. Community resource information spread via social dosing was nearly 4 fold that from clinical dosing alone and did not vary by delivery mode. This study, using CRx as an example, demonstrates the process of building and experimenting with an ABM to study information diffusion from, and the population-level impact of, a clinical information-based intervention. While the focus of the CRx ABM is to recreate the CRx intervention <i>in silico</i>, the general process of model building, and computational experimentation presented is generalizable to other large-scale ABMs of information diffusion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multicellular spatial model of RNA virus replication and interferon responses reveals factors controlling plaque growth dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Josua O. Aponte-Serrano, Jordan J. A. Weaver, T. J. Sego, James A. Glazier, Jason E. Shoemaker</p>

Respiratory viruses present major public health challenges, as evidenced by the 1918 Spanish Flu, the 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, and 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemics, and the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestations at the cell and tissue levels is vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and to developing strain-independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular computational model of RNA virus infection and the type-I interferon-mediated antiviral response that it induces within lung epithelial cells. The model is built using the CompuCell3D multicellular simulation environment and is parameterized using data from influenza virus-infected cell cultures. Consistent with experimental observations, it exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. The model suggests that modifying the activity of signaling molecules in the JAK/STAT pathway or altering the ratio of the diffusion lengths of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of plaque growth arrest on diffusion lengths highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for <i>in vitro</i> measurement of these diffusion coefficients. Sensitivity analyses under conditions leading to continuous or arrested plaque growth found that plaque growth is more sensitive to variations of most parameters and more likely to have identifiable model parameters when conditions lead to plaque arrest. This result suggests that cytokine assay measurements may be most informative under conditions leading to arrested plaque growth. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms or to use as a component in models linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Inhibition of protein N-myristoylation blocks Plasmodium falciparum intraerythrocytic development, egress and invasion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anja C. Schlott, Ellen Knuepfer, Judith L. Green, Philip Hobson, Aaron J. Borg, Julia Morales-Sanfrutos, Abigail J. Perrin, Catherine Maclachlan, Lucy M. Collinson, Ambrosius P. Snijders, Edward W. Tate, Anthony A. Holder</p>

We have combined chemical biology and genetic modification approaches to investigate the importance of protein myristoylation in the human malaria parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. Parasite treatment during schizogony in the last 10 to 15 hours of the erythrocytic cycle with IMP-1002, an inhibitor of <i>N</i>-myristoyl transferase (NMT), led to a significant blockade in parasite egress from the infected erythrocyte. Two rhoptry proteins were mislocalized in the cell, suggesting that rhoptry function is disrupted. We identified 16 NMT substrates for which myristoylation was significantly reduced by NMT inhibitor (NMTi) treatment, and, of these, 6 proteins were substantially reduced in abundance. In a viability screen, we showed that for 4 of these proteins replacement of the N-terminal glycine with alanine to prevent myristoylation had a substantial effect on parasite fitness. In detailed studies of one NMT substrate, glideosome-associated protein 45 (GAP45), loss of myristoylation had no impact on protein location or glideosome assembly, in contrast to the disruption caused by GAP45 gene deletion, but GAP45 myristoylation was essential for erythrocyte invasion. Therefore, there are at least 3 mechanisms by which inhibition of NMT can disrupt parasite development and growth: early in parasite development, leading to the inhibition of schizogony and formation of “pseudoschizonts,” which has been described previously; at the end of schizogony, with disruption of rhoptry formation, merozoite development and egress from the infected erythrocyte; and at invasion, when impairment of motor complex function prevents invasion of new erythrocytes. These results underline the importance of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> NMT as a drug target because of the pleiotropic effect of its inhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A pilot study assessing the uptake of core outcome sets in health technology assessments [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Core outcome sets (COS) are an agreed standardised collection of outcomes created with representation from all key stakeholders (such as patients, clinicians, researchers), which should be reported as a minimum for all trials in that corresponding clinical area. There has been little research investigating the use of core outcomes in Health technology assessments (HTAs) and none in non-oncology HTAs. This study aimed to assess the similarity between COS and HTA outcomes. Methods: Ten COS published between 2015 and 2019 were selected, with patient participation taken as a proxy measure for a high quality COS. The INAHTA database was used as a source to identify relevant HTAs, which were accessed through the hyperlinks provided. Outcomes selected for these assessments were categorised as either a specific, partial or no match compared to the COS. An additional cohort of non-oncology HTAs published between 2019 and 2021 were identified from the NICE website and compared against a relevant COS. Results: Six hundred and fifty-one HTAs were matched to the ten COS areas, of which 119 were reviewed. Of a possible 1318 core outcome matches, there were 562 (43%) matches, 413 (31%) specific and 149 (11%) partial. NICE HTA matches against corresponding COS ranged from 44% to 100%, with a total of 78% (73/94) matches, 57 (61%) specific and 16 (17%) partial. Conclusion: Further work is required to promote the awareness and implementation of COS within HTAs. Improved uptake across NICE HTAs is encouraging, demonstrating acceptance of COS by HTA producers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigating the impact of university image on international students’ participation behavior: An empirical study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The competition among higher education institutions (HEIs) around the world coupled with the rising mobility of international postgraduate students has created challenges for universities to maintain their competitive advantage. There is continuous emphasis from higher education administrators and governments on internationalization and creating global prominence in this sector. As an emerging hub in southeast Asia, Malaysia is no exception to this. Realizing this need for internationalization, this study has attempted to analyze the impact of university image as a higher-order formative construct on international students' participation behavior as a multidimensional construct. Methods: The sample of this study comprised 150 international students from public and private HEIs in Malaysia. The study focused on this group of students as their participation in university life and face-to-face interactions with university personnel have been significantly affected due to the restrictions on global travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purposive sampling was employed to select the respondents. A structured questionnaire based on a seven-point Likert scale was used to collect the responses. The hypothesized relationships of this cross-sectional study were examined using partial least square-based structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results: The results showed that all the four hypotheses developed in relation to the dimensions of participation behavior were supported. This research outcome has evidenced that university image can influence international students’ participation behavior such as information seeking, and information sharing behavior that can be perceived as positive behavioral outcomes towards their respective HEIs. Conclusions: Since the present study was conducted in one country, future studies may reproduce this in other southeast Asian countries. While cross-validation to local students lies outside the scope of this study, this empirically tested behavior model offers practical implications for universities, particularly in this uncertain period where HEIs are going through tremendous challenges to uphold their strong rapport with international students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Common genetic signatures of Alzheimer’s disease in Down Syndrome [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: People with Down Syndrome (DS) are born with an extra copy of Chromosome (Chr) 21 and many of these individuals develop Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) when they age. This is due at least in part to the extra copy of the APP gene located on Chr 21. By 40 years, most people with DS have amyloid plaques which disrupt brain cell function and increase their risk for AD. About half of the people with DS develop AD and the associated dementia around 50 to 60 years of age, which is about the age at which the hereditary form of AD, early onset AD, manifests. In the absence of Chr 21 trisomy, duplication of APP alone is a cause of early onset Alzheimer’s disease, making it likely that having three copies of APP is important in the development of AD and in DS. Methods: We investigate the relationship between AD and DS through integrative analysis of genesets derived from a MeSH query of AD and DS associated beta amyloid peptides, Chr 21, GWAS identified AD risk factor genes, and differentially expressed genes in individuals with DS. Results:  Unique and shared aspects of each geneset were evaluated based on  functional enrichment analysis, transcription factor profile and network interactions. Genes that may be important to both disorders in the context of direct association with APP processing, Tau post translational modification  and network connectivity are ACSM1, APBA2, APLP1, BACE2, BCL2L, COL18A1, DYRK1A, IK, KLK6, METTL2B, MTOR, NFE2L2, NFKB1, PRSS1, QTRT1, RCAN1, RUNX1, SAP18 SOD1, SYNJ1, S100B. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and immune system processes likely contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and DS which is consistent with other published reports.

                Background: The provision of community health services (CHS) is critical in accelerating primary health care delivery to vulnerable and deprived populations. However, the structural linkages between households and the CHS being provided by community health workers (CHWs) or volunteers in Kisumu County, Kenya, remains weak and inefffective. Methods: This study applied a descriptive approach using a systematic review technique to provide context and substance to the two main research questions: (1) how does the interaction between households and CHWs affect utilization of CHS to promote equity and right to health? (2) How do health-seeking behaviours of households influence their decision-making regarding choices of CHS? We screened the literature from Google scholar, JSTOR, SAGE and EBSCO based on our inclusion criteria, resulting in 21 studies. These studies were assessed for quality and eligibility and data extracted based on relevance to the research study. Results: Households place primacy on trust and confidentiality in the interaction with CHWs and this affects uptake of CHS. The social determinants of health are also critical in influencing the health-seeking behaviour of households and individuals and their choice of CHS. The successful models of CHS share the characteristic of community ownership and participation and provides for comprehensive health care teams. Conclusion: CHS are critical for the acceleration of primary health care delivery. It forms an important pathway for the achievement of universal health coverage, which is an outcome required for Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A brief review of simulated Kalman Filter Algorithm – variants and applications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Simulated Kalman Filter (SKF) solves optimization problems by finding the estimate of the optimum solution. As a multi-agent algorithm, every agent in the population acts as a Kalman filter by using a standard Kalman filter framework, which includes a simulated measurement process and a best-so-far solution as a reference. This paper presented an overview of the research progress in SKF from the day it was introduced until the present day, discussing the progress, improvements, modifications, and applications of SKF. The fundamental and standard algorithm were first introduced. Then, the work on the algorithm improvements was surveyed. Finally, the remaining unresolved problems and some directions of SKF research were discussed. We reviewed 57 SKF papers. 16 of them on fundamental improvements, 9 on extension of the algorithm to discrete problems and 25 on their applications. Researchers have worked on ideas to improve exploration capability to prevent premature convergence by trying prediction operators, opposition-based learning, and different iteration strategies. There were also attempts to hybridize SKF with other famous algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) to improve its performance. Lastly, a single-agent variant of SKF and a multi-objective SKF were introduced. SKF algorithms and its variants have been implemented in at least nine areas of applications: drill path optimization, airport gate allocation problem (AGAP), assembly sequence planning (ASP), system identification, feature selection, image template matching, controller tuning, wireless sensor network, and engineering design problem. The literature reviewed solely depended on the keyword search that contained the terms simulated Kalman filter from December 2015 to the present date. This is the first review paper on SKF. It is hoped that this survey would be beneficial for the researchers of this area and attracting interest towards the algorithm.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Attitudes and habits regarding brain training applications and games among Japanese consumers: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While there is now a large amount of research investigating whether brain training applications and games are effective or not, there is less research on the expectations, attitudes, and habits of potential users of brain training programs. Previous research suggests that people generally have positive beliefs about the effectiveness of brain training which are not dependent on their level of experience of brain training. However, this research has primarily focused on western participants. Methods: In the present study, a questionnaire was used to investigate the attitudes and habits of Japanese consumers towards brain training. The final sample contained responses from 818 people. In addition to descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients were calculated to determine if there were relationships between variables relating to participants' beliefs about brain training and experience of using brain training. Results: Participants had positive beliefs about the effectiveness of brain training. However, these beliefs were negligibly or weakly correlated with their level of experience of using brain training, both in terms of the number programs used (Pearson's r = 0.163) and duration of use (Pearson's r = 0.237). The most widely used brain training program (used by 52.93% of participants) was made by Nintendo for the handheld Nintendo DS games console. Conclusions: The research presented here supports previous findings which suggest that people's beliefs about the effectiveness of brain training software are not strongly related to their experience of using such software.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Stem cell therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease leading to loss of upper and lower motor neurons at both spinal and bulbar levels.   For patients with ALS rehabilitation is important to maintain functional independence, ensure safety and optimize quality of life but is not curative. Stem cell therapy (SCT) provides a new approach to treat previously incurable diseases although peer reviewed published evidence has shown no benefit in ALS for slowing disease progression or functional loss.   This case report presents a patient with ALS who underwent SCT but deteriorated rapidly after the procedure. Whether the deterioration was due to the natural progress of the disease or expedited by SCT remains unknown. The ethical considerations of how marketing influences healthcare and individuals’ decisions in desperate situations along with reasons for taking desperate measures are discussed.  Patient education and open communication with ALS patients are imperative in gaining patient satisfaction and overcoming ill effects that marketing could have on unconventional methods of intervention. Raising awareness about the availability and access to multidisciplinary care, the timing of decisions with regards to symptom management and end of life care have proven to enhance the quality of life for such patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Neural matrix factorization++ based recommendation system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, Recommender System (RS) research work has covered a wide variety of Artificial Intelligence techniques, ranging from traditional Matrix Factorization (MF) to complex Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation methods such as MF, have limited learning capabilities as it only considers the linear combination between user and item vectors. For learning non-linear relationships, methods like Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) incorporate DNN into CF methods. Though, CF methods still suffer from cold start and data sparsity. This paper proposes an improved hybrid-based RS, namely Neural Matrix Factorization++ (NeuMF++), for effectively learning user and item features to improve recommendation accuracy and alleviate cold start and data sparsity. NeuMF++ is proposed by incorporating effective latent representation into NeuMF via Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE). NeuMF++ can also be seen as the fusion of GMF++ and MLP++. NeuMF is an NCF framework which associates with GMF (Generalized Matrix Factorization) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptrons). NeuMF achieves state-of-the-art results due to the integration of GMF linearity and MLP non-linearity. Concurrently, incorporating latent representations has shown tremendous improvement in GMF and MLP, which result in GMF++ and MLP++. Latent representation obtained through the SDAEs’ latent space allows NeuMF++ to effectively learn user and item features, significantly enhancing its learning capability. However, sharing feature extractions among GMF++ and MLP++ in NeuMF++ might hinder its performance. Hence, allowing GMF++ and MLP++ to learn separate features provides more flexibility and greatly improves its performance. Experiments performed on a real-world dataset have demonstrated that NeuMF++ achieves an outstanding result of a test root-mean-square error of 0.8681. In future work, we can extend NeuMF++ by introducing other auxiliary information like text or images. Different neural network building blocks can also be integrated into NeuMF++ to form a more robust recommendation model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Academic entrepreneurial engagement for frugal innovation in higher education institutions: a systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Higher education institutions (HEI) are faced with increasing challenges related to shrinking resources, high operation costs, the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing student enrolment rates, and pressure to contribute to regional development and economic growth. To overcome such challenges, academics must move beyond their traditional functions of research and teaching and engage in entrepreneurial activities. Through engagement in entrepreneurial activities, academics can contribute to frugal innovation (FI) in private HEI (PHEI). The literature in this context emphasizes that academic entrepreneurial engagement (AEE) will lead to innovation, the identification of opportunities for new business ventures, financial rewards for institutions and academics, an impact on the economy, and the enhancement of social welfare. This study presents a systematic review of the literature and adopts the Transfield five-phase strategy to review the literature on AEE from the past two decades (2000–2020). A total of 1,067 papers on FI are obtained, only five of which focus on AEE. Moreover, papers related to AEE for FI are few. The study presents the research gaps, challenges, and potential factors for further research in this context. We conclude that FI for AEE in PHEI can be a game-changer for future sustainability. Moreover, we believe that the outcome of this review warrants further research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Green synthesis and characterization of zinc oxide nanoparticles using bush tea (Athrixia phylicoides DC) natural extract: assessment of the synthesis process. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nanoparticles are globally synthesized for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, catalytic, magnetic, optical, and electronic properties that have put them at the forefront of a wide variety of studies. Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) has received much consideration due to its technological and medicinal applications. In this study, we report on the synthesis process of ZnO nanoparticles using Athrixia phylicoides DC natural extract as a reducing agent.   Methods: Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify the compounds responsible for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. Structural, morphological and optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles have been characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).   Results: LC-MS results showed that different flavonoids and polyphenols, as well as Coumarin, an aromatic compound, reacted with the precursor to form ZnO nanoparticles. XRD and UV-Vis analysis confirmed the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, with a spherical shape showed in SEM images. The quasi-spherical ZnO crystals had an average crystallite size of 24 nm. EDS and FTIR analysis confirmed that the powders were pure with no other phase or impurity.   Conclusions: This study successfully demonstrated that the natural plant extract of A. phylicoides DC. can be used in the bio-reduction of zinc nitrate hexahydrate to prepare pure ZnO nanoparticles, thus, extending the use of this plant to an industrial level.

                Background: Studies have acknowledged that social media enables students to connect with and learn from experts from different ties available in the students’ personal learning environment (PLE). The inclusion of experts in formal learning activities through social media such as in scaffolding problem-solving activities helps students see the practicality of experts’ thinking in solving real-world problems. However, studies that evaluate experts’ problem-solving styles and how these influence the experts' thinking process in delivering the know-how to students on social media based on the ties that the students have with the experts in social media are scarce in the extant literature. The study aimed to explore the problem-solving styles that the experts portrayed on Facebook based on their ties with the students.  Methods: This study employed a simultaneous within-subject experimental design which was conducted in three closed Facebook groups with 12 final year management students, six business experts, and one instructor as the participants. The experts were invited by the students from the weak and strong ties in their PLE. Hinging on the Theory of Fluid and Crystallised intelligence and the Strength of Weak Ties Theory, this study employed thematic analysis using the ATLAS.ti qualitative data analysis software to map the experts’ comments on Facebook. Results:  The use of strong ties in combination with weak ties balances out the negative aspects of the business experts’ problem-solving styles.  All the experts used both fluid and crystallised intelligence in scaffolding the students’ learning; however, the degree of its usage correlated with the working experience of the experts. Conclusion: The use of weak or strong ties benefited the students as it expedited their problem-solving tasks since the experts have unique expertise to offer depending on the degree of their working experiences and the proximity of the students’ relationship with the experts.

                Background: This study aims to process porang flour, moringa leaves, and tempe into cookies that are high in iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and antioxidants as potential functional food snacks for adolescents with anemia. Methods: This study is experimental with a completely randomized trial design (CRD) with three treatments and triplicates. There are three comparison formulations of a combination of porang, moringa leaves, and black soybean-based tempe; respectively F1 (3:3:3)%, F2 (3:6:6)%, and F3 (3:10:10)%. The cookie sample was then analyzed for water content, ash, iron, folic acid, cobalt, and antioxidant activity. The differences between the samples were analyzed based on the activity of antioxidants, iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in data obtained from triplicates using multivariate ANOVA analysis. Results: The results of the ash and water content tests of all three cookie formulations showed values in accordance with the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) for cookie products. F3 has significantly higher iron, folic acid, and cobalt levels than F1 and F2 (p<0.05). Antioxidant activity is highest in F3, but there is no meaningful difference between F2 and F3 (p>0.05). Conclusions: The combination of porang's tubers, moringa leaves, and tempe made from black soybeans, especially F3, has the potential to be used as a functional cookie processed product source of iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin, and antioxidants for adolescent anemia.

<p>Morphological and functional development of astrocytes in the visual thalamus: In the present study, we show that by eye-opening, astrocytes not only possess adult-like morphology but also completely enwrap retinogeniculate synapses and efficiently uptake extracellular glutamate.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent visual thalamus has served as a powerful model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie sensory circuit formation and function. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of axon-target interactions and neural activity in orchestrating circuit formation in visual thalamus, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, is less clear. In fact, we know little about the transcriptional identity and development of astrocytes in mouse visual thalamus. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied the expression of canonical astrocyte molecules in visual thalamus using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and reporter lines. While our data suggests some level of heterogeneity of astrocytes in different nuclei of the visual thalamus, the majority of thalamic astrocytes appeared to be labeled in <i>Aldh1l1-EGFP</i> mice. This led us to use this transgenic line to characterize the neonatal and postnatal development of these cells in visual thalamus. Our data show that not only have the entire cohort of astrocytes migrated into visual thalamus by eye-opening but they also have acquired their adult-like morphology, even while retinogeniculate synapses are still maturing. Furthermore, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and functional approaches revealed that by eye-opening, thalamic astrocytes ensheathe retinogeniculate synapses and are capable of efficient uptake of glutamate. Taken together, our results reveal that the morphological, anatomical, and functional development of astrocytes in visual thalamus occurs prior to eye-opening and the emergence of experience-dependent visual activity.</p>

     alt="Pretecto- and ponto-cerebellar pathways to the pigeon oculomotor cerebellum follow a zonal organization"/>
<p>Using injections of retrograde tracers, we show that the medial and lateral pontine nucleus (PM and PL, respectively), and the medial and lateral subdivisions of the medial spiriform nucleus (SpMm and SpMl, respectively) project to different parasagittal zones in the oculomotor cerebellum of the pigeon. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Both birds and mammals have relatively large forebrains and cerebella. In mammals, there are extensive sensory–motor projections to the cerebellum through the pontine nuclei originating from several parts of the cerebral cortex. Similar forebrain-to-cerebellum pathways exist in birds, but the organization of this circuitry has not been studied extensively. Birds have two nuclei at the base of the brainstem that are thought to be homologous to the pontine nuclei of mammals, the medial and lateral pontine nuclei (PM, PL). Additionally, birds are unique in that they have a pretectal nucleus called the medial spiriform nucleus (SpM) that, like the pontine nuclei, also receives projections from the forebrain and projects to the oculomotor cerebellum (OCb; folia VI to VIII). The OCb also receives input from the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM), which analyzes visual optic flow information resulting from self-movement. In this study, we used single or double injections of fluorescent tracers to study the organization of these inputs from PM, PL, SpM and LM to the OCb in pigeons. We found that these inputs follow a zonal organization. The most medial zone in the OCb, zone A1, receives bilateral inputs from the lateral SpM, PL and LM. Zones A2 and C receive a bilateral projection from the medial SpM, and a mostly contralateral projection from PM and LM. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructure of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar projections in the mouse"/>
<p>The confocal image of a coronal section through the left mouse pulvinar nucleus (PUL) illustrates the distribution of projections from the left (Ipsi, magenta) and right (Contra, green) superior colliculus (SC). This study examined the ultrastructure of ipsi and contra SC to PUL projections using viruses that induce the expression of peroxidase in synaptic vesicles (example electron micrographs circled, black arrows indicate synapses). Synaptic terminals originating from the ipsi SC were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals originating from the contra SC (left graph), and both populations of SC terminals were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals in the PUL that do not originate from the SC (right graph).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual pathways of the brain are organized into parallel channels that code different features of the external environment. In the current study, we investigated the anatomical organization of parallel pathways from the superior colliculus (SC) to the pulvinar nucleus in the mouse. Virus injections placed in the ipsilateral and contralateral SC to induce the expression of different fluorescent proteins define two pulvinar zones. The lateral pulvinar (Pl) receives ipsilateral SC input and the caudal medial pulvinar (Pcm) receives bilateral SC input. To examine the ultrastructure of these projections using transmission electron microscopy, we injected the SC with viruses to induce peroxidase expression within synaptic vesicles or mitochondria. We quantitatively compared the sizes of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites, as well as the sizes of the overall population of synaptic terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites in the Pl and Pcm. Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that ipsilateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than contralateral tectopulvinar terminals. In particular, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection includes a subset of large terminals (≥ 1 μm<sup>2</sup>) that envelop dendritic protrusions of postsynaptic dendrites. We also found that both ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than the overall population of synaptic terminals in both the Pl and Pcm. Thus, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection is structurally distinct from the bilateral tectopulvinar pathway, but both tectopulvinar channels may be considered the primary or “driving” input to the Pl and Pcm.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Rethinking stress resilience</a></h4>

              
                Resilience to stressful life events has received considerable attention in both clinical and preclinical studies. A number of neural substrates have been identified as putatively mediating resilience to stress. However, there remains considerable diversity in how resilience is defined and studied. This article aims to examine how resilience is defined and conceptualized in social psychology, public health, and related fields, to better inform the understanding of stress resilience in the neurobiological context, and to differentiate resilience from other patterns of response to stressful experiences.

                Hu and Dan established an auditory-cue-directed visual spatial attention task for mice and identified a midbrain source of attention signal. The delay activity of neurons in the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus is crucial for task performance and attentional modulation in the superior colliculus and visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Astrocyte GluN2C NMDA receptors control basal synaptic strengths of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in the stratum radiatum</a></h4>

              
                Experience-dependent plasticity is a key feature of brain synapses for which neuronal N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a major role, from developmental circuit refinement to learning and memory. Astrocytes also express NMDARs although their exact function has remained controversial. Here we identify in mouse hippocampus, a circuit function for GluN2C NMDAR, a subtype highly expressed in astrocytes, in layer-specific tuning of synaptic strengths in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Interfering with astrocyte NMDAR or GluN2C NMDAR activity reduces the range of presynaptic strength distribution specifically in the <i>stratum radiatum</i> inputs without an appreciable change in the mean presynaptic strength. Mathematical modeling shows that narrowing of the width of presynaptic release probability distribution compromises the expression of long-term synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest a novel feedback signaling system that uses astrocyte GluN2C NMDARs to adjust basal synaptic weight distribution of Schaffer collateral inputs, which in turn impacts computations performed by the CA1 pyramidal neuron.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Effect of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on vascular permeability</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infection leads to severe disease associated with cytokine storm, vascular dysfunction, coagulation, and progressive lung damage. It affects several vital organs, seemingly through a pathological effect on endothelial cells. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 29 proteins, whose contribution to the disease manifestations, and especially endothelial complications, is unknown. We cloned and expressed 26 of these proteins in human cells and characterized the endothelial response to overexpression of each, individually. Whereas most proteins induced significant changes in endothelial permeability, nsp2, nsp5_c145a (catalytic dead mutant of nsp5), and nsp7 also reduced CD31, and increased von Willebrand factor expression and IL-6, suggesting endothelial dysfunction. Using propagation-based analysis of a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, we predicted the endothelial proteins affected by the viral proteins that potentially mediate these effects. We further applied our PPI model to identify the role of each SARS-CoV-2 protein in other tissues affected by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). While validating the PPI network model, we found that the tight junction (TJ) proteins cadherin-5, ZO-1, and β-catenin are affected by nsp2, nsp5_c145a, and nsp7 consistent with the model prediction. Overall, this work identifies the SARS-CoV-2 proteins that might be most detrimental in terms of endothelial dysfunction, thereby shedding light on vascular aspects of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Subpopulations of neurons in lOFC encode previous and current rewards at time of choice</a></h4>

              
                Studies of neural dynamics in lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) have shown that subsets of neurons that encode distinct aspects of behavior, such as value,may project to common downstreamtargets. However, it is unclear whether reward history, which may subserve lOFC's well-documented role in learning, is represented by functional subpopulations in lOFC. Previously, we analyzed neural recordings from rats performing a value-based decision-making task, and we documented trial-by-trial learning that required lOFC (Constantinople et al., 2019). Here we characterize functional subpopulations of lOFC neurons during behavior, including their encoding of task variables. We found five distinct clusters of lOFC neurons, either based on clustering of their trial-averaged peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs), or a feature space defined by their average conditional firing rates aligned to different task variables. We observed weak encoding of reward attributes, but stronger encoding of reward history, the animal's left or right choice, and reward receipt across all clusters. Only one cluster, however, encoded the animal's reward history at the time shortly preceding the choice, suggesting a possible role in integrating previous and current trial outcomes at the time of choice. This cluster also exhibits qualitatively similar responses to identified corticostriatal projection neurons in a recent study (Hirokawa et al., 2019), and suggests a possible role for subpopulations of lOFC neurons in mediating trial-by-trial learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Lon protease temporally restricts polar cell differentiation events during the Caulobacter cell cycle</a></h4>

              
                The highly conserved protease Lon has important regulatory and protein quality control functions in cells from the three domains of life. Despite many years of research on Lon, only a few specific protein substrates are known in most organisms. Here, we used a quantitative proteomics approach to identify novel substrates of Lon in the dimorphic bacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. We focused our study on proteins involved in polar cell differentiation and investigated the developmental regulator StaR and the flagella hook length regulator FliK as specific Lon substrates in detail. We show that Lon recognizes these proteins at their C-termini, and that Lon-dependent degradation ensures their temporally restricted accumulation in the cell cycle phase when their function is needed. Disruption of this precise temporal regulation of StaR and FliK levels in a Δ<i>lon</i> mutant contributes to defects in stalk biogenesis and motility, respectively, revealing a critical role of Lon in coordinating developmental processes with cell cycle progression. Our work underscores the importance of Lon in the regulation of complex temporally controlled processes by adjusting the concentrations of critical regulatory proteins. Furthermore, this study includes the first characterization of FliK in <i>C. crescentus</i> and uncovers a dual role of the C-terminal amino acids of FliK in protein function and degradation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein kinase Cδ is essential for the IgG response against T cell-independent type 2 antigens and commensal bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Antigens (Ags) with multivalent and repetitive structure elicit IgG production in a T cell-independent manner. However, the mechanisms by which such T cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) Ags induce IgG responses remain obscure. Here we report that BCR engagement with a TI-2 Ag but not with a T cell-dependent (TD) Ag was able to induce the transcription of <i>Aicda</i> encoding activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and efficient class switching to IgG3 upon co-stimulation with IL-1 or IFN-α in mouse B cells. TI-2 Ags strongly induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC)δ and PKCδ mediated the <i>Aicda</i> transcription through the induction of BATF, the key transcriptional regulator of <i>Aicda</i>. In PKCδ-deficient mice, production of IgG was intact against TD Ag but abrogated against typical TI-2 Ags as well as commensal bacteria, and experimental disruption of the gut epithelial barrier resulted in fatal bacteremia. Thus, our results have revealed novel molecular requirements for class-switching in the TI-2 response and highlighted its importance in homeostatic commensal-specific IgG production.

                : Polycystic ovary syndrome often starts in puberty, and its pathogenesis is not clear. This study aimed to explore the pathogenesis of pubertal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and assess the therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture on pubertal PCOS. Methods: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was used to induce rat models of pubertal PCOS. pubertal rats with PCOS were randomly divided into a model group (M), an electroacupuncture group (EA), and a sham acupuncture group (SA). Age-matched normal rats were regarded as normal controls (N). Rats were treated with EA or SA five times a week for 25 minutes during their 6 th -7 th week. At the end of the experiment, we observed any changes in ovarian morphology; detected levels of metabolic indices in serum, the hypothalamus and pancreas. Results: EA significantly improved estrous cycle disorders and the ovarian polycystic morphology in pubertal rats with PCOS, but SA only improved disorders of the estrous cycle. The serum levels of insulin, neuropeptide Y(NPY) and fasting blood glucose(FBG) increased significantly, while the serum levels of ghrelin(GHRL) decreased in the model group. After treatment with EA, the levels of NPY and FBG went into decrease, whereas the levels of GHRL and insulin increased. There was few differences in the hypothalamic expression of galanin (GAL), galanin-like peptide (GALP) and ghrelin receptor(GHSR) between the four groups. The upregulation of NPY mRNA and neuropeptide Y2 receptor(NPY2R) mRNA and the downregulation of GHRL protein and mRNA in the hypothalamus, and the increased expression of NPY and NPY2R as well as the decreased expression of GHRL in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) can be rescued by EA. But, surprisingly, SA seem to make no difference to the levels of FBG and insulin, and the protein expression of ghrelin in the hypothalamus and ARC. Co-expression of kisspeptin and GHSR, and co-expression of gonadotrophin releasing hormone(GnRH) and NPY2R were observed in ARC. No differences were found between groups in protein of GAL, GALP and GHRL expression in the pancreas. Neither EA nor SA can attenuate the upregulated kisspeptin protein expression in the pancreas of PCOS model rats. EA and SA improved the symptoms of pubertal PCOS rats, and the mechanism might be associated with regulating hypothalamic NPY and ghrelin levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A computational model of direction selectivity in Macaque V1 cortex based on dynamic differences between ON and OFF pathways</a></h4>

              
                This paper is about neural mechanisms of direction selectivity (DS) in Macaque primary visual cortex, V1. DS arises in V1 layer 4Ca, which receives afferent input from the Magnocellular division of the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). LGN itself, however, is not direction-selective. To understand the mechanisms of DS, we built a new computational model (DSV1) of 4Ca. DSV1 is a realistic, large-scale mechanistic model that simulates many V1 properties: orientation selectivity, spatial and temporal tuning, contrast response, and DS. In the model, DS is initiated by the dynamic difference of OFF and ON Magnocellular cell activity that excites the model's layer 4Ca; the recurrent network has no intra-cortical direction-specific connections. In experiments, and in DSV1, most 4Ca Simple cells were highly direction-selective but few 4Ca Complex cells had high DS. Furthermore, the preferred directions of the model's direction- selective Simple cells were invariant with spatial and temporal frequency, in this way emulating the experimental data. The distribution of DS across the model's population of cells was very close to that found in experiments. Analyzing DSV1, we found that the dynamic interaction of feedforward and intra-cortical synaptic currents led to cortical enhancement of DS for a majority of cells. In view of the strong quantitative agreement between DS in data and in model simulations, the neural mechanisms of DS in DSV1 may be indicative of those in the real visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fitness tracking reveals task-specific associations between memory, mental health, and exercise</a></h4>

              
                Physical exercise can benefit both physical and mental well-being. Different forms of exercise (i.e., aerobic versus anaerobic; running versus walking, swimming, or yoga; high-intensity interval training versus endurance workouts; etc.) impact physical fitness in different ways. For example, running may substantially impact leg and heart strength but only moderately impact arm strength. We hypothesized that the mental benefits of exercise might be similarly differentiated. We focused specifically on how different forms of exercise might related to different aspects of memory and mental health. To test our hypothesis, we collected (in aggregate) roughly a century's worth of fitness data. We then asked participants to fill out surveys asking them to self-report on different aspects of their mental health. We also asked participants to engage in a battery of memory tasks that tested their short and long term episodic, semantic, and spatial memory performance. We found that participants with similar exercise habits and fitness profiles tended to also exhibit similar mental health and task performance profiles. These effects were task-specific in that different exercise patterns or fitness characteristics varied with different aspects of memory, on different tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">State-of-the-art EEG artifact removal evaluation</a></h4>

              
                Object. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and are very susceptible to muscular, ambient noise, and other artifacts. Many artifact removal algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. However, the evaluation of these algorithms is conventionally too indirect (e.g., black-box comparisons of brain-computer interface performance before and after removal) because it is unclear which part of the signal represents raw EEG and which is noise. This project objectively benchmarks popular artifact removal algorithms and evaluates the fundamental Independent Component Analysis (ICA) approach thanks to a unique dataset where EEG is recorded simultaneously with other physiological signals-facial electromyography (EMG), accelerometers, and gyroscope-while ten subjects perform several repetitions of common artifact-inflicting tasks (blinking, speaking, etc.). Approach. I have compared the correlation between EEG signals and the artifact-representing channels before and after applying an artifact removal algorithm across the different artifact-inflicting tasks. The extent to which an artifact removal method can reduce this correlation objectively quantifies its effectiveness for the different artifacts. In the same direction, I have determined to what extent ICA successfully detects artefactual components in EEG by comparing the corresponding correlations for independent components that are labeled as artifacts with those labeled as EEG. Main result. The FORCe was found to be the most effective and generic artifact removal method, cleaning almost 40% of artifacts. ICA is shown to be able to isolate almost 70% of artefactual components. Significance. This work alleviates the problem of unreliable evaluation of EEG artifact removal frameworks and provides the first reliable benchmark for the most popular algorithms in this literature.

                The goal of sensory substitution is to convey the information transduced by one sensory system through a novel sensory modality. One example is vibrotactile (VT) speech, for which acoustic speech is transformed into vibrotactile patterns. Despite an almost century-long history of studying vibrotactile speech, there has been no study of the neural bases of VT speech learning. We here trained hearing adult participants to recognize VT speech syllables. Using fMRI, we showed that both somatosensory (left post-central gyrus) and auditory (right temporal lobe) regions acquire selectivity for VT speech stimuli following training. The right planum temporale in particular was selective for both VT and auditory speech. EEG source-estimated activity revealed temporal dynamics consistent with direct, low-latency engagement of right temporal lobe following activation of the left post-central gyrus. Our results suggest that VT speech learning achieves integration with the auditory speech system by piggybacking onto corresponding auditory speech representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing adaptive coding of reward in bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deficits in neural processing of reward have been described in both bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), but it remains unclear to what extent these deficits are caused by similar mechanisms. Efficient reward processing relies on adaptive coding which allows representing large input spans by limited neuronal encoding ranges. Deficits in adaptive coding of reward have previously been observed across the SZ spectrum and correlated with total symptom severity. In the present work we sought to establish whether adaptive coding is similarly affected in patients with BD. Methods: 25 patients with BD, 27 patients with SZ and 25 healthy controls performed a variant of the Monetary Incentive Delay task during functional magnetic resonance imaging in two reward range conditions. Results: Adaptive coding was impaired in BD and SZ in the posterior part of the right caudate. In contrast, BD did not show impaired adaptive coding in the anterior caudate and right precentral gyrus/insula, where SZ showed deficits compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: BD patients show adaptive coding deficits, that are similar to those observed in SZ in the right posterior caudate. Adaptive coding in BD appeared more preserved as compared to SZ participants especially in the more anterior part of the right caudate and to a lesser extent also in the right precentral gyrus. Thus, dysfunctional adaptive coding could constitute a fundamental deficit in severe mental illnesses that extends beyond the schizophrenia spectrum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A data-informed mean-field approach to mapping of cortical parameter landscapes</a></h4>

              
                Constraining the many biological parameters that govern cortical dynamics is computationally and conceptually difficult because of the curse of dimensionality. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing (1) a novel data-informed mean-field (MF) approach to efficiently map the parameter space of network models; and (2) an organizing principle for studying parameter space that enables the extraction biologically meaningful relations from this high-dimensional data. We illustrate these ideas using a large-scale network model of the Macaque primary visual cortex. Of the 10-20 model parameters, we identify 7 that are especially poorly constrained, and use the MF algorithm in (1) to discover the firing rate contours in this 7D parameter cube. Defining a "biologically plausible" region to consist of parameters that exhibit spontaneous Excitatory and Inhibitory firing rates compatible with experimental values, we find that this region is a slightly thickened codimension-1 submanifold. An implication of this finding is that while plausible regimes depend sensitively on parameters, they are also robust and flexible provided one compensates appropriately when parameters are varied. Our organizing principle for conceptualizing parameter dependence is to focus on certain 2D parameter planes that govern lateral inhibition: Intersecting these planes with the biologically plausible region leads to very simple geometric structures which, when suitably scaled, have a universal character independent of where the intersections are taken. In addition to elucidating the geometry of the plausible region, this invariance suggests useful approximate scaling relations. Our study offers, for the first time, a complete characterization of the set of all biologically plausible parameters for a detailed cortical model, which has been out of reach due to the high dimensionality of parameter space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Biodegradable, Tacrolimus-releasing Nerve Wrap Promotes Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Axonal regeneration following nerve repair is slow and often incomplete, resulting in poor functional recovery and sometimes lifelong disability. Yet, there are no FDA-approved therapies available to promote nerve regeneration. Tacrolimus accelerates axonal regeneration, but systemic side-effects presently outweigh its potential benefits for peripheral nerve surgery. We have developed a biodegradable drug delivery system for the sustained local release of tacrolimus at the nerve repair site, with suitable properties for large-scale manufacturing and clinical application, aiming to promote axonal regeneration and functional recovery with minimal systemic drug exposure. Tacrolimus is encapsulated in polycarbonate-urethane nanofibers and electrospun to generate an implantable nerve wrap that releases therapeutic doses of bioactive tacrolimus over 31 days. Size and drug loading are adjustable for applications in small and large caliber nerves, and the wrap degrades within 120 days into biocompatible byproducts. Tacrolimus released from the nerve wrap promotes axon elongation in vitro and accelerates nerve regeneration and functional recovery in preclinical nerve repair models while systemic drug exposure is reduced by 80% compared to systemic delivery. Given its surgical suitability and preclinical efficacy and safety, this system may provide a readily translatable approach to support axonal regeneration and recovery in patients undergoing nerve surgery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrative multi-omics analyses reveal multi-modal FOXG1 functions acting on epigenetic processes and in concert with NEUROD1 to regulate synaptogenesis in the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Background: FOXG1 has important functions for neuronal differentiation and balances excitatory/inhibitory network activity. Mutations in the human FOXG1 gene cause a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, FOXG1-syndrome, which manifests differing phenotypes, including severe cognitive dysfunction, microencephaly, social withdrawal, and communication and memory deficits. Changes at the molecular level underlying these functional abnormalities upon FOXG1 haploinsufficiency are largely unexplored, in human patients as well as in animals modelling the debilitating disease. Methods: We present multi-omics data and explore comprehensively how FOXG1 impacts neuronal maturation at the chromatin level in the adult mouse hippocampus. We used RNA-, ATAC- and ChIP-sequencing of primary hippocampal neurons and co-immunoprecipitation to explore various levels of epigenetic changes and transcription factor networks acting to alter neuronal differentiation upon reduction of FOXG1. Results: We provide the first comprehensive multi-omics data set exploring FOXG1 presence at the chromatin and identifying the consequences of reduced FOXG1 expression in primary hippocampal neurons. Analyzing the multi-omics data, our study reveals that FOXG1 uses various different ways to regulate transcription at the chromatin level. On a genome-wide level, FOXG1 (i) both represses and activates transcription, (ii) binds mainly to enhancer regions, and (iii) bidirectionally alters the epigenetic landscape in regard to levels of H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and chromatin accessibility. Genes affected by the chromatin alterations upon FOXG1 reduction impact synaptogenesis and axonogenesis. This finding emphasizes the importance of FOXG1 to integrate and coordinate transcription of genes necessary for proper neuronal function by acting on a genome-wide level. Interestingly, FOXG1 acts through histone deacetylases (HDACs) and inhibition of HDACs partly rescued transcriptional alterations observed upon FOXG1 reduction. On a more detailed level of analysis, we show that FOXG1 (iv) operates synergistically with NEUROD1. Interestingly, we could not detect a clear hierarchy of these two key transcription factors, but instead provide first evidence that they act in highly concerted and orchestrated manner to control neuronal differentiation. Conclusions: This integrative and multi-omics view of changes upon FOXG1 reduction reveals an unprecedented multimodality ofFOXG1 functions converging on neuronal maturation, fueling novel therapeutic options based on epigenetic drugs to alleviate, at least in part, neuronal dysfunctions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humans, machines, and language: A deep alignment in underlying computational styles?</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of AI systems that emulate the remarkable human capacity for language has raised fundamental questions about complex cognition in humans and machines. This lively debate has largely taken place, however, in the absence of specific empirical evidence about how the internal operations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) relate to processes in the human brain as listeners speak and understand language. To directly evaluate these parallels, we extracted multi-level measures of word-by-word sentence interpretation from ANNs, and used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to test these against the representational geometries of real-time brain activity for the same sentences heard by human listeners. These uniquely spatiotemporally specific comparisons reveal deep commonalities in the use of multi-dimensional probabilistic constraints to drive incremental interpretation processes in both humans and machines. But at the same time they demonstrate profound differences in the underlying functional architectures that implement this shared algorithmic alignment.

	<p>Across all ages, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) experience high rates of sleep problems as well as cognitive impairments. This study sought to investigate whether circadian rhythm disruption was also experienced by people with DS and whether this kind of sleep disorder may be correlated with cognitive performance. A cross-sectional study of 101 participants (58 with DS, 43 with typical development) included individuals in middle childhood (6–10 years old), adolescence (11–18 years old), and young adulthood (19–26 years old). Sleep and markers of circadian timing and robustness were calculated using actigraphy. Cognitive and behavioral data were gathered via a novel touchscreen battery (A-MAPTM, Arizona Memory Assessment for Preschoolers and Special Populations) and parent questionnaire. Results indicated that children and adolescents with DS slept the same amount as peers with typical development, but significant group differences were seen in phase timing. The circadian robustness markers, interdaily stability and intradaily variability of sleep-wake rhythms, were healthiest for children regardless of diagnostic group and worst for adults with DS. Amplitude of the 24-h activity profile was elevated for all individuals with DS. In analyses of the correlations between sleep quality, rhythms, and cognition in people with DS, interdaily stability was positively correlated with reaction time and negatively correlated with verbal and scene recall, a finding that indicates increased stability may paradoxically correlate with poorer cognitive outcomes. Further, we found no relations with sleep efficiency previously found in preschool and adult samples. Therefore, the current findings suggest that a thorough examination of sleep disorders in DS must take into account age as well as circadian robustness to better understand sleep-cognitive correlations in this group.</p>

	<p>Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) commonly affects the production of lexical stress contrast in polysyllabic words. Automated classification tools have the potential to increase reliability and efficiency in measuring lexical stress. Here, factors affecting the accuracy of a custom-built deep neural network (DNN)-based classification tool are evaluated. Sixteen children with typical development (TD) and 26 with CAS produced 50 polysyllabic words. Words with strong–weak (SW, e.g., dinosaur) or WS (e.g., banana) stress were fed to the classification tool, and the accuracy measured (a) against expert judgment, (b) for speaker group, and (c) with/without prior knowledge of phonemic errors in the sample. The influence of segmental features and participant factors on tool accuracy was analysed. Linear mixed modelling showed significant interaction between group and stress type, surviving adjustment for age and CAS severity. For TD, agreement for SW and WS words was &amp;amp;gt;80%, but CAS speech was higher for SW (&amp;amp;gt;80%) than WS (~60%). Prior knowledge of segmental errors conferred no clear advantage. Automatic lexical stress classification shows promise for identifying errors in children’s speech at diagnosis or with treatment-related change, but accuracy for WS words in apraxic speech needs improvement. Further training of algorithms using larger sets of labelled data containing impaired speech and WS words may increase accuracy.</p>

	<p>Temporal and probability discounting are considered two fundamental constructs in economic science, as they are associated with phenomena with major societal impact and a variety of sub-optimal behaviors and clinical conditions. Although it is well known that positive and negative affective states bear important cognitive/behavioral consequences, the effect of emotional experiences on decision-making remains unclear due to the existence of many conflicting results. Inspired by the need to understand if and to what extent the current COVID-19 pandemic has determined changes in our decision-making processes by means of the unusual, prolonged experience of negative feelings, in this study we investigate the effect of anger, fear, sadness, physical and moral disgust on intertemporal and risky choices. Results show that all emotions significantly increase subjects’ preferences for immediate rewards over delayed ones, and for risky rewards over certain ones, in comparison to a “neutral emotion” condition, although the magnitude of the effect differs across emotions. In particular, we observed a more pronounced effect in the case of sadness and moral disgust. These findings contribute to the literature on emotions and decision-making by offering an alternative explanation to the traditional motivational appraisal theories. Specifically, we propose that the increased preference for immediate gratification and risky outcomes serves as a mechanism of self-reward aimed at down-regulating negative feelings and restore the individual’s “emotional balance”.</p>

	<p>Background: Many studies have confirmed headache as one of the most common COVID-19-related neurological symptoms. There are some reports concerning migraine attacks during SARS-CoV-2 infection with an unusual course of migraine attack. Our aim was to recognize and characterize accurately the features of headaches accompanying this disease. Methods: Research based on questionnaire study gathered 100 randomly chosen medical healthcare employees who experienced symptoms associated with COVID-19 disease, 96 with confirmed COVID-19 (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR laboratory test or positive rapid COVID-19 antigen test). Conclusion: Headaches reported in the study did not fulfill criteria for migraine with/without aura, tension-type headache according to ICHD-3.</p>

	<p>While recent advances in genetics make it possible to follow the genetic exchanges between populations and their phenotypic consequences, the impact of the genetic exchanges on the sensory perception of populations has yet to be explored. From this perspective, the present study investigated the consequences of African gene flow on odor perception in a Malagasy population with a predominantly East Asian genetic background. To this end, we combined psychophysical tests with genotype data of 235 individuals who were asked to smell the odorant molecule beta-ionone (βI). Results showed that in this population the ancestry of the OR5A1 gene significantly influences the ability to detect βI. At the individual level, African ancestry significantly protects against specific anosmia/hyposmia due to the higher frequency of the functional gene (OR ratios = 14, CI: 1.8–110, p-value = 0.012). At the population level, African introgression decreased the prevalence of specific anosmia/hyposmia to this odorous compound. Taken together, these findings validate the conjecture that in addition to cultural exchanges, genetic transfer may also influence the sensory perception of the population in contact.</p>

	<p>Due to its complexity and high variability in symptomology, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires a coordinated and multidisciplinary intervention to better support the different programs over time and to promote social interactions in all contexts of life. Telemedicine can offer a valuable contribution in this regard, providing low-cost and portable applications. In this paper, we presented an Italian project, SUPER, which aimed to foster collaboration and information sharing between ASD families, health services, and schools. SUPER provided a digital platform with several tools that were useful both to enhance general and specific ASD knowledge and to promote personalized programs for children with ASD. We conducted a preliminary user test for the platform with 30 participants (18 therapists and 12 parents of children with ASD) using the system usability scale (SUS). The total mean SUS score (89.2) showed that SUPER is an excellent, usable system. Moreover, we extracted the usability and learnability mean components from the SUS scores, which were 96.1 and 61.7, respectively. Our preliminary results indicate that SUPER is a very user-friendly application and its innovative telemedicine approach could be ahelpful communication and collaboration tool among the different contexts of care for children with ASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial coding in the hippocampus of flying owls</a></h4>

              
                The elucidation of spatial coding in the hippocampus requires exploring diverse animal species. While robust place-cells are found in the mammalian hippocampus, much less is known about spatial coding in the hippocampus of birds - and nothing is known about avian spatial representation during flight. Here we used a wireless-electrophysiology system to record single neurons in the hippocampus and related pallial structures from freely flying barn owls (Tyto alba) - a central-place nocturnal predator species with excellent navigational abilities. The owl 3D position was monitored while it flew back and forth between two perches. We found place cells - neurons that robustly represented the owls location during flight, and its flight-direction - as well as neurons that coded the owls perching position between flights. Spatial coding was invariant to changes in lighting conditions and to the position of a salient object in the room. Place cells were found in the anterior hippocampus and in the adjacent posterior hyperpallium apicale, and to a much lesser extent in the visual Wulst (visual-cortex homologue). The finding of place-cells in flying owls suggests commonalities in spatial coding across a variety of species - including rodents, bats and owls.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A transcriptomic axis predicts state modulation of cortical interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Transcriptomics has revealed the exquisite diversity of cortical inhibitory neurons, but it is not known whether these fine molecular subtypes have correspondingly diverse activity patterns in the living brain. Here, we show that inhibitory subtypes in primary visual cortex (V1) have diverse correlates with brain state, but that this diversity is organized by a single factor: position along their main axis of transcriptomic variation. We combined in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of mouse V1 with a novel transcriptomic method to identify mRNAs for 72 selected genes in ex vivo slices. We used transcriptomic clusters to classify inhibitory neurons imaged in layers 1-3 using a three-level hierarchy of 5 Families, 11 Classes, and 35 Subclasses. Visual responses differed significantly only across Families, but modulation by brain state differed at all three hierarchical levels. Nevertheless, this diversity could be predicted from the first transcriptomic principal component, which predicted a cell type's brain state modulation and correlations with simultaneously recorded cells. Inhibitory Subclasses with narrower spikes, lower input resistance, weaker adaptation, and less axon in layer 1 as determined in vitro fired more in resting, oscillatory brain states. Subclasses with the opposite properties fired more during arousal. The former cells had more inhibitory cholinergic receptors, and the latter more excitatory receptors. Thus, despite the diversity of V1 inhibitory neurons, a simple principle determines how their joint activity shapes state-dependent cortical processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible neural coding in sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices during goal-directed virtual navigation</a></h4>

              
                We do not understand how neural nodes operate within the recurrent action-perception loops that characterize naturalistic self-environment interactions, nor how brain networks reconfigure during changing computational demands. Here, we record local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity simultaneously from the dorsomedial superior temporal area (MSTd), parietal area 7a, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as monkeys navigate in virtual reality to catch fireflies. This task requires animals to actively sample from a closed-loop visual environment while concurrently computing latent variables: the evolving distance and angle to a memorized firefly. We observed mixed selectivity in all areas, with even a traditionally sensory area (MSTd) tracking latent variables. Strikingly, global encoding profiles and unit-to-unit coupling suggested a functional subnetwork between MSTd and dlPFC, and not between these are 7a, as anatomy would suggest. When sensory evidence was rendered scarce, lateral connectivity through neuron-to-neuron coupling within MSTd strengthened but its pattern remains fixed, while neuronal coupling adaptively remapped within 7a and dlPFC. The larger the remapping in 7a/dlPFC and the greater the stability within MSTd, the less was behavior impacted by loss of sensory evidence. These results highlight the distributed nature of neural coding during closed-loop action-perception naturalistic behaviors and suggest internal models may be housed in the pattern of fine-grain lateral connectivity within parietal and frontal cortices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal confidence for unaware visuomotor deviations</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have shown that humans can successfully correct deviations to ongoing movements without being aware of them, suggesting limited conscious monitoring of visuomotor performance. Here, we ask whether such limited monitoring impairs the capacity to judiciously place confidence ratings to reflect decision accuracy (metacognitive sensitivity). To this end, we recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging data while thirty-one participants reported visuomotor cursor deviations and rated their confidence retrospectively. We show that participants use a summary statistic of the unfolding visual feedback (the maximum cursor error) to detect deviations but that this information alone is insufficient to explain detection performance. The same summary statistics is used by participants to optimally adjust their confidence ratings, even for unaware deviations. At the neural level, activity in the ventral striatum tracked high confidence, whereas a broad network including the anterior prefrontal cortex encoded cursor error but not confidence, shedding new light on a role of the anterior prefrontal cortex for action monitoring rather than confidence. Together, our results challenge the notion of limited action monitoring and uncover a new mechanism by which humans optimally monitor their movements as they unfold, even when unaware of ongoing deviations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clostridioides difficile infection increases circulating p-cresol levels and dysregulates brain dopamine metabolism: linking gut-brain axis to autism and other neurologic disorders?</a></h4>

              
                Gastrointestinal illnesses are one of the most common comorbidities reported in patients with neurodevelopmental diseases, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Gut dysbiosis, overgrowth of C. difficile in the gut, and gut microbiota-associated alterations in central neurotransmission have been implicated in ASD, where the dopaminergic axis plays an important role in the disease pathogenesis. Human C. difficile strains produce a significant amount of the toxic metabolite p-cresol, an inhibitor of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), which catalyzes the conversion of dopamine (DA) to norepinephrine (NE). p-cresol is known to precipitate and exacerbate autistic behavior in rodents by increasing DA levels and altering DA receptor sensitivity in brain regions relevant to ASD. Therefore, we hypothesized that C. difficile infection dysregulates dopaminergic metabolism in the brain by increasing p-cresol levels in the gut and circulation and by inhibiting DBH, ultimately leading to elevated DA in the brain. For testing this hypothesis, we induced antibiotic-associated C. difficile in mice and determined the gut and serum p-cresol levels, serum DBH activity, and dopamine and its metabolite levels in different brain regions relevant to ASD. The results showed that C. difficile infection causes significant alterations in the dopaminergic axis in mice (p < 0.05). In addition, significantly increased circulating p-cresol levels and reduced DBH activity was observed in C. difficile infected animals (p < 0.05). Therefore, the results from this study suggest a potential link between C. difficile infection and alterations in the dopaminergic axis implicated in the precipitation and aggravation of ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generating accurate 3D gaze vectors using synchronized eye tracking and motion capture</a></h4>

              
                Assessing gaze behaviour during real-world tasks is difficult; dynamic bodies moving through dynamic worlds make finding gaze fixations challenging. Current approaches involve laborious coding of pupil positions overlaid on video. One solution is to combine eye tracking with motion tracking to generate 3D gaze vectors. When combined with tracked or known object locations, fixation detection can be automated. Here we use combined eye and motion tracking and explore how linear regression models generate accurate 3D gaze vectors. We compare spatial accuracy of models derived from four short calibration routines across three data types: the performance of calibration routines were assessed using calibration data, a validation task that demands short fixations on task-relevant locations, and an object interaction task we used to bridge the gap between laboratory and "in the wild" studies. Further, we generated and compared models using spherical and cartesian coordinate systems and monocular (Left or Right) or binocular data. Our results suggest that all calibration routines perform similarly, with the best performance (i.e., sub-centimeter errors) coming from the task (i.e., the most "natural") trials when the participant is looking at an object in front of them. Further, we found that spherical coordinate systems generate more accurate gaze vectors with no differences in accuracy when using monocular or binocular data. Overall, we recommend recording one-minute calibration datasets, using a binocular eye tracking headset (for redundancy), a spherical coordinate system when depth is not considered, and ensuring data quality (i.e., tracker positioning) is high when recording datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Listening Zone of Human Electrocorticographic Field Potential Recordings</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) recordings provide invaluable insights into neural dynamics in humans due to their unmatched spatiotemporal resolution. Yet, such recordings reflect the combined activity of multiple underlying generators, confounding the ability to resolve spatially distinct neural sources. To empirically quantify the listening zone of icEEG recordings, we computed the correlations between signals as a function of distance (expressed as full width at half maximum; FWHM) between 8,752 recording sites in 71 patients implanted with either subdural electrodes (SDE), stereo-encephalography electrodes (sEEG), or high-density sEEG electrodes. As expected, for both SDE and sEEG electrodes, higher frequency signals exhibited a sharper fall off relative to lower frequency signals. For broadband high gamma (BHG) activity, the mean FWHM of SDEs (6.6 {+/-} 2.5 mm) and sEEGs in gray matter (7.14 {+/-} 1.7 mm) was not significantly different, however the FWHM for low frequencies recorded by sEEGs was 2.45 mm smaller than SDEs. White matter sEEG electrodes showed much lower power for frequencies 17 to 200 Hz (q < 0.01) and a much broader decay (11.3 {+/-} 3.2 mm) than gray matter electrodes (7.14 {+/-} 1.7 mm). The use of a bipolar referencing scheme significantly lowered FWHM for sEEG electrodes, as compared with a white matter reference or a common average reference. These results outline the influence of array design, spectral bands, and referencing schema on local field potential recordings and source localization in icEEG recordings in humans. The metrics we derive have immediate relevance to the analysis and interpretation of both cognitive and epileptic data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Unsupervised Machine Learning Paradigm for Artifact Removal from Electrodermal Activity in an Uncontrolled Clinical Setting</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Electrodermal activity (EDA) reflects sympathetic nervous system activity through sweating-related changes in skin conductance. To enable EDA data to be used robustly in clinical settings, we need to develop artifact detection and removal frameworks that can handle the types of interference experienced in clinical settings. Methods: We collected EDA data from 69 subjects while they were undergoing surgery in the operating room. We then built an artifact removal framework using unsupervised learning methods and informed features to remove the heavy artifact that resulted from the use of surgical electrocautery during the surgery and compared it to other existing methods for artifact removal from EDA data. Results: Our framework was able to remove the vast majority of artifact from the EDA data across all subjects with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (90%). In contrast, existing methods used for comparison struggled to be sufficiently sensitive and specific, and none effectively removed artifact even if it was identifiable. In addition, the use of unsupervised learning methods in our framework removes the need for manually labeled datasets for training. Conclusion: Our framework allows for robust removal of heavy artifact from EDA data in clinical settings such as surgery. Since this framework only relies on a small set of informed features, it can be expanded to other modalities such as ECG and EEG. Significance: Robust artifact removal from EDA data is the first step to enable clinical integration of EDA as part of standard monitoring in settings such as the operating room.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fatigue induces behavioural improvements in the unfatigued hand via altered functional connectivity and neurochemicals in cortical motor areas</a></h4>

              
                In humans, motor learning is underpinned by changes in functional connectivity (FC) across the sensorimotor network. Unilateral exercise-induced fatigue increases FC in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA); areas involved in motor planning and execution of the contralateral hand. Unilateral fatiguing exercise is therefore a promising potential approach to augment motor performance in the non-fatigued, contralateral, hand. In a within-participant, controlled, randomized, cross-over design, 15 right-handed adults had two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions, where functional MRI and MR Spectroscopic Imaging were acquired before and after repeated right-hand contractions at either 5% or 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Before and after scanning, response times (RTs) were determined in both hands, and after scanning, participants performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their left, unfatigued, hand. Nine minutes of 50% MVC contractions resulted in fatigue. This unimanual fatigue improved motor performance, as indexed by decreased RTs, in the contralateral hand. Although fatigue had no significant effects on sequence learning, fatigue led to a significant increase in the transfer of the learned skill to the untrained hand. These behavioural effects were supported by significant neural changes: an increase in SMA-SMA functional connectivity, and increased connectivity between right M1 and right Orbitofrontal Cortex. At a neurochemical level, the degree of fatigue-induced decrease in GABA in left M1, left and right SMA correlated with subsequent behavioural improvements in the left-hand. These results support unilateral fatiguing exercise as a potential therapeutic intervention in a range of neurological and orthopedic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">E-Cannula reveals anatomical diversity in sharp-wave ripples as a driver for the recruitment of distinct hippocampal assemblies</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial navigation and episodic memory. However, research on in vivo hippocampal activity dynamics has mostly relied on single modalities such as electrical recordings or optical imaging, with respectively limited spatial and temporal resolution. This technical difficulty greatly impedes multi-level investigations into network state-related changes in cellular activity. To overcome these limitations, we developed the E-Cannula integrating fully transparent graphene microelectrodes with imaging-cannula. The E-Cannula enables the simultaneous electrical recording and two-photon calcium imaging from the exact same population of neurons across an anatomically extended region of the mouse hippocampal CA1 stably across several days. These large-scale simultaneous optical and electrical recordings showed that local hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) are associated with synchronous calcium events involving large neural populations in CA1. We show that SWRs exhibit spatiotemporal wave patterns along multiple axes in 2D space with different spatial extents (local or global) and temporal propagation modes (stationary or travelling). Notably, distinct SWR wave patterns were associated with, and decoded from, the selective recruitment of orthogonal CA1 cell assemblies. These results suggest that the diversity in the anatomical progression of SWRs may serve as a mechanism for the selective activation of the unique hippocampal cell assemblies extensively implicated in the encoding of distinct memories. Through these results we demonstrate the utility of the E-Cannula as a versatile neurotechnology with the potential for future integration with other optical components such as green lenses, fibers or prisms enabling the multi-modal investigation of cross-time scale population-level neural dynamics across brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding individualized motor cortical excitability states from whole-brain electroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                OBJECTIVE: Brain state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) requires real-time identification of cortical excitability states. Here, we aimed to identify individualized, subject-specific motor cortex (M1) excitability states from whole-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals. METHODS: We analyzed a pre-existing dataset that delivered 600 single TMS pulses to the right M1 during EEG and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Subject-specific multivariate pattern classification was used to discriminate between brain states during which TMS elicited small or large motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). RESULTS: Classifiers trained at the individual subject level successfully discriminated between low and high M1 excitability states. MEPs elicited during classifier-predicted high excitability states were significantly larger than those elicited during classifier-predicted low excitability states. Classifiers trained on subject-specific data obtained immediately before TMS delivery performed better than classifiers trained on data from earlier time points, and subject-specific classifiers generalized weakly but significantly across subjects. CONCLUSION: Decoding individualized M1 excitability states from whole-brain EEG activity is feasible and robust. SIGNIFICANCE: Deploying subject-specific classifiers during brain state-dependent TMS may enable effective, fully individualized neuromodulation in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distribution of multi-unit pitch responses recorded intracranially from human auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The perception of pitch requires the abstraction of stimulus properties related to the spectrotemporal structure of sound. Previous studies utilizing both animal electrophysiology and human imaging have indicated the presence of a center for pitch representation in the auditory cortex. Recent data from our own group - examining local field potentials (LFPs) in humans - indicate more widely distributed pitch-associated responses within the auditory cortex (Gander et al., 2019). To probe this with greater spatial resolution, we examined multi-unit activity related to three different auditory stimuli, in seven epilepsy patients who were implanted with high-impedance electrodes in auditory cortex for the clinical purpose of localizing seizures. The stimuli were regular-interval noise (RIN) with a pitch strength that is related to the temporal regularity, and pitch value determined by repetition rate, and harmonic complexes with missing fundamentals. We demonstrated increases in spiking activity in 69 of 104 (66%) responsive multi-unit activity in auditory cortex due to pitch-associated stimuli. Importantly, these responses were distributed across the entire extent of Heschl's gyrus (HG), in both primary and non-primary areas, rather than isolated to a specific region, and this finding was evident regardless of the stimulus presented. These findings are the first multi-unit pitch responses recorded from humans, and align with a recent study in macaques (Kikuchi et al., 2019) demonstrating that both local field potential and unit responses to pitch-inducing stimuli are distributed throughout auditory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual occipito-temporal sensitivity to digits through elementary school</a></h4>

              
                Number processing abilities are important for academic and personal development. The course of initial specialization of ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC) for visual number processing is crucial for the development of numeric and arithmetic skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of vOTC activations across five time points in kindergarten (T1), middle and end of first grade (T2, T3), second (T4) and fifth grade (T5). 62 children (35 female) performed a target detection task which included visual presentation of digits, false fonts, and letters. Arithmetic skills were measured at T4 and T5 with standardized math tests. Stronger N1 amplitudes for digits than false fonts were found across all 5 measurements. Arithmetic skills correlated negatively with visual N1 sensitivity to digits at T4 (2nd grade, mean age 8.3 yrs) over the left hemisphere, possibly reflecting allocation of more attentional or cognitive resources with poorer arithmetic skills. Our main result shows persistent visual N1 sensitivity to digits that is already present early on in pre-school and remains stable until fifth grade. This differs from the relatively sharp rise and fall of the visual N1 sensitivity to words or letters between kindergarten and middle of elementary school. The present study thus indicates different trajectories in the development of visual processing for written characters that are relevant to numeracy and literacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of the Relationship between Task Related Hemodynamic Responses and Neuronal Excitability: a Simultaneous fNIRS/TMS Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Investigating the relationship between task-related cortical hemodynamic activity and brain excitability is challenging because it requires simultaneous measurement of brain hemodynamic activity while applying non-invasive brain stimulation. There is also considerable inter-/intra-subject variability which both brain excitability and task-related hemodynamic responses are associated with. Here we proposed hierarchical Bayesian modeling to taking into account variability in the data at the individual and group levels, aiming to provide accurate and reliable statistical inferences on this research question. Methods: We performed a study on 16 healthy subjects with simultaneous Paired Associative Stimulation (Inhibitory PAS10, Excitatory PAS25, Sham) and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) targeting the primary motor cortex (M1). PAS was applied to modulate the cortical function and induce plasticity. Before and after each intervention cortical excitability was measured by motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and the motor task-related hemodynamic response was measured using fNIRS. We constructed three models to encode 1) PAS effects on the M1 excitability; 2) PAS effects on the whole-time course of fNIRS hemodynamic responses to finger tapping tasks, and 3) the correlation between PAS effects on M1 excitability and PAS effects on task-related hemodynamic responses. Results: Significant increase of the cortical excitability was found after PAS25, whereas a small reduction of the cortical excitability was shown after PAS10 and no changes after sham. We found PAS effects on finger tapping evoked HbO/HbR within M1, around the peak of the hemodynamic time courses. Both HbO and HbR absolute amplitudes increased after PAS25 and decreased after PAS10. Cortical excitability changes and task-related HbO/HbR changes showed a high probability of being positively correlated, 0.77 and 0.79, respectively. The corresponding Pearson correlations were 0.58 (p<.0001, HbO with MEP) and 0.56 (p<.001, HbR with MEP), respectively. Conclusion: Benefiting from this original Bayesian data analysis, our results showed that PAS modulates task-related cortical hemodynamic responses in addition to M1 excitability. The fact that PAS effects on hemodynamic response were exhibited mainly around the peak of the hemodynamic time course may indicate that the intervention only increases metabolic demanding rather than modulating hemodynamic response function per se. Moreover, the positive correlation between PAS modulations of excitability and hemodynamic brings insights to understand the fundamental properties of cortical function and cortical excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tickle contagion in the somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The cellular mechanisms of emotional contagion are unknown. We investigated tickle contagion and the underlying neuronal representations in rats. We recorded trunk somatosensory cortex activity of observer rats while they received tickling, audio-visual playback of tickling footage, and while they witnessed tickling of demonstrator rats. Observers vocalized, and showed "Freudenspruenge" ("joy jumps") during witnessing live tickling, while they showed little behavioral responses to playbacks. A fraction of trunk somatosensory neurons responded to both direct and witnessed tickling in action-specific manner. The correlation between direct and witnessed tickling responses increased towards deeper cortical layers. Tickle-mirror neurons but not non-mirror neurons discharged prior to and during vocalizations and hence might drive contagious 'laughter'. We conclude that trunk somatosensory cortex represents mirrored ticklishness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal single-cell transcriptional dynamics throughout neurodegeneration in SCA1</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegeneration is a protracted process involving progressive changes in myriad cell types that ultimately result in neuronal death. Changes in vulnerable neuronal populations are highly influenced by concomitant changes in surrounding cells, complicating experimental approaches to interrogate the simultaneous events that underlie neurodegeneration. To dissect how individual cell types within a heterogeneous tissue contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of a neurodegenerative disorder, we performed longitudinal single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the mouse and human spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cerebellum, establishing continuous dynamic trajectories of each population. Furthermore, we defined the precise transcriptional changes that precede loss of Purkinje cells and identified early oligodendroglial impairments that can profoundly impact cerebellar function. Finally, we applied a deep learning method to accurately predict disease state and identify drivers of disease. Together, this work uncovers new roles for diverse cerebellar cell types in SCA1 and provides a generalizable analysis framework for studying neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin reduces interoceptive influences on empathy-for-pain in the anterior insula</a></h4>

              
                Empathy-for-pain states are underpinned by interoception, i.e the central representation of internal states. Cardiac signals occur in a phasic manner; baroreceptor discharges at systole communicate the heartbeats' strength. These signals modulate pain and emotion processing. We tested whether these phasic interoceptive signals modulate empathy-for-pain. As oxytocin (OT) enhances empathy and modulates interoceptive signals' precision, we also tested if OT administration impacts empathy-for-pain via interoceptive mechanisms. Male subjects (N=32) attended three sessions to perform psychometric tests and an fMRI empathy-for-pain task, after intranasal administration of OT or placebo (40IU). Pictures of hands in painful or non-painful context were presented at systole or diastole. Effects of drug, emotion and cardiac timing on behaviour and brain activity was tested using general and mixed-effects linear models. Across conditions, activation was observed within regions implicated in pain and empathy-for-pain, with insula activation greater in the right than left hemisphere. OT administration, compared to placebo, attenuated the reactivity of some regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, but presentation of stimuli at systole blocked the OT attenuating effect. Our data suggest that OT alters the processing of motivationally-salient social cues, interacting with interoceptive signals. Our findings may inform targeted use of OT in psychiatric conditions linked to aberrant interoceptive processing.

	<p>We examined whether word processing is associated with subjective self-evaluation of cognition in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) as a function of their depressive symptoms. MTLE patients with (MTLE +d, N = 28) or without (MTLE -d, N = 11) depression were compared to pair-matched healthy control participants on free recall and self-relevance ratings of emotionally valenced words. Correlation and hierarchical analyses were conducted to investigate whether the subjective self-evaluation of cognition in MTLE patients is predicted by the negative emotional bias reflected in task performance. MTLE +d patients endorsed as self-relevant fewer positive words and more negative words than the MTLE -d patients and healthy participants. They also self-evaluated their cognition poorer than the MTLE -d patients. Analyses indicated that recall and self-endorsement of emotional words predicted both self-evaluation of cognition as well as epilepsy duration. Our findings indicate that negative self-relevance emotional bias is observed in MTLE patients and is predictive of subjective self-evaluation of cognition. Application of brief behavioral tasks probing emotional functions could be valuable for clinical research and practice in the patients with MTLE.</p>

	<p>Background: Cataract is one of the most common age-related vision deteriorations, leading to opacification of the lens and therefore visual impairment as well as blindness. Both cataract extraction and the implantation of blue light filtering lens are believed to improve not only vision but also overall functioning. Methods: Thirty-four cataract patients were subject to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation (IOL). Global and local graph metrics were calculated in order to investigate the reorganization of functional network architecture associated with alterations in blue light transmittance. Psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) was conducted. Results: Graph theory-based analysis revealed decreased eigenvector centrality after the cataract extraction and IOL replacement in inferior occipital gyrus, superior parietal gyrus and many cerebellum regions as well as increased clustering coefficient in superior and inferior parietal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and various cerebellum regions. PVT results revealed significant change between experimental sessions as patients responded faster after IOL replacement. Moreover, a few regions were correlated with the difference in blue light transmittance and the time reaction in PVT. Conclusion: Current study revealed substantial functional network architecture reorganization associated with cataract extraction and alteration in blue light transmittance.</p>

	<p>Balance training interventions over several months have been shown to improve spatial cognitive functions and to induce structural plasticity in brain regions associated with visual-vestibular self-motion processing. In the present cross-sectional study, we tested whether long-term balance practice is associated with better spatial cognition. To this end, spatial perspective-taking abilities were compared between balance experts (n = 40) practicing sports such as gymnastics, acrobatics or slacklining for at least four hours a week for the last two years, endurance athletes (n = 38) and sedentary healthy individuals (n = 58). The balance group showed better performance in a dynamic balance task compared to both the endurance group and the sedentary group. Furthermore, the balance group outperformed the sedentary group in a spatial perspective-taking task. A regression analysis across all participants revealed a positive association between individual balance performance and spatial perspective-taking abilities. Groups did not differ in executive functions, and individual balance performance did not correlate with executive functions, suggesting a specific association between balance skills and spatial cognition. The results are in line with theories of embodied cognition, assuming that sensorimotor experience shapes cognitive functions.</p>

	<p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in investigating the effect of specific pharmacological treatments for ADHD not only on its core symptoms, but also on social skills in youths. This stands especially true for ADHD patients displaying impulsive aggressiveness and antisocial behaviors, being the comorbidity with Disruptive Behavior Disorders, one of the most frequently observed in clinical settings. This systematic review aimed to synthesize research findings on this topic following PRISMA guidelines and to identify gaps in current knowledge, future directions, and treatment implications. Search strategies included the following terms: ADHD; methylphenidate and other ADHD drugs; empathy, theory of mind and emotion recognition. Full-text articles were retrieved and data from individual studies were collected. Thirteen studies were finally included in our systematic review. Ten studies assessing changes in empathy and/or theory of mind in patients with ADHD treated after pharmacological interventions were identified. Similarly, seven partially overlapping studies assessing changes in emotion recognition were retrieved. Despite a great heterogeneity in the methodological characteristics of the included studies, most of them reported an improvement in emphatic and theory of mind abilities in youths with ADHD treated with psychostimulants and nonstimulant drugs, as well as positive but less consistent results about emotion recognition performances.</p>

	<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-chromosome-linked dominant genetic disorder that causes a variable degree of cognitive dysfunction and developmental disability. Current treatment is symptomatic and no existing medications target the specific cause of FXS. As with other X-linked disorders, FXS manifests differently in males and females, including abnormalities in the dopamine system that are also seen in Fmr1-knockout (KO) mice. We investigated sex differences in dopamine signaling in Fmr1-KO mice in response to L-stepholidine, a dopamine D1 receptor agonist and D2 receptor antagonist. We found significant sex differences in basal levels of phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β in wild type mice that were absent in Fmr1-KO mice. In wild-type mice, L-stepholidine increased p-PKA in males but not female mice, decreased p-GSK-3 in female mice and increased p-GSK-3 in male mice. Conversely, in Fmr1-KO mice, L-stepholidine increased p-PKA and p-GSK-3β in females, and decreased p-PKA and p-GSK-3β in males.</p>

	<p>Educational theory claims that integrating learning style into learning-related activities can improve academic performance. Traditional methods to recognize learning styles are mostly based on questionnaires and online behavior analyses. These methods are highly subjective and inaccurate in terms of recognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have significant potential for use in the measurement of learning style. This study uses EEG signals to design a deep-learning-based model of recognition to recognize people’s learning styles with EEG features by using a non-overlapping sliding window, one-dimensional spatio-temporal convolutions, multi-scale feature extraction, global average pooling, and the group voting mechanism; this model is named the TSMG model (Temporal-Spatial-Multiscale-Global model). It solves the problem of processing EEG data of variable length, and improves the accuracy of recognition of the learning style by nearly 5% compared with prevalent methods, while reducing the cost of calculation by 41.93%. The proposed TSMG model can also recognize variable-length data in other fields. The authors also formulated a dataset of EEG signals (called the LSEEG dataset) containing features of the learning style processing dimension that can be used to test and compare models of recognition. This dataset is also conducive to the application and further development of EEG technology to recognize people’s learning styles.</p>

	<p>Several electrical stimulation patterns of the auditory nerve have been described for tinnitus relief, but there is no consensus on the most effective stimulation pattern. Therefore, we aim to systematically review the literature on the effect of intra- and extracochlear electrical stimulation patterns as a treatment option for patients with tinnitus. Only studies on intra- and extracochlear electrical stimulation for patients with tinnitus were included if the stimulation used did not concern standardized CI stimulation patterns to primarily rehabilitate hearing loss as intervention. A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 10 studies (89 patients) on intracochlear electrical stimulation and 25 studies on extracochlear electrical stimulation (1109 patients). There was a high to medium risk of bias in 22 studies, especially due to lack of a non-exposed group and poor selection of the exposed group. All included studies showed subjective tinnitus improvement during or after electrical stimulation, using different stimulation patterns. Due to methodological limitations and low reporting quality of the included studies, the potential of intra- and extracochlear stimulation has not been fully explored. To draw conclusions on which stimulation patterns should be optimized for tinnitus relief, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in tinnitus suppression is needed.</p>

	<p>The present study investigated whether, as in adults, 7-month-old infants’ sensorimotor brain areas are recruited in response to the observation of emotional facial expressions. Activity of the sensorimotor cortex, as indexed by µ rhythm suppression, was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) while infants observed neutral, angry, and happy facial expressions either in a static (N = 19) or dynamic (N = 19) condition. Graph theory analysis was used to investigate to which extent neural activity was functionally localized in specific cortical areas. Happy facial expressions elicited greater sensorimotor activation compared to angry faces in the dynamic experimental condition, while no difference was found between the three expressions in the static condition. Results also revealed that happy but not angry nor neutral expressions elicited a significant right-lateralized activation in the dynamic condition. Furthermore, dynamic emotional faces generated more efficient processing as they elicited higher global efficiency and lower networks’ diameter compared to static faces. Overall, current results suggest that, contrarily to neutral and angry faces, happy expressions elicit sensorimotor activity at 7 months and dynamic emotional faces are more efficiently processed by functional brain networks. Finally, current data provide evidence of the existence of a right-lateralized activity for the processing of happy facial expressions.</p>

     alt="Characterization and manipulation of Corticothalamic neurons in associative cortices using Syt6-Cre transgenic mice"/>
<p>Our work highlights the potential of the Syt6-Cre transgenic mouse line to effectively target Corticothalamic neurons in the associative cortices. This detailed study describes and tests the utility of the system, laying the foundation for its implementation as a new tool to study corticothalamic interactions between frontal and medial associative areas, thalamic nuclei, and the contribution of these interactions to higher cognitive functions.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticothalamic interactions between associative cortices and higher order thalamic nuclei are involved in high-cognitive functions such as decision-making and working memory. Corticothalamic neurons (CTn) in the prefrontal cortex and other associative areas have been much less studied than their counterparts in the primary sensory areas. The availability of characterized transgenic tools to study CTn in associative areas will facilitate their study and contribute to overcome the scarcity of data about their properties, network dynamics, and contribution to cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the Syt6-Cre (KI148Gsat/Mmud) transgenic mouse line, by tracking expression of a Cre-mediated reporter. In this line, Cre-reporter is strongly expressed in the prefrontal, motor, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in other brain areas including the cerebellum and the olfactory tubercle. Cortical expression starts embryonically and reaches the adult expression pattern by postnatal day 15. In the cortex, Cre-reporter is expressed by layer 6-CTn and by layer 5-CTn to a lesser extent. We quantified Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> CTn axon varicosities to estimate the distribution and density of putative corticothalamic driver and modulator inputs to thalamic nuclei in the medial, midline, intralaminar, anterior, and motor groups. Also, we characterized the effect of optogenetic stimulation of Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons in the activity of the prefrontal cortex. CTn stimulation in the prefrontal cortex induces an oscillatory activity in the local field potential that resembles the cortical downstates typically observed during slow-wave sleep or quiet wake.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes lifelong neurologic disability. Despite the use of therapeutic hypothermia, memory deficits and executive functions remain severely affected. Cholinergic neurotransmission from the basal forebrain to neocortex and hippocampus is central to higher cortical functions. We examined the basal forebrain by light microscopy and report loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT)+ neurons, at postnatal day (P) 40, in the ipsilateral medial septal nucleus (MSN) after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in mice. There was no loss of ChAT+ neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and striatum. Ipsilateral striatal and nbM ChAT+ neurons were abnormal with altered immunoreactivity for ChAT, shrunken and crenated somas, and dysmorphic appearing dendrites. Using confocal images with 3D reconstruction, nbM ChAT+ dendrites in HI mice were shorter than sham (p = 0.0001). Loss of ChAT+ neurons in the MSN directly correlated with loss of ipsilateral hippocampal area. In the nbM and striatum, percentage of abnormal ChAT+ neurons correlated with loss of ipsilateral cerebral cortical and striatal area, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increased in adjacent ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the increase was linearly related to loss of cortical and hippocampal area. Numbers and size of cathepsin D+ lysosomes increased in large neurons in the ipsilateral nbM. After neonatal HI, abnormalities were found throughout the major cholinergic systems in relationship to amount of forebrain area loss. There was also an upregulation of cathepsin D+ particles within the nbM. Cholinergic neuropathology may underlie the permanent dysfunction in learning, memory, and executive function after neonatal brain injury.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/62ed6c2d-ab9d-45f2-aeb6-e635ba50d90c/cne25258-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Satb1 expression in retinal ganglion cells of marmosets, macaques, and humans"/>
<p>Satb1 expressing cells make up a subpopulation of ganglion cells in the retinas of marmosets, macaques, and humans. They comprise different morphological cell types and in marmoset include the recursive bistratified cell, which is a candidate for the on-off direction-selective ganglion cell.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the molecular distinction of ganglion cell populations in mammalian retinas. Here we used antibodies against the transcription factor special AT-rich binding protein 1 (Satb1, a protein which is expressed by on-off direction-selective ganglion cells in mouse retina) to study Satb1 expression in the retina of marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>), and humans. In all species, Satb1 was exclusively expressed in retinal ganglion cells. The Satb1 cells made up ∼2% of the ganglion cell population in the central retina of all species, rising to a maximum ∼7% in peripheral marmoset retina. Intracellular injections in marmoset and macaque retinas revealed that most Satb1 expressing ganglion cells are widefield ganglion cells. In marmoset, Satb1 cells have a densely branching dendritic tree and include broad and narrow thorny, recursive bistratified, and parasol cells, all of which show some costratification with the outer or inner cholinergic amacrine cells. The recursive bistratified cells showed the strongest costratification but did not show extensive cofasciculation as reported for on-off direction-selective ganglion cells in rabbit and rodent retinas. In macaque, Satb1 was not expressed in recursive bistratified cells, but in large sparsely branching cells. Our findings further support the idea that the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World (human and macaque) and New World (marmoset) primates and provides a further step to link a molecular marker with specific cell types.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">COVID‐19 vaccine response in people with multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the effect of disease modifying therapies on immune response to SARS-CoV2 vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>473 people with multiple sclerosis provided one or more dried blood spot samples. Information about COVID-19 and vaccine history, medical and drug history were extracted from questionnaires and medical records. Dried blood spots were eluted and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV2. Antibody titres were partitioned into tertiles with people on no disease modifying therapy as a reference. We calculated the odds ratio of seroconversion (univariate logistic regression) and compared quantitative vaccine response (Kruskal Wallis) following SARS-CoV2 vaccine according to disease modifying therapy. We used regression modelling to explore the effect of vaccine timing, treatment duration, age, vaccine type and lymphocyte count on vaccine response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio 0.03; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.06, p&lt;0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio 0.04; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following SARS-CoV2 vaccine. All other drugs did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Both time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly associated with response to vaccination. Vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. Preliminary data on cellular T-cell immunity showed 40% of seronegative subjects had measurable anti-SARS-CoV2 T cell responses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some disease modifying therapies convey risk of attenuated serological response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and affective disorders are frequently comorbid and share underlying mechanisms that could be targets for comprehensive treatment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has high comorbidity with AUD, but comprehensive models of this overlap are nascent. We recently characterized a model of comorbid AUD and PTSD-like symptoms, wherein stressed rats receive an inhibitory avoidance (IA)-related footshock on two occasions followed by two-bottle choice (2BC) voluntary alcohol drinking. Stressed rats received the second footshock in a familiar (FAM, same IA box as the first footshock) or novel context (NOV, single-chambered apparatus); the FAM paradigm more effectively increased alcohol drinking in males and the NOV paradigm in females. During abstinence, stressed males displayed avoidance-like PTSD symptoms, and females showed hyperarousal-like PTSD symptoms. Rats in the model had altered spontaneous action potential-independent GABAergic transmission in the central amygdala (CeA), a brain region key in alcohol dependence and stress-related signaling. However, PTSD sufferers may have alcohol experience prior to their trauma. Here, we therefore modified our AUD/PTSD comorbidity model to provide 3 weeks of intermittent extended alcohol access before footshock and then studied the effects of NOV and FAM stress on drinking and PTSD phenotypes. NOV stress suppressed the escalation of alcohol intake and preference seen in male controls, but no stress effects were seen on drinking in females. Additionally, NOV males had decreased action potential-independent presynaptic GABA release and delayed postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor kinetics in the CeA compared to control and FAM males. Despite these changes to alcohol intake and CeA GABA signaling, stressed rats showed broadly similar anxiogenic-like behaviors to our previous comorbid model, suggesting decoupling of the PTSD symptoms from the AUD vulnerability for some of these animals. The collective results show the importance of alcohol history and trauma context in vulnerability to comorbid AUD/PTSD-like symptoms.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper introduces a special issue focused on sex and gender (s/g) cognitive/behavioral differences at developmental ages providing an overview of this multifaceted and debated topic. It will provide a description of the biological systems that are strongly interconnected to generate s/g differences, that is, genetic determinants, sex hormones, differences in brain structure, organization, and/or function, inherited or modifiable under environmental pressures. Developmental studies are rare. Some addressed whether s/g differences in cognitive/behavioral characteristics are evident early in life and are consistent throughout development, entailing that s/g differences can follow the evolving steps in girls and boys in different domains. The data are far from being homogeneous and consistent about s/g difference in language, social skills, and visuo/spatial abilities. The differences are small, often with overlapping performances, similar to what is seen in adulthood. Given that several variables and the interactions between them are implicated, further longitudinal studies adopting adequate assessment tools, very large size multicultural samples stratified in different, well-sized and precise age groups, considering biological and sociocultural variables, are needed. Due to the complexity of the issue, there is still the need to support and adopt an s/g difference approach also in cognitive and behavioral studies at developmental ages. Finally, these studies have not only scientific importance and relevant cultural, anthropological, and social implications, but are also useful for pedagogical programming as well as for the study of the different susceptibility to develop CNS diseases and consequently to promote different therapies and treatments.</p>

                Alcohol use produces wide-ranging and diverse effects on the central nervous system. It influences intracellular signaling mechanisms, leading to changes in gene expression, chromatin remodeling, and translation. As a result of these molecular alterations, alcohol affects the activity of neuronal circuits. Together, these mechanisms produce long-lasting cellular adaptations in the brain that in turn can drive the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorder (AUD). We provide an update on alcohol research, focusing on multiple levels of alcohol-induced adaptations, from intracellular changes to changes in neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The many layers of BOLD. On the contribution of different vascular compartments to laminar fMRI.</a></h4>

              
                Ultra-high field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offers the spatial resolution to measure neural activity at the scale of cortical layers. Most fMRI studies make use of the Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, arising from a complex interaction of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV), and venous oxygenation. However, along with cyto- and myeloarchitectural changes across cortical depth, laminar fMRI is confronted with additional confounds related to vascularization differences that exist across cortical depth. In the current study, we quantify how the non-uniform distribution of macro- and micro-vascular compartments, as measured with Gradient-Echo (GE) and Spin-Echo (SE) scan sequences, respectively, affect laminar BOLD fMRI responses following evoked hypercapnic and hyperoxic breathing conditions. We find that both macro- and micro-vascular compartments are capable of comparable theoretical maximum signal intensities, as represented by the M-scaling parameter. However, the capacity for vessel dilation, as reflected by the cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), is approximately three times larger for the macro- compared to the micro-vasculature at superficial layers. Finally, there is roughly a 35% difference in CBV estimates between the macro- and micro-vascular compartments, although this relative difference is approximately uniform across cortical depth.

                The multilayer dynamic network model has been proposed as an effective method to understand how the brain functions dynamically. Specially, derived from the definition of clustering coefficient in static networks, the temporal clustering coefficient provides a direct measure of topological stability of dynamic brain networks and shows potential in predicting altered brain functions in both normal and pathological conditions. However, test-retest reliability and demographic-related effects on this measure remain to be evaluated. Using a publicly available dataset from the Human Connectome Project consisting of 337 young healthy adults (157 males/180 females; 22 to 37 years old), the present study investigated: (1) the test-retest reliability of temporal clustering coefficient across four repeated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); and (2) sex- and age-related effects on temporal clustering coefficient. The results showed that (1) the temporal clustering coefficient had overall moderate test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.40 over a wide range of densities) at both global and subnetwork levels; (2) female subjects showed significantly higher temporal clustering coefficient than males at both global and subnetwork levels, in particular within the default-mode and subcortical regions; (3) temporal clustering coefficient of the subcortical subnetwork was negatively correlated with age in young adults. Our findings suggest that temporal clustering coefficient is a reliable and reproducible approach for the identification of individual differences in brain function, and provide evidence for sex and age effects on human brain dynamic connectome.

                The crustacean cardiac ganglion (CG) network coordinates the rhythmic contractions of the heart muscle to control the circulation of blood. The network consists of 9 cells, 5 large motor cells (LC1-5) and 4 small endogenous pacemaker cells (SCs). We report a new three-compartmental biophysical model of an LC that is morphologically realistic and includes provision for inputs from the SCs via a gap-junction coupled spike-initiation-zone (SIZ) compartments. To determine physiologically viable LC models in this realistic configuration, maximal conductances in three compartments of an LC are determined by random sampling from a biologically-characterized 9D-parameter space, followed by a three stage rejection protocol that checks for conformity with electrophysiological features from single cell traces. LC models that pass the single cell rejection protocol are then incorporated into a network model which is then used in a final rejection protocol stage. Using disparate experimental data, the study provides hitherto unknown structure-function insights related to the crustacean cardiac ganglion large cell, including predictions about morphology including the role of its SIZ, and the differential roles of active conductances in the three compartments. Further, we extend analyses of emergent conductance relationships and correlations in model neurons relative to their biological counterparts, allowing us to make inferences both with respect to the biological system as well as the implications of the ability to detect such relationships in populations of model neurons going forward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feature representation under crowding in V1 and V4 neuronal populations</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception depends strongly on spatial context. A profound example is visual crowding, whereby the presence of nearby stimuli impairs discriminability of object features. Despite extensive work on both perceptual crowding and the spatial integrative properties of visual cortical neurons, the link between these two aspects of visual processing remains unclear. To understand better the neural basis of crowding, we recorded simultaneously from neuronal populations in V1 and V4 of fixating macaque monkeys. We assessed the information about the orientation of a visual target available from the measured responses, both for targets presented in isolation and amid distractors. Both single neuron and population responses had less information about target orientation when distractors were present. Information loss was moderate in V1 and more substantial in V4. Information loss could be traced to systematic divisive and additive changes in neuronal tuning. Tuning changes were more severe in V4; in addition, tuning exhibited greater context-dependent distortions in V4, further restricting the ability of a fixed sensory readout strategy to extract accurate feature information across changing environments. Our results provide a direct test of crowding effects at different stages of the visual hierarchy, reveal how these effects alter the spiking activity of cortical populations by which sensory stimuli are encoded, and connect these changes to established mechanisms of neuronal spatial integration.

                Identifying the structure of motion relations in the environment is critical for navigation, tracking, prediction, and pursuit. Yet, little is known about the mental and neural computations that allow the visual system to infer this structure online from a volatile stream of visual information. We propose online hierarchical Bayesian inference as a principled solution for how the brain might solve this complex perceptual task. We derive an online Expectation-Maximization algorithm that explains human percepts qualitatively and quantitatively for a diverse set of stimuli, covering classical psychophysics experiments, ambiguous motion scenes, and illusory motion displays. We thereby identify normative explanations for the origin of human motion structure perception and make testable predictions for new psychophysics experiments. The algorithm furthermore affords a neural network implementation which shares properties with motion-sensitive cortical areas and motivates a novel class of experiments to reveal the neural representations of latent structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Allosteric stabilization of calcium and lipid binding engages three synaptotagmins in fast exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                The release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals is a strongly Ca2+-dependent process controlled by synaptotagmins, especially by their C2B domains. Biochemical measurements have reported Ca2+ affinities of synaptotagmin too low to account for synaptic function. However, binding of the C2B domain to the membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 increases the Ca2+ affinity and vice versa, indicating a positive allosteric stabilization of simultaneous binding. Here, we construct a mathematical model of the release-triggering mechanism of synaptotagmin based on measured Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 affinities and reported protein copy numbers. The model reproduced the kinetics of synaptic transmission observed at the calyx of Held over the full range of Ca2+ stimuli, with each C2B domain crosslinking Ca2+ and PI(4,5)P2 lowering the energy barrier for fusion by 4.85 kBT. The allosteric stabilization of simultaneous Ca2+ and PI(4,5)P2 binding was crucial to form multiple crosslinks which enabled fast fusion rates. Only three crosslinking C2B domains were needed to reproduce physiological responses, but high copy numbers per vesicle sped up the collision-limited formation of crosslinks. In silico evaluation of theoretical mutants revealed that affection of the allosteric properties might be a determinant of the severity of synaptotagmin mutations and may underlie dominant-negative, disease-causing effects. We conclude that allostericity is a crucial feature of synaptotagmin action.

                The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms a continuous and dynamic network throughout a neuron, extending from dendrites to axon terminals, and axonal ER dysfunction is implicated in several neurological disorders. In addition, tight junctions between the ER and plasma membrane (PM) are formed by several molecules including Kv2 channels, but the cellular functions of many ER-PM junctions remain unknown. Dynamic Ca2+ uptake into the ER during electrical activity plays an essential role in synaptic transmission as failure to allow rapid ER Ca2+ filling during stimulation activates stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and decreases both presynaptic Ca2+ influx and synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Our experiments demonstrate that Kv2.1 channels are necessary for enabling ER Ca2+ uptake during electrical activity as genetic depletion of Kv2.1 rendered both the somatic and axonal ER unable to accumulate Ca2+ during electrical stimulation. Moreover, our experiments show that the loss of Kv2.1 in the axon impairs synaptic vesicle fusion during stimulation via a mechanism unrelated to modulation of membrane voltage. Thus, our data demonstrate that the non-conducting role of Kv2.1 in forming stable junctions between the ER and PM via ER VAMP-associated protein (VAP) binding couples ER Ca2+ uptake with electrical activity. Our results further suggest that Kv2.1 has a critical function in neuronal cell biology for Ca2+-handling independent of voltage and reveals a novel and critical pathway for maintaining ER lumen Ca2+ levels and efficient neurotransmitter release. Taken together these findings reveal an essential non-classical role for both Kv2.1 and the ER-PM junctions in synaptic transmission.

                Homeostatic and circadian processes collaborate to appropriately time and consolidate sleep and wake. To understand how these processes are integrated, we scheduled brief sleep deprivation at different times of day in Drosophila and find elevated morning rebound compared to evening. These effects depend on discrete morning and evening clock neurons, independent of their roles in circadian locomotor activity. In the R5 ellipsoid body sleep homeostat, we identified elevated morning expression of activity dependent and presynaptic gene expression as well as the presynaptic protein BRUCHPILOT consistent with regulation by clock circuits. These neurons also display elevated calcium levels in response to sleep loss in the morning, but not the evening consistent with the observed time-dependent sleep rebound. These studies reveal the circuit and molecular mechanisms by which discrete circadian clock neurons program a homeostatic sleep center.

                Dynamic re-configuration of circuit function subserves the flexibility of innate behaviours tuned to physiological states. Internal energy stores adaptively regulate feeding-associated behaviours by integrating opposing hunger and satiety signals at the level of neural circuits. Across vertebrate lineages, the neuropeptides CART and NPY have potent anorexic and orexic functions, respectively, and show energy state-dependent expression in interoceptive neurons. However, how the antagonistic activities of these peptides modulate circuit plasticity remain unclear. Using behavioural, neuroanatomical and activity analysis in adult zebrafish, along with pharmacological interventions, we show that CART and NPY activities converge on a population of neurons in the dorsomedial telencephalon (Dm). While CART facilitates glutamatergic neurotransmission at the Dm, NPY dampens the response to glutamate. In energy-rich states, CART enhances NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function by PKA/PKC mediated phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR complex. Conversely, starvation triggers NPY-mediated reduction in phosphorylated NR1 via calcineurin activation and inhibition of cAMP production leading to reduced responsiveness to glutamate. Our data identify convergent integration of CART and NPY inputs by the Dm neurons to generate nutritional state-dependent circuit plasticity that is correlated with the behavioural switch induced by the opposing actions of satiety and hunger signals.

                Hundreds of genes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies have indicated that some phenotypes caused by decreased developmental function of select risk genes can be reversed by restoring gene function in adulthood. However, very few risk genes have been assessed for adult reversibility. We developed a strategy to rapidly assess the temporal requirements and phenotypic reversibility of neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene orthologs using a conditional protein degradation system and machine vision phenotypic profiling in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using this approach, we measured the effects of degrading and re-expressing orthologs of 3 neurodevelopmental risk genes EBF3, BRN3A, and DYNC1H1 across 30 morphological, locomotor, sensory, and learning phenotypes at multiple timepoints throughout development. We found some degree of phenotypic reversibility was possible for each gene studied. However, the temporal requirements of gene function and degree of phenotypic reversibility varied by gene and phenotype. The data reflects the dynamic nature of gene function and the importance of using multiple time windows of degradation and re-expression to understand the many roles a gene can play over developmental time. This work also demonstrates a strategy of using a high-throughput model system to investigate temporal requirements of gene function across a large number of phenotypes to rapidly prioritize neurodevelopmental disorder genes for re-expression studies in other organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A positively Tuned Voltage Indicator Reveals Electrical Correlates of Calcium Activity in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal spiking activity is routinely recorded using genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), but calcium imaging is limited in temporal resolution and does not report subthreshold voltage changes. Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) offer better temporal resolution and subthreshold sensitivity, but spike detection with fast GEVIs has required specialized imaging equipment. Here, we report the ASAP4 subfamily of genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) that brighten in response to membrane depolarization, inverting the fluorescence-voltage relationship of previous ASAP GEVIs. Two variants, ASAP4b and ASAP4e, feature 128% and 178% fluorescence increases over 100-mV of depolarization, respectively, facilitating spike detection in single trials in vivo with standard 1 and 2-photon imaging systems. Simultaneous voltage and calcium imaging confirms improved temporal resolution and spike discernment by ASAP4 GEVIs. Thus, positively tuned ASAP4 voltage indicators enable recording of neuronal spiking activity using similar equipment as calcium imaging, while providing higher temporal resolution.

                During brain homeostasis, stem cell fate determination is crucial to guarantee function, adaptation and regeneration while preventing neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. How neural stem cells (NSCs) are instructed to generate neurons or glia is not well understood. Here we addressed how fate is resolved in multipotent adult hippocampal NSCs, and identify Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (Safb1) as a determinant of neuron production by blocking glial commitment. Safb1 is sufficient to block oligodendrocytic differentiation of NSCs by preventing expression of the transcription factor NFIB at the post-transcriptional level. Detailed interrogation of the Drosha interactome and functional validation revealed that Safb1 enhances NFIB mRNA cleavage in a Drosha-dependent fashion. Thus, our study provides a cellular mechanism for selective NSC fate regulation by post-transcriptional destabilization of mRNAs. Given the importance of NSC maintenance and fate determination in the adult brain, our findings have major implications for cell-specific gene expression, brain disease and aging.

                The brain forms cognitive maps of relational knowledge, an organizing principle thought to underlie our ability to generalize and make inferences. However, how can a relevant map be selected in situations where a stimulus is embedded in multiple relational structures? Here, we find that both spatial and temporal cognitive maps influence generalization in a choice task, where spatial location determines reward magnitude. Mirroring behavior, the hippocampus not only builds a map of spatial relationships but also encodes temporal distances. As the task progresses, participants' choices become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial and a weakening of the temporal map. This change is driven by orbitofrontal cortex, which represents the evidence that an observed outcome is generated from the spatial rather than the temporal map and updates hippocampal representations accordingly. Taken together, this demonstrates how hippocampal cognitive maps are used and updated flexibly for inference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental Dynamics of RNA Translation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                The precise regulation of gene expression is fundamental to neurodevelopment, plasticity, and cognitive function. While several studies have deeply profiled mRNA dynamics in the developing human brain, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of accompanying translational regulation. We perform ribosome profiling from more than 70 human prenatal and adult cortex samples across ontogeny and into adulthood, mapping translation events at nucleotide resolution. In addition to characterizing the translational regulation of annotated open reading frames (ORFs), we identify thousands of previously unknown translation events, including small open reading frames (sORFs) that give rise to human- and/or brain-specific microproteins, many of which we independently verify using size-selected proteomics. Ribosome profiling in stem cell-derived human neuronal cultures further corroborates these findings and shows that several neuronal activity-induced long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including LINC00473, a primate-specific lncRNA implicated in depression, encode previously undescribed microproteins. Physicochemical analysis of these brain microproteinss identifies a large class harboring arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats as strong candidates for regulating RNA metabolism. Moreover, we find that, collectively, these previously unknown human brain sORFs are enriched for variants associated with schizophrenia. In addition to significantly expanding the translational landscape of the developing brain, this atlas will serve as a rich resource for the annotation and functional interrogation of thousands of previously unknown brain-specific protein products.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced context updating but intact visual priors in autism</a></h4>

              
                A general consensus persists that sensory-perceptual differences in autism, such as hypersensitivities to light or sound, result from an overreliance on new (rather than prior) sensory observations. However, conflicting Bayesian accounts of autism remain unresolved as to whether such alterations are caused by more precise sensory observations (precise likelihood model) or by forming a less precise model of the sensory context (hypo-priors model). We used a decision-under-uncertainty paradigm that manipulated uncertainty in both likelihoods and priors. Contrary to model predictions we found no differences in reliance on likelihood in autistic group (AS) compared to neurotypicals (NT) and found no differences in subjective prior variance between groups. However, we found reduced context adjustment in the AS group compared to NT. Further, the AS group showed heightened variability in their relative weighting of sensory information (vs. prior) on a trial-by-trial basis. When participants were aligned on a continuum of autistic traits, we found no associations with likelihood reliance or prior variance but found an increased likelihood precision with autistic traits. These findings together provide empirical evidence for intact priors, precise likelihood, reduced context updating and heightened variability during sensory learning in autism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Higher synaptic threshold for NMDA spike generation in human neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons receive synaptic input primarily onto their dendrites. While we know much about the electrical properties of dendrites in rodents, we have only just started to describe their properties in the human brain. Here we investigate the capacity of human neurons to generate NMDA spikes. We find that dendritic iontophoresis of glutamate, as well as local dendritic synaptic stimulation, can evoke NMDA spikes in dendrites of human layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Surprisingly, however, the capacity to evoke NMDA spikes in human neurons was significantly reduced compared to that in rodent neurons. Simulations in morphologically realistic models indicated that human neurons have a higher synaptic threshold for NMDA spike generation. Using a simplified model, we show that this is primarily due to the larger diameter of human dendrites. In summary, we find reduced NMDA spike generation in human compared to rodent neurons due to the larger diameter of human dendrites.

                Human understanding of the world can change rapidly when new information comes to light, such as when a plot twist occurs in a work of fiction. This flexible knowledge assembly requires few-shot reorganisation of neural codes for relations among objects and events. However, existing computational theories are largely silent about how this could occur. Here, participants learned a transitive ordering among novel objects within two distinct contexts, before exposure to new knowledge revealing how the contexts were linked. BOLD signals in dorsal frontoparietal cortical areas revealed that objects were rapidly and dramatically rearranged on the neural manifold after minimal exposure to the linking information. We then adapt stochastic online gradient descent to permit similar rapid knowledge assembly in a neural network model.

	<p>Background: Early biomarkers of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are critical both to initiate interventions and to choose participants for clinical trials. Odor threshold, odor identification and odor familiarity are impaired in AD. Methods: We investigated the relative abilities of standard screening (MMSE) and olfactory measures to predict transitions from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from CN to AD, and MCI to AD. The archival sample of 497, from the UCSD ADRC, included participants who were CN, MCI, AD and converters to MCI or AD. Apoe ε4 status, a genetic risk factor, was available for 256 participants, 132 were ε4 carriers. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve plots the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to determine diagnostic accuracy. Results: Different measures were better predictors at specific stages of disease risk; e.g., odor familiarity, odor identification and the combination showed higher predictive value for converting from MCI to AD in ε4 carriers than the MMSE. Combining odor familiarity and odor identification produced an AUC of 1.0 in ε4 carriers, MMSE alone was 0.58. Conclusions: Olfactory biomarkers show real promise as non-invasive indicators of prodromal AD. The results support the value of combining olfactory measures in assessment of risk for conversion to MCI and to AD.</p>

	<p>Objective: The effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for residual seizures after corpus callosotomy (CC) has not yet been fully investigated. We hypothesized that seizure control would be improved by VNS after CC. The purpose of this study was to compare seizure frequency between patients with implantation of a VNS generator (post-VNS group) or without VNS (non-post-VNS group) following CC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent CC between January 2009 and May 2019 in our institution. We evaluated proportions of ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency (responders) and seizure reduction rate 1 and 2 years after VNS. To investigate factors related to responders, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed regarding age, number of anti-seizure medications (ASMs), addition of novel ASMs (levetiracetam, lacosamide or perampanel), and post-VNS or non-post-VNS status. Results: Thirteen post-VNS patients and 24 non-post-VNS patients were analyzed in this study. Responder rate at 1 year after VNS differed significantly between the post-VNS group (53.9%) and non-post-VNS group (12.5%, p = 0.017). Number of ASMs at the time of CC and post-VNS were significantly associated with responders in univariate analyses (odds ratio [OR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13–0.88, p = 0.025 and OR 8.2, 95%CI 1.6–41.6, p = 0.011, respectively), whereas age, sex, seizure frequency, and addition of novel ASMs were not. In multivariate analysis, the presence of VNS procedures after CC was the only factor favorably associated with responder status (OR 82.2, 95%CI 1.55–4355.7, p = 0.03). Conclusions: VNS therapy after CC may increase the proportion of responders independent of the addition of novel ASMs.</p>

The feedback received by the users are relayed from a functional electrical stimulation (FES) device and hence are somato-sensory in nature. The BCI system designed for this study activates an electrical stimulator placed on the left hand, right hand, left foot, and right foot of the user. Trials containing erroneous feedback can be detected from the neural signals in form of the error related potential (ErrP). The inclusion of neuro-feedback during the experiments indicated the possibility that ErrP signals can be evoked when the participant perceives an error from the feedback. Hence, to detect such feedback using ErrP, a transferable (offline) decoder based on optimal transport theory is introduced herein. The offline system detects single-trial erroneous trials from the feedback period of an online neuro-feedback BCI system. The results of the FES-based feedback BCI system were compared to a similar visual-based (VIS) feedback system. Using our framework, the error detector systems for both the FES and VIS feedback paradigms achieved an F1-score of 92.66% and 83.10%, respectively, and are significantly superior to a comparative system where an optimal transport was not used. It is expected that this form of transferable and automated error detection system compounded with a motor imagery system will augment the performance of a BCI and provide a better BCI-based neuro-rehabilitation protocol that has an error control mechanism embedded into it.&amp;amp;nbsp;</p>

	<p>Affective computing systems can decode cortical activities to facilitate emotional human–computer interaction. However, personalities exist in neurophysiological responses among different users of the brain–computer interface leads to a difficulty for designing a generic emotion recognizer that is adaptable to a novel individual. It thus brings an obstacle to achieve cross-subject emotion recognition (ER). To tackle this issue, in this study we propose a novel feature selection method, manifold feature fusion and dynamical feature selection (MF-DFS), under transfer learning principle to determine generalizable features that are stably sensitive to emotional variations. The MF-DFS framework takes the advantages of local geometrical information feature selection, domain adaptation based manifold learning, and dynamical feature selection to enhance the accuracy of the ER system. Based on three public databases, DEAP, MAHNOB-HCI and SEED, the performance of the MF-DFS is validated according to the leave-one-subject-out paradigm under two types of electroencephalography features. By defining three emotional classes of each affective dimension, the accuracy of the MF-DFS-based ER classifier is achieved at 0.50–0.48 (DEAP) and 0.46–0.50 (MAHNOBHCI) for arousal and valence emotional dimensions, respectively. For the SEED database, it achieves 0.40 for the valence dimension. The corresponding accuracy is significantly superior to several classical feature selection methods on multiple machine learning models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Neuron-Specific Regulator of the V-ATPase in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The V-ATPase is a highly conserved enzymatic complex that ensures appropriate levels of organelle acidification in virtually all eukaryotic cells. While the general mechanisms of this proton pump have been well studied, little is known about the specific regulations of neuronal V-ATPase. Here, we studied CG31030, a previously uncharacterized <I>Drosophila</I> protein predicted from its sequence homology to be part of the V-ATPase family. In contrast to its ortholog ATP6AP1/VhaAC45 which is ubiquitous, we observed that CG31030 expression is apparently restricted to all neurons, and using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene tagging, that it is mainly addressed to synaptic terminals. In addition, we observed that CG31030 is essential for fly survival and that this protein co-immunoprecipitates with identified V-ATPase subunits, and in particular ATP6AP2. Using a genetically-encoded pH probe (VMAT-pHluorin) and electrophysiological recordings at the larval neuromuscular junction, we show that <I>CG31030</I> knock-down induces a major defect in synaptic vesicle acidification and a decrease in quantal size, which is the amplitude of the postsynaptic response to the release of a single synaptic vesicle. These defects were associated with severe locomotor impairments. Overall, our data indicate that CG31030, which we renamed VhaAC45-related protein (VhaAC45RP), is a specific regulator of neuronal V-ATPase in <I>Drosophila</I> that is required for proper synaptic vesicle acidification and neurotransmitter release.</p>

                Fabry disease (FD) is an ultra-rare genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by pathologic gene variants resulting in insufficient expression of α-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine in plasma and in different cells throughout the body, causing major cardiovascular, renal, and nervous system complications. Until 2018, reimbursed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD was available in all European Union countries except Poland.             We present the preliminary results of the first two years of reimbursed ERT in Poland. We obtained data from the seven largest academic centers in Katowice, Cracow, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk, Warsaw, and Łódź. The questionnaire included the following data: number of patients treated, number of patients qualified for ERT, and patient characteristics.             All centers returned completed questionnaires that included data for a total of 71 patients (28 men and 43 women) as of June 2021. Thirty-five patients with the diagnosis of FD confirmed by genetic testing (22 men and 13 women) had already qualified for reimbursed ERT. Mean (SD) age at the commencement of the ERT program was 39.6 (15.5) years (range 18-79 years). Mean time from the first clinical symptoms reported by the patients to the FD diagnosis was 21.1 (8.9) years, and the mean time from the final diagnosis of FD to the beginning of ERT was 4.7 (4.6) years.             FD is still underdiagnosed in Poland. To identify undiagnosed FD patients and to ensure that patients in Poland benefit fully from ERT, implementation of an effective nationwide screening strategy and close cooperation with a network of rare disease centers is advised.

                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been rapidly spreading. Several guideline therapies have been proposed as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2, however, these therapies are not sufficient to treat a severe condition of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterised by the increase of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs). Secretome-mesenchymal stem cells (S-MSCs) produced by MSCs under hypoxia could excessively release several anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors to control the COVID-19 cytokine storm and accelerate lung injury improvement. This is the first study investigating the clinical outcomes of three severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of three different hospitals in Indonesia treated with S-MSCs. The decrease of D-dimer and CRP level was reported for all patients treated with S-MSCs. This was in line with improvement of pulmonary radiology, blood gas level, and hematologic assessment. In conclusion, these cases suggest that S-MSCs could effectively control D-dimer, CRP level and GGOs of severe COVID-19 patients associated with recovered pulmonary function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CAMAP: Artificial neural networks unveil the role of codon arrangement in modulating MHC-I peptides presentation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tariq Daouda, Maude Dumont-Lagacé, Albert Feghaly, Yahya Benslimane, Rébecca Panes, Mathieu Courcelles, Mohamed Benhammadi, Lea Harrington, Pierre Thibault, François Major, Yoshua Bengio, Étienne Gagnon, Sébastien Lemieux, Claude Perreault</p>

MHC-I associated peptides (MAPs) play a central role in the elimination of virus-infected and neoplastic cells by CD8 T cells. However, accurately predicting the MAP repertoire remains difficult, because only a fraction of the transcriptome generates MAPs. In this study, we investigated whether codon arrangement (usage and placement) regulates MAP biogenesis. We developed an artificial neural network called Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor (CAMAP), predicting MAP presentation solely from mRNA sequences flanking the MAP-coding codons (MCCs), while excluding the MCC <i>per se</i>. CAMAP predictions were significantly more accurate when using original codon sequences than shuffled codon sequences which reflect amino acid usage. Furthermore, predictions were independent of mRNA expression and MAP binding affinity to MHC-I molecules and applied to several cell types and species. Combining MAP ligand scores, transcript expression level and CAMAP scores was particularly useful to increase MAP prediction accuracy. Using an <i>in vitro</i> assay, we showed that varying the synonymous codons in the regions flanking the MCCs (without changing the amino acid sequence) resulted in significant modulation of MAP presentation at the cell surface. Taken together, our results demonstrate the role of codon arrangement in the regulation of MAP presentation and support integration of both translational and post-translational events in predictive algorithms to ameliorate modeling of the immunopeptidome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PaIRKAT: A pathway integrated regression-based kernel association test with applications to metabolomics and COPD phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charlie M. Carpenter, Weiming Zhang, Lucas Gillenwater, Cameron Severn, Tusharkanti Ghosh, Russell Bowler, Katerina Kechris, Debashis Ghosh</p>

High-throughput data such as metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have become familiar data types within the “-omics” family. For this work, we focus on subsets that interact with one another and represent these “pathways” as graphs. Observed pathways often have disjoint components, i.e., nodes or sets of nodes (metabolites, etc.) not connected to any other within the pathway, which notably lessens testing power. In this paper we propose the Pathway Integrated Regression-based Kernel Association Test (PaIRKAT), a new kernel machine regression method for incorporating known pathway information into the semi-parametric kernel regression framework. This work extends previous kernel machine approaches. This paper also contributes an application of a graph kernel regularization method for overcoming disconnected pathways. By incorporating a regularized or “smoothed” graph into a score test, PaIRKAT can provide more powerful tests for associations between biological pathways and phenotypes of interest and will be helpful in identifying novel pathways for targeted clinical research. We evaluate this method through several simulation studies and an application to real metabolomics data from the COPDGene study. Our simulation studies illustrate the robustness of this method to incorrect and incomplete pathway knowledge, and the real data analysis shows meaningful improvements of testing power in pathways. PaIRKAT was developed for application to metabolomic pathway data, but the techniques are easily generalizable to other data sources with a graph-like structure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Optimal design for a psychosocial intervention on severely acute malnourished children in humanitarian settings: results of an expert survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Common psychosocial interventions focus on feeding, stimulation, emotional responsiveness and childcare and parenting. Inclusion of such a component in the outpatient management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) children is recommended. However, clinical assessment of such interventions is tedious in humanitarian settings and modalities evidence on the impact of psychosocial interventions alongside nutrition protocol for SAM is scarce.  This survey aimed to gather expert opinions on the optimal design of a combined psychosocial and nutrition intervention feasible in humanitarian settings. Methods: From March to May 2018, an online survey was emailed to international experts in nutrition and mental health and psychosocial support, mainly from academia and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs). It included multiple choices questions on the key components of an optimal combined intervention. Results: Of the 76 experts targeted, 20 responded. 11 (55%) belonged to INGOs, 2 (10%) to academia, and 4 (20%) to international organizations and donors. For most respondents, a combined intervention should be provided in weekly 45-minuites counselling sessions, provided individually (rather than in a group) and at home (rather than at a health center). None of the proposed ideal duration (two, four or six months) gained the majority of votes. Experts thought that 35% staff training should be in “Active listening for psychosocial support”, and 30% in “Early child development”, 25% in “Maternal depression” and 9% in “Anthropometric measurements”. They estimated that a combined intervention could improve SAM recovery rate by 10% (min-max: 0-19%) vs. the nutritional protocol alone. Qualitative results highlighted the importance of tailoring the intervention to the individual, the population and the settings; as well as considering feasibility and scalability at the design stage. Conclusion: These findings could guide further research on the impact of psychosocial interventions on SAM children’s health and development, and help designing innovative approaches to treat undernutrition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of acute L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The oral administration of L-arginine has been related to improved physical performance due to a likely reduction in muscle fatigue, resulting from the vasodilator effect of nitric oxide on skeletal muscle. However, there is no precise and quantitative analysis of the information in the literature. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training with a systematic review and meta-analysis. We hypothesized that L-arginine supplementation would improve performance capacity and the effects involved in strength training. Methods: The study period was from 2010 to 2020. The inclusion process established articles with well-designed human experiments that included only L-arginine supplementation (without any additional compounds) testing the effects of L-arginine supplementation on sports performance related to strength training; identical experimental conditions in placebo or control group; and publications in the last ten years (until December 31, 2020). Three studies were included that compared L-arginine supplementation with placebo in anaerobic performance tests. Test analysis supplementation with other supplements was removed and there was no gender, age, and ethnicity level. Results: There was no significant heterogeneity (p>0.05) in the analysis of the three selected articles and the effects of L-arginine supplementation in muscular endurance; performance had a mean of 0.26 (95% CI = -0.129; 0.649; p = 0.190), peak torque with a mean of -0.002 (95% CI = -0.531; 0.527; p = 0. 99) of the third series of exercises and, furthermore, when comparing the integrated effect (resistance rate with the peak torque) there was no difference with a mean of 0.168 (95% CI = -0.145; 0.481; p = 0.292). Conclusions: Acute L-arginine supplementation provides no ergogenic effect on strength training performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nitric oxide for the prevention and treatment of viral, bacterial, protozoal and fungal infections [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Although the antimicrobial potential of nitric oxide (NO) is widely published, it is little used clinically. NO is a key signalling molecule modulating vascular, neuronal, inflammatory and immune responses. Endogenous antimicrobial activity is largely mediated by high local NO concentrations produced by cellular inducible nitric oxide synthase, and by derivative reactive nitrogen oxide species including peroxynitrite and S-nitrosothiols. NO may be taken as dietary substrate (inorganic nitrate, L-arginine), and therapeutically as gaseous NO, and transdermal, sublingual, oral, intranasal and intravenous nitrite or nitrate. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that NO has generic static and cidal activities against viruses (including β-coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2), bacteria, protozoa and fungi/yeasts in vitro. Therapeutic effects have been seen in animal models in vivo, and phase II trials have demonstrated that NO donors can reduce microbial infection. Nevertheless, excess NO, as occurs in septic shock, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In view of the dose-dependent positive and negative effects of NO, safety and efficacy trials of NO and its donors are needed for assessing their role in the prevention and treatment of infections. Trials should test dietary inorganic nitrate for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis and gaseous NO or oral, topical or intravenous nitrite and nitrate for treatment of mild-to-severe infections, including due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). This review summarises the evidence base from in vitro, in vivo and early phase clinical studies of NO activity in viral, bacterial, protozoal and fungal infections.

                Currently, the studies on sexual abuse trauma, and resilience in Confucian survivors are still limited. The purpose of this study is to explore the resilience of Confucian women after sexual abuse trauma to provide evidence to support in counseling and psychotherapy practices. The article describes the resiliency story of a Vietnamese Confucian female survivor who was abused by her brother from the age of 8 to 16. The life history approach used in qualitative narrative research was applied in this study. The researcher identified two factors that strongly influence the survivor’s resilience: (1) the effectiveness of passive education in the general education curriculum is oriented to both competence and quality development; and (2) an authentic understanding of the core Confucian philosophical doctrine: the neutrality and the self-nurture. Based on the findings, we propose a 7-stage flow diagram of a Confucian women's resilience following sexual abuse. These findings provide important evidence-based practice for counselors and clinicians in supporting and intervening for sexually abused Confucian women and contribute to the impact of studies on religious and spiritual factors affecting the resilience of sexual abuse survivors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pneumococcal carriage and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in mother-baby pairs in a rural community in Eastern Uganda: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pneumococcal carriage predisposes children to pneumonia. Pneumonia poses a significant threat to the lives of children below five years old worldwide, contributing to a high number of hospitalizations and death. Morbidity and morbidity are especially common in children under five and the elderly, although any age group can be affected. This study aimed to estimate pneumococcal carriage and determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the pneumococci isolated from mother-baby pairs in Ngora district after the rollout of the pneumococcal vaccine. We hypothesized that high carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in mothers leads to carriage in their babies and hence a greater chance of contracting pneumonia. Methods: Consecutive sampling was used to select 152 mother-baby pairs from community visits and those seeking care at the health facility. We collected nasal swabs from both baby and mother for culture and sensitivity testing using Kirby-Bauer’s agar disc diffusion method. Data was also collected from the mothers who consented to take part in the study, using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Results: This study found that there was a low prevalence of pneumococcal carriage in the mother-baby pair in the Ngora district. Only one mother-baby pair (1/152) was found to be colonized with pneumococci in both mother and baby and the rest of S. pneumoniae colonized either the mother or baby. We also observed high rates of microbial resistance to penicillin, which is the first-line drug for the management of pneumonia in Uganda. Also, high resistance patterns were recorded with chloramphenicol (50%) and tetracycline (50%), whereas the lowest resistance was recorded in clindamycin (17%). Conclusions: The relationship between pneumococcal carriage and immunization status suggests that the pneumococcal vaccine is protective against the pneumococcal carriage. Resistance of S. pneumoniae to commonly used antibiotics was high.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prospective cohort study of the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers over clinical variables in children and young people with cancer presenting with fever and neutropenia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Fever during chemotherapy induced neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of the treatment of childhood cancer. Predictions of poor outcome could be enhanced by incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation and reassessment. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted of children under 18 years old, being treated for cancer or a cancer-like condition, who presented with fever (≥ 38.0°C) and neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5*109/L). Clinical features were recorded, along with three experimental inflammatory biomarkers: procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Outcomes included serious medical complications (SMC): any infection related mortality, critical care and organ support, severe sepsis, septic shock, significant microbiologically defined infection, or radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Results Biomarker assessments were undertaken in 43 episodes of fever and neutropenia, from 31 patients aged between four months and 17 years old (median six years): 20 were female and 22 had acute leukaemia. Five episodes of SMC were noted. PCT, IL-6 and IL-8 had poor individual discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.48 to 0.60) and did not add to the value of clinical risk stratification tools. Insufficient data were collected to formally assess the value of repeated assessments. Conclusions Incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation of episodes of fever with neutropenia in childhood does not clearly improve risk stratification. Repeated assessments over time may be of value.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Breastfeeding assessment tools for at-risk and malnourished infants aged under 6 months old: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many small and malnourished infants under 6 months of age have problems with breastfeeding and restoring effective exclusive breastfeeding is a common treatment goal. Assessment is a critical first step of case management, but most malnutrition guidelines do not specify how best to do this. We aimed to identify breastfeeding assessment tools for use in assessing at-risk and malnourished infants in resource-poor settings. Methods: We systematically searched: Medline and Embase; Web of Knowledge; Cochrane Reviews; Eldis and Google Scholar databases. Also the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), CAse REport guidelines, Emergency Nutrition Network, and Field Exchange websites. Assessment tool content was analysed using a framework describing breastfeeding ‘domains’ (baby’s behaviour; mother’s behaviour; position; latching; effective feeding; breast health; baby’s health; mother’s view of  feed; number, timing and length of feeds). Results: We identified 29 breastfeeding assessment tools and 45 validation studies. Eight tools had not been validated. Evidence underpinning most tools was low quality and mainly from high-income countries and hospital settings. The most comprehensive tools were the Breastfeeding, Evaluation and Education Tool, UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative tools and CARE training package. The tool with the strongest evidence was the WHO/UNICEF B-R-E-A-S-T-Feed Observation Form. Conclusions: Despite many possible tools, there is currently no one gold standard. For assessing malnourished infants in resource-poor settings, UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative tools, Module IFE and the WHO/UNICEF B-R-E-A-S-T-Feed Observation Form are the best available tools but could be improved by adding questions from other tools. Allowing for context, one tool for rapid community-based assessment plus a more detailed one for clinic/hospital assessment might help optimally identify breastfeeding problems and the support required. Further research is important to refine existing tools and develop new ones. Rigorous testing, especially against outcomes such as breastfeeding status and growth, is key.

<p>The mouse corticoreticular pathway (CRP) originates from widespread parts of the cortex, including the primary motor (M1), secondary motor (M2), anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and primary somatosensory (S1) areas. Compared with the corticospinal tract, the CRP is more distributed and bilaterally projecting, suggesting greater resilience to complete disruption.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The corticoreticular pathway (CRP) has been implicated as an important mediator of motor recovery and rehabilitation after central nervous system damage. However, its origins, trajectory and laterality are not well understood. This study mapped the mouse CRP in comparison with the corticospinal tract (CST). We systematically searched the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (© 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science) for experiments that used anterograde tracer injections into the right isocortex in mice. For each eligible experiment (<i>N</i> = 607), CRP and CST projection strength were quantified by the tracer volume reaching the reticular formation motor nuclei (RF<sub>motor</sub>) and pyramids, respectively. Tracer density in each brain voxel was also correlated with RF<sub>motor</sub> versus pyramids projection strength to explore the relative trajectories of the CRP and CST. We found significant CRP projections originating from the primary and secondary motor cortices, anterior cingulate, primary somatosensory cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. Compared with the CST, the CRP had stronger projections from each region except the primary somatosensory cortex. Ipsilateral projections were stronger than contralateral for both tracts (above the pyramidal decussation), but the CRP projected more bilaterally than the CST. The estimated CRP trajectory was anteromedial to the CST in the internal capsule and dorsal to the CST in the brainstem. Our findings reveal a widespread distribution of CRP origins and confirm strong bilateral CRP projections, theoretically increasing the potential for partial sparing after brain lesions and contralesional compensation after unilateral injury.</p>

<p>MS had deleterious effects on a variety of assessments. EE could reverse MS-induced cognitive impairments.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early-life experiences, including parental care, affect cognitive performance later in life. Being exposed to early-life maternal separation (MS) increases susceptibility to stress-related psychopathology. Previous studies suggest that MS could induce learning and memory impairments. Since enriched environment (EE) provides more opportunities for exploration and social interaction, in the present study we evaluated the effects of a short EE paradigm with a duration of 13 days on cognitive abilities of maternally separated rats (MS; 180 min/day, postnatal day (PND) 1–21) during adolescence in four experimental groups: Control, Control+EE, MS, and MS+EE. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were also measured in experimental animals. We also studied the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the slices of hippocampal CA1 area. The behavioral and electrophysiological assessments were started at PND 35. MS caused higher basal CORT levels in plasma and impaired spatial learning, memory, and social interaction. LTP induction was also impaired in MS rats and plasma BDNF levels were reduced in these animals. MS also induced more anxiety-like behavior. Short EE reduced plasma CORT levels had the potential to improve locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in MS+EE rats and reversed MS-induced impairments of spatial learning, memory, and social behavior. LTP induction and plasma BDNF levels were also enhanced in MS+EE rats. We concluded that short EE might be considered as a therapeutic strategy for promoting cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Therapeutic time windows of compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways for ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Much evidence has proved that excitotoxicity induced by excessive release of glutamate contributes largely to damage caused by ischemia. In view of the key role played by NMDA receptors in mediating excitotoxicity, compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways have become the most promising type of anti-stroke candidate compounds. However, the limited therapeutic time window for neuroprotection is a key factor preventing NMDA receptor-related compounds from showing efficacy in all clinical trials for ischemic stroke. In this perspective, the determination of therapeutic time windows of these kinds of compounds is useful in ensuring a therapeutic effect and accelerating clinical application. This mini-review discussed the therapeutic time windows of compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways, described related influence factors and the status of clinical studies. The purpose of this review is to look for compounds with wide therapeutic time windows and better clinical application prospect.</p>

                Nestvogel and McCormick performed intra- and extracellular recordings in the visual thalamus and visual cortex of mice to reveal a crucial role of thalamocortical interactions in shaping movement/arousal-related signals in visual cortex and in regulating a 3–5 Hz oscillation thought to be an evolutionary precursor to the primate alpha rhythm.

                The brain contains multiple maps of visual space that are thought to preserve the 2D spatial relationships established in the retina. Sedigh-Sarvestani et al. discovered a new periodic map structure for visual space in V2 that violates this assumption and reveals an unexpected correspondence with periodic maps of stimulus features.

                Jung et al. show that Vgat-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus are generally required for diverse thermoregulatory behaviors. A subpopulation of these neurons encodes motivational properties of thermal stimuli as well as the behavior itself and is largely separate from caloric reward-encoding subpopulation.
