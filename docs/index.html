                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days).

	<p>Microglia influence pathological progression in neurological diseases, reacting to insults by expressing multiple morphofunctional phenotypes. However, the complete morphological spectrum of reactive microglia, as revealed by three-dimensional microscopic reconstruction, has not been detailed in virus limbic encephalitis. Here, using an anatomical series of brain sections, we expanded on an earlier Piry arbovirus encephalitis study to include CA1/CA2 and assessed the morphological response of homeostatic and reactive microglia at eight days post-infection. Hierarchical cluster and linear discriminant function analyses of multimodal morphometric features distinguished microglial morphology between infected animals and controls. For a broad representation of the spectrum of microglial morphology in each defined cluster, we chose representative cells of homeostatic and reactive microglia, using the sum of the distances of each cell in relation to all the others. Based on multivariate analysis, reactive microglia of infected animals showed more complex trees and thicker branches, covering a larger volume of tissue than in control animals. This approach offers a reliable representation of microglia dispersion in the Euclidean space, revealing the morphological kaleidoscope of surveillant and reactive microglia morphotypes. Because form precedes function in nature, our findings offer a starting point for research using integrative methods to understand microglia form and function.</p>

	<p>Aggression and violent offenses are common amongst forensic psychiatric patients. Notably, research distinguishes two motivationally distinct dimension of aggression–instrumental and reactive aggression. Instrumental aggression comprises of appetitive, goal-directed aggressive acts, whereas reactive aggression consists of affective, defensive violence with both their biological basis remaining largely unknown. Childhood trauma and functional genetic polymorphisms in catecholamines converting enzymes, such as mono-amino-oxidase A (MAO-A) and catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) have been suggested to augment an aggressive behavioral response in adulthood. However, it warrants clarification if these factors influence one or both types of aggression. Furthermore, it remains elusive, if having a combination of unfavorable enzyme genotypes and childhood maltreatment further increases violent behavior. Hence, we set out to address these questions in the current study. First, analysis revealed an overall marginally increased frequency of the unfavorable MAO-A genotype in the test population. Second, each gene polymorphisms together with a traumatic childhood significantly increased the AFAS (Appetitive and Facilitative Aggression Scale) scores for both reactive and appetitive aggression. Third, having a combination of both disadvantageous genotypes and a negative childhood served as a minor positive predictor for increased reactive aggression, but had a strong influence on the joy of being aggressive.</p>

	<p>Olfactory decline is an early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is a predictor of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Olfactory decline could reflect AD-related atrophy of structures related to the sense of smell. The aim of this study was to verify whether the presence of a clinical diagnosis of AD or MCI is associated with a volumetric decrease in the olfactory bulbs (OB) and the primary olfactory cortex (POC). We conducted two systematic reviews, one for each region and a meta-analysis. We collected articles from PsychNet, PubMed, Ebsco, and ProQuest databases. Results showed large and heterogeneous effects indicating smaller OB volumes in patients with AD (k = 6, g = −1.21, 95% CI [−2.19, −0.44]) and in patients with MCI compared to controls. There is also a trend for smaller POC in patients with AD or MCI compared to controls. Neuroanatomical structures involved in olfactory processing are smaller in AD and these volumetric reductions could be measured as early as the MCI stage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Preventing type 1 diabetes in childhood</a></h4>

              
                <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing &beta; cells of the pancreas are destroyed by T lymphocytes. Recent studies have demonstrated that monitoring for pancreatic islet autoantibodies, combined with genetic risk assessment, can identify most children who will develop T1D when they still have sufficient &beta; cell function to control glucose concentrations without the need for insulin. In addition, there has been recent success in secondary prevention using immunotherapy to delay the progression of preclinical disease, and primary prevention approaches to inhibiting the initiating autoimmune process have entered large-scale clinical trials. By changing the focus of T1D management from late diagnosis and insulin replacement to early diagnosis and &beta; cell preservation, we can anticipate a future without the need for daily insulin injections for children with T1D.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Immunotherapy: Building a bridge to a cure for type 1 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy the insulin-producing &beta; cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetic and environmental factors increase T1D risk by compromising immune homeostasis. Although the discovery and use of insulin have transformed T1D treatment, insulin therapy does not change the underlying disease or fully prevent complications. Over the past two decades, research has identified multiple immune cell types and soluble factors that destroy insulin-producing &beta; cells. These insights into disease pathogenesis have enabled the development of therapies to prevent and modify T1D. In this review, we highlight the key events that initiate and sustain pancreatic islet inflammation in T1D, the current state of the immunological therapies, and their advantages for the treatment of T1D.</p>

                <p>Technological advancements in blood glucose monitoring and therapeutic insulin administration have improved the quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes. However, these efforts fall short of replicating the exquisite metabolic control provided by native islets. We examine the integrated advancements in islet cell replacement and immunomodulatory therapies that are coalescing to enable the restoration of endogenous glucose regulation. We highlight advances in stem cell biology and graft site design, which offer innovative sources of cellular material and improved engraftment. We also cover cutting-edge approaches for preventing allograft rejection and recurrent autoimmunity. These insights reflect a growing understanding of type 1 diabetes etiology, &beta; cell biology, and biomaterial design, together highlighting therapeutic opportunities to durably replace the &beta; cells destroyed in type 1 diabetes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Type 1 diabetes glycemic management: Insulin therapy, glucose monitoring, and automation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite innovations in insulin therapy since its discovery, most patients living with type 1 diabetes do not achieve sufficient glycemic control to prevent complications, and they experience hypoglycemia, weight gain, and major self-care burden. Promising pharmacological advances in insulin therapy include the refinement of extremely rapid insulin analogs, alternate insulin-delivery routes, liver-selective insulins, add-on drugs that enhance insulin effect, and glucose-responsive insulin molecules. The greatest future impact will come from combining these pharmacological solutions with existing automated insulin delivery methods that integrate insulin pumps and glucose sensors. These systems will use algorithms enhanced by machine learning, supplemented by technologies that include activity monitors and sensors for other key metabolites such as ketones. The future challenges facing clinicians and researchers will be those of access and broad clinical implementation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Horizontally transmitted parasitoid killing factor shapes insect defense to parasitoids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interkingdom competition occurs between hymenopteran parasitoids and insect viruses sharing the same insect hosts. It has been assumed that parasitoid larvae die with the death of the infected host or as result of competition for host resources. Here we describe a gene family, <I>parasitoid killing factor</I> (<I>pkf</I>), that encodes proteins toxic to parasitoids of the Microgastrinae group and determines parasitism success. <I>Pkfs</I> are found in several entomopathogenic DNA virus families and in some lepidopteran genomes. We provide evidence of equivalent and specific toxicity against endoparasites for PKFs found in entomopoxvirus, ascovirus, baculovirus, and Lepidoptera through a mechanism that elicits apoptosis in the cells of susceptible parasitoids. This highlights the evolutionary arms race between parasitoids, viruses, and their insect hosts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Drug-induced phospholipidosis confounds drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drawn much attention. Beginning with sigma receptor ligands and expanding to other drugs from screening in the field, we became concerned that phospholipidosis was a shared mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of many repurposed drugs. For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific target-based activities&mdash;rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">lncRNA SLERT controls phase separation of FC/DFCs to facilitate Pol I transcription</a></h4>

              
                <p>RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription takes place at the border of the fibrillar center (FC) and the dense fibrillar component (DFC) in the nucleolus. Here, we report that individual spherical FC/DFC units are coated by the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 in human cells. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) <I>SLERT</I> binds to DDX21 RecA domains to promote DDX21 to adopt a closed conformation at a substoichiometric ratio through a molecular chaperone&ndash;like mechanism resulting in the formation of hypomultimerized and loose DDX21 clusters that coat DFCs, which is required for proper FC/DFC liquidity and Pol I processivity. Our results suggest that <I>SLERT</I> is an RNA regulator that controls the biophysical properties of FC/DFCs and thus ribosomal RNA production.</p>

                <p>Thermoelectric materials transfer heat and electrical energy, hence they are useful for power generation or cooling applications. Many of these materials have narrow bandgaps, especially for cooling applications. We developed SnSe crystals with a wide bandgap (<I>E</I><SUB>g</SUB>  33 <I>k</I><SUB>B</SUB><I>T</I>) with attractive thermoelectric properties through Pb alloying. The momentum and energy multiband alignments promoted by Pb alloying resulted in an ultrahigh power factor of ~75 &mu;W cm<sup>&ndash;1</sup> K<sup>&ndash;2</sup> at 300 K, and an average figure of merit <I>ZT</I> of ~1.90. We found that a 31-pair thermoelectric device can produce a power generation efficiency of ~4.4% and a cooling <I>T</I><SUB>max</SUB> of ~45.7 K.

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Liquid medium annealing for fabricating durable perovskite solar cells with improved reproducibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>Solution processing of semiconductors is highly promising for the high-throughput production of cost-effective electronics and optoelectronics. Although hybrid perovskites have potential in various device applications, challenges remain in the development of high-quality materials with simultaneously improved processing reproducibility and scalability. Here, we report a liquid medium annealing (LMA) technology that creates a robust chemical environment and constant heating field to modulate crystal growth over the entire film. Our method produces films with high crystallinity, fewer defects, desired stoichiometry, and overall film homogeneity. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs) yield a stabilized power output of 24.04% (certified 23.7%, 0.08 cm<sup>2</sup>) and maintain 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 2000 hours of operation. In addition, the 1-cm<sup>2</sup> PSCs exhibit a stabilized power output of 23.15% (certified PCE 22.3%) and keep 90% of their initial PCE after 1120 hours of operation, which illustrates their feasibility for scalable fabrication. LMA is less climate dependent and produces devices in-house with negligible performance variance year round. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue to improving the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.</p>

The measured field-angular variation of the quantized thermal Hall conductance has the same sign structure as the topological Chern number of the pure Kitaev spin liquid.

                <p>Generalization of the concept of band topology from lower-dimensional to higher-dimensional (<I>n</I> &gt; 3) physical systems is expected to introduce new bulk and boundary topological effects. However, theoretically predicted topological singularities in five-dimensional systems&mdash;Weyl surfaces and Yang monopoles&mdash;have either not been demonstrated in realistic physical systems or are limited to purely synthetic dimensions. We constructed a system possessing Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces based on metamaterials with engineered electromagnetic properties, leading to the observation of several intriguing bulk and surface phenomena, such as linking of Weyl surfaces and surface Weyl arcs, via selected three-dimensional subspaces. The demonstrated photonic Weyl surfaces and Weyl arcs leverage the concept of higher-dimension topology to control the propagation of electromagnetic waves in artificially engineered photonic media.</p>

                <p>Artificial spin ices are frustrated spin systems that can be engineered, in which fine tuning of geometry and topology has allowed the design and characterization of exotic emergent phenomena at the constituent level. Here, we report a realization of spin ice in a lattice of superconducting qubits. Unlike conventional artificial spin ice, our system is disordered by both quantum and thermal fluctuations. The ground state is classically described by the ice rule, and we achieved control over a fragile degeneracy point, leading to a Coulomb phase. The ability to pin individual spins allows us to demonstrate Gauss&rsquo;s law for emergent effective monopoles in two dimensions. The demonstrated qubit control lays the groundwork for potential future study of topologically protected artificial quantum spin liquids.</p>

Cells linking visual processing to person memory have been proposed but not found. Here, we report the discovery of such cells through recordings from an area in the macaque temporal pole identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging. These cells responded to faces that were personally familiar. They responded nonlinearly to stepwise changes in face visibility and detail and holistically to face parts, reflecting key signatures of familiar face recognition. They discriminated between familiar identities, as fast as a general face identity area. The discovery of these cells establishes a new pathway for the fast recognition of familiar individuals.</p>

We investigated PIEZO function in tip-growing cells in the moss <I>Physcomitrium patens</I> and the flowering plant <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>. <I>Pp</I>PIEZO1 and <I>Pp</I>PIEZO2 redundantly contribute to the normal growth, size, and cytoplasmic calcium oscillations of caulonemal cells. Both <I>Pp</I>PIEZO1 and <I>Pp</I>PIEZO2 localized to vacuolar membranes. Loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and overexpression mutants revealed that moss PIEZO homologs promote increased complexity of vacuolar membranes through tubulation, internalization, and/or fission. <I>Arabidopsis</I> PIEZO1 also localized to the tonoplast and is required for vacuole tubulation in the tips of pollen tubes. We propose that in plant cells the tonoplast has more freedom of movement than the plasma membrane, making it a more effective location for mechanosensory proteins.</p>

                <p>Bacteriophage predation selects for diverse antiphage systems that frequently cluster on mobilizable defense islands in bacterial genomes. However, molecular insight into the reciprocal dynamics of phage-bacterial adaptations in nature is lacking, particularly in clinical contexts where there is need to inform phage therapy efforts and to understand how phages drive pathogen evolution. Using time-shift experiments, we uncovered fluctuations in <I>Vibrio cholerae</I>&rsquo;s resistance to phages in clinical samples. We mapped phage resistance determinants to SXT integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which notoriously also confer antibiotic resistance. We found that SXT ICEs, which are widespread in -proteobacteria, invariably encode phage defense systems localized to a single hotspot of genetic exchange. We identified mechanisms that allow phage to counter SXT-mediated defense in clinical samples, and document the selection of a novel phage-encoded defense inhibitor. Phage infection stimulates high-frequency SXT ICE conjugation, leading to the concurrent dissemination of phage and antibiotic resistances.</p>

                <p>Emerging studies indicate that the immune system can regulate systemic metabolism. Here, we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulates T cells to induce selective white adipose loss, which protects against obesity, improves glucose metabolism, and mitigates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, adipose loss was not caused by alterations in food intake, absorption, or energy expenditure. Rather, it was induced by the excessive loss of lipids through the skin as sebum. TSLP and T cells regulated sebum release and sebum-associated antimicrobial peptide expression in the steady state. In human skin, <I>TSLP</I> expression correlated directly with sebum-associated gene expression. Thus, we establish a paradigm in which adipose loss can be achieved by means of sebum hypersecretion and uncover a role for adaptive immunity in skin barrier function through sebum secretion.</p>

                <p>In evaluating any randomized clinical trial, it is important to determine whether baseline differences between groups could have affected the primary outcome. In our study, muscle insulin sensitivity, which was identical in both groups at baseline, improved after nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), not placebo, therapy. Differences in baseline intrahepatic triglyceride content between groups do not negate the effects of NMN observed in muscle.</p>

                <p>Aging is an established risk factor for vascular diseases, but vascular aging itself may contribute to the progressive deterioration of organ function. Here, we show in aged mice that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling insufficiency, which is caused by increased production of decoy receptors, may drive physiological aging across multiple organ systems. Increasing VEGF signaling prevented age-associated capillary loss, improved organ perfusion and function, and extended life span. Healthier aging was evidenced by favorable metabolism and body composition and amelioration of aging-associated pathologies including hepatic steatosis, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, "inflammaging" (age-related multiorgan chronic inflammation), and increased tumor burden. These results indicate that VEGF signaling insufficiency affects organ aging in mice and suggest that modulating this pathway may result in increased mammalian life span and improved overall health.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The regulation of synaptic connectivity in the brain is vital to proper functioning and development of the CNS. Formation of neural networks in the CNS has been shown to be heavily influenced by astrocytes, which secrete factors, including thrombospondin (TSP) family proteins, that promote synaptogenesis. However, whether this process is different between males and females has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we found that cortical neurons purified from newborn male rats showed a significantly more robust synaptogenic response compared with female-derived cells when exposed to factors secreted from astrocytes. This difference was driven largely by the neuronal response to TSP2, which increased synapses in male neurons while showing no effect on female neurons. Blockade of endogenous 17&beta;-estradiol (E2) production with letrozole normalized the TSP response between male and female cells, indicating a level of regulation by estrogen signaling. Our results suggest that male and female neurons show a divergent response to TSP synaptogenic signaling, contributing to sex differences in astrocyte-mediated synaptic connectivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">COUNTEN, an AI-Driven Tool for Rapid and Objective Structural Analyses of the Enteric Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of an interconnected meshwork of neurons and glia residing within the wall of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While healthy GI function is associated with healthy ENS structure, defined by the normal distribution of neurons within ganglia of the ENS, a comprehensive understanding of normal neuronal distribution and ganglionic organization in the ENS is lacking. Current methodologies for manual enumeration of neurons parse only limited tissue regions and are prone to error, subjective bias, and peer-to-peer discordance. There is accordingly a need for robust, and objective tools that can capture and quantify enteric neurons within multiple ganglia over large areas of tissue. Here, we report on the development of an AI-driven tool, COUNTEN (COUNTing Enteric Neurons), which is capable of accurately identifying and enumerating immunolabeled enteric neurons, and objectively clustering them into ganglia. We tested and found that COUNTEN matches trained humans in its accuracy while taking a fraction of the time to complete the analyses. Finally, we use COUNTEN&rsquo;s accuracy and speed to identify and cluster thousands of ileal myenteric neurons into hundreds of ganglia to compute metrics that help define the normal structure of the ileal myenteric plexus. To facilitate reproducible, robust, and objective measures of ENS structure across mouse models, experiments, and institutions, COUNTEN is freely and openly available to all researchers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Deciphering Spinal Endogenous Dopaminergic Mechanisms That Modulate Micturition Reflexes in Rats with Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spinal neuronal mechanisms regulate recovered involuntary micturition after spinal cord injury (SCI). It was recently discovered that dopamine (DA) is synthesized in the rat injured spinal cord and is involved in lower urinary tract (LUT) activity. To fully understand the role of spinal DAergic machinery in micturition, we examined urodynamic responses in female rats during pharmacological modulation of the DA pathway. Three to four weeks after complete thoracic SCI, the DA precursor L-DOPA administered intravenously during bladder cystometrogram (CMG) and external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) reduced bladder overactivity and increased the duration of EUS bursting, leading to remarkably improved voiding efficiency. Apomorphine (APO), a non-selective DA receptor (DR) agonist, or quinpirole, a selective DR<SUB>2</SUB> agonist, induced similar responses, whereas a specific DR<SUB>2</SUB> antagonist remoxipride alone had only minimal effects. Meanwhile, administration of SCH 23390, a DR<SUB>1</SUB> antagonist, reduced voiding efficiency by increasing tonic EUS activity and shortening the EUS bursting period. Unexpectedly, SKF 38393, a selective DR<SUB>1</SUB> agonist, increased EUS tonic activity, implying a complicated role of DR<SUB>1</SUB> in LUT function. In metabolic cage assays, subcutaneous administration of quinpirole decreased spontaneous voiding frequency and increased voiding volume; L-DOPA and APO were inactive possibly because of slow entry into the CNS. Collectively, tonically active DR<SUB>1</SUB> in SCI rats inhibit urine storage and enhance voiding by differentially modulating EUS tonic and bursting patterns, respectively, while pharmacologic activation of DR<SUB>2</SUB>, which are normally silent, improves voiding by enhancing EUS bursting. Thus, enhancing DA signaling achieves better detrusor-sphincter coordination to facilitate micturition function in SCI rats.</p>

                <p>by Leon Avery, Brian Ingalls, Catherine Dumur, Alexander Artyukhin</p>

We describe a mathematical model for the aggregation of starved first-stage <i>C elegans</i> larvae (L1s). We propose that starved L1s produce and respond chemotactically to two labile diffusible chemical signals, a short-range attractant and a longer range repellent. This model takes the mathematical form of three coupled partial differential equations, one that describes the movement of the worms and one for each of the chemical signals. Numerical solution of these equations produced a pattern of aggregates that resembled that of worm aggregates observed in experiments. We also describe the identification of a sensory receptor gene, <i>srh–2</i>, whose expression is induced under conditions that promote L1 aggregation. Worms whose <i>srh–2</i> gene has been knocked out form irregularly shaped aggregates. Our model suggests this phenotype may be explained by the mutant worms slowing their movement more quickly than the wild type.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Accurate influenza forecasts using type-specific incidence data for small geographic units</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James Turtle, Pete Riley, Michal Ben-Nun, Steven Riley</p>

Influenza incidence forecasting is used to facilitate better health system planning and could potentially be used to allow at-risk individuals to modify their behavior during a severe seasonal influenza epidemic or a novel respiratory pandemic. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs an annual competition to forecast influenza-like illness (ILI) at the regional and national levels in the US, based on a standard discretized incidence scale. Here, we use a suite of forecasting models to analyze type-specific incidence at the smaller spatial scale of clusters of nearby counties. We used data from point-of-care (POC) diagnostic machines over three seasons, in 10 clusters, capturing: 57 counties; 1,061,891 total specimens; and 173,909 specimens positive for Influenza A. Total specimens were closely correlated with comparable CDC ILI data. Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit subpopulations of the cluster (individual counties) separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing during seasonal peaks and guide public health intervention policy during potentially severe novel influenza pandemics.

                <p>by Marcio Gameiro, Tomáš Gedeon, Shane Kepley, Konstantin Mischaikow</p>

We demonstrate a modeling and computational framework that allows for rapid screening of thousands of potential network designs for particular dynamic behavior. To illustrate this capability we consider the problem of hysteresis, a prerequisite for construction of robust bistable switches and hence a cornerstone for construction of more complex synthetic circuits. We evaluate and rank most three node networks according to their ability to robustly exhibit hysteresis where robustness is measured with respect to parameters over multiple dynamic phenotypes. Focusing on the highest ranked networks, we demonstrate how additional robustness and design constraints can be applied. We compare our results to more traditional methods based on specific parameterization of ordinary differential equation models and demonstrate a strong qualitative match at a small fraction of the computational cost.

Ciliates are unicellular eukaryotes with both a germline genome and a somatic genome in the same cytoplasm. The somatic macronucleus (MAC), responsible for gene expression, is not sexually transmitted but develops from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC) at each sexual generation. In the MIC genome of <i>Paramecium tetraurelia</i>, genes are interrupted by tens of thousands of unique intervening sequences called internal eliminated sequences (IESs), which have to be precisely excised during the development of the new MAC to restore functional genes. To understand the evolutionary origin of this peculiar genomic architecture, we sequenced the MIC genomes of 9 <i>Paramecium</i> species (from approximately 100 Mb in <i>Paramecium aurelia</i> species to >1.5 Gb in <i>Paramecium caudatum</i>). We detected several waves of IES gains, both in ancestral and in more recent lineages. While the vast majority of IESs are single copy in present-day genomes, we identified several families of mobile IESs, including nonautonomous elements acquired via horizontal transfer, which generated tens to thousands of new copies. These observations provide the first direct evidence that transposable elements can account for the massive proliferation of IESs in <i>Paramecium</i>. The comparison of IESs of different evolutionary ages indicates that, over time, IESs shorten and diverge rapidly in sequence while they acquire features that allow them to be more efficiently excised. We nevertheless identified rare cases of IESs that are under strong purifying selection across the <i>aurelia</i> clade. The cases examined contain or overlap cellular genes that are inactivated by excision during development, suggesting conserved regulatory mechanisms. Similar to the evolution of introns in eukaryotes, the evolution of <i>Paramecium</i> IESs highlights the major role played by selfish genetic elements in shaping the complexity of genome architecture and gene expression.

                <p>by Hideki Terajima, Mijia Lu, Linda Zhang, Qi Cui, Yanhong Shi, Jianrong Li, Chuan He</p>

Among over 150 distinct RNA modifications, <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing represent 2 of the most studied modifications on mammalian mRNAs. Although both modifications occur on adenosine residues, knowledge on potential functional crosstalk between these 2 modifications is still limited. Here, we show that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification promotes expression levels of the ADAR1, which encodes an A-to-I RNA editing enzyme, in response to interferon (IFN) stimulation. We reveal that YTH <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) mediates up-regulation of ADAR1; YTHDF1 is a reader protein that can preferentially bind m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts and promote translation. Knockdown of YTHDF1 reduces the overall levels of IFN-induced A-to-I RNA editing, which consequently activates dsRNA-sensing pathway and increases expression of various IFN-stimulated genes. Physiologically, YTHDF1 deficiency inhibits virus replication in cells through regulating IFN responses. The A-to-I RNA editing activity of ADAR1 plays important roles in the YTHDF1-dependent IFN responses. Therefore, we uncover that m<sup>6</sup>A and YTHDF1 affect innate immune responses through modulating the ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Educating the future generation of researchers: A cross-disciplinary survey of trends in analysis methods</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Taylor Bolt, Jason S. Nomi, Danilo Bzdok, Lucina Q. Uddin</p>

Methods for data analysis in the biomedical, life, and social (BLS) sciences are developing at a rapid pace. At the same time, there is increasing concern that education in quantitative methods is failing to adequately prepare students for contemporary research. These trends have led to calls for educational reform to undergraduate and graduate quantitative research method curricula. We argue that such reform should be based on data-driven insights into within- and cross-disciplinary use of analytic methods. Our survey of peer-reviewed literature analyzed approximately 1.3 million openly available research articles to monitor the cross-disciplinary mentions of analytic methods in the past decade. We applied data-driven text mining analyses to the “Methods” and “Results” sections of a large subset of this corpus to identify trends in analytic method mentions shared across disciplines, as well as those unique to each discipline. We found that the <i>t</i> test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear regression, chi-squared test, and other classical statistical methods have been and remain the most mentioned analytic methods in biomedical, life science, and social science research articles. However, mentions of these methods have declined as a percentage of the published literature between 2009 and 2020. On the other hand, multivariate statistical and machine learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), have seen a significant increase in the total share of scientific publications. We also found unique groupings of analytic methods associated with each BLS science discipline, such as the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) in psychology, survival models in oncology, and manifold learning in ecology. We discuss the implications of these findings for education in statistics and research methods, as well as within- and cross-disciplinary collaboration.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Insulin‐like growth factor 1 gene transfer for sporadic Alzheimer's disease: New evidence for trophic factor mediated hippocampal neuronal and synaptic recovery‐based behavior improvement</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Patients typically suffer from cognitive impairment imprinted by irreversible neocortex and hippocampal degeneration with overt synaptic and neuron dysfunction. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) has proven to be a potent neuroprotective molecule in animal models of age-related neurodegeneration. In this regard, adenoviral gene transfer aiming at IGF1 brain overexpression has been hitherto an underexplored approach for the sAD treatment. We postulated enhanced IGF1 signaling in the brain as a restorative means in the diseased brain to revert cognitive deficit and restore hippocampal function. We implemented recombinant adenovirus mediated intracerebroventricular IGF1 gene transfer on the streptozotocin (STZ) induced sAD rat model, using 3-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats. This approach enhanced IGF1 signaling in the hippocampus and dampened sAD phosphorylated Tau. We found a remarkable short-term improvement in species-typical behavior, recognition memory, spatial memory, and depressive-like behavior. Histological analysis revealed a significant recovery of immature hippocampal neurons. We additionally recorded an increase in hippocampal microglial cells, which we suggest to exert anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we found decreased levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in the hippocampus of STZ animals. Interestingly, IGF1 gene transfer increased the levels of PSD95 and GAD65/67 synaptic markers, indicating that the treatment enhanced the synaptic plasticity. We conclude that exogenous activation of IGF1 signaling pathway, 1 week after intracerebroventricular STZ administration, protects hippocampal immature neurons, dampens phosphorylated Tau levels, improves synaptic function and therefore performs therapeutically on the sAD STZ model. Hence, this study provides strong evidence for the use of this trophic factor to treat AD and age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Murugappan et al., report that trigeminal neuropathy causes desynchronization and reduces neuronal communications in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-basolateral amygdala neural circuitry, associated with hypomyelination and reduced myelinating cells. The hypomyelination and desynchronization in the ACC lead to poor decision-making in male rats.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Infraorbital nerve-chronic constriction injury (ION-CCI) has become the most popular chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) injury animal model which causes prolonged mechanical allodynia. Accumulative evidence suggests that TNP interferes with cognitive functions, however the underlying mechanisms are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate decision-making performance as well as synaptic and large-scale neural synchronized alterations in the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) circuitry and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neural circuitry in male rats with TNP. Rat gambling task showed that ION-CCI led to decrease the proportion of good decision makers and increase the proportion of poor decision makers. Electrophysiological recordings showed long-lasting synaptic potentiation of local field potential in the trigeminal ganglia-SpV caudalis (SpVc) synapses in TNP rats. In this study, TNP led to disruption of ACC spike timing and basolateral amygdala (BLA) theta oscillation associated with suppressed synchronization of theta oscillation between the BLA and ACC, indicating reduced neuronal communications. Myelination is critical for information flow between brain regions, and myelin plasticity is an important feature for learning. Neural activity in the cortical regions impacts myelination by regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation, differentiation, and myelin formation. We characterized newly formed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and mature OLs are reduced in TNP and are associated with reduced myelin strength in the ACC region. The functional disturbances in the BLA-ACC neural circuitry is pathologically associated with the myelin defects in the ACC region which may be relevant causes for the deficits in decision-making in chronic TNP state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neurofluids—Deep inspiration, cilia and preloading of the astrocytic network</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With the advent of real-time MRI, the motion and passage of cerebrospinal fluid can be visualized without gating and exclusion of low-frequency waves. This imaging modality gives insights into low-volume, rapidly oscillating cardiac-driven movement as well as sustained, high-volume, slowly oscillating inspiration-driven movement. Inspiration means a spontaneous or artificial increase in the intrathoracic dimensions independent of body position. Alterations in thoracic diameter enable the thoracic and spinal epidural venous compartments to be emptied and filled, producing an upward surge of cerebrospinal fluid inside the spine during inspiration; this surge counterbalances the downward pooling of venous blood toward the heart. Real-time MRI, as a macroscale in vivo observation method, could expand our knowledge of neurofluid dynamics, including how astrocytic fluid preloading is adjusted and how brain buoyancy and turgor are maintained in different postures and zero gravity. Along with these macroscale findings, new microscale insights into aquaporin-mediated fluid transfer, its sensing by cilia, and its tuning by nitric oxide will be reviewed. By incorporating clinical knowledge spanning several disciplines, certain disorders—congenital hydrocephalus with Chiari malformation, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and adult idiopathic hydrocephalus—are interpreted and reviewed according to current concepts, from the basics of the interrelated systems to their pathology.</p>

                Ventricular non-compaction (VNC) is a rare myocardium disorder, which can be both genetic and sporadic. A poor wall compaction process or an excessive trabeculae formation may be at the genesis of myocardial hypertrabeculation with multiple recesses. It is often complicated by ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias and cardiac embolism. Herein we report a case of a 20-year-old male patient with no particular past medical history who was followed up at the cardiology department for dyspnea. Echocardiography showed reduced ejection fraction of the left ventricle with potential hypertrabeculation in the right ventricle, confirmed by cardiac MRI. The patient was not put under medication and was later lost to follow-up. He died few months later without a clear cause explaining death. A forensic autopsy was performed that attributed death to acute ventricle arrhythmia secondary to VNC, emphasizing the major role of an early and specific treatment to avoid such a fatal outcome.

                Background: In Malaysia, B40 communities are those with a median monthly household earning of under RM 3166. With the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown, the livelihoods of those in these areas has been severely impacted. This has increased their vulnerability to psychological afflictions and has led to a poorer perception of their quality of life (QoL) in comparison to the rest of the population. We investigated the association between perceived levels of depression, anxiety and stress and their impact on quality of life (QoL) among B40 residents in a low-cost urban housing area in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2020 and February 2021 in the Seri Pantai housing settlement. The validated Malay versions of the depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (DASS-21) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life, brief (WHOQOL-BREF) were distributed to the participants using Google forms. The statistical significance of the association between subscales of depression, anxiety, stress and QoL domains were assessed using the Pearson’s correlation test. Results: Of the 180 participants, the majority were Malays (87.2%) and females (82.2%).  The average scores were the highest for stress (5.66 ± 4.59) and the score in the environment domain of QoL (59.27 ± 17.23) was the lowest. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the subscales of DASS-21 and the four domains of the QoL, with the social relationships and psychological domains showing a highly significant association (p < 0.001). The strongest correlation was observed between the psychological domain and depression (r= -.520) followed by psychological domain and stress (r= -.496). Conclusion: The strongest correlation was observed between psychological domain and depression. This suggests a need to address potential devastating mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the QoL of residents in B40 communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PhD students in life sciences can benefit from team cohesion [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Scientific progress during doctoral studies is a combination of individual effort and teamwork. A recently growing body of interdisciplinary literature has investigated the determinants of early career success in academia, in which learning from supervisors and co-authors play a great role. Yet, it is less understood how collaboration patterns of the research team, in which the doctoral student participates, influences the future career of students. Here we take a social network analysis approach to investigate this and define the research team as the co-authorship network of the student. Methods: We use the Hungarian Scientific Bibliography Database, which includes all publications of PhD students who defended theses from the year 1993. The data also include thesis information, and the publications of co-authors of students. Using this data, we quantify cohesion in the ego-network of PhD students, the impact measured by citations received, and productivity measured by number of publications. We run multivariate linear regressions to measure the relation of network cohesion, and publication outputs during doctoral years with future impact. Results: We find that those students in life sciences, but not in other fields, who have a cohesive co-author network during studies and two years after defence receive significantly more citations in eight years. We find that the number of papers published during PhD years and closely after the defence correlates negatively while the impact of these papers correlates positively with future success of students in all fields. Conclusions: These results highlight that research teams are effective learning environments for PhD students where collaborations create a tightly knit knowledge network.

                Fecaloma is an accumulation of hardened impacted stool typically occurring in the sigmoid colon and rectum. It mainly affects elderly and bedridden patients suffering from chronic constipation and can be revealed by different signs. We report a case of 74-year-old female, with anorexia, Alzheimer’s disease, and chronic constipation, who was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and anuria. Clinical examination showed fever, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13/15, tachycardia with a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, polypnea with hypoxia, foci of crepitant rales in pulmonary auscultation and a tender hypogastric mass with mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. Digital rectal examination revealed hard fecal material. Computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated bilateral pulmonary parenchymal condensation and a huge heterogeneous fecaloma in the sigmoid colon and rectum compressing the bladder. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of giant fecaloma causing aspiration pneumonia and urinary retention was retained. Manual disimpaction and bowel enemas were done but they were unsuccessful and surgical treatment was refused. Ultimately the patient died due to septic shock. Early diagnosis should be made to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evolution of human respiratory virus epidemics [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pathogens are often assumed to evolve towards reduced virulence, but counterexamples abound. Faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) and the overall disease burden. Considerable effort has been invested towards developing a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although many approaches accurately recapitulate complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between CFR and infection rate. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Methods: A compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity is constructed and evaluated at both short timescales and at equilibrium. Results: We reveal kinetic constraints whereby variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased CFR and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as smallpox, are often constrained by the host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: Evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in CFR should not be assumed. These results agree with previous work demonstrating an increase in virulence for smallpox and further predict that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. Herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and viruses with similar life history traits might be unachievable without vaccination. However, partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect on the epidemic dynamics not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by changing the evolutionary trajectory of moderate CFR viruses towards reduced CFR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Discrepancy between Clove and Non-Clove Cigarette Smoke-Promoted Candida albicans Biofilm Formation with Precoating RNA-aptamer [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                This study explores the influence of precoating aptamer (Ca-apt1) on C. albicans viability while the fungus was growing in the presence of exposing condensed cigarette smoke (CSC), prepared from clove (CCSC) and non-clove (NCSC) cigarettes, for 48 h. Using qPCR, we found that mRNA expression of adhesion-associated genes (ALS3 and HWP1) was impaired by precoating C. albicans yeast cells with the aptamer. Conversely, the gene transcription was upregulated when aptamer-uncoated yeast was pre-treated with either CSC. In addition, by analysing the result of MTT ([3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay, we found that the presence of added CCSC or NCSC in growth medium for 48 h was significantly enhanced C. albicans biofilm development. However, the presence of precoated aptamer was significantly impaired biofilm development accelerated by the NCSC. The inhibitory effect of the Ca-apt1 was not dependent on the precoated aptamer (1ng/μL and 10 ng/μL). Interestingly, we noted that the enhancer effect of treated CCSC was no longer effective when the yeast had been precoated with 10 ng/μL aptamer tested. Additionally, light microscopy analysis revealed that precoating aptamer alleviates morphological changes of C. albicans (from yeast to hypha formation) that are enhanced by adding CCSC or NCSC in the growth medium. In conclusion, these results suggest that administration on Ca-ap1 exhibits a significant protective effect on CSC-induced biofilm formation by C. albicans.

                In March 2019, 45 scientists and software engineers from around the world converged at the University of California, Santa Cruz for the first pangenomics codeathon. The purpose of the meeting was to propose technical specifications and standards for a usable human pangenome as well as to build relevant tools for genome graph infrastructures. During the meeting, the group held several intense and productive discussions covering a diverse set of topics, including advantages of graph genomes over a linear reference representation, design of new methods that can leverage graph-based data structures, and novel visualization and annotation approaches for pangenomes. Additionally, the participants self-organized themselves into teams that worked intensely over a three-day period to build a set of pipelines and tools for specific pangenomic applications. A summary of the questions raised and the tools developed are reported in this manuscript.

Here, Ricci Hannah and Adam Aron provide an update of studies of this circuit, discuss its clinical relevance, and consider whether its action-stopping function applies in real-world scenarios, beyond the laboratory.

                Keratin intermediate filaments are an essential and major component of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. They form a stable yet dynamic filamentous network extending from the nucleus to the cell periphery, which provides resistance to mechanical stresses. Mutations in keratin genes are related to a variety of epithelial tissue diseases. Despite their importance, the molecular structure of keratin filaments remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the structure of keratin 5/keratin 14 filaments within ghost mouse keratinocytes by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. By averaging a large number of keratin segments, we have gained insights into the helical architecture of the filaments. Two-dimensional classification revealed profound variations in the diameter of keratin filaments and their subunit organization. Computational reconstitution of filaments of substantial length uncovered a high degree of internal heterogeneity along single filaments, which can contain regions of helical symmetry, regions with less symmetry and regions with significant diameter fluctuations. Cross section views of filaments revealed that keratins form hollow cylinders consisting of multiple protofilaments, with an electron dense core located in the center of the filament. These findings shed light on the complex and remarkable heterogenic architecture of keratin filaments, suggesting that they are highly flexible, dynamic cytoskeletal structures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Murine muscle stem cell response to perturbations of the neuromuscular junction are attenuated with aging</a></h4>

              
                During aging and neuromuscular diseases, there is a progressive loss of skeletal muscle volume and function impacting mobility and quality of life. Muscle loss is often associated with denervation and a loss of resident muscle stem cells (satellite cells or MuSCs), however, the relationship between MuSCs and innervation has not been established. Herein, we administered severe neuromuscular trauma to a transgenic murine model that permits MuSC lineage tracing. We show that a subset of MuSCs specifically engraft in a position proximal to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synapse between myofibers and motor neurons, in healthy young adult muscles. In aging and in a mouse model of neuromuscular degeneration (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase knockout – <i>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup></i>), this localized engraftment behavior was reduced. Genetic rescue of motor neurons in <i>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mice reestablished integrity of the NMJ in a manner akin to young muscle and partially restored MuSC ability to engraft into positions proximal to the NMJ. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of MuSCs isolated from aged muscle, we demonstrate that a subset of MuSCs are molecularly distinguishable from MuSCs responding to myofiber injury and share similarity to synaptic myonuclei. Collectively, these data reveal unique features of MuSCs that respond to synaptic perturbations caused by aging and other stressors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Eukaryotic initiation factor EIF-3.G augments mRNA translation efficiency to regulate neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                The translation initiation complex eIF3 imparts specialized functions to regulate protein expression. However, understanding of eIF3 activities in neurons remains limited despite widespread dysregulation of eIF3 subunits in neurological disorders. Here, we report a selective role of the <i>C. elegans </i>RNA-binding subunit EIF-3.G in shaping the neuronal protein landscape. We identify a missense mutation in the conserved Zinc-Finger (ZF) of EIF-3.G that acts in a gain-of-function manner to dampen neuronal hyperexcitation. Using neuron type-specific seCLIP, we systematically mapped EIF-3.G-mRNA interactions and identified EIF-3.G occupancy on GC-rich 5′UTRs of a select set of mRNAs enriched in activity-dependent functions. We demonstrate that the ZF mutation in EIF-3.G alters translation in a 5′UTR dependent manner. Our study reveals an <i>in vivo</i> mechanism for eIF3 in governing neuronal protein levels to control neuronal activity states and offers insights into how eIF3 dysregulation contributes to neuronal disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Scanned optogenetic control of mammalian somatosensory input to map input-specific behavioral outputs</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory stimuli guide and shape behavior, from immediate protective reflexes to longer-term learning and higher-order processes related to pain and touch. However, somatosensory inputs are challenging to control in awake mammals due to the diversity and nature of contact stimuli. Application of cutaneous stimuli is currently limited to relatively imprecise methods as well as subjective behavioral measures. The strategy we present here overcomes these difficulties, achieving 'remote touch' with spatiotemporally precise and dynamic optogenetic stimulation by projecting light to a small defined area of skin. We mapped behavioral responses in freely behaving mice with specific nociceptor and low-threshold mechanoreceptor inputs. In nociceptors, sparse recruitment of single action potentials shapes rapid protective pain-related behaviors, including coordinated head orientation and body repositioning that depend on the initial body pose. In contrast, activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptors elicited slow-onset behaviors and more subtle whole-body behaviors. The strategy can be used to define specific behavioral repertoires, examine the timing and nature of reflexes, and dissect sensory, motor, cognitive and motivational processes guiding behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decoding locomotion from population neural activity in moving C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the neural representation of locomotion in the nematode C. elegans by recording population calcium activity during movement. We report that population activity more accurately decodes locomotion than any single neuron. Relevant signals are distributed across neurons with diverse tunings to locomotion. Two largely distinct subpopulations are informative for decoding velocity and curvature, and different neurons’ activities contribute features relevant for different aspects of a behavior or different instances of a behavioral motif. To validate our measurements, we labeled neurons AVAL and AVAR and found that their activity exhibited expected transients during backward locomotion. Finally, we compared population activity during movement and immobilization. Immobilization alters the correlation structure of neural activity and its dynamics. Some neurons positively correlated with AVA during movement become negatively correlated during immobilization and vice versa. This work provides needed experimental measurements that inform and constrain ongoing efforts to understand population dynamics underlying locomotion in C. elegans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NirD curtails the stringent response by inhibiting RelA activity in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria regulate their metabolism to adapt and survive adverse conditions, in particular to stressful downshifts in nutrient availability. These shifts trigger the so-called stringent response, coordinated by the signaling molecules guanosine tetra and pentaphosphate collectively referred to as (p)ppGpp. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, accumulation of theses alarmones depends on the (p)ppGpp synthetase RelA and the bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase SpoT. A tight regulation of these intracellular activities is therefore crucial to rapidly adjust the (p)ppGpp levels in response to environmental stresses but also to avoid toxic consequences of (p)ppGpp over-accumulation. In this study, we show that the small protein NirD restrains RelA-dependent accumulation of (p)ppGpp and can inhibit the stringent response in <i>E. coli</i>. Mechanistically, our in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that NirD directly binds the catalytic domains of RelA to balance (p)ppGpp accumulation. Finally, we show that NirD can control RelA activity by directly inhibiting the rate of (p)ppGpp synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interrogating theoretical models of neural computation with emergent property inference</a></h4>

              
                A cornerstone of theoretical neuroscience is the circuit model: a system of equations that captures a hypothesized neural mechanism. Such models are valuable when they give rise to an experimentally observed phenomenon -- whether behavioral or a pattern of neural activity -- and thus can offer insights into neural computation. The operation of these circuits, like all models, critically depends on the choice of model parameters. A key step is then to identify the model parameters consistent with observed phenomena: to solve the inverse problem. In this work, we present a novel technique, emergent property inference (EPI), that brings the modern probabilistic modeling toolkit to theoretical neuroscience. When theorizing circuit models, theoreticians predominantly focus on reproducing computational properties rather than a particular dataset. Our method uses deep neural networks to learn parameter distributions with these computational properties. This methodology is introduced through a motivational example of parameter inference in the stomatogastric ganglion. EPI is then shown to allow precise control over the behavior of inferred parameters and to scale in parameter dimension better than alternative techniques. In the remainder of this work, we present novel theoretical findings in models of primary visual cortex and superior colliculus, which were gained through the examination of complex parametric structure captured by EPI. Beyond its scientific contribution, this work illustrates the variety of analyses possible once deep learning is harnessed towards solving theoretical inverse problems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An autoinhibitory clamp of actin assembly constrains and directs synaptic endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic membrane-remodeling events such as endocytosis require force-generating actin assembly. The endocytic machinery that regulates these actin and membrane dynamics localizes at high concentrations to large areas of the presynaptic membrane, but actin assembly and productive endocytosis are far more restricted in space and time. Here we describe a mechanism whereby autoinhibition clamps the presynaptic endocytic machinery to limit actin assembly to discrete functional events. We found that collective interactions between the <i>Drosophila</i> endocytic proteins Nwk/FCHSD2, Dap160/intersectin, and WASp relieve Nwk autoinhibition and promote robust membrane-coupled actin assembly in vitro. Using automated particle tracking to quantify synaptic actin dynamics in vivo, we discovered that Nwk-Dap160 interactions constrain spurious assembly of WASp-dependent actin structures. These interactions also promote synaptic endocytosis, suggesting that autoinhibition both clamps and primes the synaptic endocytic machinery, thereby constraining actin assembly to drive productive membrane remodeling in response to physiological cues.

                Mutations in TP53 occur commonly in the majority of human tumors and confer aggressive tumor phenotypes, including metastasis and therapy resistance. CB002 and structural-analogs restore p53 signaling in tumors with mutant-p53 but we find that unlike other xanthines such as caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline, they do not deregulate the G2 checkpoint. Novel CB002-analogs induce pro-apoptotic Noxa protein in an ATF3/4-dependent manner, whereas caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline do not. By contrast to caffeine, CB002-analogs target an S-phase checkpoint associated with increased p-RPA/RPA2, p-ATR, decreased Cyclin A, p-histone H3 expression, and downregulation of essential proteins in DNA-synthesis and DNA-repair. CB002-analog #4 enhances cell death, and decreases Ki-67 in patient-derived tumor-organoids without toxicity to normal human cells. Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy in mice. Thus, a novel class of anti-cancer drugs shows the activation of p53 pathway signaling in tumors with mutated p53, and targets an S-phase checkpoint.

                To control reaching, the nervous system must generate large changes in muscle activation to drive the limb toward the target, and must also make smaller adjustments for precise and accurate behavior. Motor cortex controls the arm through projections to diverse targets across the central nervous system, but it has been challenging to identify the roles of cortical projections to specific targets. Here, we selectively disrupt cortico-cerebellar communication in the mouse by optogenetically stimulating the pontine nuclei in a cued reaching task. This perturbation did not typically block movement initiation, but degraded the precision, accuracy, duration, or success rate of the movement. Correspondingly, cerebellar and cortical activity during movement were largely preserved, but differences in hand velocity between control and stimulation conditions predicted from neural activity were correlated with observed velocity differences. These results suggest that while the total output of motor cortex drives reaching, the cortico-cerebellar loop makes small adjustments that contribute to the successful execution of this dexterous movement.

                Neurons are highly polarized cells forming an intricate network of dendrites and axons. They are shaped by the dynamic reorganization of cytoskeleton components and cellular organelles. Axon branching allows to form new paths and increases circuit complexity. However, our understanding of branch formation is sparse due to technical limitations. Using in situ cellular cryo-electron tomography on primary mouse neurons, we directly visualized the remodeling of organelles and cytoskeleton structures at axon branches. Strikingly, branched areas functioned as hotspots concentrating organelles to support dynamic activities. Unaligned actin filaments assembled at the base of premature branches and remained while filopodia diminished. Microtubules and ER co-migrated into preformed branches to support outgrowth together with accumulating compact ~500 nm mitochondria and locally clustered ribosomes. We obtained a roadmap of events and present the first direct evidence of local protein synthesis selectively taking place at axon branches, allowing to serve as unique control hubs for axon development and downstream neural network formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-species comparison of human and rodent primary reward consumption under budget constraints</a></h4>

              
                We live in a world of limited resources. Optimal use of resources is therefore of great importance for survival. Previous studies have shown that rodents optimize their allocation of a limited number of operant responses (akin to a finite budget) to trade for food rewards. Here, we propose a novel human cost-benefit decision paradigm translated from an economic choice task initially developed for rodents, to examine human consumption of primary rewards in a budget-constrained consumption scenario. In the first study, heterosexual male participants made effortful presses to obtain the opportunity to watch erotic pictures (task 1: picture task) or drink milk rewards (task 2: milk task) with a limited budget (i.e. finite total amount of presses). Participants adapted their choice allocation when the price (i.e. number of presses required to produce a reward) and the budget changed. We compared our participants' choice pattern to that of rodent consumers performing a matched economic decision task. Our cross-species comparison suggests that humans responded to price and budget changes in a similar way as rat consumers when purchasing milk rewards. However, this was not the case when purchasing the opportunity to watch picture rewards: compared to the milk task and to the rodent task, participants made more internally inconsistent choices in the picture task that failed to comply to the requirements of rational choice theory, despite otherwise identical task structure. We found non-linear changes in arousal state as a function of choice selection of rewards that might potentially underlie the increased choice inconsistency in the picture task. In two control experiments, we replicated our main findings. Our study shows that humans and rodents comply surprisingly well to the predictions of rational choice theory, but that deviations from the rational ideal can be elicited depending on the reward type.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Muscarinic receptors mediate motivation via preparatory neural activity in humans</a></h4>

              
                Motivation depends on dopamine, but might be modulated by acetylcholine which influences dopamine release in the striatum, and amplifies motivation in animal studies. A corresponding effect in humans would be important clinically, since anticholinergic drugs are frequently used in Parkinson's disease, a condition that can also disrupt motivation. Reward and dopamine make us more ready to respond, as indexed by reaction times (RT), and move faster, sometimes termed vigour. These effects may be controlled by preparatory processes that can be tracked using EEG. We measured vigour in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of trihexyphenidyl (THP), a muscarinic antagonist, with an incentivised eye movement task and EEG. Participants responded faster and with greater vigour when incentives were high, but THP blunted these motivation effects, suggesting that muscarinic receptors facilitate invigoration by reward. Preparatory EEG build-up (contingent negative variation; CNV) was strengthened by high incentives and by muscarinic blockade. The amplitude of preparatory activity predicted both vigour and RT, although over distinct scalp regions. Frontal activity predicted vigour, whereas a larger, earlier, central component predicted RT. Indeed the incentivisation of RT was partly mediated by the CNV, though vigour was not. Moreover, the CNV mediated the drug's effect on dampening incentives, suggesting that muscarinic receptors underlie the motivational influence on this preparatory activity. Taken together, these findings show that a muscarinic blocker used to treat Parkinson's disease impairs motivated action in healthy people, and that medial frontal preparatory neural activity mediates this for RT.

                Creative cognition relies on the ability to form remote associations between concepts, which allows to generate novel ideas or solve new problems. Such an ability is related to the organisation of semantic memory; yet whether real-life creative behaviour relies on semantic memory organisation and its neural substrates remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored associations between brain functional connectivity patterns, network properties of individual semantic memory, and real-life creativity. We acquired multi-echo functional MRI data while participants underwent a semantic relatedness judgment task. These ratings were used to estimate their individual semantic memory networks, whose properties significantly predicted their real-life creativity. Using a connectome-based predictive modelling approach, we identified patterns of task-based functional connectivity that predicted creativity-related semantic memory network properties. Furthermore, these properties mediated the relationship between functional connectivity and real-life creativity. These results provide new insights into how brain connectivity supports the associative mechanisms of creativity.

                Animal research on anxiety and anxiety disorders relies on valid animal models of anxiety. However, the validity of widely used rodent behavioural tests of anxiety has repeatedly been questioned, as they often fail to produce consistent results across independent replicate studies using different study populations or different anxiolytic compounds. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of behavioural tests of anxiety in mice to detect anxiolytic effects of drugs prescribed to treat anxiety in humans. To this end, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review of studies reporting tests of anxiolytic compounds against a control treatment using common behavioural tests of anxiety in mice. PubMed and EMBASE were searched on August 21 st 2019 for studies published in English and 814 papers were identified for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed based on Syrcles risk of bias tool and the Camarades study quality checklist on a randomly selected subsample of 180 papers. Meta-analyses on effect sizes of treatments using standardized mean differences (Hedges g) showed that only two of 17 test measures reliably detected effects of anxiolytic compounds other than diazepam. Further, we report considerable variation in both direction and size of effects of most anxiolytics on most outcome variables, indicating poor replicability of test results. This was corroborated by high heterogeneity in most test measures. Finally, we found an overall high risk of bias. Our findings indicate a general lack of sensitivity of common behavioural tests of anxiety in mice to anxiolytic compounds and cast serious doubt on both construct and predictive validity of most of those tests. The use of animals to model human conditions can be justified only if the expected results are informative, reproducible, and translatable. In view of scientifically valid and ethically responsible research, we call for a revision of behavioural tests of anxiety in mice and the development of more predictive tests .

                Recent studies report that socioeconomic status (SES) correlates with brain structure. Yet, such findings are variable and little is known about underlying causes. We present a well-powered voxel-based analysis of grey matter volume (GMV) across levels of SES, finding many small SES effects widely distributed across the brain, including cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions. We also construct a polygenic index of SES to control for the additive effects of common genetic variation related to SES, which attenuates observed SES-GMV relations, to different degrees in different areas. Remaining variance, which may be attributable to environmental factors, is substantially accounted for by body mass index, a marker for lifestyle related to SES. In sum, SES affects multiple brain regions through measurable genetic and environmental effects.

                Young people exhibit a negative BOLD response in ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) when making unilateral movements, such as button presses. This negative BOLD response becomes more positive as people age. Here we investigated why this occurs, in terms of the underlying effective connectivity and haemodynamics. We applied dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to task fMRI data from 635 participants aged 18-88 from the Cam-CAN dataset, who performed a cued button pressing task with their right hand. We found that connectivity from contralateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) to ipsilateral M1 became more positive with age, explaining 44% of the variability across people in ipsilateral M1 responses. Neurovascular and haemodynamic parameters in the model were not able to explain the age-related shift to positive BOLD. Our results add to a body of evidence implicating neural, rather than vascular factors as the predominant cause of negative BOLD - while emphasising the importance of inter-hemispheric connectivity. This study provides a foundation for investigating the clinical and lifestyle factors that determine the sign and amplitude of the M1 BOLD response, which could serve as a proxy for neural and vascular health, via the underlying neurovascular mechanisms.

                Many studies have shown that the human endocrine system modulates brain function, reporting associations between fluctuations in hormone concentrations and both brain activity and connectivity. However, how hormonal fluctuations impact fast changes in brain network structure over short timescales remains unknown. Here, we leverage ``edge time series'' analysis to investigate the relationship between high-amplitude network states and quotidian variation in sex steroid and gonadotropic hormones in a single individual sampled over the course of two endocrine states, across a natural menstrual cycle and under a hormonal regimen. We find that the frequency of high-amplitude network states are associated with follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone, but not the sex hormones estradiol and progesterone. Nevertheless, we show that scan-to-scan variation in the co-fluctuation patterns expressed during network states are robustly linked with the concentration of all four hormones, positing a network-level target of hormonal control. We conclude by speculating on the role of hormones in shaping ongoing brain dynamics.

                Skeletal muscle dysfunction, wasting and synaptic pathology is a hallmark of Huntingtons disease (HD). Similar as for the nervous system the pathological lesions and clinical symptoms progressively worsen with disease coarse. Cell-to-cell transmission of toxic mutant huntingtin (mHTT) has been shown to occur and could be a potential explanation for the progressive accumulation of pathological lesions and clinical symptoms in time. However, the mechanism and contribution of mHTT cell-to-cell transmission to pathology in an environment of ubiquitous expression of the mutant protein is not well understood. Here, we show that the HD-associated mHTT exon 1 (mHTTEx1) is transmitted from human induced pluripotent stem cell- (hiPSC-) derived motor neurons (MNs) to isogenic hiPSC-derived myotubes across functionally active neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and in vivo in wild-type mice from the M1 motor cortex to spinal MNs and skeletal muscles. Increased synaptic connectivity and activity enhances transmission. Also, our data reveals that transmission happens prior to aggregate formation and that aggregation occurs progressively with continuous transmission across weeks at the myotube surface. Furthermore, we provide evidence that mHTTEx1 derived from MNs causes defragmentation of mitochondria and exacerbates nuclear aggregation, the latter in the presence of myotube autonomous mHTTEx1. Finally, we find that mHTTEx1 transmission results in decreased myotube contractions, in contrast myotube autonomous expression causes a hyperexcitable-like phenotype. Altogether, our data suggests that mHTTEx1 neuromuscular transmission contributes to skeletal muscle dysfunction in HD, via continuous transmission of the toxic protein already at early preclinical stages of HD and thereby contributes to an increasing accumulation of toxic protein in skeletal muscle, eventually leading to a highly-selective phenotype resulting in a decline of skeletal muscle function. Since multiple studies support a role of synaptic transmission of diverse misfolded proteins, including tau in Alzheimers, alpha-synuclein in Parkinsons, mHTT in HD, tdp-43 in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia, in the central nervous system, this process likely represents a common synaptic-linked pathobiological pathway for most neurodegenerative protein misfolding diseases.

                Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) is a surface receptor that, in the central nervous system, is exclusively expressed on microglia. TREM2 variants have been linked to increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases, but the functional effects of microglial TREM2 remain largely unknown. To this end, we investigated TAR-DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43)-related neurodegenerative disease via viral-mediated expression of human TDP-43 protein (hTDP-43) in neonatal and adult mice or inducible expression of hTDP43 with defective nuclear localization signals in transgenic mice. We found that TREM2 deficiency impaired microglia phagocytic clearance of pathological TDP-43, and enhanced neuronal damage and motor function impairments. Mass cytometry analysis revealed that hTDP-43 induced a TREM2-dependent subpopulation of microglia with high CD11c expression and higher phagocytic ability. Using mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance analysis, we further demonstrated an interaction between TDP-43 and TREM2, in vitro and in vivo, in hTDP-43-expressing transgenic mouse brains. We computationally identified the region within hTDP-43 that interacts with TREM2 and observed the potential interaction in ALS patient tissues. Our data reveal the novel interaction between TREM2 and TDP-43, highlighting that TDP-43 is a possible ligand for microglial TREM2 and the interaction mediates neuroprotection of microglial TREM2 in TDP-43-related neurodegeneration.

                Early life adversity (ELA) comprises a wide variety of negative experiences during early life and has been linked to cognitive impairments, reduced experiences of pleasure (anhedonia), and other long-term consequences implying that ELA impacts the reward circuitry. In this study, we focused on the projections from the dorsal raphe (DR) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and on to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), an important pathway within the reward circuit. We hypothesized that ELA alters connectivity within the DR-VTA-NAcc pathway, manifested behaviorally as anhedonia in adulthood. We used the limited bedding and nesting model to induce ELA in mice and measured reward-related behaviors in adulthood using the three-chamber social interaction and sucrose preference tests. High resolution ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired and processed for regional DTI metrics, including tractography to assess circuit organization. We found brain-wide changes in radial diffusivity (RD) and altered connectivity of the reward circuit in the ELA group. DR-VTA-NAcc circuit tractography and axial diffusivity (AD) along this tract exhibited dispersed organization where AD was increased in the VTA segment. Behaviorally, ELA elicited an anhedonic phenotype in adulthood with decreased direct social approach and time spent with peer but no overt differences in sucrose preference test. Our findings suggest that reward circuits, assessed using DTI, are altered following ELA and that these changes may drive enduring reward deficits.

                Previous studies demonstrate that semantics, the higher level meaning of multi-modal stimuli, can impact multisensory integration. Valence, an affective response to images, has not yet been tested in non-priming response time (RT) or temporal order judgement (TOJ) tasks. This study aims to investigate both semantic congruency and valence of non-speech audiovisual stimuli on multisensory integration via RT and TOJ tasks (assessing processing speed (RT), point of subjective simultaneity (PSS), and time-window when multisensory stimuli are likely to be perceived as simultaneous (Temporal Binding Window; TBW)). Forty participants (mean age: 26.25; females=17) were recruited from Prolific Academic resulting in 37 complete datasets. Both congruence and valence have a significant main effect on RT (congruent and high valence decrease RT) as well as an interaction effect (congruent/high valence condition being significantly faster than all others). For TOJ, images high in valence require visual stimuli to be presented significantly earlier than auditory stimuli in order for the audio and visual stimuli to be perceived as simultaneous. Further, a significant interaction effect of congruence and valence on the PSS revealed that the congruent/high valence condition was significantly earlier than all other conditions. A subsequent analysis shows there is a positive correlation between the TBW width (b-values) and RT (as the TBW widens, the RT increases) for the categories that differed most from 0 in their PSS (Congruent/High and Incongruent/Low). This study provides new evidence that supports previous research on semantic congruency and presents a novel incorporation of valence into behavioural responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emotional context sculpts action goal representations in the lateral frontal pole</a></h4>

              
                Emotional states provide an ever-present source of contextual information that should inform behavioral goals. Despite the ubiquity of emotional signals in our environment, the neural mechanisms underlying their influence on goal-directed action remains unclear. Prior work suggests that the lateral frontal pole (FPl) is uniquely positioned to integrate affective information into cognitive control representations. We used pattern similarity analysis to examine the content of representations in FPl and interconnected mid-lateral prefrontal and amygdala circuitry. Healthy participants (n=37; n=21 females) were scanned while undergoing an event-related Affective Go/No-Go task, which requires goal-oriented action selection during emotional processing. We found that FPl contained conjunctive emotion-action goal representations that were related to successful cognitive control during emotional processing. These representations differed from conjunctive emotion-action goal representations found in the basolateral amygdala. While robust action goal representations were present in mid-lateral prefrontal cortex, they were not modulated by emotional valence. Finally, converging results from functional connectivity and multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that FPl's emotional valence signals likely originated from interconnected subgenual ACC (BA25), which was in turn functionally coupled with the amygdala. Thus, our results identify a key pathway by which internal emotional states influence goal-directed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The timescale and magnitude of aperiodic activity decreases with cortical depth in humans, macaques and mice</a></h4>

              
                Cortical dynamics obey a 1/f power law, exhibiting an exponential decay of spectral power with increasing frequency. The slope and offset of this 1/f decay reflect the timescale and magnitude of aperiodic neural activity, respectively. These properties are tightly linked to cellular and circuit mechanisms (e.g. excitation:inhibition balance, firing rates) as well as cognitive processes (perception, memory, state). However, the physiology underlying the 1/f power law in cortical dynamics is not well understood. Here, we compared laminar recordings from human, macaque and mouse cortex to evaluate how 1/f aperiodic dynamics vary across cortical layers and species. We report that 1/f slope is steepest in superficial layers and flattest in deep layers in each species. Additionally, the magnitude of this 1/f decay is greatest in superficial cortex and decreases with depth. Both of these findings can be accounted for by a simple model in which transmembrane currents have longer time constants and greater densities in superficial cortical layers. Together, our results provide novel mechanistic insight into aperiodic dynamics in cortex and suggest that the timescale and magnitude of aperiodic cortical currents decrease with cortical depth.

                The value of an integrated approach for understanding the neocortex by combining functional characterization of single neuron activity with the underlying circuit architecture has been understood since the dawn of modern neuroscience. However, in practice, anatomical connectivity and physiology have been studied mostly separately. Following in the footsteps of previous studies that have combined physiology and anatomy in the same tissue, here we present a unique functional connectomics dataset that contains calcium imaging of an estimated 75,000 neurons from primary visual cortex (VISp) and three higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm), that were recorded while a mouse viewed natural movies and parametric stimuli. The functional data were co-registered with electron microscopy (EM) data of the same volume which were automatically segmented, reconstructing more than 200,000 cells (neuronal and non-neuronal) and 524 million synapses. Subsequent proofreading of some neurons in this volume yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections. The largest proofread excitatory axon reached a length of 19 mm and formed 1,893 synapses, while the largest inhibitory axon formed 10,081 synapses. Here we release this dataset as an open access resource to the scientific community including a set of analysis tools that allows easy data access, both programmatically and through a web user interface.

                Synaptotagmin-1 (syt1) is a Ca2+ sensor that regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Cell-based experiments suggest that syt1 functions as a multimer, however biochemical and electron microscopy studies have yielded contradictory findings regarding putative self-association. Here, we performed dynamic light scattering on syt1 in solution, followed by electron microscopy, and used atomic force microscopy to study syt1 self-association on supported lipid bilayers under aqueous conditions. Ring-like multimers were clearly observed. Multimerization was enhanced by Ca2+ and required anionic phospholipids. Large ring-like structures (~180 nm) were reduced to smaller rings (~30 nm) upon neutralization of a cluster of juxtamembrane lysine residues; further substitution of residues in the second C2-domain completely abolished self-association. When expressed in neurons, syt1 mutants with graded reductions in self-association activity exhibited concomitant reductions in: a) clamping spontaneous release, and b) triggering and synchronizing evoked release. Thus, the juxtamembrane linker of syt1 plays a crucial role in exocytosis by mediating multimerization.

                Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of epilepsies with early onset and severe symptoms that sometimes lead to death. While a number of genes have been successfully implicated, it remains challenging to identify causative mutations within these genes from the background variation present in all individuals due to disease heterogeneity. Our ability to detect likely pathogenic variants has continued to improve as in silico predictors of deleteriousness have advanced. We investigate their use in prioritising likely pathogenic variants in epileptic encephalopathy patient whole exome sequences and show that the inclusion of structure-based predictors of intolerance improve upon previous attempts to demonstrate enrichment within epilepsy genes.

                During navigation, information at multiple scales needs to be integrated. Single-unit recordings in rodents suggest that gradients of temporal dynamics in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support this integration. In humans, gradients of representation are observed, such that granularity of information represented increases along the long axis of the hippocampus. The neural underpinnings of this gradient in humans, however, are still unknown. Current research is limited by coarse fMRI analysis techniques that obscure the activity of individual voxels, preventing investigation of how moment-to-moment changes in brain signal are organized and how they are related to behavior. Here, we measured the signal stability of single voxels over time to uncover previously unappreciated gradients of temporal dynamics in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Using our novel, single voxel autocorrelation technique, we show for the first time a medial-lateral hippocampal gradient, as well as a continuous autocorrelation gradient along the anterolateral-posteromedial entorhinal extent. Importantly, we show that anterior-posterior and medial-lateral hippocampal autocorrelation gradients were modulated by navigational difficulty, indicating that changes in signal stability are relevant for behavior. Our method and findings open the door for future research on how temporal gradients within these structures support the integration of information for goal-directed behavior.

                In primates, the responses of individual neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) reflect convergent input from multiple classes of nerve fibers and are selective for behaviorally relevant stimulus features. The conventional view is that these response properties reflect computations that are effected in cortex, implying that sensory signals are not meaningfully processed in the two intervening structures - the Cuneate Nucleus (CN) and the thalamus. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the responses evoked in CN to a battery of stimuli that have been extensively used to characterize tactile coding, including skin indentations, vibrations, random dot patterns, and scanned edges. We found that CN responses are more similar to their S1 counterparts than they are to their inputs: CN neurons receive input from multiple sub-modalities, have spatially complex receptive fields, and exhibit selectivity for geometric features. Thus, CN plays a key role in the processing of tactile information.

                To support brain development during youth, the brain must balance energy delivery and consumption. Previous studies in adults have demonstrated high coupling between cerebral blood flow and brain function as measured using functional neuroimaging, but how this relationship evolves over adolescence is unknown. To address this gap, we studied a sample of 831 children and adolescents (478 females, ages 8-22) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort who were scanned at 3T with both arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). Local coupling between cerebral blood flow (CBF, from ASL) and the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF, from fMRI) was first quantified using locally weighted regressions on the cortical surface. We then used generalized additive models to evaluate how CBF-ALFF coupling was associated with age, sex, and executive function. Enrichment of effects within canonical functional networks was evaluated using spin-based permutation tests. Our analyses revealed tight CBF-ALFF coupling across the brain. Whole-brain CBF-ALFF coupling decreased with age, largely driven by coupling decreases in the inferior frontal cortex, precuneus, visual cortex, and temporoparietal cortex (pfdr <0.05). Females had stronger coupling in the frontoparietal network than males (pfdr <0.05). Better executive function was associated with decreased coupling in the somatomotor network (pfdr <0.05). Overall, we found that CBF-ALFF coupling evolves in development, differs by sex, and is associated with individual differences in executive function. Future studies will investigate relationships between maturational changes in CBF-ALFF coupling and the presence of psychiatric symptoms in youth.

                Methamphetamine (meth) causes enduring changes within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NA). Projections from the mPFC to the NA have a distinct dorsal-ventral distribution, with the prelimbic (PL) mPFC projecting to the NAcore, and the infralimbic (IL) mPFC projecting to the NAshell. Inhibition of these circuits has opposing effects on cocaine relapse. Inhibition of PL-NAcore reduces cued reinstatement of cocaine seeking and IL-NAshell inhibition reinstates cocaine seeking. Meth, however, exhibits a different profile, as pharmacological inhibition of either the PL or IL decrease cued reinstatement of meth-seeking. The potentially opposing roles of the PL-NAcore and IL-NAshell projections remain to be explored in the context of cued meth seeking. Here we used an intersectional viral vector approach that employs a retrograde delivery of Cre from the NA and Cre-dependent expression of DREADD in the mPFC, in both male and female rats to inhibit or activate these parallel pathways. Inhibition of the PL-NAcore circuit reduced cued reinstatement of meth seeking under short and long-access meth self-administration and after withdrawal with and without extinction. Inhibition of the IL-NAshell also decreased meth cued reinstatement. Activation of the parallel circuits was without an effect. These studies show that inhibition of the PL-NAcore or the IL-NAshell circuits can inhibit reinstated meth seeking. Thus, the neural circuitry mediating cued reinstatement of meth seeking is similar to cocaine in the dorsal, but not ventral, mPFC-NA circuit.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">GFAP-IL6 transgenic mice are characterised by astroglial and microglial activation predominantly in the cerebellum, hallmarks of many neuroinflammatory conditions. However, information available regarding the proteome profile associated with IL-6 overexpression in the mouse brain is limited. This study investigated the cerebellum proteome using a top-down proteomics approach using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry and correlated these data with motor deficits using the elevated beam walking and accelerod tests. In a detailed proteomic analysis, a total of 67 differentially expressed proteoforms including 47 cytosolic and 20 membrane-bound proteoforms were identified. Bioinformatics and literature mining analyses revealed that these proteins were associated with three distinct classes: metabolic and neurodegenerative processes as well as protein aggregation. The GFAP-IL6 mice exhibited impaired motor skills in the elevated beam walking test measured by their average scores of ‘number of footslips’ and ‘time to traverse’ values. Correlation of the proteoforms' expression levels with the motor test scores showed a significant positive correlation to peroxiredoxin-6 and negative correlation to alpha-internexin and mitochondrial cristae subunit Mic19. These findings suggest that the observed changes in the proteoform levels caused by IL-6 overexpression might contribute to the motor function deficits.</p>
