              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07825">Inferring Hidden Motives: Bayesian Models of Preference Learning in Repeated Dictator Games</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cooperation depends on how accurately we infer others' motives--how much they value fairness, generosity, or self-interest from the choices they make. We model that process in binary dictator games, which isolate moral trade-offs between self and other stripped of strategic complexity. Participants observed others' allocation decisions and predicted their future behavior while playing through an exhaustive, randomized payoff space implemented on The Morality Game platform. We formalize social-preference learning as Bayesian belief updating over continuous parameters such as self-interest, altruism, envy, and guilt. The resulting Utility Bayesian Model (UBM) outperformed non-Bayesian alternatives and Bayesian models that categorize others into discrete social types. Because Bayesian updating requires a utility function in its likelihood term, we conducted the largest utility-function comparison to date--476 candidate forms differing in psychologically meaningful properties (e.g., payoff exponents, reference dependence, payoff ratios, and envy-guilt asymmetries). Exploring this joint space of payoffs and models allowed us to identify the function that unifies prior theories and generalizes across payoff conditions. Parameter estimation revealed moderate altruism, strong inequality aversion, and nonlinear payoff valuation (exponent > 1). Altruism and social-comparison motives were largely independent, revealing diverse moral phenotypes from cooperative to competitive or sadistic. Together, these findings provide a computational framework and a map of social motives, clarifying how humans learn whom to trust and offering quantitative foundations for promoting cooperation in social and artificial systems.

                arXiv:2511.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent high-profile study by Koide-Majima et al. (2024) claimed a major advance in reconstructing visual imagery from brain activity using a novel variant of a generative AI-based method. However, our independent reanalysis reveals multiple methodological concerns that raise questions about the validity of their conclusions. Specifically, our evaluation demonstrates that: (1) the reconstruction results are biased by selective reporting of only the best-performing examples at multiple levels; (2) performance is artificially inflated by circular metrics that fail to reflect perceptual accuracy; (3) fair baseline comparisons reveal no discernible advantages of the study's key innovations over existing techniques; (4) the central "Bayesian" sampling component is functionally inert, producing outcomes identical to the standard optimization result; and (5) even if the component were successfully implemented, the claims of Bayesian novelty are unsubstantiated, as the proposed method does not leverage the principles of a proper Bayesian framework. These systemic issues necessitate a critical reassessment of the study's contributions. This commentary dissects these deficiencies to underscore the need for greater credibility and transparency in the rapidly advancing field of brain decoding.

                arXiv:2511.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives an in-depth theoretical analysis of the direction and speed selectivity properties of idealized models of the spatio-temporal receptive fields of simple cells and complex cells, based on the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. According to this theory, the receptive fields are modelled as velocity-adapted affine Gaussian derivatives for different image velocities and different degrees of elongation. By probing such idealized receptive field models of visual neurons to moving sine waves with different angular frequencies and image velocities, we characterize the computational models to a structurally similar probing method as is used for characterizing the direction and speed selective properties of biological neurons.
  By comparison to results of neurophysiological measurements of direction and speed selectivity for biological neurons in the primary visual cortex, we find that our theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with (i) velocity-tuned visual neurons that are sensitive to particular motion directions and speeds, and (ii)~different visual neurons having broader {\em vs.\/}\ sharper direction and speed selective properties. Our theoretical results in combination with results from neurophysiological characterizations of motion-sensitive visual neurons are also consistent with a previously formulated hypothesis that the simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under local Galilean transformations, so as to enable processing of visual stimuli with different motion directions and speeds.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08292">Distance by de-correlation: Computing distance with heterogeneous grid cells</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding the distance between locations in space is essential for accurate navigation. Grid cells, a functional class of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, are believed to support this computation. However, existing theories of how populations of grid cells code distance rely on complex coding schemes, with assumptions that may not be met by anatomical constraints. Inspired by recent work finding grid cells to have small, but robust heterogeneity in their grid properties, we hypothesize that distance coding can be achieved by a simple de-correlation of population activity. We develop a mathematical theory for describing this de-correlation in one-dimension, showing that its predictions are consistent with simulations of noisy grid cells. Our simulations highlight a non-intuitive prediction of such a distance by de-correlation framework. Namely, that some further distances are better encoded than some nearer distances. We find evidence of this "sweet spot" in previously published rodent behavioral experiments and demonstrate that a decoder which estimates distance from the de-correlation of populations of simulated noisy grid cells leads to a similar pattern of errors. Finally, by simulating noisy grid cells in two-dimensions, we find that there exists a trade-off between the range of distances that can be encoded by de-correlation of population activity and the distinguishability of different distances, which is controlled by the amount of variability in grid properties. We show that the previously observed average amount of grid property variability strikes a balance between the two, enabling the encoding of distances up to several meters. Our work provides new insight on how grid cells can underlie the coding of distance, without the assumptions previously needed, and why grid cells may have small amounts of heterogeneity in their grid properties.

                arXiv:2511.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slime mould Physarum polycephalum displays adaptive transport dynamics and network formation that have inspired its use as a model of biological computation. We develop a Lagrangian formulation of Physarum's adaptive dynamics on predefined graphs, showing that steady states arise as extrema of a least-action functional balancing metabolic dissipation and transport efficiency. The organism's apparent ability to find optimal paths between nutrient sources and sinks emerges from minimizing global energy dissipation under predefined boundary conditions that specify the problem to be solved. Applied to ring, tree, and lattice geometries, the framework accurately reproduces the optimal conductance and flux configurations observed experimentally. These results show that Physarum's problem-solving on constrained topologies follows a physics-based variational principle, revealing least-action dynamics as the foundation of its adaptive organization.

                arXiv:2504.13727v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive novel, precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08436">Understanding Electro-communication and Electro-sensing in Weakly Electric Fish using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08275">Bi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for Large-Scale Open Pit Mine Scheduling Problem under Uncertainty with Chance Constraints</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open-pit mine scheduling problem (OPMSP) is a complex, computationally expensive process in long-term mine planning, constrained by operational and geological dependencies. Traditional deterministic approaches often ignore geological uncertainty, leading to suboptimal and potentially infeasible production schedules. Chance constraints allow modeling of stochastic components by ensuring probabilistic constraints are satisfied with high probability. This paper presents a bi-objective formulation of the OPMSP that simultaneously maximizes expected net present value and minimizes scheduling risk, independent of the confidence level required for the constraint. Solutions are represented using integer encoding, inherently satisfying reserve constraints. We introduce a domain-specific greedy randomized initialization and a precedence-aware period-swap mutation operator. We integrate these operators into three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms: the global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO), a mutation-only variant of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). We compare our bi-objective formulation against the single-objective approach, which depends on a specific confidence level, by analyzing mine deposits consisting of up to 112 687 blocks. Results demonstrate that the proposed bi-objective formulation yields more robust and balanced trade-offs between economic value and risk compared to single-objective, confidence-dependent approach.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08469">Spatio-Temporal Cluster-Triggered Encoding for Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding static images into spike trains is a crucial step for enabling Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to process visual information efficiently. However, existing schemes such as rate coding, Poisson encoding, and time-to-first-spike (TTFS) often ignore spatial relationships and yield temporally inconsistent spike patterns. In this article, a novel cluster-based encoding approach is proposed, which leverages local density computation to preserve semantic structure in both spatial and temporal domains. This method introduces a 2D spatial cluster trigger that identifies foreground regions through connected component analysis and local density estimation. Then, extend to a 3D spatio-temporal (ST3D) framework that jointly considers temporal neighborhoods, producing spike trains with improved temporal consistency. Experiments on the N-MNIST dataset demonstrate that our ST3D encoder achieves 98.17% classification accuracy with a simple single-layer SNN, outperforming standard TTFS encoding (97.58%) and matching the performance of more complex deep architectures while using significantly fewer spikes (~3800 vs ~5000 per sample). The results demonstrate that this approach provides an interpretable and efficient encoding strategy for neuromorphic computing applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07836">Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling: Exploitative Sequences to Accelerate High-Dimensional Optimization</a></h4>

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality presents a pervasive challenge in optimization problems, with exponential expansion of the search space rapidly causing traditional algorithms to become inefficient or infeasible. An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.
  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.
  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.
  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p < 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of HDS as a robust alternative to QMC sampling for high-dimensional optimization.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative to artificial neural networks, due to their event-driven spiking computation. However, some foundation SNN backbones (including Spikformer and SEW ResNet) suffer from non-spike computations (integer-float multiplications) caused by the structure of their residual connections. These non-spike computations increase SNNs' power consumption and make them unsuitable for deployment on mainstream neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we analyze the spike-driven behavior of the residual connection methods in SNNs. We then present Spikingformer, a novel spiking transformer backbone that merges the MS Residual connection with Self-Attention in a biologically plausible way to address the non-spike computation challenge in Spikformer while maintaining global modeling capabilities. We evaluate Spikingformer across 13 datasets spanning large static images, neuromorphic data, and natural language tasks, and demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of Spikingformer, setting a vital benchmark for spiking neural networks. In addition, with the spike-driven features and global modeling capabilities, Spikingformer is expected to become a more efficient general-purpose SNN backbone towards energy-efficient artificial intelligence.

Abstract: This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of Episodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.

                arXiv:2509.15810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies. LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity. By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios. Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.

                Background The objective of this study was to perform morphometry of the gracilis muscle and understand the topographical basis of the entry of its pedicles. Methods We studied forty-four cadaveric lower extremities fixed in formalin. The length and width of the gracilis were measured at three locations: the origin, midpoint, and musculotendinous junction. The topographic location of the gracilis pedicles was also studied. Results The gracilis muscle’s length was 369.9±34.1 mm and 359.6±29.6 mm over the right and left sides. The width of right gracilis was 25±8.4 mm, 20.4±6.2 mm and 10.6±5.6 mm at the origin, midpoint and at the musculotendinous junction. The same over the left side were 26.7±8.6 mm, 20.6±9.1 mm and 10.4±6.4 mm respectively. The number of gracilis ranged from one to three. The location of first pedicle was 93.6±35.6 mm and 68.9±35.8 mm away from the pubic tubercle on the right and left sides, respectively. The second and third pedicles were entering at a distance of 153.1±38.8 mm and 101.3±20.8 mm, 214.6±86.8 mm and 145.3±124.4 mm over the right side and left side. The accessory head of the origin of the gracilis was observed in only one cadaver (2.3%), which originated from the adductor longus. Conclusions It is believed that the morphological data of the gracilis and its neurovascular pedicles will be enlightening to the operating surgeon. They will guide the procedures for reconstructive plastic surgery.

">The Cerebellum Implements an Oscillatory Forward Model for Accurate Motor Timing</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary movements are composed of small sub-movements generated by pulsatile bursts of muscle activity at 4-10 Hz. These motor intermittencies synchronize with rhythmic brain activity and vary with movement velocity and sensory delays, suggesting they are a signature of a central oscillatory motor control mechanism. We hypothesized that these pulsatile movements arise from a cerebellar clocking mechanism- a neuronal timing process that flexibly adjusts its dynamics to maintain motor precision under temporal uncertainty. If so, cerebellar rhythms should modulate their influence on movement depending on cue predictability. To test this, we used optically pumped magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG), which enables high quality, movement tolerant recordings of the brain with dense cerebellar coverage. Six participants performed an auditory paced finger flexion-extension task at approximately 1 Hz with either regular or irregular cue timing to vary predictability. All participants exhibited clear 4-10 Hz intermittencies in their kinematics, synchronized to neural activity in the cerebellum and the posterior parietal cortex. Our connectivity analysis revealed for the first time, that cerebellar activity at this frequency, predominantly reflects sensory feedback, but during regular, predictable cueing, the cerebellum shifts to exert a greater feedforward influence on movement. Moreover, cerebellar oscillations were most persistently phase-aligned with motor intermittent rhythms during accurately timed actions, an effect that was absent under irregular cueing. These findings support the idea that the cerebellum implements an oscillatory forward model for motor timing and provide novel evidence for its ability to adjusting its role in coordinating sensorimotor integration according to sensory predictability. Motor intermittencies may thus represent the output of a cerebellar timing process that underpins precise voluntary action.

">Cell-type-resolved NRXN1 isoforms across human brain tissues and hiPSC organoids</a></h4>

              
                NRXN1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing that generates a highly diverse repertoire of isoforms, diversifying protein-protein interactions, shaping synaptic specialization, and contributing to neuropsychiatric disease when disrupted. However, the splicing landscape of NRXN1 across distinct human brain cell types remains poorly defined. Because NRXN1 expression level is relatively low in adult brains and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived neurons, single-cell Iso-seq RNA sequencing often provides insufficient coverage to capture its full isoform diversity, particularly across heterogeneous cell populations. To address this gap, we developed an integrative sequencing strategy that combines single-cell transcriptomics, targeted enrichment of NRXN1 transcripts, and long-read sequencing. This approach reveals a comprehensive catalog of cell-type resolved NRXN1 isoforms across adult and fetal human postmortem brains as well as hiPSC-derived cortical organoids. From the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) region, our analyses reveal distinct splicing programs across interneuron subtypes, pyramidal neurons, and glial lineages. Comparisons between prenatal and adult brains indicate that NRXN1 isoform profiles are established during early development and remain stable throughout neuronal maturation. In hiPSC organoid models, splicing profiles partially mirror both developmental and mature brain patterns, with a subset of splice sites exhibiting cell type- and stage-specific divergence. In the cerebellum of an autism case and in organoids derived from schizophrenia patients, carrying non-recurrent heterozygous NRXN1 deletions, we identify disrupted isoform expression and mutant NRXN1alpha; isoforms and characterize their distribution across diverse cell types. These findings help understand the complex alternative splicing of NRXN1 in adult human brain and hiPSC-derived models and establish a framework for decoding cell type-specific isoform diversity for important genes with relatively low gene expression levels.

">Old-New Recognition Memory Revisited</a></h4>

              
                Identifying old items during recognition memory tasks elicits widespread cortical responses. Recent results suggest that a distributed network, labeled the Parietal Memory Network (PMN), responds to old items, potentially reflecting mnemonic familiarity. An independent, parallel line of evidence suggests that the same network responds to salient stimuli in non-mnemonic contexts, referring to the network as the Salience Network (SAL). Here, we examined responses during old-new recognition and non-mnemonic detection tasks in intensively scanned individuals to directly contrast component processes related to mnemonic familiarity with more general processes associated with target detection. In an oddball detection paradigm devoid of traditional memory demands, SAL/PMN was robustly activated. SAL/PMN was also activated by old words in a standard old-new recognition task, thus reproducing both previously reported effects. In a critical oppositional contrast, recognition was examined when the task was to detect uncommon old words versus when the task was to detect uncommon new words. SAL/PMN was activated during the detection of targets even when those targets were new items, consistent with a response to the task relevance of the targets not mnemonic familiarity. Exploratory analyses further suggested that a right-lateralized network, referred to as Frontoparietal Network B (FPN-B), responds to mnemonic familiarity. These results revise our understanding of brain networks contributing to old-new recognition separating component processes common to many forms of target detection task from processes preferentially associated with mnemonic history.

">Neural Entrainment in the Theta Band Predicts Groove Perception in Popular Music</a></h4>

              
                When humans listen to popular music, they often feel 'the groove', which is a pleasurable urge to move along with music. Previous studies suggest that groove arises from the brain's entrainment to rhythmical patterns of music in the delta-theta and beta bands, which enables the brain to predict temporal structures. However, this notion has only been tested using simplified or artificial acoustic stimuli and melodies, rather than naturalistic popular music. In this study, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) measurements with two measures of neural entrainment to test whether neural entrainment in the delta, theta, and beta bands predicts individuals' groove ratings of musical and clapping stimuli, which served as a control. We presented nine pop music songs and twelve MIDI-based clapping rhythms, which participants rated for their groove perception on a 5-point scale. Our results show that music songs received very variable groove ratings while ratings of clapping stimuli showed less variability. Univariate analyses demonstrated that both music and clapping stimuli consistently entrained neural oscillations in the delta-theta bands, but not beta bands, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) and stimulus-brain coherence (SBC). ITPC and SBC in the theta band weakly, but significantly correlated with groove ratings in fronto-central clusters. Decoding of groove ratings from multivariate spatio-temporal-spectral EEG patterns of entrainment with curve-fitting and machine-learning models predicted groove perception with high accuracy, up to 0.8 Pearson correlation, where combined patterns of inter-trial phase coherence appeared more informative than patterns of stimulus-brain coherence. Our results support the theory that the perception of groove is rooted in the brain's ability to entrain to ongoing dynamic temporal structures of music in the theta band. They further show that multivariate decoding models can be leveraged to predict subjective groove online from neural entrainment with high accuracy and temporal resolution. Summary - While participants (n = 30) rated their subjective groove perception of 9 popular songs and 12 MIDI clapping rhythms, we measured how their brains entrained to these musical stimuli using stimulus-brain coherence (SBC) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) measures. - Both stimulus types strongly entrained delta-theta (1-7 Hz) oscillations. In univariate analyses, also both stimulus types at fronto-central, beat-related frequencies significantly predicted groove ratings. - Multivariate decoding using EEG entrainment patterns predicted individual groove ratings far better (up to Pearson r = 0.8), with combined ITPC patterns providing the most information.

                <p>Attachment theory offers an important clinical framework for understanding and treating negative effects of early life adversity. Attachment styles emerge during critical periods of development in response to caregivers' ability to consistently meet their offspring&rsquo;s needs. Attachment styles are classified as secure or insecure (anxious, avoidant, or disorganized), with rates of insecure attachment rising in high-risk populations and correlating with a plethora of negative health outcomes throughout life. Despite its importance, little is known about the neural basis of attachment. Work in rats has demonstrated that limited bedding and nesting (LB) impairs maternal care and produces abnormal maternal attachment linked to increased pup corticosterone. However, the effects of LB on attachment-like behavior have not been investigated in mice where additional genetic and molecular tools are available. Furthermore, no group has utilized home-cage monitoring to link abnormal maternal care with deficits in attachment-like behavior. Using home-cage monitoring, we confirmed a robust increase in maternal fragmentation among LB dams. Abnormal maternal care was correlated with elevated corticosterone levels on postnatal day 7 (P7) and a stunted growth trajectory that persisted later in life. LB did not alter maternal buffering at P8 or maternal preference at P18, indicating that certain attachment-like behaviors remain unaffected despite exposure to high levels of erratic maternal care. However, LB male and female pups vocalized less in response to maternal separation at P8, did not readily approach their dam at P13, and exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior at P18, suggesting that LB induces avoidant-like attachment deficits in mice.</p>

                Background Flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in Malaysia with major social, economic, and psychological consequences. Compared to material and logistical preparedness, the psychological aspects of disaster management remain underexplored compared to material and logistical aspects. Methods This conceptual paper employs a targeted review of disaster preparedness literature to identify key psychological factors and integrate them into a conceptual framework to understand Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. The literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, Directory of Open Access Journals, Supplemental Index and Google Scholar with keywords including “disaster preparedness, flood, natural disaster and psychological preparedness”. Articles were included if they focused on preparedness towards disasters as well as examining coping mechanisms, perceptions and preparedness behaviours in the context of flood-related crises and excluded if they did not provide methodological clarity or empirical grounding. The review synthesized findings using a thematic analysis approach, identifying psychological resilience and coping strategies in flood-affected populations, the role of social support networks in preparedness and recovery as well as mental health implications of floods, including anxiety, trauma, and post-disaster recovery. This synthesis informed the development of a conceptual model to address factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. According to contemporary theories of catastrophe risk reduction and psychological resilience, critical variables included are risk perception, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social support. Results It was proposed that these factors work together to determine an individual’s psychological preparedness, enhancing their ability to cope with the psychological and emotional strain of a flood disaster. Conclusions By offering these perspectives, the study contributes to the limited academic discussion on psychological preparedness in Malaysia, which aims to improve the psychological resilience of communities vulnerable to flooding. The proposed framework emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychological preparedness into existing disaster management strategies to mitigate the psychological and social impacts of flood.

                Background The rise of data analytics adoption has transformed multiple industries through technological advancements. However, utilizing big data analytics presents challenges that depend on adoption models used by individuals or organizations. Whilst numerous models on big data analytics exist, understanding the most influential theories shaping research in this domain remains limited. The study systematically explores the antecedents of data analytics adoption, aims to map the evolution of the field and uncover underexplored domains and integration gaps. Methods A rigorous systematic literature review of 43 peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2024, collected mostly from Scopus and Web of Science databases, was conducted, employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and specific inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to a total of 127 screened articles. Advanced bibliometric tools like VOSviewer and Microsoft Excel were employed to identify key trends, thematic clusters and integration gaps. Results The study reveals research concentration in manufacturing sectors and developed Asian countries. The review identifies five interconnected adoption dimensions: technological; organizational; environmental; individual; and data-related factors. The Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework dominates organizational-level studies, while the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) primarily guides individual-level investigations. Having identified five key research clusters, the review highlights that theoretical fragmentation persists between behavioral and resource-based perspectives. Conclusion This study provides guidance for future researchers in selecting an appropriate theoretical framework, differentiating between individual and organizational adoption levels and identifying significant determinants for technology adoption studies. This study aims to address the gaps in existing literature reviews by explicitly integrating individual and organizational level antecedents and mapping them to multiple frameworks. The study identifies several research gaps that need to be addressed in the future: namely; absence of studies on developing countries and sectors such as education; lack of theoretical cohesion among adoption models and resource based outcomes.

                Background Third molar extraction is one of the most common oral surgical procedures globally. This study assessed patients’ knowledge of third molar extraction procedures. Methods A self-administered questionnaire was administered to patients (N=384) of the dental hospital at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University in the eastern province. The questionnaire covered demographic data, knowledge of third molar extraction, and patients’ perception questions. SPSS Version 24 was used for statistical analysis. Chi-square and Fisher’s Exact test were used. P-values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results According to the demographical characteristics of the patient who received 3rd molar removal surgery. As per the history of the extraction, 45% had previous 3rd molar extraction experience, whereas 55% had no previous dental surgical experience. There was no significant difference between the groups with the knowledge about the extraction (p-0.187). Patients with no previous history were more aware of the correct time for 3rd molar extraction at 27% vs 19%, respectively (P=0.046*). Patients with a previous history of third molar extraction showed significant results of knowledge in terms of taking medication prior to 3rd molar surgical procedure. Conclusion The patient with previous experience with third molar extraction showed low misconceptions. However, further studies should consider increasing the knowledge and correcting the patients’ perceptions.

As a well-established and extensively utilized model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) serves as a crucial platform for investigating behavioral regulation mechanisms and their biological significance. However, manually tracking the locomotor behavior of large numbers of C. elegans is both cumbersome and inefficient. To address the above challenges, we innovatively propose an automated approach for analyzing C. elegans behavior through deep learning-based detection and tracking. Building upon existing research, we developed an enhanced worm detection framework that integrates YOLOv8 with ByteTrack, enabling real-time, precise tracking of multiple worms. Based on the tracking results, we further established an automated high-throughput method for quantitative analysis of multiple movement parameters, including locomotion velocity, body bending angle, and roll frequency, thereby laying a robust foundation for high-precision, automated analysis of complex worm behaviors. including movement speed, body bending angle, and roll frequency, thereby laying a robust foundation for high-precision, automated analysis of complex worm behaviors. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed enhanced C. elegans detection framework outperforms existing methods, achieving a precision of 99.5%, recall of 98.7%, and mAP50 of 99.6%, with a processing speed of 153 frames per second (FPS). The established framework for worm detection, tracking, and automated behavioral analysis developed in this study delivers superior detection and tracking accuracy while enhancing tracking continuity and robustness. Unlike traditional labor-intensive measurement approaches, our framework supports simultaneous tracking of multiple worms while maintaining automated extraction of various behavioral parameters with high precision. Furthermore, our approach advances the standardization of C. elegans behavioral parameter analysis, which can analyze the behavioral data of multiple worms at the same time, significantly improving the experimental throughput and providing an efficient tool for drug screening, gene function research and other fields.

                <p>by Naima Ahmed Fahmi, Sze Cheng, Jeovani Overstreet, Qianqian Song, Jeongsik Yong, Wei Zhang</p>

Intronic PolyAdenylation (IPA) is an important post-transcriptional mechanism that can alter transcript coding potential by truncating translation regions, thereby increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. This process generates novel protein isoforms with altered peptide sequences, some of which are implicated in disease progression, including cancer. Truncated proteins may lose tumor-suppressive functions, contributing to oncogenesis. Despite advancements in Alternative PolyAdenylation (APA) analysis using RNA-seq, detecting and quantifying novel IPA events remains challenging. To address this, we developed IPScan, a computational pipeline for precise IPA event identification, quantification, and visualization. IPScan has been benchmarked against existing methods using simulated data, different human and mouse cell lines, and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) breast cancer datasets. Differential IPA events under different biological conditions were quantified and validated via qPCR.

                <p>by Prejaas K. B. Tewarie, Romesh Abeysuriya, Rajanikant Panda, Pablo Nùñez, Marie M. Vitello, Glenn van der Lande, Olivia Gosseries, Aurore Thibaut, Steven Laureys, Gustavo Deco, Jitka Annen</p>

The evolution from disturbed brain activity to physiological brain rhythms can precede recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Accordingly, intriguing questions arise: What are the pathophysiological factors associated to disrupted brain rhythms in patients with DoC, and are there potential pathways for individual patients with DoC to return to normal brain rhythms? We addressed these questions at the individual subject level using biophysical simulations based on electroencephalography (EEG). The main findings are that unconscious patients exhibit a loss of excitatory corticothalamic synaptic strength. Synaptic plasticity in this excitatory corticothalamic circuitry facilitates the return of physiological brain rhythms, characterized by the reappearance of spectral peaks and flattening of the aperiodic (1/f) component of the power spectrum, in the selection of patients with DoC, particularly in those who are minimally conscious. The extent to which this occurred was correlated with cerebral glucose uptake. The current findings emphasize the importance of excitatory thalamocortical activity in reestablishing normal brain rhythms after brain injury and show that biophysical modelling of the corticothalamic circuitry could help select patients who might be potentially receptive to treatment and undergo plasticity.

                <p>by Ami G. Sangster, Cameron Dufault, Haoning Qu, Denise Le, Julie D. Forman-Kay, Alan M. Moses</p>

The biological function of a protein is often determined by its distinct functional units, such as folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions. Identifying and categorizing these protein segments from sequence has been a major focus in computational biology which has enabled the automatic annotation of folded protein domains. Here we show that embeddings from the unsupervised protein language model ProtT5 can be used to identify and categorize protein segments without relying on conserved patterns in primary amino acid sequence. We present Zero-shot Protein Segmentation (ZPS), where we use embeddings from ProtT5 to predict the boundaries of protein segments without training or fine-tuning any parameters. We find that ZPS boundary predictions for the human proteome are better at reproducing reviewed annotations from UniProt than established bioinformatics tools and ProtT5 embeddings of ZPS segments can categorize over 200 of the most common UniProt annotations in the human proteome, including folded domains, sub-domains, and intrinsically disordered regions. To explore ZPS predictions, we introduce a new way to visualize protein embeddings that closely resembles diagrams of distinct functional units in protein biology. Since ZPS and segment embeddings can be used without training or fine-tuning, the approach is not biased towards known annotations and can be used to identify and categorize unannotated protein segments. We used the segment embeddings to identify unannotated mitochondrion targeting signals and SYGQ-rich prion-like domains, which are functional regions within intrinsically disordered regions. We expect that the analysis of protein segment embedding similarity can lead to valuable information about protein function, including about intrinsically disordered regions and poorly understood protein regions.

                <p>by Boaz Goldberg, Nicolás Yehya, Jie Xiao, Sam Meyer</p>

DNA supercoiling (SC), the over- and under-winding of DNA, is generated by transcription as described in the twin-domain model. Conversely, SC also impacts transcription through torsional stress. SC therefore regulates transcription dynamically and independently of transcription factor binding, particularly in the context of chromosomal topological domains and the activity of topoisomerases in bacteria. In this work, we develop numerical simulations of SC-coupled transcription of a single gene within a topological domain, based on a model incorporating stochastic transcription and activities of topoisomerase I and gyrase. We explore the effect of several parameters not systematically assessed in previous works (role of topoisomerase activities, topological domain size, gene expression strength) and compare the simulation results to a diverse set of experimental observations ranging from <i>in vitro</i> transcription assays to transcriptomics datasets from various species. This model recapitulates the non-monotonic dependence of transcription <i>in vitro</i> with the superhelical density of the plasmid template. Simulations of <i>in vivo</i> transcription in a closed domain exhibit a qualitatively different role for the two topoisomerases, as well as qualitatively different regulatory behaviors depending on the promoter strength. Specifically, topoisomerase I is required for strongly expressed genes that may be hindered by stalled RNA Polymerase, whereas gyrase activity favors the expression of all genes by enhancing transcription initiation and modulating the burstiness of transcription. The simulations exhibit a new mechanism for transcription bursting mediated by negative SC accumulating at the promoter region and modulating the initiation rate, resulting in levels of burstiness compatible with values reported in cells. Finally, we analyze several transcriptomics datasets from a range of evolutionarily distant species and show that topoisomerase inhibition is systematically associated with the repression of highly expressed genes. Simulations show this behavior to occur within a limited parameter range and thus indicate a biologically relevant regime for the simulations. Overall, this work provides a more quantitative description of how SC contributes to differential gene regulation and transcriptional bursting in bacteria.

                <p>by Xiaohui Deng, Siyi Xie, Mo Zhou, Quyu Yuan, Shuangxin Wu, Peiming Huang, Minghua Chen, Jianteng Zeng, Pengle Guo, Jie Qin, Cancan Chen, Jiaye Liu, Bingfeng Liu, Xin He, Liqin Sun, Hui Zhang, Linghua Li, Ting Pan</p>

The persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs remains a critical barrier to functional curing AIDS, as current latency-reversing agents (LRAs) exhibit limited clinical efficacy. While RNA modifications like N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) regulate viral replication, their role in maintaining HIV-1 latency is poorly defined. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein RBM39 as a scaffold organizing an m⁶A-dependent silencing complex that enforces viral latency. Through proteomic and functional analyses, we demonstrate that RBM39 recruits the m⁶A reader YTHDC1 and the RNA helicase DDX5, forming a tripartite complex that accelerates Tat RNA decay and enforces viral quiescence. Genetic or pharmacological degradation of RBM39 (using the clinically explored molecular glue <i>indisulam</i>) potently reactivates latent HIV-1 in J-Lat cell models, primary CD4⁺ T cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH), and synergizes with established LRAs (Bryostatin-1, JQ-1, SAHA) to broadly activate proviral reservoirs. Our work reveals a previously unrecognized host pathway in which RBM39-organized RNA decay complexes silence HIV-1 through epitranscriptomic regulation of Tat. In addition to establishing RBM39 as a promising therapeutic target for addressing the limitations of current “shock and kill” strategies, our findings establish a novel mechanistic framework for m⁶A-dependent regulation of viral gene expression. This framework may serve as a valuable reference for investigating similar regulatory mechanisms in other latent viral infections or oncogenic processes where RNA methylation plays a pivotal role.

Regeneration in planarians requires alignment of new tissue axes with existing body axes, coordinated by the dorsal-ventral boundary (DVB). This study shows that the DVB is also essential for anterior-posterior axis patterning, acting independently of the anterior pole and enabling ectopic head formation through Wnt inhibition and spatial gene regulation.

Microbiota-derived metabolites have emerged as key regulators of longevity. The metabolic activity of the gut microbiota, influenced by dietary components and ingested chemical compounds, profoundly impacts host fitness. While the benefits of dietary prebiotics are well-known, chemically targeting the gut microbiota to enhance host fitness remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel chemical approach to induce a pro-longevity bacterial metabolite in the host gut. We discovered that wild-type <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains overproduce colanic acids (CAs) when exposed to a low dose of cephaloridine, leading to an increased life span in the host organism <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. In the mouse gut, oral administration of low-dose cephaloridine induced transcription of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (<i>cps</i>) operon responsible for CA biosynthesis in commensal <i>E. coli</i> at 37 °C, and attenuated age-related metabolic changes. We also found that low-dose cephaloridine overcomes the temperature-dependent inhibition of CA biosynthesis and promotes its induction through a mechanism mediated by the membrane-bound histidine kinase ZraS, independently of cephaloridine’s known antibiotic properties. Our work lays a foundation for microbiota-based therapeutics through chemical modulation of bacterial metabolism and highlights the promising potential of leveraging bacteria-targeting drugs in promoting host longevity.

                Abstract* Background Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 1 billion people. Recent evidence has highlighted iron status as a key requirement for effective immune responses. Iron deficiency is common in pregnant women and vaccines are mandated at this stage of life. In the antenatal clinics (ANC) of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit on the Thailand-Myanmar border, all pregnant women receive nutritional iron supplements at prophylactic or treatment dosages, as determined by haematocrit. Migrant pregnant women have been offered vaccination against diphtheria-tetanus since 1997, and since April-2022 COVID-19 vaccination, as indicated by vaccine history. In this setting, nearly 10% of pregnant women are anaemic at their first ANC visit; approximately 50% of anaemic women receiving treatment doses of nutritional supplements respond by increasing haematocrit after one month of supplementation. Methods This study aimed to investigate whether response to iron supplementation is associated with improved vaccine responses in pregnant women with anemia in this setting. We will monitor three groups of pregnant women vaccinated at their first ANC visit before 28 weeks of gestation receiving nutritional iron-containing multiple micronutrient supplements (Sangobion®, Procter&Gamble): 1) non-anaemic women who receive preventive doses of supplementation, 2) anaemic women who display a haematocrit response to treatment doses, and 3) anaemic women who do not respond to treatment doses. The primary endpoint is the difference in the geometric mean titer ratio (rGMT, comparing baseline to 28 days post-vaccination) of diphtheria-tetanus and COVID vaccine-specific antibodies between anaemic women who respond and those who fail to make a haematocrit response to iron-containing interventions. Discussion Iron deficiency in different populations is associated with poor vaccine efficacy, and nutritional iron supplementation may improve the immune response to vaccines. Interventions that significantly increase vaccine efficacy would represent a major benefit to public health.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 11 November 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65495-4">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-65495-4</a></p>Carbon dioxide responsive polymers are promising for smart technologies, though it is challenging to effectively regulate these properties reliably. Here the authors report an elastomer composed of polyethyleneimine and polydimethylsiloxane which can reversibly its Young’s modulus responding to carbon dioxide.

Here authors introduce improv, a modular software platform enabling real-time adaptive neuroscience experiments, orchestrating parallel data collection, modeling, and experimental control. Authors demonstrate various use cases, including online neural analysis and closed-loop optogenetics in zebrafish.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106655">Assessing plant phenological changes based on drivers of spring phenology</a></h4>

              
                Understanding plant phenological responses to climate warming is essential for predicting shifts in plant communities and ecosystems. However, this remains challenging when sensitivity analyses overlook the underlying drivers of spring phenology. In this article, we present a new measure <i>phenological lag</i> to quantify the overall effect of phenological constraints, including insufficient winter chilling, photoperiod, and environmental stresses, based on observed response and that expected from species-specific changes in spring temperatures, that is, changes in spring forcing (degree days) from warming and average temperature at budburst with the warmer climate. We applied this new analytical framework to a global dataset with 980 species and 1527 responses to synthesize observed changes in spring budburst (leafing or flowering) and investigate the mechanisms of differential phenological responses reported previously. We found longer phenological lags with experimental studies and native plants in flowering, likely due to a more stressful environment associated with warmer and drier climate. Smaller forcing changes were mainly responsible for the smaller responses in leafing and flowering in the boreal region (compared to the temperate region) and in grass leafing (compared to trees and shrubs). Higher budburst temperatures also contributed to the smaller responses in flowering for experimental studies and with herbs and grasses. The effects of altitude, latitude, mean annual temperature (MAT), and average spring temperature change were minor (all combined &lt;2.5% variations), while those of photoperiod and long-term precipitation were not significant in influencing spring phenology. Our method helps to determine mechanisms responsible for changes in spring phenology and differences in plant phenological responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92706">Cohesin reconstitution and homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks in late mitosis</a></h4>

              
                The cohesin complex maintains sister chromatid cohesion from S phase to anaphase onset. Cohesin also plays roles in chromosome structure and DNA repair. In yeast, the cohesin subunit Scc1 is cleaved at anaphase onset to allow segregation in an orderly manner, although some residual cohesin subunits remain to maintain chromosome structure. Efficient DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) with the sister chromatid also depends on cohesin. Here, we have examined the role of residual cohesin in DSB repair in telophase (late mitosis). We have found that Scc1 returns in telophase after DSBs and that it partially reconstitutes a chromatin-bound cohesin complex with Smc1 and an acetylated pool of Smc3 after a single HO-induced DSB at the <i>MAT</i> locus. However, this new cohesin is neither required for the HR-driven <i>MAT</i> switching nor binds to the <i>MAT</i> locus after the DSB.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97146">Individual recognition in a jumping spider (Phidippus regius)</a></h4>

              
                Individual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu Wilson, 2000, for a review Gherardi et al., 2012). Here, we show the exception to this rule in a non-social arthropod species, the jumping spider <i>Phidippus regius</i>. Using a habituation-dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the ‘interest’ of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders’ identities. These results suggest that <i>P. regius</i> is capable of individual recognition based on long-term memory.

                Previously, it was shown that learned avoidance of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PA14 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can be transmitted to untrained offspring (Kaletsky et al., 2025). Here, we show an independent validation of this phenomenon under the originally specified assay conditions. Adapting the Murphy lab protocol, worms trained on PA14 develop significant avoidance that persists in F1 and F2 generations, with reduced magnitude after P0. These results align with the Murphy group’s findings and address a recent report from the Hunter group that did not detect persistence beyond F1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103220">Early experience affects foraging behavior of wild fruit bats more than their original behavioral predispositions</a></h4>

              
                There are immense consistent inter-individual differences in animal behavior. While many studies have documented such behavioral differences, often referred to as individual personalities, little research has focused on the underlying causes and on determining whether they are innate or based on individual experience. Moreover, most studies on animal personalities have described consistent differences in behavior under laboratory conditions. We aimed to examine the impact of the early experienced environment on individual animal behavior, and to compare it to that of the individual’s original genetic predisposition. Additionally, we explored the correlation between personality traits measured indoors and the animal’s outdoor behavior. We studied Egyptian fruit bats, in which vast behavioral variability and plasticity have already been demonstrated. We raised bats in a captive colony under either enriched or impoverished environments and assessed their personality under controlled laboratory conditions. We then released the bats into the wild and tracked their foraging using GPS. Bats that had experienced an enriched environment during early life displayed increasing boldness and exploratory behavior when foraging outdoors, demonstrating how early-life experience can affect adult behavior. The individuals’ original predispositions did not predict their later foraging behavior. Our findings shed new light on the interplay between innate and experience-based effects on individual behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105649">Type-I nNOS neurons orchestrate cortical neural activity and vasomotion</a></h4>

              
                It is unknown how the brain orchestrates coordination of global neural and vascular dynamics. We sought to uncover the role of a sparse but unusual population of genetically distinct interneurons known as type-I nNOS neurons, using a novel pharmacological strategy to unilaterally ablate these neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. Region-specific ablation produced changes in both neural activity and vascular dynamics, decreased power in the delta-band of the local field potential, reduced sustained vascular responses to prolonged sensory stimulation, and abolished the post-stimulus undershoot in cerebral blood volume. Coherence between the left and right somatosensory cortex gamma-band power envelope and blood volume at ultra-low frequencies was decreased, suggesting type-1 nNOS neurons integrate long-range coordination of brain signals. Lastly, we observed decreases in the amplitude of resting-state blood volume oscillations and decreased vasomotion following the ablation of type-I nNOS neurons. This demonstrates that a small population of nNOS-positive neurons is indispensable for regulating both neural and vascular dynamics in the whole brain, raising the possibility that loss of these neurons could contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and sleep disturbances.

                Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a key regulator of neurodevelopment and a high-risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most pathogenic variants cause loss-of-function in Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome (HVDAS), yet the impact of missense mutations remains unclear. Here, we characterized a ADNP missense mutation (p.C687R) identified from a HVDAS patient, predicted to disrupt its ninth zinc finger domain. Overexpression of p.C687R altered subnuclear localization and affected wild-type ADNP distribution. In utero electroporation revealed impaired neuronal migration and cortical branching. CUT&Tag profiling showed mutant-specific chromatin binding, preferentially targeting histone modification genes through both direct and distal interactions. Patient-derived iPSCs carrying p.C687R exhibited upregulated bivalent histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) on neurodevelopmental genes, including regulators of GABAergic differentiation, which became transcriptionally activated in neural progenitors. These findings reveal a gain-of-function mechanism by which ADNP p.C687R perturbs chromatin regulation and disrupts GABAergic lineage specification, expanding the molecular framework of ADNP pathogenesis.

">Disentangling Stimulus & Population Dynamics in Mouse V1: Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition for Neural Representation</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the primary visual cortex of mice represents the external sensory input separately from the internal states is a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. Our work contributes to the problem of decoupling the stimulus-driven and internally generated components of neural activity in the primary visual cortex. Internally generated (or intrinsic) activity refers to neural dynamics that are not directly driven by sensory stimuli, reflecting the brain's ongoing, endogenous processes. Neuronal activity encodes both external stimuli and internal cortical states. The internally modulated activity, though not directly observable, can be inferred from the shared structure in population responses, and thus, serves as a proxy for the internal cortical state. We developed a two-phase Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) framework that decomposes neural activity into two orthogonal low-dimensional subspaces: (1) a "population" subspace capturing global variability shared across neurons, and (2) a "stimulus" subspace containing dimensions that discriminate between stimulus conditions while being linearly uncorrelated with the population subspace. We focus on the granular (L4) and supragranular (L2/3) layers of awake mice exposed to visual stimuli consisting of optical flow directions, using mesoscopic two-photon calcium imaging. In both L4 and L2/3 layers, many components individually yield above-chance decoding accuracy, yet a small low-dimensional subspace preserves nearly the full decoding performance of the high-dimensional population. Stimulus-driven components exhibit strong cross-mouse correlations, indicating a conserved coding scheme present in both L4 and L2/3. These components are stable across the entire recording session, reflecting robustness of the underlying representation over time. Removing the global modulation did not abolish stimulus discriminability in either layer, suggesting that information about stimulus direction is not dependent on this global signal. Both L4 and L2/3 stimulus components exhibit comparable decoding performance as well as similar tuning representations, suggesting common encoding of stimulus direction across layers.

">Dual Architecture of Consciousness Transitions: Evidence from Sleep EEG Analysis</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms underlying consciousness transitions have remained contentious, with Integrated Information Theory (IIT) predicting gradual changes and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) predicting discrete threshold events. Using an adaptive consciousness measurement framework applied to 622 sleep stage transitions across 12 subjects from the Sleep-EDF database, we demonstrate that both theories are correct within distinct transition types. Our Consciousness Gradient Index (CGI) framework reveals that three of four transition types (75%: Wake[-&gt;]N1, N2[-&gt;]N3, REM[-&gt;]Wake) follow gradual dynamics consistent with IIT predictions (mean slopes: -0.736, -0.532, +0.614), while one transition type (25%: N1[-&gt;]N2) exhibits threshold behavior via thalamic spindle gating mechanisms (mean slope: -2.188). The N1[-&gt;]N2 transition showed significantly steeper CGI decline compared to Wake[-&gt;]N1 (paired t-test: t=-9.334, p<0.001, Cohen's d=-2.814) and N2[-&gt;]N3 (t=-6.341, p<0.001, d=-1.912), supporting a dual architecture model where consciousness transitions employ both continuous integration mechanisms and discrete neural gates. These findings reconcile competing theoretical frameworks and establish a unified model for understanding consciousness state changes across biological systems.

">Counterconditioning Alcohol Cues: Neural and Behavioral Modulation of Automatic Tendencies and Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer in Male Alcohol Users</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol cues can influence ongoing instrumental behavior through Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT), possibly promoting problematic alcohol consumption. This influence can be explained by automatic approach tendencies towards alcohol, which play a role in understanding alcohol abuse and relapse. However, individuals differ in these tendencies; some exhibit a strong approach, while others exhibit avoidance; yet, how such profiles shape PIT and intervention outcomes remains unclear. Existing interventions predominantly target approach tendencies, often overlooking avoidance profiles that may represent distinct motivational control. Building on evidence that cue-evoked responding reflects learned expectancies about response effectiveness, we investigated whether counterconditioning (CC), i.e., reversing alcohol cue valence by pairing it with an aversive outcome, could reduce approach tendencies and attenuate alcohol-related PIT effects across both approach and avoidance groups. To enhance interventional effect transfer, we integrated retrieval cues to facilitate memory reactivation in non-treatment contexts. Thirty-nine alcohol users completed the Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task (A-AAT) and PIT task before and after CC, with participants categorized by their baseline Alcohol Approach Index. EEG recorded neural responses, focusing on N2 and P3 ERPs as indices of conflict monitoring and cognitive control. Individuals with approach tendencies showed stronger PIT interference during avoidance-related actions in the presence of alcohol cues. CC attenuated these tendencies and restored instrumental responding, with retrieval cues supporting transfer effects. Post-intervention, enhanced frontal N2 and centro-parietal P3 amplitudes reflected improved conflict monitoring and top-down control. These findings demonstrate that retrieval cue-integrated CC can recalibrate automatic approach tendencies and restore adaptive instrumental behavior, with corresponding neural enhancements, offering a practical intervention to reduce cue-driven drinking.

">Transferring active inference to newly encountered prism-shifted environments</a></h4>

              
                Active inference has been proposed as a unified explanation of perception and action. Previous work has shown that canonical neural networks that minimize shared Helmholtz energy are cast as performing active inference of the external environment. However, how animals flexibly adapt to newly encountered environments remains to be fully addressed. To investigate the brain's generalizability and adaptability to new environments, this work develops canonical neural networks that employ multiple policy matrices in parallel. We demonstrate that the proposed model can recapitulate the prism adaptation--a form of visuomotor adaptation--under an arm-reaching task. Using policy matrices pretrained under various target positions, these networks could transfer previous experiences and exhibit faster adaptation to the prism-shifted environment than the naive networks. Furthermore, after-effects were observed following the removal of simulated prism glasses. These results suggest the biological plausibility and utility of the proposed model, providing insights into the adaptive capabilities of the brain.

">Skull Bone Marrow Drainage and Its Associations with Inflammation, Sleep Quality, and Cognitive Performance</a></h4>

              
                Background: Recent studies using human craniotomy samples and murine models have revealed channels that connect the inner skull cortex to the skull marrow cavities. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracer access to skull bone marrow has been described in CSF circulation disorders, evidence on regional patterns and clinical correlates in broader clinical cohorts is limited. Methods: Three-dimensional imaging was performed at baseline, 4.5, 15, and 39 hours post-gadolinium administration in 87 patients with neurological conditions. Signal changes in skull bone marrow near the superior sagittal sinus, lateral fissure, and cisterna magna were recorded. CSF drainage function was characterized as the percentage changes in the signal unit ratio within the skull bone marrow from baseline to time points post administration of gadolinium. Results: The tracer drained from CSF into the skull bone marrow, highlighting the drainage variations nearby different regions. Reduced drainage was associated with female sex, hypertension, diabetes, and elevated neutrophil levels (p < 0.05). Drainage near the superior sagittal sinus was inversely associated with sleep quality and positively associated with cognitive scores, and partially accounted for the association of sleep quality with cognitive function (indirect effect {Delta}{beta} = -0.092; bootstrap 95% CI -0.195 to -0.004; proportion mediated {approx} 38%). Conclusion: These results support the presence of skull bone marrow adjacent routes for CSF tracer movement and suggest that skull bone marrow tracer dynamics relate to systemic inflammation, sleep quality, and cognitive performance in this clinical cohort.

">Quantum Holographic Dynamics in the Brain's Proton Spin Ensemble</a></h4>

              
                Non-compact symmetries such as SU(1,1) govern quantum amplification and squeezing, yet have not been directly identified in macroscopic spin ensembles. Here we apply a symmetry-based analytical framework to previously published magnetic resonance data acquired from proton spin ensembles in the living human brain. By reanalyzing the zero-quantum (ZQ) signal within this framework, we isolate a non-compact SU(1,1) sector of the full SU(4) spin algebra and exclude all compact SU(2) exchange pathways. A calibrated signal-level witness links the measured ZQ amplitude to the off-diagonal density-matrix element, yielding a direct lower bound on concurrence. The observed signal exceeds the separability threshold, confirming bipartite entanglement within the SU(1,1) manifold. This non-compact symmetry defines a hyperbolic temporal geometry that can be interpreted holographically as a non-traversable wormhole connecting correlated spin sectors. Such an entangled bridge provides a natural physical analogue of working memory. Independent evidence shows that the same magnetic-resonance signal correlates with short-term memory performance, supporting this interpretation and suggesting that transient SU(1,1) entanglement in the brain's proton spin ensemble may underlie a functional holographic memory mechanism.

">On Temporal Robustness & Brain-State Stability of Functional Connectivity in Mouse Primary Visual Area V1 compared to Higher Visual Area AL</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the structure of functional connectivity in the visual cortex changes over time and across brain states is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms by which neurons coordinate to process information and support behavior. Higher-order visual areas in mice are known to exhibit more distinct, segregated functional roles compared to the primary visual cortex (V1), and they maintain stimulus representations over extended time scales. However, the stability of the architecture of their functional connectivity across time and brain states remains less understood. In vivo mesoscopic two-photon calcium imaging was used to simultaneously record activity from thousands of neurons across V1 and the extra-striate anterolateral area (AL) in mice, during both visual stimulation (optical-flow/motion) and at resting state (i.e., absence of stimulus). We then applied the spike time-tiling (STTC) coefficient to estimate the pairwise correlations of the neuronal firing and form the functional connectivity at the cell resolution. We then comparatively analyzed the functional connections within area AL and V1 under both stimulus-driven and resting-state conditions. The functional connectivity within AL remains consistently more robust over time than in area V1. Moreover, the structure of the functional connectivity in AL exhibits a smaller change between these two conditions compared to V1, indicating that functional connectivity derived from spontaneous activity more faithfully reflects the functional network architecture elicited by visual stimulation in this higher-order area. Finally, during the resting state, AL activity and functional connectivity are less dependent on pupil size than those of V1, indicating that arousal exerts a weaker modulatory effect on AL compared to V1.

">Circadian timing does not modulate human chromatic temporal contrast sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Previous studies have reported diurnal variations in colour and brightness perception, suggesting modulation of visual processing by the circadian pacemaker. Visual processing of image features such as colour and brightness begins with photoreceptor activity in the retina. To clarify potential time-of-day effects, we examined whether photoreceptor activation-the earliest stage of visual processing-is modulated by circadian timing. Methods: We disentangled circadian and homeostatic influences on human visual performance using a 40-hour forced desynchrony protocol. Twelve participants (5 female; mean age 24.4 {+/-} 2.9 years, range 19-30) followed a 2:1 sleep-wake cycle (3.75 h each) under constant environmental conditions. Circadian phase was determined from 46 salivary melatonin samples collected per participant. During wake periods, participants repeatedly completed temporal contrast sensitivity tasks at 2 Hz and 8 Hz, assessing luminance (L+M+S) and chromatic (L-M, S) mechanisms. We tested for circadian modulation of visual performance by comparing multi-level cosinor and uninformative Bayesian models. Results: All participants showed robust melatonin rhythms (mean {tau} = 24.18 {+/-} 0.39 h). Bayesian inference provided decisive evidence against circadian variation in luminance or chromatic contrast sensitivity. Discussion: These findings challenge previous reports of circadian changes in visual sensitivity, indicating that earlier effects likely reflected uncontrolled homeostatic factors or mechanisms beyond cone-mediated vision. Significance: Through precise control of environmental and physiological factors, this study offers new insights into how biological timing interfaces with human visual processing.

">Photoreceptor-specific scene statistics reveal melanopic structure in natural environments</a></h4>

              
                Natural scenes shape both visual perception and non-visual light responses, but the melanopsin pathway, the retina's key circadian input, has rarely been quantified in this context. We measured the spectral and spatial properties in 675 natural scenes, including indoor without windows (n=115), indoor with windows (n=194), and outdoor (n=366), quantifying input across all five human photoreceptors. Radiance and photometric metrics increased systematically across scene types from indoor without window view (mean melanopic EDI 280 lx), indoor with window view (mean melanopic EDI 2386 lx) to outdoors (mean melanopic EDI 12,142 lx), with melanopic and photopic illuminance strongly correlated (r {approx} 0.9, p < 10-). RMS contrast ranged from 0.001 to 0.365, lowest indoors without windows and highest outdoors, with melanopic luminance associated with contrast indoors with windows (r = 0.48) and outdoors (r = 0.49) but not windowless (r = 0.03). Amplitude spectra followed power laws (-0.9 to -1.9), steeper indoors (-1.4) and flatter outdoors (-1.1). These results reveal systematic, context-dependent melanopsin scene statistics, extending natural scene analysis beyond cone pathways.

">Transcranial ultrasound stimulation induces white matter plasticity in the human corticospinal tract</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive methods to causally modulate human white matter plasticity have proved elusive. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that myelinated axons are sensitive to mechanical perturbations from ultrasound, providing a mechanistic rationale for targeting white matter tracts with ultrasound neuromodulation. Here, we demonstrate that transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) induces site-specific plasticity in the human corticospinal tract. In a within-subject study, 15 healthy adults received 5 Hz patterned TUS targeted at the left corticospinal tract at the level of the superior internal capsule. The homologous tract in the opposite hemisphere and the ipsilateral motor cortex were targeted as comparison conditions to confirm site specificity. Left corticospinal tract TUS increased corticomotor excitability and intracortical facilitation, whereas left motor cortex TUS reduced intracortical inhibition. Diffusion tractography showed the magnitude of TUS-induced plasticity scaled with individual differences in white matter microstructure (fractional anisotropy) and ultrasound orientation in relation to the tract. These findings provide causal evidence of white matter plasticity in the human corticospinal tract and establish TUS as a tool for non-invasive neuromodulation of white matter tracts in health and disorders of white matter.

">How to Improve the Reliability of Aperiodic Parameter Estimates in M/EEG: A Method Comparison and Recommendations for Best Practices</a></h4>

              
                Interest in broadband aperiodic, non-oscillatory brain activity (1/f phenomenon) has increased exponentially over recent years, partly fueled by the development of tools to parameterize it (i.e., estimate its offset/intercept and exponent/slope) using the M/EEG power spectrum. Broadband aperiodic activity needs to be separated from narrowband periodic activity before its parameters are computed. A popular method, the fooof toolbox (Donoghue et al., 2020), is based on the data-driven detection of narrowband-periodic peaks, whose maximum number is set by the user. While increasing analytic flexibility, variability in the number of detected peaks may increase sensitivity to noise and reduce the reliability of aperiodic parameter estimates and the power of analytic pipelines. Here, we present an investigation of the effects of several analytic choices (e.g., number of peaks, spectral estimation method) on metrics indicating the adequacy of spectral parametrization. These metrics include the internal consistency (odd-even reliability) of aperiodic estimates, the number of outliers generated, and their ability to detect effects. Across two different data sets (resting state and task-based) we found a decrease in the reliability of intercept and slope estimates as more peaks were allowed to be extracted. To ameliorate this problem, we propose a theory-driven modification of fooof labelled censored regression, whereby the same range of frequencies expected to contain periodic activity is removed from all spectra, and the remaining power values are regressed on the remaining frequencies to obtain parameter estimates. This method shows superior reliability and accuracy compared to fooof. Our findings thus provide suggestions for best practices for estimating 1/f parameters.

">Physical determinants of perceived vibration intensity: Insights from haptic feedback given at the wrist</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how controlled mechanical vibrations applied to the skin translate into tactile sensations is key in advancing our understanding of somatosensory perception and using this in haptic applications. Prior research has established psychophysical thresholds and discrimination levels for vibrotactile stimuli, yet less is known about tactile intensity perception. Understanding the signaling of tactile intensity and how mechanical dynamics of skin transmission shape this is critical for providing effective graded haptic feedback. We investigated how modifying the frequency, amplitude, and waveform shape of vibration at the wrist influence free ratings of perceived tactile intensity. Two accelerometers recorded mechanical signals: one embedded within the vibrotactile wristband and another placed 1 cm away on the skin, enabling tracking of vibration propagation through the tissue. We found that perceived intensity was determined by all three parameters, but each had a distinct role. Vibration frequency exerted a non-linear influence, with perceived intensity peaking around 150 Hz, which also corresponded to the actuator's mechanical resonance, with lower secondary peaks for square and sawtooth waveforms in-line with vibratory harmonics. Moreover, square waves were consistently rated as most intense. Vibration amplitude provided a consistent scaling of perceived strength, which was strongly correlated with both actuator and skin acceleration, indicating that skin-transmitted accelerations retained the stimulation profile. We find that the skin acts as a non-linear, frequency-dependent mechanical filter that selectively modulates vibration transmission. Understanding these determinants provides insights for the design of wearable haptic devices and how these can be used to provide graded feedback during tactile interactions.

">Toward precision EEG: Assessing the reliability of individual-level ERPs across EEG Systems</a></h4>

              
                Event-related potentials (ERPs) are among the most established tools for studying the neural mechanisms of perception and cognition. Advancing toward precision EEG, however, places new demands for a better understanding of how reliable neural markers are at the individual subject level. We conducted two complementary experiments to examine the reliability of N100 and P300 components in an auditory oddball paradigm with three sounds (Standard, Target, and Novel). In Experiment 1, we evaluated the consistency at both the group level and the individual level across four EEG systems: one research-grade wired system (BioSemi) and three mobile devices - Smarting, DSI-24, and EPOC X. At the group level, all systems demonstrated the canonical N100 and P300 components; however, the EPOC X system showed a significantly reduced signal-to-noise ratio compared to the others. At the individual level, temporal and spatial clustering analyses showed that N100 and P300 components were detectable in most individuals (70-85%), with additional significant responses appearing outside this range. We further calculated the similarity of individual responses across participants (typicality index), which revealed highly consistent responses to Standard and Novel sounds, alongside divergent patterns of responses to Targets. In Experiment 2, we assessed the within-participant reliability of N100 and P300 using a test-retest design. Results indicated high within-participant consistency of response patterns for all three stimuli, demonstrating that individual ERPs remain reliably stable over time, even when they deviate from canonical group-level patterns. The current study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the utility and reliability of ERP-based metrics for precision imaging and highlights important methodological considerations for their practical implementation.

">Crosstalk of noradrenergic Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in astrocytes of the murine olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and Ca2+ are ubiquitous second messengers that regulate gene expression, metabolism, and synaptic plasticity. Here, we identified a complex interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways in mouse olfactory bulb astrocytes. Norepinephrine (NE) elevated both Ca2+ and cAMP levels via 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors, whereas {beta} receptors triggered only cAMP responses. The 1 receptor agonist phenylephrine increased cAMP, but this effect was suppressed when Ca2+ elevations were blocked by Ca2+ depletion and removal of external Ca2+. We found that 1A and 1D receptors are key targets for phenylephrine, acting through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC3 downstream of 1 receptor activation. Moreover, 2 receptor stimulation raised Ca2+ levels, thereby stimulating cAMP production, yet also reduced forskolin-induced cAMP elevations, indicating that 2 receptors can both inhibit adenylyl cyclase via Gi and stimulate AC1/AC3 via Ca2+ signaling. Together, these findings reveal intricate crosstalk between noradrenergic Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in olfactory bulb astrocytes mediated by all three adrenergic receptor subtypes.

">The role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in synaptic transmission during ischemia and recovery</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral ischemia impairs neuronal and glial function, ranging from synaptic failure to irreversible damage. The effects of ischemia on excitatory synaptic transmission remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a detailed biophysical model including the first full implementation of the glutamate-glutamine cycle (GG-cycle), which is essential for proper functioning of glutamatergic synapses. We simulate a presynaptic neuron and an astrocyte in a finite extracellular space (ECS), surrounded by an oxygen bath, as a proxy for energy supply. The model includes ionic currents with corresponding channels and transporters such as the sodium-potassium ATPase. To model synaptic transmission, we combine calcium-dependent glutamate release, its uptake by the sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), and the GG-cycle, including glutamine synthesis. We simulate ischemia by blocking energy supply completely. The neuron enters a depolarization block, ion concentrations reach pathological values, and glutamate accumulates in the ECS while glutamate release is disrupted. Surprisingly, we found that synaptic transmission failure was not primarily caused by excessive glutamate release nor by failure of glutamine synthetase. Instead, it mainly resulted from EAAT dysfunction, driven by the collapse of the sodium gradient. Enhancing glutamate clearance alone was insufficient for recovery of synaptic transmission. However, inhibition of the voltage-gated Na+ channels restored ion gradients, recovered glutamate uptake, and re-enabled glutamate release. Taken together, our study highlights the critical role of ion homeostasis, in particular the sodium gradient, in maintaining synaptic function during metabolic stress. Moreover, the model provides a better understanding of synaptic transmission failure and potential recovery strategies during ischemia.

">Hippocampal indexing alters the stability landscape of synaptic weight space allowing life-long learning</a></h4>

              
                Systems-level consolidation holds that the hippocampus rapidly encodes new information during wakefulness, and that coordinated cortico-hippocampal replay during subsequent sleep transfers and stabilizes those traces in cortex. This idea captures key learning principles, but exactly how replay reshapes the synaptic-weight landscape - creating new representations while preserving old ones - remains unclear. To address this, we used a biophysically realistic network model to probe the effects of slow-wave sleep (SWS) on synaptic-weight space. We show that previously learned memories are stable attractors in that space, and that hippocampus-driven interactions between sharp-wave ripples and cortical slow waves push the system into new attractor states that jointly encode old and new memories. As a result, replay allows recently acquired information to be incorporated without degrading prior memories. Our results offer a novel mechanistic - and conveniently 'geometric' - framework for understanding how sleep-driven replay sculpts synaptic weights during consolidation.

">Predatory orienting is jointly controlled by optic tectum and pretectum.</a></h4>

              
                The optic tectum and pretectum have been implicated in hunting behaviour in several species but how activity in these regions is coordinated to control target-directed orienting manoeuvres is not understood. We performed two-photon calcium imaging across these brain regions in larval zebrafish, which revealed space and rate-coded premotor activity associated with graded, prey-directed eye and tail movements. Consistent with imaging data, intensity-modulated optogenetic stimulation of pretectum induced progressively more lateralised contraversive orienting behaviour and spatially patterned stimulation of optic tectum revealed a motor map along the anterior-posterior axis that primarily generated ipsiversive responses. Anatomical tracing and laser axotomies indicated that pretectal neurons control contraversive turns via a crossed pretectobulbar pathway whereas optic tectum shows topographically patterned output with a major uncrossed projection to hindbrain. Our data support a model in which premotor activity across pretectum and optic tectum collectively controls predatory orienting via both crossed and uncrossed (pre)-tectobulbar pathways.

">Parsing auditory neural code into maximum-entropy packets</a></h4>

              
                Deciphering the neural code requires identifying its fundamental symbols or codewords. Neural activity is usually interpreted either as a rate code - based on average spike counts - or as a temporal code, which distinguishes patterns with identical counts. Yet, the symbols of the code remain undefined. Here we show that the symbols can be clearly defined by parsing auditory spike trains into variable-duration "packets", within which precise spike timing is irrelevant. Because packets vary in duration, this is not a rate code. A single neuron could encode very different stimuli depending on the number of spikes it produced per packet. The packet-based code enables real-time readout upon packet completion due to its instantaneous code structure and maximizes information capacity at both single-neuron and population levels.

">Looking for Details: Fine-Grained Visual Search at the Foveal Scale</a></h4>

              
                Visual search has traditionally been conceptualized as the process by which the visual system identifies relevant objects in the extrafoveal field for subsequent foveation. Standard models implicitly assume there is no need for a finer-level search within the 1-degree foveola, as stimuli falling in this region are already viewed at high resolution. Using state-of-the-art high-precision eye tracking with arcminute level accuracy to localize the line of sight, we show that the visuomotor system is capable of implementing effective visual search strategies with striking precision within the foveated region. This active behavior, mediated by microsaccades, tiny saccades just a few arcminutes in size, allows for an efficient examination of the details falling in the central fovea. Our findings challenge the traditional visual search view and reveal that at each fixation a finer priority map of the foveal input is established, underscoring the dynamic nature of these representations.

">Peripheral modulation of Pumilio in intestinal stem cells and the corpus allatum affects sleep latency in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                While central circuits governing sleep are well-studied, the contribution of signaling from peripheral tissues remains a critical yet less understood aspect of sleep regulation. The highly conserved RNA-binding protein Pumilio (Pum) is a post-transcriptional regulator expressed in multiple tissues that influence systemic physiology, but its role in modulating basal sleep has not been established. Although Pumilios function in central neurons has been linked to sleep homeostasis following deprivation, whether it regulates sleep through peripheral mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we use conditional genetic tools in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to demonstrate that Pumilio acts in the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and the endocrinecorpus allatum (CA) to specifically regulate the transition to sleep. Reducing Pumilio function in either the ISCs or the CA independently and significantly accelerates nighttime sleep onset, while overexpression produces the opposite effect. This behavioral change is accompanied by widespread transcriptional alterations in the brain, characterized by a robust upregulation of genes involved in cellular stress responses, including Heat shock protein 83 (Hsp83). Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized gut-endocrine-brain signaling axis and identify peripheral post-transcriptional regulation as a key input to the central control of sleep behavior.

">Hidden Literacy in Minimally Verbal Autistic Individuals Revealed by Eye Gaze</a></h4>

              
                Minimally verbal autistic individuals (mvASD) are often presumed to have severe cognitive and language impairments based on their poor performance on standardized assessments requiring voluntary motor responses, such as pointing. However, emerging evidence suggests that these individuals may possess latent cognitive abilities. Here, we introduce the Cued Looking Paradigm (CLP), a novel eye-tracking method that bypasses motor requirements by capturing involuntary gaze responses to language-based stimuli. In our study, 35 minimally verbal autistic adolescents and adults were presented with spoken or written words, followed by a pair of images (target and foil) as their eye movements were recorded. The majority (83%) of mvASD participants demonstrated hidden receptive language and reading abilities, with eye gaze performance, including time course and spatial displacement, comparable to neurotypical controls. In contrast, the same mvASD individuals averaged only 57% accuracy when asked to point to the target, revealing a significant gap between reporting via pointing and actual lexical-semantic knowledge. Furthermore, pupil dilation analysis during tasks indicated reduced arousal recruitment in mvASD participants, potentially implicating dysregulation of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system associated with the performance gap between pointing and eye-gaze. These findings challenge assumptions of global intellectual limitation while confirming specific lexical-semantic competence among mvASD individuals. Results highlight the need for- and provide alternative- assessments that bypass manual motor responses. The CLP shows promise for revealing cognitive and language abilities, with important implications for both research and education.

">Phase-Dependent EEG Decoding of Continuous Visual Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations support cognition and perception by organizing information across oscillatory cycles, such that different phases correspond to distinct computational states. Although animal studies strongly support this view, evidence in humans is mixed and largely based on brief, flashed stimuli. Here, we tested whether alpha oscillations, the dominant human brain rhythm, rhythmically modulate visual encoding during sustained perception. EEG was recorded while participants viewed long-lasting (2s) Gabor patches. Using a phase-dependent decoding approach, we extracted EEG activity at specific alpha phases and quantified stimulus decoding accuracy. Decoding performance varied systematically with alpha phase, following a smooth unimodal profile that peaked over occipito-parietal electrodes. These effects emerged well after stimulus onset, indicating a sustained modulation of visual processing during continuous input. Our findings demonstrate that visual information is encoded more accurately at specific alpha phases. This provides direct evidence that sensory processing is gated by intrinsic brain activity and introduces a generalizable decoding framework for linking oscillatory phase to neural information processing.

">Learning-dependent cholinergic plasticity reconfigures cortical circuit dynamics.</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation by acetylcholine (ACh) plays a critical role in reshaping neural dynamics in the neocortex as a function of development, behavioral state, and learning 1-6. Prior work suggests cholinergic signaling can act as a gate for the subsequent induction of circuit plasticity 3,7,8. However, modification of ACh release could also be a direct mechanism for the expression of cortical plasticity. Here, we combine widefield and 2-photon imaging in head-fixed mice to show that visual fear conditioning leads to a selective, cue-dependent release of ACh in primary visual cortex that enhances visually-evoked neuronal responses via excitation of layer 1 GABAergic interneurons and resulting disinhibition of local excitatory pyramidal neurons. Cholinergic signaling through muscarinic receptors in visual cortex is necessary for both the enhanced visual response and conditioned fear behavior. Our results demonstrate a novel capacity for conditioned release of ACh in sensory cortex to serve as a mechanism for sensory-guided behavioral learning. Rather than acting as a simple gate, cortical neuromodulation may thus play a central role in the expression of learned behavior.

">A lobule-specific neuronal representation of song temporal structure in the songbird cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is involved in the acquisition and production of speech as revealed by clinical evidence and imaging studies, but its specific role however remains unclear. Songbirds provide a unique model to study the neural mechanisms of speech learning and production. Recent evidence highlights a contribution of the cerebellum to syllable duration in songbirds. Here, we aim at better understanding how and which cerebellar circuits may contribute to the tight control of syllable duration in zebra finches. We first confirmed that lesions in the lateral cerebellum affect syllable duration. We then recorded neuronal activity in the various cerebellar lobules in response to song playback and during singing with or without auditory feedback perturbation. We found that many cerebellar lobules receive non-selective auditory information locked to syllable boundaries during song playback, both in anaesthetized and awake behaving birds. During singing, cerebellar neurons in several lobules display song-locked responses with varying degrees of alignment to their playback responses and no alteration during auditory feedback perturbation. Singing-related activity tends to correlate with the fluctuations in syllable duration rather than any acoustic song feature. Importantly, neurons in lobule IV of the cerebellum are largely unaffected by auditory stimulation but display syllable-locked firing rate modulations during singing that precisely encode syllable boundaries with a sharp and tight increase in firing at syllable onsets and offsets. Altogether, our findings reveal cerebellar signals that may contribute to the control of the duration of vocal elements during singing, possibly serving as a forward model of song temporal features.

">Proteomic profile of hippocampal growth cones through early postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                The early postnatal period represents a critical window for neural circuit assembly in the developing hippocampus. Growth cones (GCs) play essential roles in establishing connectivity patterns, yet their proteomic composition during this dynamic developmental phase remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed comprehensive proteomic profiling of GCs isolated from the whole hippocampus (HP-GCs) and dentate gyrus (DG-GCs) across the first five postnatal days (P1, P3, P5) in mice. Mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis revealed that GCs from both regions are highly similar at P1, subsequently diverging. This earliest timepoint seems to be characterized by a high metabolic demand. Developmental trajectories of the GCs from the two subregions then start to differ, with P3 being a very dynamic period for HP-GCs, with GO terms related to RNA splicing, and a transition towards synapse formation by P5. On the contrary, DG-GCs seem to still be in an exploratory phase by P5, suggesting a delayed maturation and reflecting the later time course of the invasion of EC layer 2 Reelin-positive axons into this region. We identified over 5,000 proteins, with each timepoint characterized by distinct protein subsets. Temporal trajectory analysis revealed key GC markers including DCC, DPSYL2, and FABP7, which showed dynamic regulation across development. Notably, we identified multiple proteins containing nuclear localization sequences, suggesting bidirectional communication between GCs and the nucleus during critical developmental periods. Furthermore, our dataset contains over 400 proteins associated with neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, with twenty showing temporal regulation, highlighting the potential relevance of early developmental disruptions to disease pathogenesis. These findings provide a comprehensive proteomic resource for understanding GC function during hippocampal circuit formation and offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying region-specific developmental timelines in the brain.

                <p>Identifying neural signatures of slow-wave sleep (SWS) is important for a number of reasons including diagnosing potential sleep disorders and examining its role in memory consolidation (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B13">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Klinzing et al., 2019</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B4">Brodt et al., 2023</cross-ref>). Studies of sleep in the common marmoset (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) have revealed similarities to humans and other nonhuman primates, including distinct sleep stages (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Crofts et al., 2001</cross-ref>) and diurnal sleep patterns (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B18">Hoffmann et al., 2012</cross-ref>). Advances in applying wireless technology for recording neural activity during natural, unrestrained behaviors (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B39">Walker et al., 2021</cross-ref>) position the marmoset as an excellent model for studying sleep-related neural activity associated with learning. Here, we identify putative SWS epochs based on the spatially correlated activity of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from a multielectrode planar array implanted in the sensorimotor cortex of two marmosets (one female and one male). The average correlation of the LFP signal measured between electrodes decreased gradually with the distance between pairs. We modeled this spatial structure as an exponential decay function, where the spatial decay constant varied significantly over time, reaching its lowest values during epochs where LFP power dynamics were consistent with SWS. These periods of widespread high correlations across the sensorimotor cortex closely matched SWS identification commonly used in rodent models based on the changes in power in the gamma (30&ndash;60&nbsp;Hz) and delta/slow oscillation (0.1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) frequency bands. These findings demonstrate that putative SWS epochs can be reliably identified using spatially correlated LFP activity across the sensorimotor cortex.</p>

                <p>Listening effort reflects the cognitive and motivational resources allocated to speech comprehension, particularly under challenging conditions. Visual cues are known to enhance speech perception, potentially by reducing the cognitive demands of the task. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this facilitation, especially in terms of effort-related changes, remain unclear. In this study, we combined pupillometry and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how visual speech cues modulate cognitive effort during speech recognition. Twenty-two participants (seven females) performed a speech-in-noise task under three modalities: (1) auditory-only, (2) audiovisual, and (3) visual-only. Task difficulty was manipulated via signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the first two modalities. Firstly, we found an inverted U-shape relationship between pupil dilation and frontal midline theta with SNR for audiovisual and auditory-only speech, consistent with prior models of effort allocation. Secondly, we observed the SNR at which the neurophysiological measures peaked was at a lower SNR for audiovisual speech. Surprisingly, we found pupil dilation to be larger overall in audiovisual speech, while frontal midline theta did not show differences in either modality. These findings highlight the complexity of interpreting physiological markers of effort and suggest that visual cues may alter the temporal dynamics or resource allocation strategies during speech processing. Our results support the extension of auditory-based models of listening effort to audiovisual contexts and underscore the value of integrating multimodal neurophysiological measures to better understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms of effortful listening.</p>

                The slender walking catfish, Prophagorus nieuhofii, plays an important role in small-scale fisheries across Southeast Asia, supporting food security. While IUCN currently lists it as a Least Concern species, growing demand and pressures such as overfishing, habitat loss, and degradation may elevate its conservation risk. To support sustainable fisheries management and aquaculture, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the whole genome of this species. The specimen was part of an expedition to document and preserve the genetic resources of aquatic animals in Kalimantan’s freshwater ecosystems. Using 27 Gb of sequence data, we assembled a 1.1 Gb genome comprising 5,790 scaffolds. This genome assembly has high contiguity and completeness, with N50 of 33.7 Mb and a BUSCO score of 98.8%. Repeat annotation revealed that 48.17% of the genome consisted of repetitive elements, predominantly DNA transposons (18.56%) and retroelements (13.30%). Structural annotation identified 30,099 protein-coding genes and 37,734 transcripts, most of which were multi-exonic and rich in alternative splicing. BUSCO analysis confirmed the high completeness of the genome and annotation, with 97.7% of the conserved orthologs being detected.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) provides valuable insights into cell biology. However, current scRNA-Seq analytic approaches do not distinguish between spliced and unspliced mRNA at the level of dimensionality reduction. RNA velocity paradigms suggest that the presence of unspliced mRNA reflects transitional cell states, informative for studies of dynamic processes such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Alternatively, stable cell subsets may also maintain translationally repressed spliced mRNA in processing bodies (P-bodies) and/or unspliced mRNA reservoirs for prompt initiation of transcription-independent expression. To enable splicing-aware analysis of scRNA-Seq data, we developed a method called SANSARA (Splicing-Aware scrNa-Seq AppRoAch). We employed SANSARA to characterize peripheral blood regulatory T cell (T<sub>reg</sub>) subsets, revealing a complementary interplay between the FoxP3 and Helios master transcription factors and upregulation of functionally relevant <i>IL10RA</i>, <i>LGALS3</i>, <i>FCRL3</i>, <i>CD38</i>, <i>ITGAL</i>, and <i>LEF1</i> spliced gene forms in effector T<sub>reg</sub>s. Among Th1 and cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, SANSARA also revealed substantial splicing heterogeneity across subset-specific genes. SANSARA is straightforward to implement in current data analysis pipelines and opens new dimensions for scRNA-Seq-based discoveries.

In the field of Plant Protection Products (PPP), the combination of multiple active ingredients is a common strategy to improve the efficacy against target species. However, these mixtures may expose non-target species to untested chemical combinations due to varied application and degradation pathways. Developing a method to predict the effects of such mixtures without extensive testing is crucial for enhancing risk assessment for non-target organisms. Toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicodynamic (TD) models currently provide predictive power for the toxicity of mixture over time, utilizing the concentration addition and independent action principles. However, their capacity to capture complex, non-linear interactions - such as synergistic and antagonistic effects - remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new methodology that integrates TKTD models using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) with neural networks (NN), offering a robust framework for modeling complex substance interactions. The ODE component encodes fundamental biological principles that constrain the neural network to biologically plausible solutions. Bayesian inference further refines the model by addressing uncertainties in data, model parameters, and biological processes, while also allowing quantification of prediction uncertainty, highlighting gaps in experimental data that warrant further investigation. This hybrid model was evaluated across 99 acute toxicity studies that included various PPP mixtures, testing its ability to identify and forecast deviations from expected mixture behaviors. Our findings demonstrate that while simpler linear models provide a robust and parsimonious baseline for predicting additive mixture effects, the neural network component serves as a powerful tool for selectively identifying and forecasting significant non-linear deviations from these expectations. This dual approach clarifies the distinct roles of both simple and complex models, providing a more responsible framework to anticipate the combined effects of untested chemical mixtures and inform risk assessment practices.

The homeostasis of intracellular inorganic phosphate is essential for eukaryotic metabolism and is regulated by the INPHORS signalling pathway, which employs inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) as key intermediary messengers. This study investigates the metabolic pathways of inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) in the yeast cell line ΔSPX and the human tumor cell line HCT116. Utilizing pulse-labelling experiments with <sup>18</sup>O water and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, we explore the synthesis and turnover of the highly phosphorylated IPP, 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub>. Our findings challenge the notion that 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub> can be synthesized through distinct routes, revealing a linear reaction sequence in both systems. Employing model reduction via the profile likelihood method, we achieved statistically concise identifiability analysis that led to significant biological insights. In yeast, we determined that 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub> production primarily occurs through the phosphorylation of 5-InsP<sub>7</sub>, with the pathway involving 1-InsP<sub>7</sub> deemed unnecessary as its removal did not compromise model accuracy. Crucially, this prediction of altered IPP concentrations was validated experimentally in <i>vip1</i>Δ and <i>kcs1</i>Δ knockout strains, providing orthogonal biological support for the reduced model. In HCT116 cells, 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis is mainly driven by 1-InsP<sub>7</sub>, with variations observed across different experimental conditions. These results underscore the utility of model reduction in enhancing our understanding of metabolic pathways, coupling predictive modeling with experimental validation, and providing a framework for future investigations into the regulation and implications of linear IPP pathways in eukaryotic cells.

Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. However, translating high-dimensional data into functional pathway insights remains challenging. To address this obstacle, we developed PaaSc (Pathway activity analysis of Single-cell), a computational method for inferring pathway activity at single-cell resolution. PaaSc employs multiple correspondence analysis to simultaneously project cells and genes into a common latent space and selects pathway-associated dimensions through linear regression to infer pathway activity scores. We validated PaaSc across diverse benchmarking datasets, including those that jointly profiled protein and RNA levels, as well as large-scale cancer scRNA-seq cohorts. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, PaaSc demonstrated superior performance in multiple applications: scoring cell type-specific gene sets, identifying cell senescence-associated pathways, and exploring GWAS trait-associated cell types. Importantly, PaaSc maintained accuracy despite batch effects and demonstrated robust performance across different data modalities, including scATAC-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. Our results demonstrate that PaaSc accurately captures dynamic cellular states and spatial patterns, thereby advancing our understanding of cellular dynamics, aging, and disease mechanisms.

Equally spaced temporal sampling is the standard protocol for the study of biological rhythms. These equispaced designs perform well when calibrated to an oscillator’s period, yet can introduce systematic biases when applied to rhythms of unknown periodicity. Here, we investigate how optimizing the timing of measurements can improve rhythm detection across a range of experimental settings. When the period of a rhythm is known, we prove that equispaced designs provide optimal statistical power. In studies targeting specific sets of candidate rhythms, we construct optimal alternatives to equispaced designs to simultaneously maximize power at all frequencies under consideration. For studies investigating continuous period ranges, we show numerically how blindspots near the Nyquist rate can be resolved through timing optimization. Our computational methods are available through our PowerCHORD library. Our findings across all experimental contexts suggest that timing optimization is an effective yet under-explored tool for improving biological rhythm discovery.

                <p>by Hui Liu, Jiani Ma, Xianjun Ma, Lin Zhang</p>

Identifying pathogenic RNA methylation sites with a reasonable biological explanation has important implications for the treatment of diseases. Due to the limitations of in vitro experiments in identifying pathogenic RNA methylation sites, there is a growing need for computational workflows to enable accurate inference. Here, motivated by this profound meaning, we developed PathoRM, a biologically informed deep learning model, to infer associations between RNA methylation sites and diseases. PathoRM could provide convincing pathogenic RNA methylation sites and unravel the enigma of pathology in the epi-transcriptomic layer. PathoRM fuses RNA methylation host sequences and pathogenic descriptions as inputs, and subsequently employs large language models, multi-view learning algorithm, graph neural networks, an adversarial training approach, and “guilty-by-association”-derived negative sampling approach. PathoRM distils the semantically enriched feature embeddings, leading to more accurate and robust prediction performance across the metrics and datasets. Notably, incorporated with attention mechanism, PathoRM bestows itself biological interpretability through illuminating the dark matters in the host sequences of RNA methylation sites. This work is expected to assist in the discovery of pathogenic RNA methylation sites and conserved motifs, contributing to the advancement of genome research. Codes and pre-trained model are accessible at https://github.com/jianiM/PathoRM.

                <p>by Josune Imaz-Iruretagoyena, Maite Blanco-Urrejola, Irene Núñez-García, Irene García-Toledo, Luis C. Fernández-Beltrán, Mar Márquez, Silvia Corrochano, Amanda Sierra, Jimena Baleriola</p>

Polarized cells in the brain, such as neurons and glia, rely on the asymmetric distribution of their proteins compartmentalizing the function of dendrites, axons, glial projections, and endfeet. Subcellular proteomes can be assembled either by the transport of proteins synthesized in the cell soma or by the delivery of mRNAs to target compartments where they are locally translated into proteins. This latter mechanism is known as local protein synthesis or local translation, and it has been best studied in neurons. Increasing evidence suggests it is also required to maintain local protein homeostasis in glial cells; however, in microglia, local translation remains largely unexplored. Given the scant evidence, we aimed at exploring the existence of local translation in peripheral microglial processes (PeMPs) and unraveling its functional significance. We report that local translation indeed happens in PeMPs, and it is enhanced by triggering a microglial inflammatory response with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) suggesting a functional relevance of this molecular mechanism in response to inflammation. We found that <i>Actb</i> mRNA polarizes to PeMPs and is locally translated upon LPS exposure. Interestingly, downregulation of the <i>Actb</i>-binding protein IMP1/ZBP1 impaired <i>Actb</i> mRNA polarization and its localized translation, and led to defects in filopodia distribution, PeMP motility, lamellar directed migration, and phagocytosis in microglia. Thus, our work contributes to recent findings that mRNA localization and localized translation occur in microglia and gives a mechanistic insight into the relevance of this molecular mechanism in fundamental microglial functions in response to inflammation.

                We are living in an era of rapid transformation in the technology sector, where success depends on shifting from traditional static strategies to dynamic models that emphasize strategic agility and real-time decision making as shown in Figure 1. Despite ongoing digital transformation, a critical gap remains in understanding how predictive Artificial Intelligence (AI) and electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM) tools integrate into policy frameworks that future-proof organizations against disruption. This systematic literature review provides an evidence-based analysis of how digital AI and e-HRM platforms can be utilized to enhance strategic agility and real-time decision making in the technology industry. Through qualitative and thematic synthesis analysis of studies published between 2015 and 2025, the review finds that AI and e-HRM significantly strengthen strategic agility. However, challenges such as data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, integration difficulties, and resistance to AI adoption may limit scalability and ethical use. While AI-driven tools offer strong potential for improving agility, addressing ethical, technical, and organizational challenges is crucial to fully realize their benefits. The findings highlight the need for policies supporting ethical AI practices, robust data governance, and workforce readiness to ensure effective integration of AI tools and strengthen organizational agility and real time decision-making.

                Achievement goal orientation theory has become popular, as it interprets students’ academic attitudes and behavior. The present research aims to investigate the variation in teachers’ perceived goals in relation to achievement goals in different grades, as well as the emergence of the multiple goal theory. Participants were junior high school students who responded to a self-report questionnaire. The instrument used was the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS). The results revealed that mastery and performance goals behave as a network of interacting variables that essentially represent their coexistence, as well as their individual variations and specificities in relation to other variables. However, a significant distinction between mastery goals and perceived mastery goals with performance goals and perceived performance goals became apparent for each individual grade. The present research contributes to the theoretical development of the field, while in practice it highlights the combination of goals in school reality.

                Background The CRM nacelle is a benchmark model for both CFD validation and shock dominated flow interaction analysis in propulsion airframe configurations. However, accurate prediction of drag and lift remains challenging due to complex flow interaction near the nacelle surface. Methods This research investigates the aerodynamic performance of a CRM nacelle using the ANSYS 2023 Fluent tool with different numerical techniques like the grid independence test, different turbulence models, and different Mach number variations. Results At Mach 0.85, the nacelle with a fan and a 1.64 million grid size produced a Cd of 0.00245 with a 1.24% error. Similarly, out of six different models, the K-epsilon model produced the least validation error of 1.24%. Mach number variation from 0.8 to 1.3 Mach number shown a maximum Cd at 0.95 Mach followed by a decrement at 1.2 Mach. In the aerodynamic optimization, a core cone was added to the nacelle and further simulated at 0.82 Mach. Spalart-Allmara model with a 2.55 million grid size produced a Cl value of 0.01098 with an 8.54% validation error. The cone angles were varied from 15.7° by ±0.5° steps. Conclusions The optimized nacelle at a 13.7°cone angle showed an improved Cl of 0.011035 compared to the baseline model. The novelty of this research lies in testing the CRM nacelle under transonic flow conditions from 0.8 to 1.3 Mach and optimizing the nacelle aerodynamic performance using different numerical techniques. This research paper further helps the researchers in nacelle aerodynamics by optimizing the nacelle geometry for aerodynamic lift enhancement.

                The high performance computing (HPC) community is in a period of transition. The rise of AI/ML coupled with a changing landscape of resources deems portability a new metric of performance, and methods to move between on-premises and cloud environments and assess compatibility are paramount. Here we design and test a strategy for bridging the gap between traditional HPC and Kubernetes environments – first containerizing applications, providing automated orchestration to run studies, and packaging the setup with automated means to assess performance using low overhead eXtended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) programs. We first assess different designs for eBPF collection, demonstrating a tradeoff between number of programs deployed on a node and overhead added. We develop 5 low overhead eBPF programs that combine with streaming ML models to assess CPU, futex, TCP, shared memory, and file access across four different builds of an HPC application for CPU and GPU. We use eBPF data to generate insights into the possible underlying etiology of scaling issues. We then assess compatibility of a well-known benchmark, HPCG, across matrices of micro-architectures and optimization levels (217 containers across 24 instance types and over 7500 runs). We provide to the community 30 applications to deploy in our automated setup and perform a scaling study from 4 to a maximum of 256 nodes for both CPU and GPU applications. Finally, we use our gained knowledge about performance to generate compatibility artifacts that are used by a newly developed Kubernetes controller to intelligently select instance type based on optimizing a figure of merit. Along with insights to scaling in this environment with a collection of applications and templates to work from, we provide an overall strategy for approaching HPC application deployment and image selection based on compatibility in cloud.

                Artificial intelligence (AI) is swiftly emerging as a core component in the transformation of global healthcare systems, with its effectiveness contingent upon the readiness of the workforce, especially future physicians. The incorporation of AI into medical education must uphold essential principles, including ethical considerations, the preservation of the physician-patient relationship, and the primacy of human judgment. Preparing medical students for this evolution equips them to effectively leverage emerging technologies in clinical practice. This policy brief aims to establish a framework for preparing medical students for the future of AI in healthcare, assisting policymakers in universities, governments, and health authorities in developing effective educational programs. It presents prompt engineering as an innovative skill for medical students, facilitating personalized AI interactions in clinical simulations and ethical decision-making, while addressing existing gaps in current curricula. Incorporating findings from a 2025 cross-sectional study involving 1,619 medical students, this brief indicates a moderate level of AI readiness (61.34/100), with cognition identified as the weakest domain. This underscores the necessity for targeted curricula to bridge gaps in AI knowledge and cultivate practical skills such as prompt engineering for clinical simulations.

<p>Glial Innexin2 expression plays a role in suppression of heat-induced seizures and maintaining sleep architecture in <i>Drosophila</i>. A North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (NS-PME) model shows a decreased level and altered expression pattern of glial Innexin2, along with heat-induced seizures and disturbed sleep architecture.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (NS-PME) is a rare genetic disease that presents at an early age with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, and epilepsy. The disease is caused by a mutation in the Golgi SNAP receptor 2 gene (GOSR2). However, the consequences of this genetic defect at the cellular level are still unknown. Using a NS-PME <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> model, it was previously found that knockdown of <i>membrin</i>, the fruit fly GOSR2 ortholog, in glial cells leads to progressive heat-induced seizure-like behavior in adult flies. Upon close inspection, we found NS-PME flies not only show progressive heat-induced seizures but also disrupted sleep architecture (higher number of shorter sleep bouts). Here we asked what glial cellular consequences could be underlying these phenotypes of <i>membrin</i> knockdown. First, we investigate whether these phenotypes are attributed to specific glial types; we found that these phenotypes were partly reproduced with specific knockdown of <i>membrin</i> in perineurial glia only. Next, we show that Innexin2, a gap junction protein specifically expressed in glia, is affected upon <i>membrin</i> knockdown, with an altered expression pattern and reduced protein levels. Finally, glial overexpression of Innexin2 in the background of glial <i>membrin</i> knockdown strongly ameliorates the heat-induced seizure phenotype, disrupted sleep architecture, as well as Innexin2 expression pattern, corroborating the importance of Innexin2 in maintaining neuronal homeostasis in NS-PME. These findings show that dysregulation of Innexin2 at least partially underlies the phenotypes of <i>membrin</i> knockdown in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and could suggest a similar role of Innexin2-like proteins in the human disease NS-PME.</p>

                Purpose The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate differences in pathological outcomes and safety between subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer management. Methods A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect for original articles published until February 2024 that compared tumour characteristics, biochemical markers, and adverse effects associated with these treatments. The risk of bias from each study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Risk of Bias-2 (ROB-2) tool. Results Eleven studies meeting the inclusion criteria were analysed. Both subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological ADT effectively reduced tumour size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Subcapsular orchiectomy was linked to higher surgical complication rates. At the same time, due to its systemic pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacological ADT carries a greater risk of metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and insulin resistance. Conclusions Both subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological ADT are viable options for prostate cancer treatment. However, their differing safety and pharmacological profiles highlight the need for personalised treatment strategies based on individual patient factors and preferences.

     alt="Ophthalmologic Findings in an Induced Model of Holoprosencephaly in Zebrafish"/>
<p>We used a zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) model to variably induce <i>bmp4</i> during embryonic development. We show ophthalmologic phenotypes of variable severity depending on the length and onset of <i>bmp4</i> inductions. We find phenotypes like ocular hypotelorism, synophthalmia, cyclopia, and anophthalmia, which are described to be part of the HPE spectrum.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most frequent developmental disorder of the forebrain. In this condition, the separation of the early precursor domains is hampered. A spectrum of clinical manifestations can be observed, for example, severe forms like alobar HPE and less severe forms like lobar HPE. Ophthalmologic findings that accompany HPE also occur as a spectrum that ranges from ocular hypotelorism and synophthalmia to cyclopia and anophthalmia. In this brief analysis, we made use of a recently established zebrafish model of HPE. This model is based on experimental BMP ligand induction that resulted in anophthalmia. We attenuated the induction protocol to investigate whether the ophthalmologic phenotype can also be attenuated. We found a spectrum of ocular phenotypes: ocular hypotelorism, cases of synophthalmia, and cyclopia.</p>

                Singh et al. show that TMZ treatment in glioblastoma induces ATR- and PNPT1-dependent degradation of miR-181d. Loss of miR-181d de-represses PNPT1, establishing a feedforward loop that amplifies TMZ-induced miR-181d degradation. This circuit enhances MGMT expression and cell-to-cell variability, highlighting a mechanism driving resistance to alkylating chemotherapy.

                Miller et al. use fMRI to demonstrate that human hippocampal CA2/3 subfield damage results in retrograde autobiographical amnesia and destabilized frontal autobiographical mnemonic representations. Mnemonic stability in the right inferior frontal gyrus predicts retrograde episodic memory performance.

                Only a small number of barrier-enhancing factors have been discovered to specifically increase barrier integrity, enhance vessel stability, and make vessels resistant to fluid leakage. Here, Fahey et al. present DEVDIL-36β as a cytokine promoter of vascular integrity in the CNS, with barrier-enhancing properties through upregulation of junctional components.

                Miao et al. demonstrate that KIF18A depletion causes synthetic defects with CENP-C hypomorphic mutant and KIF18A functions for chromosome congression in cooperation with CENP-E. CENP-E levels at kinetochores are reduced in KIF18A-knockdown-sensitive cancer cells, suggesting that CENP-E is a potential marker for vulnerability to KIF18A inactivation in cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91431">Eye-specific differences in active zone addition during synaptic competition in the developing visual system</a></h4>

              
                Spatially clustered synaptic inputs enable local dendritic computations important for learning, memory, and sensory processing. In the mammalian visual system, individual retinal ganglion cell axons form clustered terminal boutons containing multiple active zones onto relay cell dendrites in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. This mature architecture arises through the addition of release sites, which strengthens selected afferents while weaker inputs are pruned. Following eye-opening, spontaneous activity and visual experience promote synaptic refinement and bouton clustering after binocular inputs have segregated. However, anatomical changes in release site addition and spatial patterning during earlier stages of eye-specific competition are not well understood. To investigate this, we examined the spatial organization of eye-specific active zones in wild-type mice and a mutant line with disrupted cholinergic retinal waves. Using volumetric super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy and electron microscopy, we found that individual retinogeniculate boutons begin forming multiple nearby presynaptic active zones during the first postnatal week. Both eyes generate these ‘multi-active-zone’ (mAZ) inputs throughout refinement, but the dominant eye forms more numerous mAZ contacts, each with more active zones and larger vesicle pools. At the height of competition (postnatal day 4), the non-dominant-eye projection adds many single-active-zone synapses. Mutants with abnormal cholinergic retinal waves still form mAZ inputs but develop fewer synapses overall and show reduced synaptic clustering in projections from both eyes. Together, these findings reveal eye-specific differences in release site addition that correlate with axonal segregation outcomes during retinogeniculate refinement.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106305">A tissue boundary orchestrates the segregation of inner ear sensory organs</a></h4>

              
                The inner ear contains distinct sensory organs, produced sequentially by segregation from a large sensory-competent domain in the developing otic vesicle. To understand the mechanistic basis of this process, we investigated the changes in prosensory cell patterning, proliferation, and character during the segregation of some of the vestibular organs in the mouse and chicken otic vesicle. We discovered a specialised boundary domain, located at the interface of segregating organs. It is composed of prosensory cells that gradually enlarge, elongate, and are ultimately diverted from a prosensory fate. Strikingly, the boundary cells align their apical borders and constrict basally at the interface of cells expressing or not the Lmx1a transcription factor, an orthologue of <i>Drosophila</i> Apterous. The boundary domain is absent in <i>Lmx1a</i>-deficient mice, which exhibit defects in sensory organ segregation and is disrupted by the inhibition of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility. Altogether, our results suggest that actomyosin-dependent tissue boundaries ensure the proper separation of inner ear sensory organs and uncover striking homologies between this process and the compartmentalisation of the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc by lineage-restricted boundaries.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105466">Parallel HIV-1 fitness landscapes shape viral dynamics in humans and macaques that develop broadly neutralizing antibodies</a></h4>

              
                HIV-1 evolves within individual hosts to escape adaptive immune responses while maintaining its capacity for replication. Coevolution between HIV-1 and the immune system generates extraordinary viral genetic diversity. In some individuals, this process also results in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can neutralize many viral variants, a key focus of HIV-1 vaccine design. However, a general understanding of the forces that shape virus-immune coevolution within and across hosts remains incomplete. Here, we performed a quantitative study of HIV-1 evolution in humans and rhesus macaques, including individuals who developed bnAbs. We observed strong selection early in infection for mutations affecting HIV-1 envelope glycosylation and escape from autologous strain-specific antibodies, followed by weaker selection for bnAb resistance. The inferred fitness effects of HIV-1 mutations in humans and macaques were remarkably similar. Moreover, we observed a striking pattern of rapid HIV-1 fitness gains that precedes the development of bnAbs. Our work highlights strong parallels between infection in rhesus macaques and humans, and it reveals a quantitative evolutionary signature of bnAb development.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The organization of the human cerebral cortex during fetal development is regulated by multiple processes, including neurogenesis and neuronal migration, which are essential for cortical expansion and folding patterns. According to the radial unit hypothesis, neurons originate in the germinal zone and migrate radially along the radial glial scaffolds to reach the cortical plate. However, the spatial distributions of these scaffolds and their roles in cortical folding remain unclear. Consequently, a computational model was developed to simulate virtual scaffolds extending from the cerebral ventricular surface to the white matter, incorporating region-specific neurogenic potential. The results demonstrate dense scaffold distribution in the perisylvian region, where complex cortical folding emerges, suggesting that differences in scaffold distribution contribute to region-specific cortical expansion. Notably, increased neuron influx along the scaffolds in the perisylvian region may contribute to early volumetric growth, potentially influencing Sylvian fissure formation. These findings align with previous reports that demonstrate distinct developmental patterns in this region. Being an accurate representation of radial migration pathways, this model provides a framework for integrating tangential migration of inhibitory neurons, refining scaffold distribution estimates, and quantifying early cortical development, offering insights into neurogenetic regional variations, scaffold architecture, and cortical folding in the human fetal brain.</span>

PVWMH and DWMH volume increased exponentially with age, but PVWMH rose twice as fast, with inflection at 61 years. PVWMH &gt; 2.3 mL, independent of age, was associated with structural atrophy (rostralmiddlefrontal, pre/postcentral gyri, lingual-gyrus, nucleus-accumbens), global fiber disintegration, and impairments in executive, attentional, semantic domains. DWMH effects were negligible. Longitudinal mixed-models in NACC and ADNI confirmed that PVWMH progression, not DWMH, predicted accelerated atrophy. PVWMH-related neuroanatomic loss mediates cognitive decline. The 2.3 mL threshold was validated in ADNI3. While both are visible on routine MRI, only PVWMH demonstrated threshold-dependent effects. Progression to ≥2.3 mL marks a threshold, demanding clinical surveillance, vascular-risk management, and recognition of accelerated brain-aging. Neuroimaging-based quantification of PVWMH, combined with domain-specific cognitive testing provides robust measures of clinical surveillance, definitive of brain health.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Aging-related dopamine decline has been suggested as a key factor behind individual differences in cognitive decline at older ages. Thus far, the hypothesized age-dopamine-cognition triad has been extrapolated from cross-sectional studies, which cannot uncover change associations. Using data from the longitudinal Cognition, Brain, and Aging (COBRA) study, we examined whether dopamine D2-receptor availability changes are correlated with cognitive changes across individuals in old age. At the first wave, 181 healthy adults aged 64 to 68 years underwent positron emission tomography with <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride, magnetic resonance imaging, multiple cognitive tests assessing episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed, and mapping of health-related factors. The returnees (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 129 after 5 years; <span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 93 after 10 years) were representative of the parent sample regarding gender composition, educational attainment, cognitive performance, and dopamine D2-receptor status at baseline. Bayesian structural equation modeling revealed mean decline and individual differences in decline for striatal dopamine D2-receptor availability (approximately -5% per decade) and for all three cognitive abilities. Changes in dopamine D2-receptor and a factor of general cognition were positively correlated (r = 0.31, P(r &gt; 0.00) &gt; 0.95). Taken together, these longitudinal findings support that striatal dopamine decline is associated with cognitive aging, possibly reflecting dopamine influences via striato-thalamo-cortical loops on general cognitive functions.</span>

Public sharing of well-documented codes for such models facilitates further development. Nevertheless, scientific practice in computational neuroscience suffers from replication problems and little re-use of circuit models. One exception is a data-driven model of early sensory cortex by Potjans and Diesmann that has advanced computational neuroscience as a building block for more complex models. As a widely accepted benchmark for correctness and performance, the model has driven the development of CPU-based, GPU-based, and neuromorphic simulators. On the 10th anniversary of the publication of this model, experts convened at the Käte Hamburger Kolleg Cultures of Research at RWTH Aachen University to reflect on the reasons for the model’s success, its effect on computational neuroscience and technology development, and the perspectives this offers for the future of computational neuroscience.

                <p>Exposure to early life stress (ELS) can exert long-lasting impacts on emotional regulation. The corticolimbic system including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventral hippocampus (vHIP), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in fear learning. Using the limited bedding paradigm (LB), we examined the functional consequences of ELS on excitatory and inhibitory tone in the prelimbic (PL) mPFC after fear conditioning in rats. In adults, LB exposure enhanced in vivo glutamate release in the PL mPFC during fear conditioning in male, but not female offspring. In contrast, the glutamate response to fear conditioning was diminished in LB-exposed pre-adolescent males, but not females. We investigated whether reduced glutamatergic inputs and/or elevated inhibitory tone might contribute to the diminished glutamate response in the mPFC following LB in pre-adolescent male rats. Indeed, we found that LB exposure specifically increased the activation of PV, but not SST interneurons in layer V, but not layer II/III of the PL mPFC in fear-exposed pre-adolescent males. Presynaptic glutamate release probability was reduced by LB exposure in layer V, but increased in layer II/III of the PL mPFC. These functional changes might be related to the LB-induced alterations in the bilaminar distribution of BLA and vHIP projections to the PL mPFC we observed in pre-adolescent males. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS modifies glutamate release and PL mPFC function during fear conditioning in a sex- and age-dependent fashion, likely through layer-specific shifts in excitation/inhibition balance.</p>

                <p>Higher education (HE) is undergoing rapid transformation, shaped as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the expansion of digital learning, and the increasing presence of artificial intelligence (AI). For educators, these shifts raise important questions about their evolving purpose and responsibilities. In this commentary, we reflect on the role of bioscience educators in the United Kingdom, highlighting the enduring need for human connection, empathy, and belonging in teaching, alongside the integration of digital tools. We discuss changing student motivations, the necessity of flexible and inclusive learning environments, and the balance between traditional practices and innovative pedagogies. Practical training, active learning, and responsible engagement with emerging technologies remain central to equipping students with transferable skills such as adaptability, critical thinking, and resilience. We argue that while digital innovations can enhance accessibility and engagement, they cannot replace the uniquely human dimensions of teaching. Ultimately, bioscience educators must embrace their dual role as facilitators and lifelong learners, modeling curiosity, vulnerability, and inclusivity to empower students to thrive in an increasingly complex world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-561/v2?src=rss">Income Inequality, Governance Quality, and Political Engagement: A Cross-country Analysis of Disparities and Democratic Participation [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Whether income inequality erodes citizens’ (VA) depends on institutional context. We examine how integrity—proxied by Control of Corruption (CC)—conditions the inequality–voice link across developed and developing democracies. Methods We assemble a harmonised, unbalanced 10-country panel (2003–2022) with VA as outcome and a parsimonious set of regressors: lagged Gini, lagged poverty, lagged GDP-per-capita growth, CC, Political Stability, and Gini×CC. We test cross-sectional dependence, serial correlation, and stationarity (IPS/CADF). Given mixed orders of integration and no panel cointegration in Westerlund tests with bootstrap p-values, our main specification is first-difference two-way fixed effects with country-clustered inference. A dynamic Augmented Anderson–Hsiao (AAH) estimator provides robustness. Multicollinearity among governance pillars is addressed via diagnostics (VIF) and a parsimonious design. Heterogeneity is assessed via separate models for developed and developing groups. Results Diagnostics indicate cross-sectional and AR(1) dependence; VA, Gini, poverty, and CC behave as I(1), while growth and stability are I(0); Westerlund fails to reject no cointegration (bootstrap p≈0.51 across Gt/Ga/Pt/Pa). In Δ two-way FE, CC is a robust positive correlate of VA, whereas the main Gini effect is small/unstable; the Gini×CC term shows that integrity conditions the inequality–voice link. In developed countries, higher integrity attenuates the (marginally) negative association of inequality with VA (interaction >0). In developing countries, integrity amplifies a negative inequality–VA association as CC improves (interaction <0). The AAH model confirms high persistence in VA (lag ≈0.70, p<0.001), a positive CC effect (≈0.33, p≈0.02), and a borderline negative Gini×CC interaction (p≈0.08). Conclusions The political impact of inequality is context-dependent and integrity-mediated. Control of Corruption consistently emerges as the institutional dimension most tightly linked to citizens’ voice, while inequality’s association with VA hinges on governance quality and differs by development group. Absent cointegration, findings are interpreted as short-run within-country associations. Policy should pair inequality-reducing reforms with integrity-building measures to safeguard VA.

                Background Structural variants (SVs) and metagenomics remain challenging areas in genomics, requiring new tools and collaborative solutions. Hackathons provide a rapid, team-based approach to prototyping and innovation. Methods In August 2024, 48 scientists from six continents convened at Baylor College of Medicine for the Sixth Structural Variant Codeathon. Participants worked in interdisciplinary teams over three days, using public datasets and cloud-based infrastructure to design and implement computational tools. Results Eight projects were developed, addressing topics such as tandem repeat annotation, structural variant discovery, benchmarking, pangenome visualization, and machine learning applications. Each project produced open-source software, with repositories openly available on GitHub and archived on Zenodo. Conclusions The hackathon fostered global collaboration and generated reproducible, community-driven tools. These outputs provide new resources for structural variation and metagenomics research and demonstrate the effectiveness of hackathons in advancing genomic science.

                <p>by Yue Huang, Tianqi Tang, Xiaowu Dai, Fengzhu Sun</p>

Understanding microbial interactions is fundamental for exploring population dynamics, particularly in microbial communities where interactions affect stability and host health. Generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) models have been widely used to investigate system dynamics but depend on absolute abundance data, which are often unavailable in microbiome studies. To address this limitation, we introduce an iterative Lotka-Volterra (iLV) model, a novel framework tailored for compositional data that leverages relative abundances and iterative refinements for parameter estimation. The iLV model features two key innovations: an adaptation of the gLV framework to compositional constraints and an iterative optimization strategy combining linear approximations with nonlinear refinements to enhance parameter estimation accuracy. Using simulations and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that iLV surpasses existing methodologies, such as the compositional LV (cLV) and the generalized LV (gLV) model, in recovering interaction coefficients and predicting species trajectories under varying noise levels and temporal resolutions. Applications to the lynx-hare predator-prey, <i>Stylonychia pustula</i>-<i>P. caudatum</i> mixed culture, and cheese microbial systems revealed consistency between predicted and observed relative abundances showcasing its accuracy and robustness. In summary, the iLV model bridges theoretical gLV models and practical compositional data analysis, offering a robust framework to infer microbial interactions and predict community dynamics using relative abundance data, with significant potential for advancing microbial research.

Deep metabarcoding offers an efficient and reproducible approach to biodiversity monitoring, but noisy data and incomplete reference databases challenge accurate diversity estimation and taxonomic annotation. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm, NEEAT, for removing spurious operational taxonomic units (OTUs) originating from nuclear-embedded mitochondrial DNA sequences (NUMTs) or sequencing errors. It integrates ‘echo’ signals across samples with the identification of unusual evolutionary patterns among similar DNA sequences. We also extensively benchmark current tools for chimera removal, taxonomic annotation and OTU clustering of deep metabarcoding data. The best performing tools/parameter settings are integrated into HAPP, a high-accuracy pipeline for processing deep metabarcoding data. Tests using CO1 data from BOLD and large-scale metabarcoding data on insects demonstrate that HAPP significantly outperforms existing methods, while enabling efficient analysis of extensive datasets by parallelizing computations across taxonomic groups.

     alt="Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibition Confers Neuroprotection via PPAR-α Activation During Intracerebral Hemorrhage"/>
<p>Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) exerts a neuroprotective effect in a collagenase-induced hemorrhagic stroke model, likely by increasing EETs. This neuroprotection appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the regulation of antioxidant balance. Notably, all the beneficial effects conferred by sEH inhibition were abolished by selective PPAR-α inhibition, indicating that EETs exert their neuroprotective actions through PPAR-α activation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), are known to possess potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant neuroprotective properties. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are not well understood. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective role of EETs in a hemorrhagic stroke model and the possible involvement of PPAR-α activation in this neuroprotection. Hemorrhagic damage was induced in mice through the intracerebral administration of collagenase VII in the striatum. The neuroprotective effect of EETs was tested in mice by pre-treatments of 2 h with TPPU, an inhibitor of the EETs metabolism. TPPU was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 2 mg/kg. Brain damage was evaluated based on measurements of motor activity, hematoma volume, brain water content, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Additionally, the levels of enzymes involved in the oxidative stress balance, such as NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX-2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were determined by Western blot analysis. Our results showed that EETs exert neuroprotective effects by significantly decreasing all parameters related to brain damage, improving motor function and promoting an antioxidant state, as evidenced by increased levels of SOD and reduced levels of NOX enzymes. Subsequently, PPAR-α involvement was evaluated through the administration of GW6471, a PPAR-α antagonist. Pre-treating mice with GW6471 for 30 min, reverted all neuroprotective effects, including the observed changes in SOD and NOX levels. Our results demonstrate that EETs confer neuroprotection in hemorrhagic brain injury, and this effect is dependent on PPAR-α activation.</p>

                Background One billion people worldwide have preventable vision impairment. Ocular morbidities are a significant problem in the public health sector, especially among medical students. The study objectives were to identify the prevailing ocular morbidities and evaluate the risk factors and their impact on students’ lifestyles and academics. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 312 undergraduate medical students over 6 months. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analysed to identify the prevalence, associated risk factors, and consequences of ocular morbidities. Results 64.7% were suffering from ocular morbidities. Headache was a predominant symptom in students with (51.7%) and without (39.1%) ocular morbidities. The most common ocular morbidity was myopia (84.3%). 18.7% of students perceived that ocular morbidity had restricted them from participating in activities or applying for specific job posts. The evaluation of various risk factors inferred that ocular morbidity was associated with family history, early age onset of the condition, lighting, posture while reading, screen time, and a vitamin A-rich diet. Conclusion The study concluded that the most prevalent ocular morbidity was refractive error, with myopia being the highest among medical students, and it has adversely impacted the students’ lifestyle and academics, underscoring the need for early detection, preventive strategies, and health education interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-853/v2?src=rss">Innovations in Inventory Management to Improve the Profitability of Local SMEs [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Efficient inventory management is a critical internal capability for ensuring the financial sustainability of micro and small enterprises, especially in emerging economies affected by post-pandemic disruptions. In Bagua, Peru, MSMEs often lack digitised control systems, leading to frequent stock imbalances, rushed purchases at high prices, and lower profitability; a deeper understanding of inventory practices that drive financial performance can contribute to more informed and strategic decision-making. Method This quantitative, descriptive, and explanatory study examined the effects of four components of inventory management—control, valuation methods, control records, and measurement—on profitability; a convenience sample of 83 MSMEs yielded 200 valid responses from key personnel involved in inventory decisions; A 21-item Likert scale validated by experts was applied, and the data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression in SPSS v27. Profitability indicators included return on assets (ROA), gross margin (GM), and return on equity (ROE). Results All dimensions of the inventory showed moderate levels of implementation (means: 2.37–2.62 on a five-point scale). The regression model demonstrated satisfactory predictive power (R2 = 0.402; F = 32.81; p < 0.001). Inventory measurement was the strongest and only highly significant predictor of profitability (β = 0.383; p < 0.001), followed by inventory control, with a smaller but significant contribution (β = 0.257; p = 0.013). Inventory valuation methods and control records did not show statistically significant direct effects (p > 0.40). Conclusion The findings highlight that decision-oriented measurement practices, supported by systematic control, are essential factors for the financial performance of micro and small enterprises; investment in digital monitoring tools, replenishment based on key performance indicators, and staff training could improve operational and financial efficiency; due to its cross-sectional design and localised context, future studies should incorporate longitudinal data and broader geographical comparisons to strengthen generalisation and explore possible mediation pathways between accounting-oriented practices and profitability.

                Background Although preventable and treatable, oral diseases affect nearly half of the world’s population, driven by limited accessibility and equity in oral healthcare services, and lack of integration of oral health into noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and universal health coverage (UHC) agendas. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Strategy and Action Plan on Oral Health 2023–2030 (WHOOH) emphasizes the importance of embedding oral health in national health systems and policies. Evidence-informed oral health policies (OHPs) can help reduce disease burden, improve access, and address inequalities. However, in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMR) (hereafter, EMR), current policies have not achieved meaningful impact, constrained by barriers that require comprehensive analysis and systematic evaluation. This review aims to systematically identify and assess OHPs and barriers and facilitators influencing their creation, dissemination, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation (CDIM&E). Methods A systematic search was developed for Ovid MEDLINE, and also used to search Embase, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos. It will also be applied to global and regional databases, covering January 2014 to December 2024 without language restrictions. Additional searches will be conducted on government websites (e.g., ministries of health) to capture OHPs. Eligible documents will include official and up-to-date national OHPs, and research or policy-related documents reporting barriers to and facilitators for the CDIM&E of OHPs. Independent reviewers will perform screening and data extraction using DistillerSR. Quantitative data will be analyzed in R Studio using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data will undergo thematic analysis in NVivo. Discussion Advancing evidence-informed OHPs in the EMR requires mapping existing national policies, evaluating their alignment with WHOOH targets, and understanding the barriers and facilitators for their CDIM&E. This review’s findings may help and support ministries of health, chief dental officers, academic institutions, and regional interest-holders to inform policy dialogue and support collective efforts to achieve the WHOOH targets. Registration The protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DQ6E4.

                Backgrounds Alopecia in captive non-human primates (NHPs) is a major animal welfare concern in many primate facilities. Some studies suggested that the mycobiome, considered fungal communities in specific areas, could influence the pathogenesis of alopecia. However, the pathogenesis mechanism of alopecia in cynomolgus macaques is poorly known. Objectives This study aims to investigate the association between alopecia and skin mycobiota in cynomolgus macaques. Methods Skin swab samples were collected from five areas where alopecia is common (arm, dorsal, head, leg, and ventral areas) of 47 healthy and 50 alopecic macaques. The samples were extracted for DNA. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) was applied to explore the skin mycobiota based on full-length Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing. Results Our findings showed that alpha and beta diversities significantly differed between alopecic and healthy macaques among the five areas. Wallemia sebi was associated with alopecia in the arm. Furthermore, Candida albicans, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Exophiala dermatitidis, and Candida parapsilosis were prevalent in the dorsal and head areas. Moreover, Aspergillus penicillioides was dominant in the dorsal and ventral areas. Pseudozyma sp., Moesziomyces antarcticus, and Cladosporium dominicanum were uniquely found in the head area. Apiotrichum domesticum was highly observed in the leg and ventral areas. Lastly, Cladosporium halotolerans was uniquely detected in the ventral area. Conclusion These microorganisms may be associated with the development of alopecia in cynomolgus macaques. These findings might be useful for biomedical research and therapeutic management strategies of animal health in primate facilities in the future.
