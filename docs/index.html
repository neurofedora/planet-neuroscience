	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) and stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Methods: AIS patients were enrolled in two centers. The serum samples were collected within the first 24 h after admission, and HMGB1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of SAP for HMGB1 concentrations. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were performed to explore the shapes of the association between HMGB1 concentrations and SAP. Results: From January 2022 to May 2022, a total of 420 AIS patients were enrolled. Ninety-six (22.9%) patients develop SAP. The levels of HMGB1 in the SAP group were higher than those in the non-SAP group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Using the first quartile of HMGB1 group as a reference, patients in the fourth quartile of HMGB1 group had the highest likelihood of experiencing SAP in the unadjusted model (OR = 3.687; 95% CI: 1.851&amp;amp;ndash;7.344), age- and sex-adjusted model (OR = 3.511; 95% CI: 1.725&amp;amp;ndash;7.147), and multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 2.701; 95% CI: 1.045&amp;amp;ndash;6.981). HMGB1 was also independently associated with SAP as a continuous variable in the unadjusted model (OR = 1.132; 95% CI: 1.069&amp;amp;ndash;1.199), age- and sex-adjusted model (OR = 1.131; 95% CI: 1.066&amp;amp;ndash;1.200), and multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 1.096; 95% CI: 1.011&amp;amp;ndash;1.188). RCS showed a linear association between HMGB1 and SAP (p for linear trend = 0.008) Conclusions: HMGB1 might be able to act as a potential biomarker of SAP in AIS patients.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder often associated with pre-motor symptoms involving both gastrointestinal and olfactory tissues. PD patients frequently suffer from hyposmia, hyposalivation, dysphagia and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. During the last few years it has been speculated that microbial agents could play a crucial role in PD. In particular, alterations of the microbiota composition (dysbiosis) might contribute to the formation of misfolded &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein, which is believed to be the leading cause of PD. However, while several findings confirmed that there might be an important link between intestinal microbiota alterations and PD onset, little is known about the potential contribution of the nasal microbiota. Here, we describe the latest findings on this topic by considering that more than 80% of patients with PD develop remarkable olfactory deficits in their prodromal disease stage. Therefore, the nasal microbiota might contribute to PD, eventually boosting the gut microbiota in promoting disease onset. Finally, we present the applications of the seed amplification assays to the study of the gut and olfactory mucosa of PD patients, and how they could be exploited to investigate whether pathogenic bacteria present in the gut and the nose might promote &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein misfolding and aggregation.</p>

	<p>Engaging in musical activities throughout the lifespan may protect against age-related cognitive decline and modify structural and functional connectivity in the brain. Prior research suggests that musical experience modulates brain regions that integrate different modalities of sensory information, such as the insula. Most of this research has been performed in individuals classified as professional musicians; however, general musical experiences across the lifespan may also confer beneficial effects on brain health in older adults. The current study investigated whether general musical experience, characterized using the Goldsmith Music Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI), was associated with functional connectivity in older adults (age = 65.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.4, n = 69). We tested whether Gold-MSI was associated with individual differences in the functional connectivity of three a priori hypothesis-defined seed regions in the insula (i.e., dorsal anterior, ventral anterior, and posterior insula). We found that older adults with more musical experience showed greater functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior insula and the precentral and postcentral gyrus, and between the ventral anterior insula and diverse brain regions, including the insula and prefrontal cortex, and decreased functional connectivity between the ventral anterior insula and thalamus (voxel p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01, cluster FWE p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Follow-up correlation analyses showed that the singing ability subscale score was key in driving the association between functional connectivity differences and musical experience. Overall, our findings suggest that musical experience, even among non-professional musicians, is related to functional brain reorganization in older adults.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">BDNF as a potential predictive biomarker for patients with pediatric cerebral palsy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in children, which is instigated by damage to the developing brain that affects the ability to control the muscles. The main types of CP are spastic CP, dyskinesia CP and mixed CP. The aim of this work was to estimate the concentrations of complete blood count (CBC), erythrocytic sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in children with CP compared to the control group. Methods: A total of 75 Egyptian children were enrolled in this study, 45 had CP and 30 were controls. CBC, ESR, CRP, BDNF, and TNF-α were assessed. Results: The ESR, CRP and TNF-α levels showed statistically significant increases in cases compared with controls. While the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and the BDNF levels were significantly lower in CP compared with the controls. When comparing the different groups of CP with each other; there were no significant differences. Regarding the correlation of BDNF and different studied parameters, our study showed a positive correlation between BDNF and TNF levels only within the group with spastic CP. Conclusions: BDNF may be considered as a biomarker or treatment target for CP to avoid further complications as still there is insufficient progress in the prediction, early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CP. Furthermore, searching for novel strategies to increase BDNF levels may open a new opportunity for the treatment of CP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Stage 1 Registered Report: Refinement of tickling protocols to improve positive animal welfare in laboratory rats [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Rat tickling is a heterospecific interaction for experimenters to mimic the interactions of rat play, where they produce 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USV), symptoms of positive affect; tickling can improve laboratory rat welfare. The standard rat tickling protocol involves gently pinning the rat in a supine position. However, individual response to this protocol varies. This suggests there is a risk that some rats may perceive tickling as only a neutral experience, while others as a positive one, depending on how tickling is performed. Based on our research experiences of the standard tickling protocol we have developed a playful handling (PH) protocol, with reduced emphasis on pinning, intended to mimic more closely the dynamic nature of play. We will test whether our PH protocol gives rise to more uniform increases in positive affect across individuals relative to protocols involving pinning. We will compare the response of juvenile male and female Wistar rats as: Control (hand remains still against the side of the test arena), P0 (PH with no pinning), P1 (PH with one pin), P4 (PH with four pins). P1 and P4 consist of a background of PH, with treatments involving administration of an increasing dosage of pinning per PH session. We hypothesise that rats exposed to handling protocols that maximise playful interactions (where pinning number per session decreases) will show an overall increase in total 50 kHz USV as an indicator of positive affect, with less variability. We will explore whether behavioural and physiological changes associated with alterations in PH experience are less variable. We propose that maximising the numbers of rats experiencing tickling as a positive experience will reduce the variation in response variables affected by tickling and increase the repeatability of research where tickling is applied either as a social enrichment or as a treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A scoping review protocol on diagnostic and treatment costs of cardiovascular disease management in India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality in India. Economic threats due to CVDs have surged, as diagnostic and treatment costs are out-of-pocket expenses. The increasing prevalence of CVDs in India is due to globalization, industrialization, aging, tobacco and alcohol consumption, diet, and sleep patterns. This scoping review provides a summary of the costs incurred in diagnosing and treating CVDs in India. Methods: The JBI updated methodology aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will guide this scoping review. Searches will be conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, Econ Papers, and ProQuest databases. Google Scholar and Shodhganga will be used to search for relevant gray literature. Bibliographic mining will be performed to identify additional relevant studies. The literature published from 2000 onwards will be the primary focus. All direct and indirect costs for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs across various levels of healthcare settings will be included. A two-stage independent screening, consisting of title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening, will be conducted to identify eligible articles. Data will be extracted from full-text studies using a customized data extraction form. The results will be compiled and presented in the scoping review performed. Ethics and dissemination: A conference presentation and scientific peer-reviewed journal publication will be the sources for disseminating the review results. This study does not require an ethics review because publicly available sources were used to retrieve data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multiple institutions’ research findings using the National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mesothelioma remains an under-researched cancerous disease due to the lack of high-quality patient samples and clinical information especially outcomes and asbestos exposure data. The National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank (NMVB) is a biobank in which mesothelioma annotated biospecimens can be made widely available to the research community. Here, we summarized the significant research findings from 20 publications that utilized the NMVB samples for novel biomarker and therapeutic discoveries. The results showed that the use of the NMVB resource was dispersed among a variety of basic science topics including, but not limited to, biomarkers, abnormal gene expression, and potential therapeutic targets. Positive biomarkers included several miRNAs and antibodies, HMGB1, ATG5, PIAS3, pancytokeratin and GATA3. Genes that had mutations or high/low levels of expression were BAP1, a human control gene of importance in this disease, as well as various cytokines, and checkpoint inhibitors TM4SF1, PKM2, ARHGDIA, COBLL1, WT1, FOXM1, and CD30. Treatments investigated include thiostrepton, interferon-�� gene, and Brentuximab. Publications reviewed indicated a significant impact of the NMVB resource utilized in significant studies focusing on biomarker and therapeutic discoveries, which can act as a model for rare diseases, especially in oncology.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Invasive micropapillary ductal breast carcinoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast is a rare variant of invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC), with most cases characterized by lymph node metastasis and lymphatic vascular invasion. It is a ductal breast cancer subtype with a very high risk of recurrence and therefore requires special attention from breast cancer physicians and radiologists. Case: We present a case of an IMPC that has been followed up for two years since diagnosis and management. Based on clinical breast examination, ultrasound, and mammography, the initial diagnosis was a suspicious mass that required further investigation. Radiological and histological findings informed the diagnosis of a highly suspicious lesion, which turned out to be IMPC. The patient underwent surgery, left mastectomy with nodal dissection. During the 24-month follow-up, ultrasound and mammography revealed no evidence of local recurrence or involvement of the contralateral breast. Conclusions: This case reveals that invasive micropapillary carcinoma is a distinct but poorly recognized variant and subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Operant conditioning of stochastic chemical reaction networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Arredondo, Matthew R. Lakin</p>

Adapting one’s behavior to environmental conditions and past experience is a key trait of living systems. In the biological world, there is evidence for adaptive behaviors such as learning even in naturally occurring, non-neural, single-celled organisms. In the bioengineered world, advances in synthetic cell engineering and biorobotics have created the possibility of implementing lifelike systems engineered from the bottom up. This will require the development of programmable control circuitry for such biomimetic systems that is capable of realizing such non-trivial and adaptive behavior, including modification of subsequent behavior in response to environmental feedback. To this end, we report the design of novel stochastic chemical reaction networks capable of probabilistic decision-making in response to stimuli. We show that a simple chemical reaction network motif can be tuned to produce arbitrary decision probabilities when choosing between two or more responses to a stimulus signal. We further show that simple feedback mechanisms from the environment can modify these probabilities over time, enabling the system to adapt its behavior dynamically in response to positive or negative reinforcement based on its decisions. This system thus acts as a form of operant conditioning of the chemical circuit, in the sense that feedback provided based on decisions taken by the circuit form the basis of the learning process. Our work thus demonstrates that simple chemical systems can be used to implement lifelike behavior in engineered biomimetic systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sleep prevents catastrophic forgetting in spiking neural networks by forming a joint synaptic weight representation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryan Golden, Jean Erik Delanois, Pavel Sanda, Maxim Bazhenov</p>

Artificial neural networks overwrite previously learned tasks when trained sequentially, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, the brain learns continuously, and typically learns best when new training is interleaved with periods of sleep for memory consolidation. Here we used spiking network to study mechanisms behind catastrophic forgetting and the role of sleep in preventing it. The network could be trained to learn a complex foraging task but exhibited catastrophic forgetting when trained sequentially on different tasks. In synaptic weight space, new task training moved the synaptic weight configuration away from the manifold representing old task leading to forgetting. Interleaving new task training with periods of off-line reactivation, mimicking biological sleep, mitigated catastrophic forgetting by constraining the network synaptic weight state to the  previously learned manifold, while allowing the weight configuration to converge towards the intersection of the manifolds representing old and new tasks. The study reveals a possible strategy of synaptic weights dynamics the brain applies during sleep to prevent forgetting and optimize learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Hypermutator strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveal novel pathways of resistance to combinations of cephalosporin antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Augusto Dulanto Chiang, Prashant P. Patil, Lidia Beka, Jung-Ho Youn, Adrien Launay, Robert A. Bonomo, Pavel P. Khil, John P. Dekker</p>

Hypermutation due to DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies can accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Whether hypermutators generate resistance through predominantly similar molecular mechanisms to wild-type (WT) strains is not fully understood. Here, we show that MMR-deficient <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> can evolve resistance to important broad-spectrum cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotics through novel mechanisms not commonly observed in WT lineages. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and transcriptional profiling of isolates that underwent in vitro adaptation to ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA), we characterized the detailed sequence of mutational and transcriptional changes underlying the development of resistance. Surprisingly, MMR-deficient lineages rapidly developed high-level resistance (>256 μg/mL) largely without corresponding fixed mutations or transcriptional changes in well-established resistance genes. Further investigation revealed that these isolates had paradoxically generated an early inactivating mutation in the <i>mexB</i> gene of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, a primary mediator of CZA resistance in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, potentially driving an evolutionary search for alternative resistance mechanisms. In addition to alterations in a number of genes not known to be associated with resistance, 2 mutations were observed in the operon encoding the RND efflux pump MexVW. These mutations resulted in a 4- to 6-fold increase in resistance to ceftazidime, CZA, cefepime, and ceftolozane-tazobactam when engineered into a WT strain, demonstrating a potentially important and previously unappreciated mechanism of resistance to these antibiotics in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>. Our results suggest that MMR-deficient isolates may rapidly evolve novel resistance mechanisms, sometimes with complex dynamics that reflect gene inactivation that occurs with hypermutation. The apparent ease with which hypermutators may switch to alternative resistance mechanisms for which antibiotics have not been developed may carry important clinical implications.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor differentially controls mossy cell activity across the dentate gyrus longitudinal axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the role of dentate gyrus (DG) mossy cells (MCs) in learning and memory has rapidly evolved due to increasingly precise methods for targeting MCs and for in vivo recording and activity manipulation in rodents. These studies have shown MCs are highly active in vivo, strongly remap to contextual manipulation, and that their inhibition or hyperactivation impairs pattern separation and location or context discrimination. Less well understood is how MC activity is modulated by neurohormonal mechanisms, which might differentially control the participation of MCs in cognitive functions during discrete states, such as hunger or satiety. In this study, we demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a neuropeptide produced in the gut and the brain that regulates food consumption and hippocampal-dependent mnemonic function, might regulate MC function through expression of its receptor, GLP-1R. RNA-seq demonstrated that most, though not all, <i>Glp1r</i> in hippocampal principal neurons is expressed in MCs, and in situ hybridization revealed strong expression of <i>Glp1r</i> in hilar neurons. <i>Glp1r-ires-Cre</i> mice crossed with Ai14D reporter mice followed by co-labeling for the MC marker GluR2/3 revealed that almost all MCs in the ventral DG expressed <i>Glp1r</i> and that almost all <i>Glp1r</i>-expressing hilar neurons were MCs. However, only ~60% of dorsal DG MCs expressed <i>Glp1r</i>, and <i>Glp1r</i> was also expressed in small hilar neurons that were not MCs. Consistent with this expression pattern, peripheral administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (5 μg/kg) increased cFos expression in ventral but not dorsal DG hilar neurons. Finally, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ventral MCs showed that bath application of exendin-4 (200 nM) depolarized MCs and increased action potential firing. Taken together, this study adds to known MC activity modulators a neurohormonal mechanism that may preferentially affect ventral DG physiology and may potentially be targetable by several GLP-1R pharmacotherapies already in clinical use.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal responses to electrical stimulation of the major input pathways are modulated by dentate spikes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dentate gyrus (DG) is important for pattern separation and spatial memory, and it is thought to gate information flow to the downstream hippocampal subregions. Dentate spikes (DSs) are high-amplitude, fast, positive local-field potential events taking place in the DG during immobility and sleep, and they have been connected to memory consolidation in rodents. DSs are a result of signaling from the entorhinal cortex (EC) to the DG, and they suppress firing of pyramidal cells in the CA3 and CA1. To study the effects of DSs to signaling in the hippocampal tri-synaptic loop, we electrically stimulated the afferent fibers of the DG, CA3, and CA1 in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats at different delays from DSs. Responses to stimulation were increased in the EC-DG synapse during DSs, and the effect was amplified after theta-burst stimulation. We concluded that DSs strengthen the excitatory signal from the EC to the DG, which is reinforced by synapse potentiation and increased excitability of granule cells after theta-burst stimulation. This signal boosting may function in enhancing plastic changes in the DG-CA3 synapse. As responses in the CA3 and CA1 remained unaffected by the DS, the DS-contingent silencing of pyramidal cells seems to be a result of a decrease in excitatory input rather than a decrease in the excitability of the pyramidal cells themselves. In addition, we found that the DSs occur asynchronously in the left and right hippocampi, giving novel evidence of lateralization of the rodent hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Obese male Zucker rats exhibit dendritic remodeling in neurons of the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit as well as spatial memory deficits</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obesity is characterized by excessive fat accumulation. The Zucker rat displays genetic obesity due to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene; this model is of great interest because of its similarity to human obesity. Brain regions may be affected by obesity, but detailed information is lacking. In the present study, we analyzed the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit as well as the spatial memory of obese Zucker rats. We performed two experiments. Each experiment contained two experimental groups: the control group (male Long Evans rats) and the study group (obese male Zucker rats). We monitored the body weights of all rats over 4 weeks. In the first experiment, we analyzed the morphology of hippocampal neurons. Under anesthesia, we measured the abdominal and hip circumferences and collected at least 1 ml of blood to assess serum glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TGC), and cholesterol (COL) concentrations. We perfused the brains of these rats with 0.9% saline solution, incubated the brains in Golgi-Cox solution, and subsequently evaluated the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (the CA1-CA3 regions) and the entorhinal cortex as well as the morphology of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. In the second experiment, we assessed the spatial memory of animals with the Morris water maze. The Zucker rats had an obese phenotype, as indicated by their elevated body weight and increased abdominal and hip circumferences as well as elevated GLU, COL, and TGC concentrations. Analysis of neurons from the specified regions in obese male Zucker rats indicated reduced dendritic arborization and reduced dendritic spine density. In terms of spatial learning and memory, the obese Zucker rats exhibited intact spatial learning (i.e., of platform location) but deficits in spatial memory. These data provide evidence that obesity alters the morphology and function of hippocampal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal neurogenesis promotes effortful responding but does not regulate effort‐based choice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A fundamental trait of depression is low motivation. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been associated with motivational deficits but detailed evidence on how it regulates human-relevant behavioral traits is still missing. We used the hGFAP-TK rat model to deplete actively dividing neural stem cells in the rat hippocampus. Use of the effort-discounting operant task allowed us to identify specific and detailed deficits in motivation behavior. In this task, rats are given a choice between small and large food rewards, where 2–20 lever presses are required to obtain the large reward (four sugar pellets) versus one press to receive the smaller reward (two sugar pellets). We found that depleting adult neurogenesis did not affect effort-based choice or general motivation to complete the task. However, lack of adult neurogenesis reduced the pressing rate and thus increased time to complete the required presses to obtain a reward. In summary, the present study finds that adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically reduces response vigor to obtain rewards and thus deepens our understanding in how neurogenesis shapes depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal cellular functional organization for fear memory: Effects of sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is vital to our daily existence. Although a large number of studies have suggested that the hippocampus is dedicated to long-term memory, understanding how memory is anatomically encoded within the hippocampal neuronal network is still lacking. Previously our laboratory showed that hippocampal pyramidal cells are organized in cell clusters to encode both spatial and episodic memory. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that “cluster-type” is a functional organization principal in the hippocampus to encode all types of memory. Here, we tested whether contextual fear, another hippocampus-dependent memory, is also organized in cell clusters. We further investigated the possibility that post-learning sleep may affect functional organization. Cluster formation was examined by assessing the topographic localization of active cells using immediate early gene (IEG, Zif268) imaging methods. The first experiment provides evidence of a cluster-type organization in the hippocampus for fear memory by showing a spatial distribution of adjacent Zif268 positive cells. Exposure to the context itself, without electric shocks, induced a similar cellular formation; however, the degree of clustering was significantly lower. The second experiment provides evidence that sleep plays a role in the refinement and long-term stability of the clusters. The present results confirm the existence of a cluster-type topographic functional neuronal organization in the hippocampus for memory, and further suggest that post-learning sleep enhances the cluster-type organization.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Where is the error? Hierarchical predictive coding through dendritic error computation</a></h4>

              
                Top-down feedback in cortex is critical for guiding sensory processing, which has prominently been formalized in the theory of hierarchical predictive coding (hPC). However, experimental evidence for error units, which are central to the theory, is inconclusive and it remains unclear how hPC can be implemented with spiking neurons. To address this, we connect hPC to existing work on efficient coding in balanced networks with lateral inhibition and predictive computation at apical dendrites. Together, this work points to an efficient implementation of hPC with spiking neurons, where prediction errors are computed not in separate units, but locally in dendritic compartments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hedgehog regulation of epithelial cell state and morphogenesis in the larynx</a></h4>

              
                The larynx enables speech while regulating swallowing and respiration. Larynx function hinges on the laryngeal epithelium which originates as part of the anterior foregut and undergoes extensive remodeling to separate from the esophagus and form vocal folds that interface with the adjacent trachea. Here we find that Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is essential for epithelial integrity in the mouse larynx as well as the anterior foregut. During larynx-esophageal separation, low <i>Shh</i> expression marks specific domains of actively remodeling epithelium that undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by the induction of N-Cadherin and movement of cells out of the epithelial layer. Consistent with a role for SHH signaling in regulating this process, <i>Shh</i> mutants undergo an abnormal EMT throughout the anterior foregut and larynx, marked by a cadherin switch, movement out of the epithelial layer and cell death. Unexpectedly, <i>Shh</i> mutant epithelial cells are replaced by a new population of FOXA2-negative cells that likely derive from adjacent pouch tissues and form a rudimentary epithelium. These findings have important implications for interpreting the etiology of HH-dependent birth defects within the foregut. We propose that SHH signaling has a default role in maintaining epithelial identity throughout the anterior foregut and that regionalized reductions in SHH trigger epithelial remodeling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sugar sensation and mechanosensation in the egg-laying preference shift of Drosophila suzukii</a></h4>

              
                The agricultural pest <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> differs from most other <i>Drosophila</i> species in that it lays eggs in ripe, rather than overripe, fruit. Previously, we showed that changes in bitter taste sensation accompanied this adaptation (Dweck et al., 2021). Here, we show that <i>D. suzukii</i> has also undergone a variety of changes in sweet taste sensation. <i>D. suzukii</i> has a weaker preference than <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for laying eggs on substrates containing all three primary fruit sugars: sucrose, fructose, and glucose. Major subsets of <i>D. suzukii</i> taste sensilla have lost electrophysiological responses to sugars. Expression of several key sugar receptor genes is reduced in the taste organs of <i>D. suzukii</i>. By contrast, certain mechanosensory channel genes, including <i>no mechanoreceptor potential C</i>, are expressed at higher levels in the taste organs of <i>D. suzukii</i>, which has a higher preference for stiff substrates. Finally, we find that <i>D. suzukii</i> responds differently from <i>D. melanogaster</i> to combinations of sweet and mechanosensory cues. Thus, the two species differ in sweet sensation, mechanosensation, and their integration, which are all likely to contribute to the differences in their egg-laying preferences in nature.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Munc13 supports fusogenicity of non-docked vesicles at synapses with disrupted active zones</a></h4>

              
                Active zones consist of protein scaffolds that are tightly attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane. They dock and prime synaptic vesicles, couple them to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and direct neurotransmitter release towards postsynaptic receptor domains. Simultaneous RIM+ELKS ablation disrupts these scaffolds, abolishes vesicle docking and removes active zone-targeted Munc13, but some vesicles remain releasable. To assess whether this enduring vesicular fusogenicity is mediated by non-active zone-anchored Munc13 or is Munc13-independent, we ablated Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 in addition to RIM+ELKS in mouse hippocampal neurons. The hextuple knockout synapses lacked docked vesicles, but other ultrastructural features were near-normal despite the strong genetic manipulation. Removing Munc13 in addition to RIM+ELKS impaired action potential-evoked vesicle fusion more strongly than RIM+ELKS knockout by further decreasing the releasable vesicle pool. Hence, Munc13 can support some fusogenicity without RIM and ELKS, and presynaptic recruitment of Munc13, even without active zone-anchoring, suffices to generate some fusion-competent vesicles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Development of visual cortex in human neonates is selectively modified by postnatal experience</a></h4>

              
                Experience-dependent cortical plasticity is a pivotal process of human brain development and essential for the formation of most cognitive functions. Although studies found that early visual experience could influence the endogenous development of visual cortex in animals, little is known about such impact on human infants. Using the multimodal MRI data from the developing human connectome project, we characterized the early structural and functional maps in the ventral visual cortex and their development during neonatal period. Particularly, we found that postnatal time selectively modulated the cortical thickness in the ventral visual cortex and the functional circuit between bilateral primary visual cortices. But the cortical myelination and functional connections of the high-order visual cortex developed without significant influence of postnatal time in such an early period. The structure–function analysis further revealed that the postnatal time had a direct influence on the development of homotopic connection in area V1, while gestational time had an indirect effect on it through cortical myelination. These findings were further validated in preterm-born infants who had longer postnatal time but shorter gestational time at birth. In short, these data suggested in human newborns that early postnatal time shaped the structural and functional development of the visual cortex in selective and organized patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Discovery of a new class of reversible TEA-domain transcription factor inhibitors with a novel binding mode</a></h4>

              
                The TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factor forms a transcription co-activation complex with the key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, YAP/TAZ. TEAD-YAP controls the expression of Hippo-responsive genes involved in cell proliferation, development, and tumorigenesis. Hyperactivation of TEAD-YAP activities is observed in many human cancers, and is associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival and immune evasion. Therefore, targeting the TEAD-YAP complex has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach. We previously reported that the mammalian TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1-4) possess auto-palmitoylation activities and contain an evolutionarily conserved palmitate-binding pocket (PBP), which allows small molecule modulation. Since then, several reversible and irreversible inhibitors have been reported by binding to PBP. Here, we report a new class of TEAD inhibitors with a novel binding mode. Representative analog TM2 shows potent inhibition of TEAD auto-palmitoylation both <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. Surprisingly, the co-crystal structure of the human TEAD2 YAP-binding domain (YBD) in complex with TM2 reveals that TM2 adopts an unexpected binding mode by occupying not only the hydrophobic PBP, but also a new side binding pocket formed by hydrophilic residues. RNA-seq analysis shows that TM2 potently and specifically suppresses TEAD-YAP transcriptional activities. Consistently, TM2 exhibits strong anti-proliferation effects as a single agent or in combination with a MEK inhibitor in YAP-dependent cancer cells. These findings establish TM2 as a promising small molecule inhibitor against TEAD-YAP activities and provide new insights for designing novel TEAD inhibitors with enhanced selectivity and potency.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mettl3-mediated m6A modification of Fgf16 restricts cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide due to the inability of adult heart to regenerate after injury. <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3) plays an important role in various physiological and pathological bioprocesses. However, the role of m<sup>6</sup>A in heart regeneration remains largely unclear. To study m<sup>6</sup>A function in heart regeneration, we modulated Mettl3 expression in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of <i>Mettl3</i> significantly increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice. However, <i>Mettl3</i> overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice. Conjoint analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA-seq identified <i>Fgf16</i> as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification during postnatal heart regeneration. RIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Mettl3 negatively regulates <i>Fgf16</i> mRNA expression in an m<sup>6</sup>A-Ythdf2-dependent manner. The silencing of <i>Fgf16</i> suppressed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. However, the overexpression of ΔFgf16, in which the m<sup>6</sup>A consensus sequence was mutated, significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice compared with wild-type Fgf16. Our data demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces <i>Fgf16</i> mRNA levels through an m<sup>6</sup>A-Ythdf2-dependen pathway, thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A role for the centrosome in regulating the rate of neuronal efferocytosis by microglia in vivo</a></h4>

              
                During brain development, many newborn neurons undergo apoptosis and are engulfed by microglia, the tissue-resident phagocytes of the brain, in a process known as efferocytosis. A hallmark of microglia is their highly branched morphology characterized by the presence of numerous dynamic extensions that these cells use for scanning the brain parenchyma and engulfing unwanted material. The mechanisms driving branch formation and apoptotic cell engulfment in microglia are unclear. By taking a live-imaging approach in zebrafish, we show that while microglia generate multiple microtubule-based branches, they only successfully engulf one apoptotic neuron at a time. Further investigation into the mechanism underlying this sequential engulfment revealed that targeted migration of the centrosome into one branch is predictive of phagosome formation and polarized vesicular trafficking. Moreover, experimentally doubling centrosomal numbers in microglia increases the rate of engulfment and even allows microglia to remove two neurons simultaneously, providing direct supporting evidence for a model where centrosomal migration is a rate-limiting step in branch-mediated efferocytosis. Conversely, light-mediated depolymerization of microtubules causes microglia to lose their typical branched morphology and switch to an alternative mode of engulfment, characterized by directed migration towards target neurons, revealing unexpected plasticity in their phagocytic ability. Finally, building on work focusing on the establishment of the immunological synapse, we identified a conserved signalling pathway underlying centrosomal movement in engulfing microglia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FreiBox: A versatile open-source behavioral setup for investigating the neuronal correlates of behavioral flexibility via 1-photon imaging in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                To survive in a complex and changing environment, animals must adapt their behavior. This ability is called behavioral flexibility and is classically evaluated by a reversal learning paradigm. During such a paradigm, the animals adapt their behavior according to a change of the reward contingencies. To study these complex cognitive functions (from outcome evaluation to motor adaptation), we developed a versatile, low-cost, open-source platform, allowing us to investigate the neuronal correlates of behavioral flexibility with 1-photon calcium imaging. This platform consists of FreiBox, a novel low-cost Arduino behavioral setup, as well as further open-source tools which we developed and integrated into our framework. FreiBox is controlled by a custom Python interface and integrates a new licking sensor (Strain Gauge lickometer) for controlling spatial licking behavioral tasks. In addition to allowing both discriminative and serial reversal learning, the Arduino can track mouse licking behavior in real time to control task events in a sub-millisecond timescale. To complete our setup, we also developed and validated an affordable commutator, crucial for recording calcium imaging with the Miniscope V4 in freely moving mice. Further, we demonstrated that FreiBox can be associated with 1-photon imaging and other open-source initiatives (e.g., Open Ephys), to form a versatile platform for exploring the neuronal substrates of licking based behavioral flexibility in mice. The combination of the FreiBox behavioral setup and our low-cost commutator represents a highly competitive and complementary addition to the recently emerging battery of open-source initiatives.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hungry for compliments? Ghrelin is not associated with neural responses to social rewards or their pleasantness</a></h4>

              
                The stomach-derived hormone ghrelin motivates food search and stimulates food consumption, with highest plasma concentrations before a meal and lowest shortly after. However, ghrelin also appears to affect the value of non-food rewards such as interaction with rat conspecifics, and monetary rewards in humans. The present pre-registered study investigated how nutritional state and ghrelin concentrations are related to the subjective and neural responses to social and non-social rewards. In a cross-over feed-and-fast design, 67 healthy volunteers (20 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a hungry state and after a meal with repeated plasma ghrelin measurements. In task 1, participants received social rewards in the form of approving expert feedback, or non-social computer reward. In task 2, participants rated the pleasantness of compliments and neutral statements. Nutritional state and ghrelin concentrations did not affect the response to social reward in task 1. In contrast, ventromedial prefrontal cortical activation to non-social rewards was reduced when the meal strongly suppressed ghrelin. In task 2, fasting increased activation in the right ventral striatum during all statements, but ghrelin concentrations were neither associated with brain activation nor with experienced pleasantness. Complementary Bayesian analyses provided moderate evidence for a lack of correlation between ghrelin concentrations and behavioral and neural responses to social rewards, but moderate evidence for an association between ghrelin and non-social rewards. This suggests that ghrelin's influence may be restricted to non-social rewards. Social rewards implemented via social recognition and affirmation may be too abstract and complex to be susceptible to ghrelin's influence. In contrast, the non-social reward was associated with the expectation of a material object that was handed out after the experiment. This may indicate that ghrelin might be involved in anticipatory rather than consummatory phases of reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deducing ensemble dynamics and information flow from the whole-brain imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Recent development of large-scale activity imaging of neuronal ensembles provides opportunities for understanding how activity patterns are generated in the brain and how information is transmitted between neurons or neuronal ensembles. However, methodologies for extracting the component properties that generate overall dynamics are still limited. In this study, the results of time-lapse 3D imaging (4D imaging) of head neurons of the nematode C. elegans were analyzed by hitherto unemployed methodologies. By combining time-delay embedding with independent component analysis, the whole-brain activities were decomposed to a small number of component dynamics. Results from multiple samples, where different subsets of neurons were observed, were further combined by matrix factorization, revealing common dynamics from neuronal activities that are apparently divergent across sampled animals. By this analysis, we could identify components that show common relationships across different samples and those that show relationships distinct between individual samples. We also constructed a network model building on time-lagged prediction models of synaptic communications. This was achieved by dimension reduction of 4D imaging data using the general framework gKDR (gradient kernel dimension reduction). The model is able to decompose basal dynamics of the network. We further extended the model by incorporating probabilistic distribution, resulting in models that we call gKDR-GMM and gKDR-GP. The models capture the overall relationships of neural activities and reproduce the stochastic but coordinated dynamics in the neural network simulation. By virtual manipulation of individual neurons and synaptic contacts in this model, information flow could be estimated from whole-brain imaging results.

                The malaise symptoms of cybersickness are thought to be related to the sensory conflict present in the exposure to virtual reality (VR) content. When there is a sensory mismatch in the process of sensory perception, the perceptual estimate has been shown to change based on a reweighting mechanism between the relative contributions of the individual sensory signals involved. In this study, the reweighting of vestibular and body signals was assessed before and after exposure to different typical VR experiences and sickness severity was measured to investigate the relationship between susceptibility to cybersickness and sensory reweighting. Participants reported whether a visually presented line was rotated clockwise or counterclockwise from vertical while laying on their side in a subjective visual vertical (SVV) task. Task performance was recorded prior to VR exposure and after a low and high intensity VR game. The results show that the SVV was significantly shifted away from the body representation of upright and towards the vestibular signal after exposure to the high intensity VR game. Cybersickness measured using the fast motion sickness (FMS) scale found that sickness severity ratings were higher in the high intensity compared to the low intensity experience. The change in SVV from baseline after each VR exposure modelled using a simple 3-parameter gaussian regression fit was found to explain 49.5% of the variance in the FMS ratings. These results highlight the aftereffects of VR for sensory perception and suggests a potential relationship between the susceptibility to cybersickness and sensory reweighting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Geometry of population activity in spiking networks with low-rank structure</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent network models are instrumental in investigating how behaviorally-relevant computations emerge from collective neural dynamics. A recently developed class of models based on low-rank connectivity provides an analytically tractable framework for understanding of how connectivity structure determines the geometry of low-dimensional dynamics and the ensuing computations. Such models however lack some fundamental biological constraints, and in particular represent individual neurons in terms of abstract units that communicate through continuous firing rates rather than discrete action potentials. Here we examine how far the theoretical insights obtained from low-rank rate networks transfer to more biologically plausible networks of spiking neurons. Adding a low-rank structure on top of random excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, we systematically compare the geometry of activity in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons to rate networks with statistically equivalent low-rank connectivity. We show that the mean-field predictions of rate networks allow us to identify low-dimensional dynamics at constant population-average activity in spiking networks, as well as novel non-linear regimes of activity such as out-of-phase oscillations and slow manifolds. We finally exploit these results to directly build spiking networks that perform nonlinear computations.

                Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a key regulator of systemic phosphate homeostasis, but also an interplay with glucose metabolism has been suggested. Several studies implicate a function of FGF23 in the brain, and indeed we have recently identified FGF23 protein in several brain areas in rats, such as the hypothalamus, third ventricle and choroid plexus. In the current study, we aimed to determine the effect of an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of FGF23 in the third ventricle of rats on hypothalamic genes involved in glucose regulation. In addition, we assessed whether glycerol can be used safely for icv injections as glycerol is used as a stabilizing compound for FGF23 protein. Adult Wistar rats received an icv injection of recombinant rat FGF23 or vehicle. Dose dependent behavioral changes, suggestive of stress, were observed directly after infusion of FGF23. After 60 min animals were sacrificed and the arcuate nucleus, lateral hypothalamus and choroid plexus were isolated. In these brain regions gene expression was determined of the FGF23 receptor complex (FGFR1, alphaKlotho), NPY, POMC, phosphate transporters (SLC20 and SLC34 families) and markers of cellular ER stress (ATF4 and the ratio of spliced/unspliced XBP1). We showed that glycerol is well tolerated as stabilizer for icv injections. In FGF23-treated animals, cellular ER stress markers were increased in the arcuate nucleus. FGF23 injection did not affect expression of its receptor complex, NPY, POMC, or phosphate transporters. Future studies are warranted to investigate the effect of FGF23 in the brain on the protein level and on neuronal activation.

                A neuron's input-output function is commonly understood in terms of the fluctuation-driven and mean-driven regimes. Here we investigate how active dendrites falling in either regime shape the input-output function and find that dendritic input primarily controls interspike interval dispersion, a prediction that is validated with dual patch clamp recordings. This phenomenon can be understood by considering that neurons display not two, but three fundamental operating regimes, depending on whether dendritic spikes or the somatic input reach threshold.

                Microglial endolysosomal (dys)function is strongly implicated in neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic studies show that a microglial state characterised by a set of genes involved in endolysosomal function is induced in both mouse Alzheimer's Disease (AD) models and in human AD brain and that the onset of this state is emphasized in females. Cst7 (encoding protein Cystatin F) is among the most highly upregulated genes in these microglia. However, despite such striking and robust upregulation, the sex-specific function of Cst7 in neurodegenerative disease is not understood. Here, we crossed Cst7-/- mice with the AppNL-G-F mouse to test the role of Cst7 in a model of amyloid-driven AD. Surprisingly, we found that Cst7 plays a sexually dimorphic role regulating microglia in this model. In females, Cst7-deficient microglia had greater endolysosomal gene expression, lysosomal burden, and amyloid beta (A{beta}) burden in vivo and were more phagocytic in vitro. However, in males, Cst7-deficient microglia were less inflammatory and had a reduction in lysosomal burden but had no change in A{beta} burden. This study has important implications for AD research, confirming the functional role of a gene which is commonly upregulated in disease models, but also raising crucial questions on sexual dimorphism in neurodegenerative disease and the interplay between endolysosomal and inflammatory pathways in AD pathology.

                Phencyclidine (PCP) causes psychosis, is abused with increasing frequency, and was extensively used in antipsychotic drug discovery, but how this uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist impairs cognition remains unknown. Using rats and mice, we report that, consistent with ionotropic actions, PCP discoordinated hippocampus CA1 action potential discharge and impaired a well-learned hippocampus-dependent active place avoidance that requires cognitive control. However, consistent with metabotropic actions, PCP exaggerated protein-synthesis dependent DHPG-induced mGluR-LTD. Pretreatment with anisomycin or the group I mGluR antagonist MPEP, both of which repress translation, prevented the discoordination and PCP-induced cognitive and sensorimotor impairments. Both PCP and the NR2A-containing NMDA-receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 unbalanced translation that engages the AKT, mTOR and 4EBP1 translation machinery and increased protein synthesis, whereas the NR2B-containing antagonist Ro25-6981 did not. We conclude that PCP dysregulates translation acting through NR2A receptor subtypes recruiting group 1 mGluR signaling pathways, leading to the neural discoordination that is central to the cognitive and sensorimotor impairments.

                Radial glial cells (RGCs) are essential for the generation and organization of neurons in the cerebral cortex. RGCs have an elongated bipolar morphology with basal and apical endfeet which reside in distinct niches. Yet, how this subcellular compartmentalization of RGCs controls cortical development is largely unknown. Here, we employ in vivo proximity labeling using unfused BirA to generate the first subcellular proteome of RGCs and uncover new principles governing local control of cortical development. We discover a cohort of proteins that are significantly enriched in RGC basal endfeet, with MYH9 and MYH10 among the most abundant. Myh9 and Myh10 transcripts also localize to endfeet with distinct temporal dynamics. Although they each encode isoforms of nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain, Myh9 and Myh10 have drastically different requirements for RGC integrity. Myh9 loss from RGCs decreases branching complexity and causes endfoot protrusion through the basement membrane. In contrast, Myh10 controls endfoot adhesion, as mutants have unattached apical and basal endfeet. Finally, we show that Myh9- and Myh10-mediated regulation of RGC complexity and endfoot position non-cell autonomously controls interneuron number and organization in the marginal zone. Our study demonstrates the utility of in vivo proximity labeling for dissecting local control of complex systems, and reveals new mechanisms for dictating RGC integrity and cortical architecture.

                Background It is well-established that individuals with autism show atypical functional brain connectivity. However, the role this plays in behavior, especially in naturalistic social settings, has remained unclear. Some atypical patterns may reflect core deficits, while others may instead compensate for deficits and promote adaptive behavior. Distinguishing these possibilities requires measuring the 'typicality' of spontaneous behaviour and determining which connectivity patterns correlate with it. Methods Thirty-nine male participants (19 autism, 20 typically-developed) engaged in 115 spontaneous conversations with an experimenter during fMRI scanning (Jasmin, et al., 2019, Brain). A classifier algorithm was trained to distinguish participants by diagnosis based on 81 semantic, affective and linguistic dimensions derived from their use of language. The algorithm's certainty that a participant was in either the autism or typical group was used as a measure of task performance and compared with functional connectivity levels. Results The algorithm accurately classified participants (74%, P = .002), and its scores correlated with clinician-observed autism signs (ADOS) (rs = .51, P = .03). In support of a compensatory role, greater functional connectivity, most prominently between left-hemisphere social communication regions and right inferior frontal cortex, correlated with more typical language behaviour, only for the autism group (rs = .56, P = .01). Conclusion We report a simple and highly generalizable method for quantifying behavioral performance and neural compensation during complex spontaneous social behavior, without the need for an a priori benchmark. The findings suggest that functional connectivity increases in autism during communication reflect a neural compensation strategy.

                Parkinsons Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting 1-2% of the global population with no cure to date. PD is characterized by accumulation of Lewy Bodies (LBs), which are caused due to aggregation of incorrectly folded alpha-Synuclein, (SNCA). Another form of PD manifestation is characterized by loss of function of parkin, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Despite extensive research, the cause for onset and progression of PD remains unknown and current therapeutics mainly help manage the disease. An alternative line of treatment can be useful. In this study, we have employed two different genetic models of Drosophila to screen for Ayurvedic compounds and found an Ayurvedic mercury based organo-metallic drug Ras-Sindoor has neuroprotective function. Our data indicate that characteristic locomotory dysfunction phenotype of PD is restored upon administration of the compound. Interestingly, RS fed flies also exhibit reduced transcript levels of initiator caspase dronc, which possibly prevents cell death in dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, RS fed PD model flies exhibit an enhanced life span. Our studies emphasize beneficial use of traditional Ayurvedic compounds as a holistic cure for PD like multifactorial diseases.

                In processing a stream of visual information, visual perception is improved by temporal expectation, the timing predictability of sensory events, and by voluntary temporal attention, the prioritization of sensory events at behaviorally relevant time points. Although temporal expectation and attention are often treated as a single process, they can be dissociated and may be supported by distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we manipulated temporal attention while holding expectation constant and used concurrent MEG to disentangle their effects on visual cortical dynamics. Human observers attended to one of two sequentially presented visual targets embedded in flickering noise on each trial. Using the intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) of visually responsive channels as a measure of cortical response reliability, we found two neural signatures of temporal expectation and attention in visual cortical responses. First, a ramping increase in ITPC anticipated the temporally expected onset of visual targets whether attended or not, with the slope of the ramp modulated by temporal attention. Second, the transient evoked ITPC response to the first visual target was larger when that target was temporally attended. These data reveal distinct and complementary impacts of temporal attention and expectation on visual cortical responses across time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A single-cell trajectory atlas of striatal development</a></h4>

              
                The striatum integrates dense neuromodulatory inputs from many brain regions to coordinate complex behaviors. This integration relies on the coordinated responses from distinct striatal cell types. While previous studies have characterized the cellular and molecular composition of the striatum using single-cell RNA-sequencing at distinct developmental timepoints, the molecular changes spanning embryonic through postnatal development at the single-cell level have not been examined. Here, we combine published mouse striatal single-cell datasets from both embryonic and postnatal timepoints to analyze the developmental trajectory patterns and transcription factor regulatory networks within striatal cell types. Using this integrated dataset, we found that dopamine receptor-1 expressing spiny projection neurons have an extended period of postnatal development with greater transcriptional complexity compared to dopamine receptor-2 expressing neurons. Moreover, we found the transcription factor, FOXP1, exerts indirect changes to oligodendrocytes. These data can be accessed and further analyzed through an interactive website (https://cells-test.gi.ucsc.edu/?ds=mouse-striatal-dev).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quadratic computations maintain neural specificity to natural stimuli across stages of visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent successes in machine vision, artificial recognition systems continue to be less robust than biological systems. The brittleness of artificial recognition system has been attributed to the linearity of the core operation that matches inputs to target patterns at each stage of the system. Here we analyze responses of neurons from the visual areas V1, V2, and V4 of the brain using the framework that incorporates quadratic computations into multi-stage models. These quadratic computations make it possible to capture local recurrent computation, and in particular, nonlinear suppressive interactions between visual features. We find that incorporating quadratic computation not only strongly improved predictive power of the resulting model, but also revealed several computation motifs that increased the selectivity of neural responses to natural stimuli. These motifs included the organization of excitatory and suppressive features along mutually exclusive hypotheses about incoming stimuli, such as orthogonal orientations or opposing motion directions. The balance between excitatory and suppressive features was largely maintained across brain regions. These results emphasize the importance and properties of quadratic computations that are necessary for achieving robust object recognition.

                Theoretical studies have long proposed that adaptation allows the brain to effectively use the limited response range of sensory neurons to encode widely varying natural inputs. However, despite this influential view, experimental studies have exclusively focused on how the neural code adapts to a range of stimuli lying along a single feature axis, such as orientation or contrast. Here, we performed electrical recordings in macaque visual cortex (area V4) to reveal significant adaptive changes in the neural code of single cells and populations across multiple feature axes. Both during free viewing and passive fixation, populations of cells improved their ability to encode image features after rapid exposure to stimuli lying on orthogonal feature axes even in the absence of initial tuning to these stimuli. These results reveal a remarkable adaptive capacity of visual cortical populations to improve network computations relevant for natural viewing despite the modularity of the functional cortical architecture.

                Experiments in flies, mice and humans suggest a significant role of impaired axonal transport in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown1,2. We report that the Swedish familial AD (FAD) mutation perturbs fast anterograde axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by altering directionality of its movement. APP thus spends more time in retrograde movement and accumulates in the soma. We found that the Swedish mutation enhances recruitment of dynactin 1 to the APP transport assemblies. Given that dynactin 1 activates the retrograde motor dynein3, this hampers physiological anterograde axonal transport of APP. We last show that the Swedish mutation perturbs also the axonal transport of early endosomes, which rely on the same molecular motors as APP. Our findings reveal extensive impairment of the axonal transport pathways by a FAD mutation, which reflects dysregulation of the cargo motor assemblies.

                The recognition of objects is strongly facilitated when they are presented in the context of other objects (Biederman, 1972). Such contexts facilitate perception and induce expectations of context-congruent objects (Trapp & Bar, 2015). The neural mechanisms underlying these facilitatory effects of context on object processing, however, are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we investigate how context-induced expectations affect subsequent object processing. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and measured repetition suppression, a proxy for prediction error processing, for pairs of alternating or repeated object images, preceded by context-congruent, context-incongruent or neutral cues. We found a stronger repetition suppression in congruent as compared to incongruent or neutral cues in the object sensitive lateral occipital cortex. Interestingly, this effect was driven by enhanced responses to alternating stimulus pairs in the congruent contexts. In addition, in the congruency condition, we discovered significant functional connectivity between object-responsive and frontal cortical regions, as well as between object-responsive regions and the fusiform gyrus. Our findings unravel the neural mechanisms underlying context facilitation.

                Here we report SUPPORT (Statistically Unbiased Prediction utilizing sPatiOtempoRal information in imaging daTa), a self-supervised learning method for removing Poisson-Gaussian noise in voltage imaging data. SUPPORT is based on the insight that a pixel value in voltage imaging data is highly dependent on its spatially neighboring pixels in the same time frame, even when its temporally adjacent frames do not provide useful information for statistical prediction. Such spatiotemporal dependency is captured and utilized to accurately denoise voltage imaging data in which the existence of the action potential in a time frame cannot be inferred by the information in other frames. Through simulation and experiments, we show that SUPPORT enables precise denoising of voltage imaging data while preserving the underlying dynamics in the scene.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measuring the non-selective effects of motor inhibition using isometric force recordings</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition is a key cognitive control mechanism. When rapidly exerted, inhibitory control has broad, non-selective motor effects, typically demonstrated using cortico-spinal excitability measurements (CSE) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For example, during rapid action-stopping, CSE is suppressed at both stopped and task-unrelated muscles. While such TMS-based CSE measurements provide crucial insights into the fronto-basal ganglia circuitry underlying non-selective inhibition, they have several downsides. TMS is contraindicated in many populations (e.g., epilepsy, deep-brain stimulation patients), has limited temporal resolution, produces distracting auditory and haptic stimulation, is difficult to combine with other imaging methods, and necessitates expensive, immobile equipment. Here, we attempted to measure the non-selective motor effects of inhibitory control using a method unaffected by these shortcomings. 30 participants exerted isometric force on a hand-held force transducer while performing a foot-response stop-signal task. Indeed, when foot movements were stopped, force output at the task-irrelevant hand was suppressed as well. Moreover, this non-selective reduction of isometric force was highly correlated with stop-signal performance and showed frequency dynamics similar to established inhibitory signatures typically found in neural and muscle recordings. Together, we demonstrate that isometric force recordings capture the non-selective effects of motor inhibition, enabling many applications that are impossible with TMS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural remodeling of peripheral taste neurons is fast and independent of taste cell turnover</a></h4>

              
                Taste bud cells are constantly replaced in taste buds as old cells die and new cells migrate into the bud. The perception of taste relies on new taste bud cells integrating with existing neural circuitry, yet how these new cells connect with a taste neuron is unknown. Do taste neurons remodel to accommodate taste bud cell renewal? If so, how much of the taste axon structure is fixed and how much remodels? We measured the motility and branching of individual taste arbors (the portion of the axon innervating taste buds) over time with two-photon in vivo microscopy. Terminal branches of taste arbors continuously and rapidly remodel within the taste bud. This remodeling is faster than predicted by taste bud cell renewal, with terminal branches added and lost concurrently. Surprisingly, ablating new taste cells with chemotherapeutic agents revealed that remodeling of the terminal branches of taste arbors does not rely of the renewal of taste bud cells. Although the arbor structure remodeling was fast and intrinsically controlled, no new arbors were added, and few were lost over 100 days. Taste neurons maintain a stable number of nerve arbors that are each capable of high-speed remodeling. Arbor structural plasticity would permit arbors to locate new taste bud cells, while stability of arbor number could support constancy in the degree of connectivity and function for each neuron over time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amyloid-beta peptides 40 and 42 employ distinct molecular pathways for cell entry and intracellular transit at the BBB endothelium</a></h4>

              
                Blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical portal regulating the bidirectional transport of amyloid beta (A{beta}) proteins between blood and brain. Disrupted trafficking at the BBB may not only promote the build-up of A{beta} plaques in the brain parenchyma, but also facilitate A{beta} accumulation within the BBB endothelium, which aggravates BBB dysfunction. Soluble A{beta}42:A{beta}40 ratios in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid have been reported to decrease during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Our previous publications demonstrated that trafficking of A{beta}42 and A{beta}40 at the BBB is distinct and is disrupted under various pathophysiological conditions. However, the intracellular mechanisms that allow BBB endothelium to differentially handle A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we identified mechanisms of fluorescently labeled A{beta} (F-A{beta}) endocytosis in polarized human cerebral microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cell monolayers using pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knock-down approaches. Further, intracellular transit of F-A{beta} following endocytosis was tracked using live cell imaging. Our studies demonstrated that both F-A{beta} peptides were internalized by BBB endothelial cells via energy, dynamin and actin dependent endocytosis. Interestingly, endocytosis of F-A{beta}40 is found to be clathrin-mediated, whereas F-A{beta}42 endocytosis is caveolae-mediated. Following endocytosis, both isoforms were sorted by the endo-lysosomal system. While A{beta}42 was shown to accumulate more in the lysosome which could lead to its higher degradation and/or aggregation at lower lysosomal pH, A{beta}40 demonstrated robust accumulation in recycling endosomes which may facilitate its transcytosis across the BBB. These results provide a mechanistic insight into the selective ability of BBB endothelium to transport A{beta}40 versus A{beta}42. This knowledge contributes to the understanding of molecular pathways underlying A{beta} accumulation in the BBB endothelium and associated cerebrovascular dysfunction as well as amyloid deposition in the brain parenchyma which are implicated in AD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural noise is associated with age-related neural dedifferentiation</a></h4>

              
                Age-related neural dedifferentiation - reductions in the selectivity and precision of neural representations - contributes to cognitive aging and is thought to result from age increases in neural noise. This research has primarily used fMRI to examine age-related reductions in neural selectivity for different categories of visual stimuli. The present experiment used EEG to examine the link between neural noise and age-related neural dedifferentiation indexed by the scene-selective (P200) and face-selective (N170) ERP components. Young and older adults viewed images of scenes, objects, and faces during a 1-back task. Whereas both the P200 and N170 showed age-related slowing of peak latency, only the P200 showed age-related reductions in amplitude that were independent of visual and contrast acuity. We also examined the relationship between the ERP peak measures and an index of neural noise, namely the 1/f exponent of the frequency power spectrum. For the P200 amplitude, higher levels of neural noise were associated with smaller P200 amplitudes in young, but not older adults. In contrast, there was an age-invariant relationship between neural noise and N170 amplitude in the left hemisphere with higher levels of neural noise being associated reduced N170 amplitudes. While the present findings provide novel empirical evidence broadly consistent with predictions from computational models of neural dedifferentiation, the results also highlight potential limitations of the computational model that necessitate revision. The results also suggest that, at least for the P200, maintaining levels of neural noise similar to young adults might preserve levels of neural selectivity.

                Excitatory projections from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) to the lateral habenula (LHb) drive aversive responses. We used Patch-seq guided multimodal classification to define the structural and functional heterogeneity of the LHA- LHb pathway. Our classification identified six glutamatergic neuron types with unique electrophysiological properties, molecular profiles, and projection patterns. We found that genetically-defined LHA-LHb neurons signal distinct aspects of emotional or naturalistic behaviors: Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons induce aversion, whereas Npy+ LHA-LHb neurons control rearing behavior. Repeated optogenetic drive of Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons induces a behaviorally persistent aversive state, and large-scale recordings showed a region-specific neural representation of the aversive state in the prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex. We further found that exposure to unpredictable mild shocks induced a sex- specific sensitivity to develop a stress state in female mice, which was associated with a specific shift in the intrinsic properties of bursting-type Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons. In summary, we describe the diversity of LHA-LHb neuron types, and provide evidence for the role of Esr1+ neurons in aversion and sexually dimorphic stress sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network plasticity in the honey bee antennal lobe during odor presentation</a></h4>

              
                Odorant processing presents multiple parallels across animal species, and insects became relevant models for the study of olfactory coding because of the tractability of the underlying neural circuits. Within the insect brain, odorants are received by olfactory sensory neurons and processed by the antennal lobe network. Such a network comprises multiple nodes, named glomeruli, that receive sensory information and are interconnected by local interneurons participating in shaping the neural representation of an odorant. The study of functional connectivity between the nodes of a sensory network in vivo is a challenging task that requires simultaneous recording from multiple nodes at high temporal resolutions. Here, we used fast two-photon microscopy to follow the calcium dynamics of antennal lobe glomeruli and applied Granger causality analysis to assess the functional directed connectivity among network nodes during and after olfactory stimulation. Our findings show that there is a significant causal coupling between network nodes also in the absence of olfactory stimulation. However, connectivity patterns change upon odorant arrival, showing an increase in connection density and conveying odorant-specific information. Furthermore, we show that causal functional connectivity is unique in individual subjects, and cannot be detected upon artificial glomerular scrambling across individuals. This demonstrates that network states do not consist solely of correlations of mean glomerular responses, which are known to be conserved across bees.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep deprivation measured by voice analysis</a></h4>

              
                Using our voice represent an exquisitely intricate act, recruiting a host of cognitive and motor functions. As such, the voice is bound to reflect many aspects of the internal state of the speaker: personality, infections, stress, emotions. Here, we investigate whether sleep deprivation in otherwise normal and healthy persons can be detected through machine-learning analysis of vocal recordings. In contrast to previous approaches, we use fully generic acoustic features, derived from auditory-inspired models of sound processing, together with recently-developed machine learning interpretation techniques. Our results show that sleep deprivation can be accurately detected from generic acoustic features of vocal recordings. Two main different types of features were impacted by sleep deprivation: one related to speech rhythms, the other related to the timbre of the voice. We speculate that these features reflect two distinct physiological processes: the cognitive control of speech production and an inflammatory effect of the vocal apparatus. Crucially, the relative balance of these two effects varied widely for each individual, suggesting that the voice may be used as a "sleep stethoscope" to better understand the variety of idiosyncratic responses to sleep deprivation. Moreover, the method we outline is fully general and could be applied to the future investigation of any type of vocal biomarkers using machine-learning techniques.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Callosal inputs generate side-invariant receptive fields in the barrel cortex</a></h4>

              
                Barrel cortex integrates contra- and ipsilateral whiskers' inputs. While contralateral inputs depend on the thalamocortical innervation, ipsilateral ones are thought to rely on callosal axons. These are more abundant in the barrel cortex region bordering with S2 and containing the row A-whiskers representation, the row lying nearest to the facial midline. Here we ask what role this callosal axonal arrangement plays in ipsilateral tactile signalling. We found that novel object exploration with ipsilateral whiskers confines c-Fos expression within the highly callosal subregion. Targeting this area with in vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed neurons with uniquely strong ipsilateral responses dependent on the corpus callosum, as assessed by tetrodotoxin silencing and by optogenetic activation of the contralateral hemisphere. Still, in this area, stimulation of contra- or ipsilateral row A-whiskers evoked an indistinguishable response in some neurons, mostly located in layers 5/6, indicating their involvement in the midline representation of the whiskers' sensory space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatially-embedded recurrent neural networks reveal widespread links between structural and functional neuroscience findings</a></h4>

              
                Brain networks exist within the confines of resource limitations. As a result, a brain network must overcome metabolic costs of growing and sustaining the network within its physical space, while simultaneously implementing its required information processing. To observe the effect of these processes, we introduce the spatially-embedded recurrent neural network (seRNN). seRNNs learn basic task-related inferences while existing within a 3D Euclidean space, where the communication of constituent neurons is constrained by a sparse connectome. We find that seRNNs, similar to primate cerebral cortices, naturally converge on solving inferences using modular small-world networks, in which functionally similar units spatially configure themselves to utilize an energetically-efficient mixed-selective code. As all these features emerge in unison, seRNNs reveal how many common structural and functional brain motifs are strongly intertwined and can be attributed to basic biological optimization processes. seRNNs can serve as model systems to bridge between structural and functional research communities to move neuroscientific understanding forward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypothalamic vasopressin sex differentiation is established during embryonic neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a conserved sexually dimorphic system regulating behaviors and physiologies. Decades of research concludes that AVP sex differentiation in mice occurs around birth when a gonadal surge of testosterone is converted to estrogen in male sexual dimorphic brain regions. We discovered that AVP neurons in the murine hypothalamus are sexually dimorphic much earlier than this surge, with male mice displaying more AVP neurons than females during neurogenesis at E11. In utero exposure to a pan-ER antagonist blocked AVP masculinization in males, whereas embryonic exogenous 17beta-estradiol or xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA) masculinized female AVP neurons, causing permanent masculinization effects on adult female AVP cell numbers, projections and intrinsic neuronal properties. Our data reveal that sexual dimorphism of hypothalamic AVP neurons is present from the earliest stages of their differentiation and challenges current dogma that masculinization of the male brain occurs around birth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A deep residual model for characterization of 5D spatiotemporal network dynamics reveals widespread spatiodynamic changes in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder with serious symptoms including delusions, disorganized speech, and hallucinations that can have a long-term detrimental impact on different aspects of a patient's life. It is still unclear what the main cause of schizophrenia is, but a combination of altered brain connectivity and structure may play a role. Neuroimaging data has been useful in characterizing schizophrenia, but there has been very little work focused on voxel-wise changes in multiple brain networks over time, despite evidence that functional networks exhibit complex spatiotemporal changes over time within individual subjects. Recent studies have primarily focused on static (average) features of functional data or on temporal variations between fixed networks; however, such approaches are not able to capture multiple overlapping networks which change at the voxel level. In this work, we employ a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) model to extract 53 different spatiotemporal networks each of which captures dynamism within various domains including subcortical, cerebellar, visual, sensori-motor, auditory, cognitive control, and default mode. We apply this approach to study spatiotemporal brain dynamism at the voxel level within multiple functional networks extracted from a large functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset of individuals with schizophrenia (N=708) and controls (N=510). Our analysis reveals widespread group level differences across multiple networks and spatiotemporal features including voxel-wise variability, magnitude, and temporal functional network connectivity in widespread regions expected to be impacted by the disorder. We compare with typical average spatial amplitude and show highly structured and neuroanatomically relevant results are missed if one does not consider the voxel-wise spatial dynamics. Importantly, our approach can summarize static, temporal dynamic, spatial dynamic, and spatiotemporal dynamics features, thus proving a powerful approach to unify and compare these various perspectives. In sum, we show the proposed approach highlights the importance of accounting for both temporal and spatial dynamism in whole brain neuroimaging data generally, shows a high-level of sensitivity to schizophrenia highlighting global but spatially unique dynamics showing group differences, and may be especially important in studies focused on the development of brain-based biomarkers.

	<p>The potential for the misdiagnosis of giftedness as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been well documented, as has the clinical diagnostic profile of individuals with both giftedness and ADHD. This study aimed to examine parents&amp;amp;rsquo; and teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; responses to the Conners 3 behavioral rating scale of gifted students with ADHD compared to gifted students without ADHD and non-gifted students with ADHD. Ninety-two children aged 6 to 12 years were included in the study. On the basis of clinical assessments utilizing the K-SADS, the WISC-V, and other neurocognitive tests, the students were split into three groups: gifted/ADHD (n = 35), ADHD (n = 35), and gifted (n = 22). The results revealed that mothers&amp;amp;rsquo;, fathers&amp;amp;rsquo;, and teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; responses to the Conners 3 rating scale distinguished well between the gifted group and the other two groups, but not between the gifted/ADHD and ADHD groups. The learning difficulties observed by teachers was the most significant element that distinguished gifted/ADHD students from non-gifted ADHD students. Other results indicated that mothers and fathers reported more inattention problems in their gifted/ADHD children than teachers. Additionally, mothers tended to observe more learning and executive function problems in their gifted/ADHD children than teachers did. These findings highlight the importance of multiple informants complementing each other in the assessment process for ADHD in a gifted context to counteract the masking effect between giftedness and ADHD.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep is considered an essential component related to physiological and psychological recovery in athletes and particularly in basketball, given the impact of condensed travel and game schedules on player health and performance. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to examine studies published to date on sleep and basketball performance. Methodology: All scientific articles that reported a relationship between sleep and its possible impact on performance in basketball are included. The research processes followed the PRISMA criteria, and the relevant articles were extracted (PubMed, WOS, Scopus) as of December 31, 2021. Results: Twenty-eight articles were selected for inclusion and data extraction, with 27 demonstrating that sleep is a vital component in the recovery of basketball players and their corresponding on-court performance. Three central themes that we identified: (1) the quality and extension of sleep (the better quality and more extension of sleep, better performance and lower probability of injury); (2) influence of the players circadian rhythm (travel and game scheduling do not currently facilitate or take this into account); and (3) higher training loads and/or increased stress may jeopardize a subsequent good night&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep, which should be taken into account when scheduling practices and workouts. Conclusion: The current systematic review regarding sleep and basketball performance and highlights that there is a strong relationship between both variables. Collectively, the evidence supports the critical influence of sleep on player recovery and basketball performance and risk for injury.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) on the primary motor cortex (M1) has been reported to be effective in fibromyalgia (FM). Our previous works have shown hypometabolism of motor networks in FM using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), which could contribute to pain symptoms. To investigate if a single Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) session can restore the reduced metabolism expected in FM patients, we compared metabolic activity in FM patients and controls during a finger-tapping task in basal condition, sham condition, and under anodal TDCS on M1. During the finger tapping task, a continuous wave 20 channel fNIRS system was placed across the bilateral central-frontal areas in 22 healthy controls and 54 FM patients. Subjects were randomly assigned to real TDCS or sham stimulation. The finger-tapping slowness did not change after real and sham stimulation. After real TDCS stimulation, FM patients showed an increased activation of cortical motor regions (t-statistic = &amp;amp;minus;2.5246, p-value = 0.0125 for the stimulated hemisphere and t-statistic = &amp;amp;minus;4.6638, p-value = 0.0001 for the non-stimulated hemisphere). The basal differences between FM and controls reverted after real TDCS, while this effect was not observed for sham stimulation. A single TDCS session of the cortical motor network seemed able to restore basic cortical hypometabolism in FM patients. Further studies could clarify the long-term effect of M1 stimulation on cortical metabolism, and its relevance in pain processing and clinical features.</p>

	<p>Children and youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) display difficulties recognizing and interacting with behavioral expressions of emotion, a deficit that makes social interaction problematic. Social skills training is foundational to the treatment of ASD, yet this intervention is costly, time-consuming, lacks objectivity, and is difficult to deliver in real-world settings. This pilot project investigated the use of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) headset to simulate real-world social interactions for children/youth with ASD. The primary objective was to describe gaze fixation and visual search behaviors during the simulated activity. Ten participants were enrolled and completed one social-skills training session in the IVR. The results demonstrate differential patterns between participants with mild, moderate, and severe ASD in the location and duration of gaze fixation as well as the patterns of visual searching. Although the results are preliminary, these differences may shed light on phenotypes within the continuum of ASD. Additionally, there may be value in quantifying gaze and visual search behaviors as an objective metric of interventional effectiveness for social-skills training therapy.</p>

	<p>Higher fasting glucose is thought to be associated with adverse outcome in patients receiving endovascular treatment (EVT), while the effect of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) on outcome is controversial. We combined fasting blood glucose (FBG) with HbA1c and evaluated their relationship with the three-month functional outcome in patients who underwent EVT. Methods: Data from 739 consecutive ischemic stroke patients who underwent EVT from April 2015 to August 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. HbA1c was used to estimate the chronic glucose level according to the following formula: chronic glucose level (mg/dL) = 28.7 &amp;amp;times; HbA1c (%) &amp;amp;minus; 6.7. Patients were split into two groups in accordance with the three-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to investigate the association of outcome with blood glucose and to identify other predictors of prognosis. Results: Patients with poor outcome had significantly higher FBG, chronic glycemia, FBG/chronic glycemic ratio, and difference between FBG and chronic glycemia (&amp;amp;Delta;A&amp;amp;ndash;C). FBG, the FBG/chronic glycemic ratio, and &amp;amp;Delta;A-C remained to be associated with poor outcome after adjustment. We then established a glycemia-based nomogram with a concordance index of 0.841, and it showed favorable clinical utility according to decision curve analysis. Conclusions: Glycemia after EVT was connected with the functional outcome and a nomogram based on glycemia may be used to predict prognosis in stroke patients treated with EVT.</p>

	<p>The perception of physical exertion is the cognitive sensation of work demands associated with voluntary muscular actions. Measurements of exerted force are crucial for avoiding the risk of overexertion and understanding human physical capability. For this purpose, various physiological measures have been used; however, the state-of-the-art in-force exertion evaluation lacks assessments of underlying neurophysiological signals. The current study applied a graph theoretical approach to investigate the topological changes in the functional brain network induced by predefined force exertion levels for twelve female participants during an isometric arm task and rated their perceived physical comfort levels. The functional connectivity under predefined force exertion levels was assessed using the coherence method for 84 anatomical brain regions of interest at the electroencephalogram (EEG) source level. Then, graph measures were calculated to quantify the network topology for two frequency bands. The results showed that high-level force exertions are associated with brain networks characterized by more significant clustering coefficients (6%), greater modularity (5%), higher global efficiency (9%), and less distance synchronization (25%) under alpha coherence. This study on the neurophysiological basis of physical exertions with various force levels suggests that brain regions communicate and cooperate higher when muscle force exertions increase to meet the demands of physically challenging tasks.</p>

	<p>Many contradictory theories regarding epileptogenesis in idiopathic generalized epilepsy have been proposed. This study aims to define the network that takes part in the formation of the spike-wave discharges in patients with generalized tonic&amp;amp;ndash;clonic seizures alone (GTCSa) and elucidate the network characteristics. Furthermore, we intend to define the most influential brain areas and clarify the connectivity pattern among them. The data were collected from 23 patients with GTCSa utilizing low-density electroencephalogram (EEG). The source localization of generalized spike-wave discharges (GSWDs) was conducted using the Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) methodology. Cortical connectivity was calculated utilizing the imaginary part of coherence. The network characteristics were investigated through small-world propensity and the integrated value of influence (IVI). Source localization analysis estimated that most sources of GSWDs were in the superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate. Graph theory analysis revealed that epileptic sources created a network that tended to be regularized during generalized spike-wave activity. The IVI analysis concluded that the most influential nodes were the left insular gyrus and the left inferior parietal gyrus at 3 and 4 Hz, respectively. In conclusion, some nodes acted mainly as generators of GSWDs and others as influential ones across the whole network.</p>

	<p>According to the shallow structure hypothesis (SSH), adult L2 learners rely more on lexical-semantic and pragmatic information but less so on syntactic information in online language processing, ending up with shallower syntactic representation. To test the SSH, we conducted an eye-tracking experiment on L1-Korean L2-Chinese learners with native Chinese speakers as the baseline, investigating their processing of Chinese base-generated-topic sentences (BGT). The results show that both the intermediate and advanced Korean learners of Chinese are sensitive to and can make use of syntactic information, but only the advanced learners are sensitive to the semantic constraint when processing Chinese BGT sentences, providing evidence against the SSH.</p>

	<p>Aims: This intervention study evaluates the effect of a virtual reality cognition training system (VRCTS) on improving cognitive function and clinical symptoms in Han Chinese patients with schizophrenia in the remission stage. Methods: Sixty-eight patients with schizophrenia in the remission stage were recruited for this study and were randomly allocated to either the virtual reality training (VRT) group or the treatment-as-usual (TAU) group. For the VRT group, patients received training with the VRCTS for two weeks and antipsychotic treatment as usual, while the TAU group only received antipsychotic treatment as usual. Cognitive function and clinical symptoms before and after the two-week treatment were assessed by the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery (MCCB), positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), and personal and social performance scale (PSP). Results: The results showed that (1) VRCTS could improve MCCB composite scores and scores on 2 out of 7 cognitive domains: visual learning as well as reasoning and problem solving. It was also observed that (2) VRCTS could alleviate general psychopathology symptoms of PANSS, but did not exert effects on positive and negative symptoms among patients with schizophrenia in the remission stage. Conclusions: A therapeutic effect of VRCTS was observed in patients with schizophrenia in the remission stage. This may improve cognitive function and general psychopathological symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of beliefs, knowledge, and attitude on herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in Indonesia [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicines are gaining a greater degree of popularity as complementary and alternative medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, there is a lack of data concerning the rationale for and factors influencing their use. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based online study involving 1,621 participants was conducted to explore the effects of magical health beliefs, holistic health beliefs, knowledge, and pro- complementary alternative medicine (CAM) attitudes on herbal medicine use in the Indonesian population. Results: Logistic regression findings showed that knowledge about herbal medicines was independently and positively associated with herbal medicine use to a greater extent than herbal medicine non-use (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval; CI = 1.16 to 1.24). The participants who used herbal medicines had a greater magical health belief score than herbal medicine non-users, with AOR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.06. Moreover, holistic health beliefs and pro-CAM attitudes were also found to be independently associated with herbal medicine use. Conclusion: Magical health beliefs, holistic health belief, knowledge, and attitudes are key factor in determining the herbal medicine use. Our findings offer crucial implications for health policymakers to encourage the use of herbal medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determining staffing needs for improving primary health care service delivery in Kaduna State, Nigeria [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The equitable distribution of a skilled health workforce is critical to health service delivery. Kaduna state has taken significant steps to revamp the primary health care system to ensure access to health care for its populace. However, these investments are yet to yield the desired outcomes due to health workforce shortages and the inequitable distribution of those available. Methods: A Workload Indicator for Staffing Need (WISN) study was conducted at Kaduna state's primary health care level. The study focused on estimating staffing requirements; Nurses/Midwives and Community Health Worker practitioners, Community Health Officers, Community Health Extension Workers, and Junior Community Health Extension Workers in all government-prioritised primary health care facilities. A total of ten focal primary health care facilities in Kaduna North Local Government Area (LGA) were included in the study. Results: Findings from the study revealed a shortage of Nurses/Midwives and Community Health Workers across the study facilities. For the Nurse/Midwife staffing category, nine of the ten PHCs have a WISN ratio < 1, indicating that the number of staff in the Nurse/Midwife category is insufficient to cope with the workload. In two of the ten primary health care facilities, there is an excess in the number of CHWs available; a WISN ratio > 1 was calculated. Conclusion: The WISN study highlights staffing needs in Kaduna State's government-prioritised primary health care facilities. This evidence establishes the basis for applying an evidence-based approach to determining staffing needs across the primary health care sector in the State to guide workforce planning strategies and future investments in the health sector. The World Health Organisation (WHO) WISN tool is useful for estimating staffing needs required to cope with workload pressures, particularly in a resource-constrained environment like Kaduna State.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Outward investment of Portuguese small and medium enterprises in the Central and Eastern European countries: motivations and challenges [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper identifies the determinant factors of Portuguese investment in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. We assume that investment abroad is motivated by business opportunities, and the quality-price ratio of the workforce. Methods: To this end, we used a qualitative methodology composed of 6 case studies, based on interviews and surveys with the managers of the Portuguese firms investing in those three economies. Results: Despite the business opportunities, Portuguese investment directed towards these economies is negligible, due, in part, to the geographic and cultural distance. However, the economic and political stability, combined with market size and growth potential are undeniable attraction factors for Portuguese investors. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), due to their flexible conditions that allow changes in the activity, and the strong trend towards outsourcing, to the detriment of the manufacturing industry, are the primary focus of international investment. This trend, although common to several sectors, has shown greater dynamism in the banking and financial sector. Conclusions: The results suggest market-oriented investments aiming at growth and expansion.  The vast Polish market is the one that most attracted Portuguese investors. The hybrid feature of some strategies can align with the cautious attitude towards the investment translated into cooperation agreements with financial institutions for funding, the market learning process, and the training of the personnel. The anticipation of the installation over potential competitors, the experience in production and international markets, the price-quality ratio, the capacity of product adaptation and the design were considered important sources of competitive advantage that motivated the investment. The greatest difficulties during this process were language and the complexity of legislation.

However, the mechanistic pathway for transmission in close contact settings is unclear.

We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, PubMed and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on the QUADAS-2 criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We included 278 studies: 258 primary studies and 20 systematic reviews. The settings for primary studies were predominantly in home/quarantine facilities (39.5%) and acute care hospitals (12%). The overall reporting quality of the studies was low-to-moderate. There was significant heterogeneity in design and methodology. The frequency of attack rates (PCR testing) varied between 2.1-75%; attack rates were highest in prison and wedding venues, and in households. The frequency of secondary attack rates was 0.3-100% with rates highest in home/quarantine settings. Three studies showed no transmission if the index case was a recurrent infection. Viral culture was performed in four studies of which three found replication-competent virus; culture results were negative where index cases had recurrent infections. Eighteen studies performed genomic sequencing with phylogenetic analysis – the completeness of genomic similarity ranged from 77-100%. Findings from systematic reviews showed that children were significantly less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 and household contact was associated with a significantly increased risk of infection. Conclusions: The evidence from published studies demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in close contact settings. The risk of transmission is greater in household contacts. There was a wide variation in methodology. Standardized guidelines for reporting transmission in close contact settings should be developed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Saudi Arabian students in postgraduate dental programs: Investigating factors associated with burnout [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout related to emotional and physical study or work demands affects an individual’s performance and wellbeing. This study focused on Saudi Arabian dental residents studying in the United States and the United Kingdom who are faced with many challenges in the pursuit of a higher education degree.  Methods: A survey including demographic and Maslach Burnout inventory (MBI) questions was distributed to assess this population’s level of burnout. The MBI has been widely used in the literature to assess three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DEP), and (diminished) personal accomplishment (PA). Potential predictors of burnout level, tested for statistical significance, included: (1) country (US vs UK), (2) hours of work, (3) sponsorship status, (4) marital status (5) gender, and (6) prior work experience.  Results: The number of participants from the UK was 29 and from the US was 64 (n=93). The total number of participants who completed the survey was 87. Using multiple regression analyses, those found to predict EE included hours of work, sponsorship status, and gender. Only gender was found to predict PA. None of the variables were predictive of DEP. Moreover, after controlling for the demographic variables, the country where studying did not help account for the level of burnout.  Conclusion: In the literature, burnout was found to be prevalent among dental postgraduate students. This study suggests that Saudi Arabian dental residents experience high burnout due to emotional exhaustion when compared to other medical professionals. Moreover, Female residents are more likely to report experiencing burnout than their male counterparts. Limitations of the study, implications for practice and suggestions for further research are offered in the discussion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring a spatial code of cell-cell interactions across a whole animal body</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erick Armingol, Abbas Ghaddar, Chintan J. Joshi, Hratch Baghdassarian, Isaac Shamie, Jason Chan, Hsuan-Lin Her, Samuel Berhanu, Anushka Dar, Fabiola Rodriguez-Armstrong, Olivia Yang, Eyleen J. O’Rourke, Nathan E. Lewis</p>

Cell-cell interactions shape cellular function and ultimately organismal phenotype. Interacting cells can sense their mutual distance using combinations of ligand-receptor pairs, suggesting the existence of a spatial code, i.e., signals encoding spatial properties of cellular organization. However, this code driving and sustaining the spatial organization of cells remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions from the transcriptomes of the cell types across the whole body of a multicellular organism. As core of this framework, we introduce our tool <i>cell2cell</i>, which uses the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs to compute the potential for intercellular interactions, and we test it across the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>’ body. Leveraging a 3D atlas of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>’ cells, we also implement a genetic algorithm to identify the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells across the whole body. Validating the spatial code extracted with this strategy, the resulting intercellular distances are negatively correlated with the inferred cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, for selected cell-cell and ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm the communicatory behavior inferred with <i>cell2cell</i> and the genetic algorithm. Thus, our framework helps identify a code that predicts the spatial organization of cells across a whole-animal body.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Soft disorder modulates the assembly path of protein complexes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Beatriz Seoane, Alessandra Carbone</p>

The relationship between interactions, flexibility and disorder in proteins has been explored from many angles over the years: folding upon binding, flexibility of the core relative to the periphery, entropy changes, etc. In this work, we provide statistical evidence for the involvement of highly mobile and disordered regions in complex assembly. We ordered the entire set of X-ray crystallographic structures in the Protein Data Bank into hierarchies of progressive interactions involving identical or very similar protein chains, yielding 40205 hierarchies of protein complexes with increasing numbers of partners. We then examine them as proxies for the assembly pathways. Using this database, we show that upon oligomerisation, the new interfaces tend to be observed at residues that were characterised as softly disordered (flexible, amorphous or missing residues) in the complexes preceding them in the hierarchy. We also rule out the possibility that this correlation is just a surface effect by restricting the analysis to residues on the surface of the complexes. Interestingly, we find that the location of soft disordered residues in the sequence changes as the number of partners increases. Our results show that there is a general mechanism for protein assembly that involves soft disorder and modulates the way protein complexes are assembled. This work highlights the difficulty of predicting the structure of large protein complexes from sequence and emphasises the importance of linking predictors of soft disorder to the next generation of predictors of complex structure. Finally, we investigate the relationship between the Alphafold2’s confidence metric pLDDT for structure prediction in unbound versus bound structures, and soft disorder. We show a strong correlation between Alphafold2 low confidence residues and the union of all regions of soft disorder observed in the hierarchy. This paves the way for using the pLDDT metric as a proxy for predicting interfaces and assembly paths.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational analysis of 5-fluorouracil anti-tumor activity in colon cancer using a mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chenhui Ma, Alex Almasan, Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu</p>

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a standard chemotherapeutic agent to treat solid cancers such as breast, colon, head, and neck. Computational modeling plays an essential role in predicting the outcome of chemotherapy and developing optimal dosing strategies. We developed an integrated mechanistic pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model examining the influence of 5-FU, as an S-phase specific double-strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, on tumor proliferation. The proposed mechanistic PK/PD model simulates the dynamics of critical intermediate components and provides the accurate tumor response prediction. The integrated model is composed of PK, cellular, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) sub-models, quantitatively capturing the essential drug-related physiological processes. In the cellular model, thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition, resultant deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool imbalance, and DSB induction are considered, as well as 5-FU incorporation into RNA and DNA. The amount of 5-FU anabolites and DSBs were modeled to drive the kinetics of the pharmacological tumor response. Model parameters were estimated by fitting to literature data. Our simulation results successfully describe the kinetics of the intermediates regulating the 5-FU cytotoxic events and the pattern of tumor suppression. The comprehensive model simulated the tumor volume change under various dose regimens, and its generalizability was attested by comparing it with literature data. The potential causes of the tumor resistance to 5-FU are also investigated through Monte Carlo analysis. The simulation of various dosage regimens helps quantify the relationship between treatment protocols and chemotherapy potency, which will lead to the development of efficacy optimization.

Scientific research increasingly relies on open source software (OSS). Funding OSS development requires intentional focus on issues of scholarly credit, unique forms of labor, maintenance, governance, and inclusive community-building. Such issues cut across different scientific disciplines that make them of interest to a variety of funders and institutions but may present challenges in understanding generalized needs. Here we present 10 simple rules for investing in scientific OSS and the teams who build and maintain it.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A neurocomputational theory of action regulation predicts motor behavior in neurotypical individuals and patients with Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shan Zhong, Jeong Woo Choi, Nadia G. Hashoush, Diana Babayan, Mahsa Malekmohammadi, Nader Pouratian, Vassilios Christopoulos</p>

Surviving in an uncertain environment requires not only the ability to select the best action, but also the flexibility to withhold inappropriate actions when the environmental conditions change. Although selecting and withholding actions have been extensively studied in both human and animals, there is still lack of consensus on the mechanism underlying these action regulation functions, and more importantly, how they inter-relate. A critical gap impeding progress is the lack of a computational theory that will integrate the mechanisms of action regulation into a unified framework. The current study aims to advance our understanding by developing a neurodynamical computational theory that models the mechanism of action regulation that involves suppressing responses, and predicts how disruption of this mechanism can lead to motor deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. We tested the model predictions in neurotypical individuals and PD patients in three behavioral tasks that involve free action selection between two opposed directions, action selection in the presence of conflicting information and abandoning an ongoing action when a stop signal is presented. Our results and theory suggest an integrated mechanism of action regulation that affects both action initiation and inhibition. When this mechanism is disrupted, motor behavior is affected, leading to longer reaction times and higher error rates in action inhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The pan-genome of Aspergillus fumigatus provides a high-resolution view of its population structure revealing high levels of lineage-specific diversity driven by recombination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lotus A. Lofgren, Brandon S. Ross, Robert A. Cramer, Jason E. Stajich</p>

<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is a deadly agent of human fungal disease where virulence heterogeneity is thought to be at least partially structured by genetic variation between strains. While population genomic analyses based on reference genome alignments offer valuable insights into how gene variants are distributed across populations, these approaches fail to capture intraspecific variation in genes absent from the reference genome. Pan-genomic analyses based on de novo assemblies offer a promising alternative to reference-based genomics with the potential to address the full genetic repertoire of a species. Here, we evaluate 260 genome sequences of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> including 62 newly sequenced strains, using a combination of population genomics, phylogenomics, and pan-genomics. Our results offer a high-resolution assessment of population structure and recombination frequency, phylogenetically structured gene presence–absence variation, evidence for metabolic specificity, and the distribution of putative antifungal resistance genes. Although <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> disperses primarily via asexual conidia, we identified extraordinarily high levels of recombination with the lowest linkage disequilibrium decay value reported for any fungal species to date. We provide evidence for 3 primary populations of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i>, with recombination occurring only rarely between populations and often within them. These 3 populations are structured by both gene variation and distinct patterns of gene presence–absence with unique suites of accessory genes present exclusively in each clade. Accessory genes displayed functional enrichment for nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism suggesting that populations may be stratified by environmental niche specialization. Similarly, the distribution of antifungal resistance genes and resistance alleles were often structured by phylogeny. Altogether, the pan-genome of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> represents one of the largest fungal pan-genomes reported to date including many genes unrepresented in the Af293 reference genome. These results highlight the inadequacy of relying on a single-reference genome-based approach for evaluating intraspecific variation and the power of combined genomic approaches to elucidate population structure, genetic diversity, and putative ecological drivers of clinically relevant fungi.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A qualitative study of the barriers to using blinding in in vivo experiments and suggestions for improvement</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natasha A. Karp, Esther J. Pearl, Emma J. Stringer, Chris Barkus, Jane Coates Ulrichsen, Nathalie Percie du Sert</p>

In animal experiments, blinding (also known as masking) is a methodological strategy to reduce the risk that scientists, animal care staff, or other staff involved in the research may consciously or subconsciously influence the outcome. Lack of masking has been shown to correlate with an overestimation of treatment efficacy and false positive findings. We conducted exploratory interviews across academic and a commercial setting to discuss the implementation of masking at four stages of the experiment: during allocation and intervention, during the conduct of the experiment, during the outcome assessment, and during the data analysis. The objective was to explore the awareness, engagement, perceptions, and the barriers to implementing masking in animal experiments. We conducted multiple interviews, to explore 30 different experiments, and found examples of excellent practice but also areas where masking was rarely implemented. Significant barriers arose from the operational and informatic systems implemented. These systems have prioritised the management of welfare without considering how to allow researchers to use masking in their experiments. For some experiments, there was a conflict between the management of welfare for an individual animal versus delivering a robust experiment where all animals are treated in the same manner. We identified other challenges related to the level of knowledge on the purpose of masking or the implementation and the work culture. The exploration of these issues provides insight into how we, as a community, can identify the most significant barriers in a given research environment. Here, we offer practical solutions to enable researchers to implement masking as standard. To move forward, we need both the individual scientists to embrace the use of masking and the facility managers and institutes to engage and provide a framework that supports the scientists.

The striatum links neuronal circuits in the human brain, and its malfunction causes neuronal disorders such as Huntington’s disease (HD). A human striatum model that recapitulates fetal striatal development is vital to decoding the pathogenesis of striatum-related neurological disorders and developing therapeutic strategies. Here, we developed a method to construct human striatal organoids (hStrOs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including hStrOs-derived assembloids. Our hStrOs partially replicated the fetal striatum and formed striosome and matrix-like compartments in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct striatal lineages in hStrOs, diverging from dorsal forebrain fate. Using hStrOs-derived assembloids, we replicated the striatal targeting projections from different brain parts. Furthermore, hStrOs can serve as hosts for striatal neuronal allografts to test allograft neuronal survival and functional integration. Our hStrOs are suitable for studying striatal development and related disorders, characterizing the neural circuitry between different brain regions, and testing therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">PTRN-1 (CAMSAP) and NOCA-2 (NINEIN) are required for microtubule polarity in Caenorhabditis elegans dendrites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Liu He, Lotte van Beem, Berend Snel, Casper C. Hoogenraad, Martin Harterink</p>

The neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton is key to establish axon-dendrite polarity. Dendrites are characterized by the presence of minus-end out microtubules. However, the mechanisms that organize these microtubules with the correct orientation are still poorly understood. Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model system for microtubule organization, we characterized the role of 2 microtubule minus-end related proteins in this process, the microtubule minus-end stabilizing protein calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated <i>protein</i> (CAMSAP/PTRN-1), and the NINEIN homologue, NOCA-2 (noncentrosomal microtubule array). We found that CAMSAP and NINEIN function in parallel to mediate microtubule organization in dendrites. During dendrite outgrowth, RAB-11-positive vesicles localized to the dendrite tip to nucleate microtubules and function as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC). In the absence of either CAMSAP or NINEIN, we observed a low penetrance MTOC vesicles mislocalization to the cell body, and a nearly fully penetrant phenotype in double mutant animals. This suggests that both proteins are important for localizing the MTOC vesicles to the growing dendrite tip to organize microtubules minus-end out. Whereas NINEIN localizes to the MTOC vesicles where it is important for the recruitment of the microtubule nucleator γ-tubulin, CAMSAP localizes around the MTOC vesicles and is cotranslocated forward with the MTOC vesicles upon dendritic growth. Together, these results indicate that microtubule nucleation from the MTOC vesicles and microtubule stabilization are both important to localize the MTOC vesicles distally to organize dendritic microtubules minus-end out.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cbln1 regulates axon growth and guidance in multiple neural regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peng Han, Yuanchu She, Zhuoxuan Yang, Mengru Zhuang, Qingjun Wang, Xiaopeng Luo, Chaoqun Yin, Junda Zhu, Samie R. Jaffrey, Sheng-Jian Ji</p>

The accurate construction of neural circuits requires the precise control of axon growth and guidance, which is regulated by multiple growth and guidance cues during early nervous system development. It is generally thought that the growth and guidance cues that control the major steps of axon development have been defined. Here, we describe cerebellin-1 (Cbln1) as a novel cue that controls diverse aspects of axon growth and guidance throughout the central nervous system (CNS) by experiments using mouse and chick embryos. Cbln1 has previously been shown to function in late neural development to influence synapse organization. Here, we find that Cbln1 has an essential role in early neural development. Cbln1 is expressed on the axons and growth cones of developing commissural neurons and functions in an autocrine manner to promote axon growth. Cbln1 is also expressed in intermediate target tissues and functions as an attractive guidance cue. We find that these functions of Cbln1 are mediated by neurexin-2 (Nrxn2), which functions as the Cbln1 receptor for axon growth and guidance. In addition to the developing spinal cord, we further show that Cbln1 functions in diverse parts of the CNS with major roles in cerebellar parallel fiber growth and retinal ganglion cell axon guidance. Despite the prevailing role of Cbln1 as a synaptic organizer, our study discovers a new and unexpected function for Cbln1 as a general axon growth and guidance cue throughout the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Topographical organization and morphology of substance P (SP)‐immunoreactive axons in the whole stomach of mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nociceptive afferents innervate the stomach and send signals centrally to the brain and locally to stomach tissues. Nociceptive afferents can be detected with a variety of different markers. In particular, substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide and is one of the most commonly used markers for nociceptive nerves in the somatic and visceral organs. However, the topographical distribution and morphological structure of SP-immunoreactive (SP-IR) axons and terminals in the whole stomach have not yet been fully determined. In this study, we labeled SP-IR axons and terminals in flat mounts of the ventral and dorsal halves of the stomach of mice. Flat-mount stomachs, including the longitudinal and circular muscular layers and the myenteric ganglionic plexus, were processed with SP primary antibody followed by fluorescent secondary antibody and then scanned using confocal microscopy. We found that (1) SP-IR axons and terminals formed an extensive network of fibers in the muscular layers and within the ganglia of the myenteric plexus of the whole stomach. (2) Many axons that ran in parallel with the long axes of the longitudinal and circular muscles were also immunoreactive for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). (3) SP-IR axons formed very dense terminal varicosities encircling individual neurons in the myenteric plexus; many of these were VAChT immunoreactive. (4) The regional density of SP-IR axons and terminals in the muscle and myenteric plexus varied in the following order from high to low: antrum-pylorus, corpus, fundus, and cardia. (5) In only the longitudinal and circular muscles, the regional density of SP-IR axon innervation from high to low were: antrum-pylorus, corpus, cardia, and fundus. (6) The innervation patterns of SP-IR axons and terminals in the ventral and dorsal stomach were comparable. Collectively, our data provide for the first time a map of the distribution and morphology of SP-IR axons and terminals in the whole stomach with single-cell/axon/synapse resolution. This work will establish an anatomical foundation for functional mapping of the SP-IR axon innervation of the stomach and its pathological remodeling in gastrointestinal diseases.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Synaptic loss is an early feature of neurodegenerative disease models, and is severe in post mortem clinical studies, including frontotemporal dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiotracers that bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A enables quantification of synaptic density in vivo. This study used [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET in participants with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), testing the hypothesis that synaptic loss is severe and related to clinical severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eleven participants with clinically probable bvFTD and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Participants underwent dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and a neuropsychological battery, including the revised Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination, and INECO frontal screening. General linear models compared [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential maps and gray matter volume between groups, and assessed associations between synaptic density and clinical severity in patients. Analyses were also performed using partial volume corrected [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential from regions of interest (ROIs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with bvFTD showed severe synaptic loss compared to controls. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding was reduced bilaterally in medial and dorsolateral frontal regions, inferior frontal gyri, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, and medial temporal lobe. Synaptic loss in the frontal and cingulate regions correlated significantly with cognitive impairments. Synaptic loss was more severe than atrophy. Results from ROI-based analyses mirrored the voxelwise results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In accordance with preclinical models, and human postmortem evidence, there is widespread frontotemporal loss of synapses in symptomatic bvFTD, in proportion to severity. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET could support translational studies and experimental medicine strategies for new disease-modifying treatments for neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tubers affecting the fusiform face area are associated with autism diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is associated with focal brain “tubers” and a high incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The location of brain tubers associated with autism may provide insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of ASD symptoms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We delineated tuber locations for 115 TSC participants with ASD (n = 31) and without ASD (n = 84) from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network. We tested for associations between ASD diagnosis and tuber burden within the whole brain, specific lobes, and at eight regions of interest derived from the ASD neuroimaging literature including the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and posterior parietal cortices, the inferior frontal and fusiform gyri, the superior temporal sulcus, the amygdala, and the supplemental motor area. Next, we performed an unbiased data-driven voxel-wise lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analysis. Finally, we calculated the risk of ASD associated with positive findings from the above analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were no significant ASD-related differences in tuber burden across the whole-brain, within specific lobes, or within <i>a priori</i> regions derived from the ASD literature. However, using VLSM analysis we found that tubers involving the right fusiform face area (FFA) were associated with a 3.7-fold increased risk of developing ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>While TSC is a rare cause of ASD, there is a strong association between tuber involvement of the right FFA and ASD diagnosis. This highlights a potentially causative mechanism for developing autism in TSC that may guide research into ASD symptoms more generally.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tenecteplase Improves Reperfusion Across Time in Large Vessel Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Background and Aims</h2>
<p>Tenecteplase improves reperfusion compared to alteplase in patients with large vessel occlusions. To determine whether this improvement varies across the spectrum of thrombolytic to reperfusion assessment times, we performed a comparative analysis of tenecteplase and alteplase reperfusion rates.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with large vessel occlusion and treatment with thrombolysis were pooled from the Melbourne Stroke Registry, the EXTEND-IA, and EXTEND-IA TNK trials. The primary outcome, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion, was defined as the absence of retrievable thrombus or &gt;50% reperfusion at imaging reassessment. We compared the treatment effect of tenecteplase and alteplase, accounting for thrombolytic-to-assessment as exposure times, via Poisson modelling. We compared 90-day outcomes of patients who achieved reperfusion with a thrombolytic to patients who achieved reperfusion via endovascular therapy using ordinal logistic regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 893 patients included in the primary analysis, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion was observed in 184 (21%) patients. Tenecteplase was associated with higher rates of reperfusion (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]:1.50 [95%CI:1.09-2.07], p=0.01). Findings were consistent in patient sub-groups with M1 (aIRR:1.41 [95%CI:0.93-2.14]) and M2 (aIRR:2.07 [95%CI:0.98-4.37]) occlusions. Increased thrombolytic to reperfusion assessment times were associated with reperfusion (tenecteplase: adjusted risk ratio [aRR]:1.08 per 15min [95%CI:1.04-1.13] versus alteplase: aRR:1.06 per 15min [95%CI:1.00-1.13]). No significant treatment-by-time interaction was observed (p=0.87). Reperfusion via thrombolysis was associated with improved 90-day mRS scores, (acOR:2.15 [95%CI:1.54-3.01]) compared to patients who achieved reperfusion following endovascular therapy.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Tenecteplase, compared to alteplase, increases pre-thrombectomy reperfusion, regardless of the time from administration to reperfusion assessment. Pre-thrombectomy reperfusion is associated with better clinical outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A combined panel of salivary biomarkers in de novo Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate molecular biomarkers of a-synuclein and tau aggregation, autophagy, and inflammation in the saliva of de novo Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in comparison to healthy subjects (HS), and to correlate molecular data with clinical features of PD patients, in order to establish whether abnormalities of these parameters are associated with specific clusters of de novo PD patients, and their potential diagnostic power in differentiating PD patients from HS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured total and oligomeric a-synuclein, total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, MAP-LC3beta, and TNFalpha in the saliva of 80 de novo PD patients and 62 HS, using quantitative Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Oligomeric a-synuclein, total-tau, MAP-LC3beta, and TNFalpha levels resulted significantly higher in patients with respect to HS, while no significant differences were detected for total a-synuclein or phosphorylated-tau. Phosphorylated-tau directly correlated with MAP-LC3beta, whereas it inversely correlated with TNFalpha in PD patients. An inverse correlation was detected between MAP-LC3beta and non-motor symptoms severity. Principal Component Analysis showed that molecular and clinical parameters were independent of each other in de novo PD patients. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis reported an accurate diagnostic performance of oligomeric a-synuclein and MAP-LC3beta. The diagnostic accuracy of total a-synuclein increased when it was combined with other salivary biomarkers targeting different molecular pathways.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study proposes a novel biomarker panel using saliva, a non-invasive biofluid, in de novo PD patients, with implications in understanding the molecular pathways involved in PD pathogenesis and the relevance of different molecular pathways in determining clinical PD subtypes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Three-dimensional flagella structures from animals’ closest unicellular relatives, the Choanoflagellates</a></h4>

              
                In most eukaryotic organisms, cilia and flagella perform a variety of life-sustaining roles related to environmental sensing and motility. Cryo-electron microscopy has provided considerable insight into the morphology and function of flagellar structures, but studies have been limited to less than a dozen of the millions of known eukaryotic species. Ultrastructural information is particularly lacking for unicellular organisms in the Opisthokonta clade, leaving a sizeable gap in our understanding of flagella evolution between unicellular species and multicellular metazoans (animals). Choanoflagellates are important aquatic heterotrophs, uniquely positioned within the opisthokonts as the metazoans’ closest living unicellular relatives. We performed cryo-focused ion beam milling and cryo-electron tomography on flagella from the choanoflagellate species <i>Salpingoeca rosetta</i>. We show that the axonemal dyneins, radial spokes, and central pair complex in <i>S. rosetta</i> more closely resemble metazoan structures than those of unicellular organisms from other suprakingdoms. In addition, we describe unique features of <i>S. rosetta</i> flagella, including microtubule holes, microtubule inner proteins, and the flagellar vane: a fine, net-like extension that has been notoriously difficult to visualize using other methods. Furthermore, we report barb-like structures of unknown function on the extracellular surface of the flagellar membrane. Together, our findings provide new insights into choanoflagellate biology and flagella evolution between unicellular and multicellular opisthokonts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phox2b mutation mediated by Atoh1 expression impaired respiratory rhythm and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the transcription factor <i>Phox2b</i> cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The syndrome is characterized by hypoventilation and inability to regulate breathing to maintain adequate O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2 </sub>levels. The mechanism by which CCHS impact respiratory control are incompletely understood, and even less is known about the impact of the non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (NPARM) form. Our goal was to investigate the extent by which NPARM <i>Phox2b</i> mutation affect a) respiratory rhythm; b) ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (HCVR) and hypoxia (HVR) and c) number of chemosensitive neurons in mice. We used a transgenic mouse line carrying a conditional <i>Phox2b<sup>Δ</sup><sup>8</sup></i> mutation (same found in humans with NPARM CCHS). We crossed them with <i>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></i> mice to introduce mutation in regions involved with respiratory function and central chemoreflex control. Ventilation was measured by plethysmograph during neonatal and adult life. In room air, mutation in neonates and adult did not greatly impact basal ventilation. However, <i>Phox2b<sup>Δ</sup><sup>8</sup></i>, <i>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></i> increased breath irregularity in adults. The HVR and HCVR were impaired in neonates. The HVR, but not HCVR was still partially compromised in adults. The mutation reduced the number of Phox2b<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup> expressing neurons as well as the number of fos-activated cells within the ventral parafacial region (also named retrotrapezoid region - RTN) induced by hypercapnia. Our data indicates that <i>Phox2b<sup>Δ</sup><sup>8</sup></i> mutation in <i>Atoh1</i>-expressing cells impaired RTN neurons, as well as chemoreflex under hypoxia and hypercapnia specially early in life. This study provided new evidence for mechanisms related to NPARM form of CCHS neuropathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unleashing a novel function of endonuclease G in mitochondrial genome instability</a></h4>

              
                Having its genome makes the mitochondrion a unique and semiautonomous organelle within cells. Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a double-stranded closed circular molecule of about 16 kb coding for 37 genes. Mutations, including deletions in the mitochondrial genome, can culminate in different human diseases. Mapping the deletion junctions suggests that the breakpoints are generally seen at hotspots. '9-bp deletion' (8271-8281), seen in the intergenic region of cytochrome c oxidase II/tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, is the most common mitochondrial deletion. While it is associated with several diseases like myopathy, dystonia, and hepatocellular carcinoma, it has also been used as an evolutionary marker. However, the mechanism responsible for its fragility is unclear. In the current study, we show that Endonuclease G, a mitochondrial nuclease responsible for nonspecific cleavage of nuclear DNA during apoptosis, can induce breaks at sequences associated with '9-bp deletion' when it is present on a plasmid or in the mitochondrial genome. Through a series of <i>in vitro</i> and intracellular studies, we show that Endonuclease G binds to G-quadruplex structures formed at the hotspot and induces DNA breaks. Therefore, we uncover a new role for Endonuclease G in generating mtDNA deletions, which depends on the formation of G4 DNA within the mitochondrial genome. In summary, we identify a novel property of Endonuclease G, besides its role in apoptosis and the recently described elimination of paternal mitochondria during fertilisation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phase separation of competing memories along the human hippocampal theta rhythm</a></h4>

              
                Competition between overlapping memories is considered one of the major causes of forgetting, and it is still unknown how the human brain resolves such mnemonic conflict. In the present magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we empirically tested a computational model that leverages an oscillating inhibition algorithm to minimise overlap between memories. We used a proactive interference task, where a reminder word could be associated with either a single image (non-competitive condition) or two competing images, and participants were asked to always recall the most recently learned word–image association. Time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect the reactivated content of target and competitor memories from MEG sensor patterns, and the timing of these neural reactivations was analysed relative to the phase of the dominant hippocampal 3 Hz theta oscillation. In line with our pre-registered hypotheses, target and competitor reactivations locked to different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm after several repeated recalls. Participants who behaviourally experienced lower levels of interference also showed larger phase separation between the two overlapping memories. The findings provide evidence that the temporal segregation of memories, orchestrated by slow oscillations, plays a functional role in resolving mnemonic competition by separating and prioritising relevant memories under conditions of high interference.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Insulin sensitivity is preserved in mice made obese by feeding a high starch diet</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is generally associated with insulin resistance in liver and muscle and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, however there is a population of obese people that remain insulin sensitive. Similarly, recent work suggests that mice fed high carbohydrate diets can become obese without apparent glucose intolerance. To investigate this phenomenon further, we fed mice either a high fat (Hi-F) or high starch (Hi-ST) diet and measured adiposity, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and tissue lipids compared to control mice fed a standard laboratory chow. Both Hi-ST and Hi-F mice accumulated a similar amount of fat and tissue triglyceride compared to chow-fed mice. However while Hi-F diet mice developed glucose intolerance as well as liver and muscle insulin resistance (assessed via euglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamp), obese Hi-ST mice maintained glucose tolerance and insulin action similar to lean, chow-fed controls. This preservation of insulin action despite obesity in Hi-ST mice was associated with differences in de novo lipogenesis and levels of C22:0 ceramide in liver and C18:0 ceramide in muscle. This indicates that dietary manipulation can influence insulin action independently of the level of adiposity and that the presence of specific ceramide species correlate with these differences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neonatal brain dynamic functional connectivity: impact of preterm birth and association with early childhood neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                Brain functional dynamics have been linked to emotion and cognition in mature individuals, where alterations are associated with mental ill-health and neurodevelopmental conditions (such as autism spectrum disorder). Although reliable resting-state networks have been consistently identified in neonates, little is known about the early development of dynamic brain functional connectivity and whether it is linked to later neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood. In this study we characterised dynamic functional connectivity in the first few weeks of postnatal life and evaluated whether early dynamic functional connectivity: i) changes with age in the neonatal period ii) is altered by preterm birth and iii) is associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes at 18 months. We used the Kuramoto Order Parameter as a metric of global brain synchrony and defined transient brain states (modules) using Leading Eigenvector Analysis (LEiDA) in a cohort of term-born (n=324) and preterm-born babies (n=66) scanned at term equivalent age from the developing Human Connectome Project. We assessed whether neonatal brain state features (mean synchrony, metastability, entropy, fractional occupancy, dwelling times) and state transition probabilities were associated with postmenstrual age at scan , postnatal days at scan and preterm-birth; and correlate with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, and atypical social, sensory and repetitive behaviours measured by the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT). On a global scale, preterm-born infants had lower mean synchronisation and metastability, with reduced mean synchronisation associated with higher Q-CHAT scores at 18 months of age. On a modular scale, we identified six transient states of neonatal dynamic functional connectivity: three whole-brain synchronisation states and three regional synchrony states occupying occipital, sensory-motor, and frontal regions. Mean synchrony, metastability, fractional occupancy and dwelling times of these brain states were correlated with postmenstrual age and postnatal days at scan. Preterm-born infants had increased fractional occupancy of frontal and occipital states. Higher neonatal sensory-motor synchronisation was associated with lower motor and language outcome scores at 18 months. Lower frequency of occurrence of whole-brain synchronisation states and higher frequency of occurrence of the sensory-motor state were associated with higher Q-CHAT scores at 18 months. Thus, we have shown for the first time that a dynamic landscape of brain connectivity is already established by the time of birth in the human brain. This landscape is altered by preterm birth and its profile is linked to neurodevelopmental outcomes in toddlerhood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration of event experiences to build relational knowledge in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                We investigated how the human brain integrates experiences of specific events to build general knowledge about typical event structure. We examined an episodic area important for temporal relations, anterior-lateral entorhinal cortex (alEC), and a semantic area important for action concepts, middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Participants underwent fMRI while watching sequences of novel events and recalling their temporal relations over two sessions one week apart. Across different contexts, the roles of these events could either be consistent, or conflict; integrative representations should weaken in the conflicting condition. We found integrative representations that emerged quickly in alEC, and only subsequently in MTG, which showed a significant change across sessions. Thus, alEC is important in building integrative representations early in learning and may be a gateway to semantic knowledge in MTG. We suggest that both episodic and semantic systems participate in integrating new information when it is aligned with their content specializations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semaphorin7A patterns neural circuitry in the lateral line of the zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                In a developing nervous system, axonal arbors often undergo complex rearrangements before neural circuits attain their final innervation topology. In the lateral line sensory system of the zebrafish, developing sensory axons reorganize their terminal arborization patterns to establish precise neural microcircuits around the mechanosensory hair cells. However, a quantitative understanding of the changes in the sensory arbor morphology and the regulators behind the microcircuit assembly remain enigmatic. Here, we report that Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) acts as an important mediator of these processes. Utilizing a semi-automated three-dimensional neurite tracing methodology and computational techniques, we have quantitatively analyzed the morphology of the sensory arbors in wild-type and Sema7A loss-of-function mutants. In contrast to those of wild-type animals, the sensory axons in Sema7A mutants display aberrant arborizations with diminished contacts to hair cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a secreted form of Sema7A by non-hair cells induces chemotropic guidance of sensory axons. Our findings demonstrate that Sema7A functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.

                Dominant missense mutations in DNAJB6, an HSP40 co-chaperone, cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) D1. No treatments are currently available. Two isoforms exist, DNAJB6a and DNAJB6b, each with distinct localizations in muscle. Mutations reside in both isoforms, yet evidence suggests only DNAJB6b is responsible for disease pathogenesis. Mechanistic data supports either a toxic gain of function, a dominant negative mechanism, or a combination of both. Knockdown treatment strategies involving both isoforms carry risk as DNAJB6 knockout is embryonic lethal. We therefore developed an isoform specific knockdown approach using morpholinos. Selective reduction of each isoform was achieved in-vitro in primary mouse myotubes and human myoblasts, as well as in-vivo in mouse skeletal muscle. To assess isoform specific knockdown in LGMDD1, we created primary myotube cultures from a knock-in LGMDD1 mouse model. Using mass spectrometry, we identified an LGMDD1 protein signature related to protein homeostasis and myofibril structure. Selective reduction of DNAJB6b levels in LGMDD1 myotubes corrected much of the proteomic disease signature towards wild type levels. While additional in-vivo functional data is required, these findings suggest selective reduction of DNAJB6b may be a viable therapeutic target for LGMDD1.

                While there is a wealth of knowledge about core object recognition--our ability to recognize clear, high-contrast object images, how the brain accomplishes object recognition tasks under increased uncertainty remains poorly understood. We investigated the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying object recognition under increased uncertainty by combining MEG and 7 Tesla fMRI in humans during a threshold-level object recognition task. We observed an early, parallel rise of recognition-related signals across ventral visual and frontoparietal regions that preceded the emergence of category-related information. Recognition-related signals in ventral visual regions were best explained by a two-state representational format whereby brain activity bifurcated for recognized and unrecognized images. By contrast, recognition-related signals in frontoparietal regions exhibited a reduced representational space for recognized images, yet with sharper category information. These results provide a spatiotemporally resolved view of neural activity supporting object recognition under uncertainty, revealing a pattern distinct from that underlying core object recognition.

                Neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are strongly influenced by inherited genetic variation, but environmental and epigenetic factors also play key roles in the course of these diseases. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 (C9) gene is the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD. To determine the cellular alterations associated with the C9 repeat expansion, we performed single nucleus transcriptomics (snRNA-seq) and epigenomics (snATAC-seq) in postmortem samples of motor and frontal cortices from C9-ALS and C9-FTD donors. We found pervasive alterations of gene expression across multiple cortical cell types in C9-ALS, with the largest number of affected genes in astrocytes and excitatory neurons. Astrocytes increased expression of markers of activation and pathways associated with structural remodeling. Excitatory neurons in upper and deep layers increased expression of genes related to proteostasis, metabolism, and protein expression, and decreased expression of genes related to neuronal function. Epigenetic analyses revealed concordant changes in chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression in specific cell types. C9-FTD patients had a distinct pattern of changes, including loss of neurons in frontal cortex and altered expression of thousands of genes in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. Overall, these findings demonstrate a context-dependent molecular disruption in C9-ALS and C9-FTD, resulting in distinct effects across cell types, brain regions, and disease phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representational geometries reveal differential effects of response correlations on population codes in neurophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                Two sensory neurons usually display trial-by-trial response correlations given the repeated representations of an identical stimulus. The effects of such response correlations on population-level sensory coding have been the focal contention in computational neuroscience over the past few years. In the meantime, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been the leading analysis approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but the effects of response correlations in voxel populations remain underexplored. Here, instead of conventional MVPA analysis, we calculate linear Fisher information of population responses in human visual cortex and hypothetically remove response correlations between voxels. We found that voxelwise response correlations generally enhance stimulus information, a result standing in stark contrast to the detrimental effects of response correlations reported in neurophysiological literature. By voxel-encoding modeling, we further show that these two seemingly opposite effects actually can coexist. Furthermore, we use principal component analysis to decompose stimulus information in population responses onto different principal dimensions in a high representational space. Interestingly, response correlations simultaneously reduce and enhance information on information on high- and low-variance principal dimensions, respectively. The relative strength of the two antagonistic effects within the same computational framework produces the apparent discrepancy in the effect of response correlations in neuronal and voxel populations. Our results suggest that multivariate fMRI data contain rich statistical structures that are directly related to sensory information representation, and the general computational framework to analyze neuronal and voxel population responses can be applied in many types of neural measurements.

                Humans consider the parameters linked to movement goal during reaching to adjust their control strategy online. Indeed, rapid changes in target structure or disturbances interfering with their initial plan elicit rapid changes in behavior. Here, we hypothesize that these changes could result from the continuous use of a decision variable combining motor and cognitive components. We combine an optimal feedback controller with a real-time monitoring of the expected cost-to-go, which considers target- and movement-related costs, in a novel theoretical framework. This model reproduces reaching behaviors in presence of changes in the target structure occurring during movement and of online decisions to flexibly change target following external perturbations. It also predicts that the time taken to decide to select a novel goal after a perturbation depends on the amplitude of the disturbance and on the rewards of the different options, which is a direct result of the continuous monitoring of the cost-to-go. We show that this result was present in our previously collected dataset. Together our developments point towards a continuous monitoring of the cost-to-go during reaching to update control online and make efficient decisions about movement goal.

                The difference between age predicted using anatomical brain scans and chronological age, i.e., the brain-age delta, provides a proxy for atypical aging. Various data representations and machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used for brain-age estimation. However, how these choices compare on performance criteria important for real-world applications, such as; (1) within-site accuracy, (2) cross-site generalization, (3) test-retest reliability, and (4) longitudinal consistency, remains uncharacterized. We evaluated 128 workflows consisting of 16 feature representations derived from gray matter (GM) images and eight ML algorithms with diverse inductive biases. Using four large neuroimaging databases covering the adult lifespan (total N = 2953, 18-88 years), we followed a systematic model selection procedure by sequentially applying stringent criteria. The 128 workflows showed a within-site mean absolute error (MAE) between 4.73-8.38 years, from which 32 broadly sampled workflows showed a cross-site MAE between 5.23-8.98 years. The test-retest reliability and longitudinal consistency of the top 10 workflows were comparable. The choice of feature representation and the ML algorithm both affected the performance. Specifically, voxel-wise feature spaces (smoothed and resampled), with and without principal components analysis, with non-linear and kernel-based ML algorithms performed well. Strikingly, the correlation of brain-age delta with behavioral measures disagreed between within-site and cross-site predictions. Application of the best-performing workflow on the ADNI sample showed a significantly higher brain-age delta in Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment patients. However, in the presence of age bias, the delta estimates in the diseased population varied depending on the sample used for bias correction. Taken together, brain-age shows promise, but further evaluation and improvements are needed for its real-world application.

                Large-scale brain states or distributed patterns of brain activity modulate downstream processing and behavior. Sustained attention and memory retrieval states impact subsequent memory, yet how these states relate to one another is unclear. We hypothesize that the retrieval state reflects internal attention. The alternative is that the retrieval state reflects a controlled, episodic retrieval mode, specifically engaged when intentionally accessing events situated within a spatiotemporal context. To test our hypothesis, we developed a mnemonic state classifier independently trained to measure retrieval state evidence and applied this classifier to a spatial attention task. We find that retrieval state evidence increases during delay and response intervals when participants are maintaining spatial information. Critically, retrieval state evidence is positively related to the amount of maintained spatial location information and predicts target detection reaction times. Together, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the retrieval state constitutes internal attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consciousness is indexed by analogous cortical reorganization during sleep and anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Although sleep and anesthesia are predicted to share common neural signatures of transitions into and out of unconsciousness, supportive evidence has been elusive. We identified these signatures using intracranial electroencephalography in neurosurgical patients. We applied diffusion map embedding to map cortical location into a space where proximity indicates functional similarity using a normalized connectivity ('diffusion') matrix, itself a rich source of information about network properties. During reduced consciousness, diffusion matrices exhibited decreased effective dimensionality, reflecting reduced network entropy. Furthermore, functional brain regions exhibited tighter clustering in embedding space with greater distances between regions, corresponding to decreased differentiation and functional integration. These changes were not region-specific, suggesting global network reorganization. These results strongly suggest common neural substrates for loss and recovery of consciousness during anesthesia and sleep, providing a systems-level mechanistic understanding within an intuitive geometric context and laying the foundation for evaluation of cortical state transitions in clinical settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Histone H2A monoubiquitination in the thalamus regulates cocaine effects and addiction risk</a></h4>

              
                The individual risk of developing drug addiction is highly determined by the epigenetic landscape. Chromatin remodeling regulates drug-induced transcriptional and behavioral effects and the consequent development of addictive behaviors. Several chromatin modifications in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, including histone H3 methylation, H3 and H4 acetylation, have been implicated in drug addiction. Still, the contribution of other histones and their post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as monoubiquitination is unknown. Here we found that H2A monoubiquitination in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) plays a major role in cocaine-adaptive behaviors and local cocaine-evoked transcriptional repression. Mice undergoing chronic cocaine administration showed a specific increased monoubiquitination of H2A. Furthermore, we showed that this histone PTM is controlled, in the PVT, by an interaction between melanoma-associated antigen D1 (Maged1), a scaffold protein involved in drug addiction, and USP7, a deubiquitinase. Accordingly, Maged1 specific inactivation in thalamic vGluT2 neurons, or USP7 inhibition, blocked cocaine-evoked H2A monoubiquitination and abolished cocaine locomotor sensitization. Finally, we identified genetic variations of MAGED1 and USP7 associated with modified transition to cocaine addiction and cocaine-induced aggressive behavior in human subjects. These findings identified a new epigenetic modification in a noncanonical reward pathway of the brain and a potent marker of epigenetic risk factor for drug addiction in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting Staufen 1 with antisense oligonucleotides for treating ALS and SCA2</a></h4>

              
                Staufen1 (STAU1) is a multifunctional RNA binding protein that controls mRNA degradation and subcellular localization. STAU1 interacts with the ATXN2 protein, that is polyglutamine expanded in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). We previously showed that STAU1 is elevated and aggregated in cells from SCA2 patients, cells from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, and in SCA2 and ALS mouse models. We also found that reduction of STAU1 abundance in vivo by genetic interaction improved motor behavior in an SCA2 mouse model, normalized the levels of several SCA2-related proteins, and reduced aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded ATXN2. Here we developed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) lowering STAU1 expression toward developing a therapeutic that may be effective for treating SCA2 and ALS. We performed a screen of 118 20mer phosphorothioate 2-prime-O-methoxyethyl (MOE) ASO gapmers targeting across the STAU1 mRNA coding region for lowering STAU1 expression in HEK-293 cells. ASO hits lowering STAU1 by >45 % were rescreened in SCA2 patient fibroblasts, and 10 of these were tested for lowering STAU1 abundance in vivo in a new BAC-STAU1 mouse model. This identified efficacious ASOs targeting human STAU1 in vivo that normalized autophagy marker proteins, including ASO-45 that also targets mouse Stau1. When delivered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection, ASO-45 normalized autophagy markers and abnormal mRNA abundances in cerebella of ATXN2-Q127 SCA2 mice, as well as ChAT, NeuN and cleaved caspase-3 in spinal cord of Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mice. Targeting STAU1 may be an effective strategy for treating ALS and SCA2 as well as other disorders characterized by its overabundance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-or-None Evaluation of Prediction Certainty in Autism</a></h4>

              
                The brain generates predictions to prepare for upcoming events. As life is not always 100% predictable, it also estimates a level of certainty for these predictions. Given that autistic individuals resist even small changes in everyday life, we hypothesized impaired tuning of prediction certainty in autism. To study this, EEG was recorded from adolescents and young adults with autism while they performed a probabilistic prediction task in which cue validity was parametrically manipulated. A fully predictable condition (100% cue validity) was contrasted with less predictable conditions (84, 67 and 33% cue validity). Well characterized brain potentials were examined to assess the influence of cue validity on target anticipation (contingent negative variation; CNV), the evaluation of target statistics (P3), and prediction model updating (slow wave; SW). As expected, cue validity systematically influenced the amplitudes of the CNV, P3 and SW in controls. In contrast, cue-validity effects on CNV and SW were substantially reduced in autism. This suggests that although target statistics are accurately registered in autism, as indicated by intact modulation of the P3, they are not effectively applied to generate expectations for upcoming input or model updating. Contrasting the fully predictable with the less predictable conditions, our data suggest that autistic individuals adopted an all-or-none evaluation of certainty of their environment, rather than adjusting certainty of predictions to different levels of environmental statistics. Social responsiveness scores were associated with flexibility in representing prediction certainty, suggesting that impaired representation and updating of prediction certainty may contribute to social difficulties in autism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Geometry of visual working memory information in human gaze patterns</a></h4>

              
                In decoding visual working memory information from neural signals, stimulus-dependent eye movements have been considered a confound. Here, we combined eye-tracking with representational geometry analyses to uncover this very information in miniature gaze patterns while participants (n = 41) were cued to maintain visual object orientations. Although participants were discouraged from breaking fixation via real-time feedback, small gaze shifts (< 1 degree) robustly encoded the to-be-maintained stimulus orientation, with evidence for encoding two sequentially presented orientations at the same time. While the orientation encoding upon stimulus presentation was object-specific, it changed to a more object-independent format during cued maintenance, particularly when attention had been temporarily withdrawn from the memorandum. Finally, categorical reporting biases increased after unattended storage, with indications of biased gaze geometries emerging already during the maintenance periods prior to behavioral reporting. These findings disclose a wealth of information in gaze patterns during visuospatial working memory, and suggest systematic changes in representational format when memory contents have been unattended.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell type-specific assessment of cholesterol distribution in models of neurodevelopmental disorders</a></h4>

              
                Most nervous system disorders manifest through alterations in neuronal signaling based on abnormalities in neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and cell survival. However, such neuronal phenotypes are frequently accompanied or even caused by metabolic dysfunctions in neuronal or nonneuronal cells. The tight packing and highly heterogenous properties of neural, glial and vascular cell types pose significant challenges to dissecting metabolic aspects of brain disorders. Perturbed cholesterol homeostasis has recently emerged as key parameter associated with sub-sets of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, approaches for tracking and visualizing endogenous cholesterol distribution in the brain have limited capability of resolving cell type-specific differences. We here develop tools for genetically-encoded sensors that report on cholesterol distribution in the mouse brain with cellular resolution. We apply these probes to examine sub-cellular cholesterol accumulation in two genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, Npc1 and Ptchd1 knock-out mice. While both genes encode proteins with sterol-sensing domains that have been implicated in cholesterol transport, we uncover highly selective and cell type-specific phenotypes in cholesterol homeostasis. The tools established in this work should facilitate probing sub-cellular cholesterol distribution in complex tissues like the mammalian brain and enable capturing cell type-specific alterations in cholesterol flow between cells in models of brain disorders.

                Speech production and perception are fundamental processes of human cognition that both rely on an internal forward model that is still poorly understood. Here, we study this forward model by using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to comprehensively map connectivity of regional brain activity within the brain and to the speech envelope during continuous speaking and listening. Our results reveal a partly shared neural substrate for both processes but also a dissociation in space, delay and frequency. Neural activity in motor and frontal areas is coupled to succeeding speech in delta band (1-3 Hz), whereas coupling in the theta range follows speech in temporal areas during speaking. Neural connectivity results showed a separation of bottom-up and top-down signalling in distinct frequency bands during speaking. Here, we show that frequency-specific connectivity channels for bottom-up and top-down signalling support continuous speaking and listening in a way that is consistent with the predictive coding framework.

	<p>Scarcity goods have generally been perceived as high in value in real-world and empirical studies. However, few studies have investigated this value over time, such as performance in intertemporal decision making. This study&amp;amp;rsquo;s chief objective was to determine how scarcity evaluation changes temporally. We used the electroencephalogram technique and an outcome evaluation task with the valuation of scarcity and ordinary rewards delivered at different times to explore the effect of scarcity on delay discounting. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) results show that ordinary goods were associated with a more negative amplitude than scarcity goods, and that rewards delivered in the future evoked more negative deflection compared to those delivered immediately. The prominent FRN effect was derived mainly from ordinary trials rather than scarcity trials in the immediate condition and in the future rather than only in the immediate condition. The Frontal Asymmetry Index (FAI) results show that the scarcity condition was associated with greater relative left frontal cortical activity than the ordinary condition when delivered immediately. The frontal asymmetry indicated greater approach motivation. Our electrophysiology data indicate that scarcity goods have a perceived high value, particularly when delivered immediately.</p>

	<p>Using the arousal and mood hypothesis as a theoretical framework, we examined whether community-dwelling older adults (N = 132) exhibited cognitive benefits after listening to music. Participants listened to shorter (&amp;amp;asymp;2.5 min) or longer (&amp;amp;asymp;8 min) excerpts from recordings of happy- or sad-sounding music or from a spoken-word recording. Before and after listening, they completed tasks measuring visuospatial working memory (WM), cognitive flexibility and speed, verbal fluency, and mathematical ability, as well as measures of arousal and mood. In general, older adults improved from pre- to post-test on the cognitive tasks. For the test of WM, the increase was greater for participants who heard happy-sounding music compared to those in the other two groups. The happy-sounding group also exhibited larger increases in arousal and mood, although improvements in mood were evident only for the long-duration condition. At the individual level, however, improvements in WM were unrelated to changes in arousal or mood. In short, the results were partially consistent with the arousal and mood hypothesis. For older adults, listening to happy-sounding music may optimize arousal levels and mood, and improve performance on some cognitive tasks (i.e., WM), even though there is no direct link between changes in arousal/mood and changes in WM.</p>

	<p>Conflicts between groups are difficult to resolve, partly because humans tend to be biased in judging outgroup members. The aim of the current article is to review findings on the link between creativity and conflict-related biases and to offer a model that views creative cognition as an ability that may contribute to overcoming conflict-related biases. Our proposed model conforms to the twofold model of creativity. According to this model, creativity involves a generation phase and an evaluation phase, and these phases correspond to the neural mechanisms that underlie conflict-related biases. Specifically, we contend that the generation phase of creativity affects conflict-related biases by exerting an influence on stereotypes and prejudice, outgroup-targeted emotions, and ingroup empathy biases, all of which rely on the default mode network. Conversely, the evaluation phase of creativity, which is usually associated with activation in the executive control network and action-observation system, may be related to herding behaviors. Building on the shared mechanisms of creativity and conflicts, we propose that studies examining creativity-based interventions may be effective in promoting reconciliation.</p>

	<p>This article evaluates an educational experience that uses art to develop empathy. The artistic educational project is called &amp;amp;ldquo;stepping into others&amp;amp;rsquo; shoes&amp;amp;rdquo; and is carried out with 71 students enrolled in the Early Childhood Education and Primary Education degree programs of the University of Vigo. The main objective is to analyze the students&amp;amp;rsquo; experiences in processes of empathic pedagogical relationships that allow empowerment dynamics of oneself and others. An ethnographic approach is used to evaluate the experience through a group case study design with different qualitative instruments: analysis of artistic production, field diary and life stories. The main results indicate that when art is used for the construction of an empathic identity, the participants of these creative dynamics find it difficult to express their feelings and emotions. However, these processes favor social relationships and mutual recognition, as well as self-knowledge. It facilitates the creation of alternative meeting spaces and the promotion of creativity. Based on these results and their discussion, lines of action are suggested which should allow using art as a resource to develop empathy and promote increased motivation in the classroom.</p>

	<p>Dysfunctional brain networks have been found in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, to verify this in a more straightforward way, we investigated the intrinsic organization of brain networks in MDD by leveraging the resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rs-fNIRS). Thirty-four MDD patients (24 females, 38.41 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.14 years old) and thirty healthy controls (22 females, 34.43 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.03 years old) underwent a 10 min rest while their brain activity was recorded via fNIRS. The results showed that MDD patients and healthy controls exhibited similar resting-state functional connectivity. Moreover, the depression group showed lower small-world Lambda (1.12 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.04 vs. 1.16 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.10, p = 0.04) but higher global efficiency (0.51 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.03 vs. 0.48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.05, p = 0.03) than the control group. Importantly, MDD patients, as opposed to healthy controls, showed a significantly lower nodal local efficiency at the left middle occipital gyrus (0.56 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.36 vs. 0.81 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.20, pFDR &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), which predicted the level of depression in MDD (r = 0.45, p = 0.01, R2 = 0.15). In sum, we found a more integrated brain network in MDD patients with a lower nodal local efficiency at the occipital hub, which could predict depressive symptoms.</p>

	<p>The correct use of punctuation marks in secondary-school students is essential for the comprehension of written texts and, therefore, for the students&amp;amp;rsquo; academic success. However, the examination of this issue has often been overlooked in the literature. In the present study, we focused on the progression of comma usage (i.e., a punctuation mark that is often challenging to master) and examined its relation to reading comprehension. A sample of first- and fourth-year secondary-education students from Spain (N = 115) punctuated brief texts in which commas had been previously omitted. The original texts included various types of mandatory commas in Spanish. We also obtained a reading comprehension score from a standardized reading test. Results show that secondary-education students often did not correctly place the commas, with first-year secondary-education students only succeeding in the correct placement of commas 54.5% of the time in (Year 8 in the UK system). This figure increased to 80.9% in fourth-year secondary-education students (Year 11 in the UK system). As a control, this figure rose to 91.5% in first-year university students. Critically, better comprehenders were the ones with better use of punctuation marks (r = 0.33). These results are useful for developing teaching methods to improve writing/reading skills in secondary-school students.</p>

	<p>Background: Drug addiction may play an important role in chronic migraine (CM) with medication-overuse headache (MOH). Psychiatric diseases are associated with CM, but data regarding obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) are lacking. We aimed to establish the prevalence of OCD traits in CM patients with MOH and the impact on onabotulinum toxin A (OBT-A) treatment. Methods: A total of 75 patients with CM and MOH undergoing treatment with OBT-A in our Headache Centre were evaluated. At baseline and after four injection sessions, we assessed the migraine burden and the presence of OCD traits with the Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Inventory&amp;amp;mdash;Revised (OCI-R) test. Results: At baseline, 28% of patients had OCI-R scores compatible with borderline OCD aspects, while 22.7% were pathological. An improvement in headache was significantly associated with an increase in the number of subjects with a normal OCI-R score at T0 and T1, whereas patients with a pathological OCI-R score at T0 showed a significantly higher prevalence of CM at T1. Conclusions: Our data showed a significant rate of OCD traits at baseline, which could strengthen the hypothesis of an addictive disorder underlying CM with MOH. OCD traits seem to influence the OBT-A response. An OCD assessment could be useful in improving patients&amp;amp;rsquo; selections before starting treatments.</p>

	<p>Background: Mapping memory ability is highly correlated with an orienteer&amp;amp;rsquo;s level, and spatial memory tasks of different difficulties can reveal the spatial cognitive characteristics of high-level athletes. Methods: An &amp;amp;ldquo;expert&amp;amp;ndash;novice&amp;amp;rdquo; experimental paradigm was used to monitor behavioral performance and changes in cerebral blood oxygen concentration in orienteering athletes with tasks of different difficulty and cognitive load using functional near-infrared spectroscopic imaging (fNIRS). Results: (1) there was no difference between high-/low-level athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; map recognition and memory abilities in the non-orienteering scenario; (2) with increasing task difficulty, both high-/low-level athletes showed significantly decreasing behavioral performance, reduced correctness, longer reaction time, and strengthened cerebral blood oxygen activation concentration. There was no significant difference in L-DLPFC cerebral oxygen concentration between high-/low-level athletes in the simple map task, and the cerebral oxygen concentration in all brain regions was lower in the expert group than in the novice group in the rest of the task difficulty levels; (3) the correctness rate in the expert group in the complex task was closely related to the activation of the right hemisphere (R-DLPFC, R-VLPFC). Conclusions: Experts have a specific cognitive advantage in map-recognition memory, showing higher task performance and lower cerebral blood oxygen activation; cognitive load constrains map-recognition memory-specific ability and produces different performance effects and brain activation changes on spatial memory processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Conditional Degradation of UNC-31/CAPS Enables Spatiotemporal Analysis of Neuropeptide Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropeptide release from dense-core vesicles in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> is promoted by UNC-31, ortholog of the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS). Loss of UNC-31 causes multiple phenotypes in <I>C. elegans</I> including reduced motility, retention of late-stage eggs, and reduction in evoked synaptic release. However, the ability to analyze UNC-31 function over discrete timescales and in specific neurons is lacking. Here, we generated and validated a tool to enable UNC-31 expression and spatiotemporal functional analysis. We show that endogenously tagged UNC-31 is expressed in major ganglia and nerve cords from late embryonic stages through to adult. Using the auxin-inducible degradation system, we depleted UNC-31 postembryonically from the hermaphrodite nervous system and revealed defects in egg laying, locomotion, and vesicle release that were comparable to those in <I>unc-31</I> null mutant animals. In addition, we found that depleting UNC-31 specifically from the BAG sensory neurons causes increased intestinal fat storage, highlighting the spatial sensitivity of this system. Together, this protein degradation tool may be used to facilitate studies of neuropeptide function at precise cellular and temporal scales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal behavior and physiology is controlled by neuropeptides that are released from specific neuronal sources. The ability to dissect discrete neuropeptide functions requires precise manipulation of neuropeptide release. We have developed and validated a tool that enables precise spatiotemporal regulation of neuropeptide release that will enable researchers to examine neuropeptide function at exceptional resolution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictable Fluctuations in Excitatory Synaptic Strength Due to Natural Variation in Presynaptic Firing Rate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many controlled <I>in vitro</I> studies have demonstrated how postsynaptic responses to presynaptic spikes are not constant but depend on short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) and the detailed timing of presynaptic spikes. However, the effects of short-term plasticity (depression and facilitation) are not limited to short, subsecond timescales. The effects of STP appear on long timescales as changes in presynaptic firing rates lead to changes in steady-state synaptic transmission. Here, we examine the relationship between natural variations in the presynaptic firing rates and spike transmission <I>in vivo</I>. Using large-scale spike recordings in awake male and female mice from the Allen Institute Neuropixels dataset, we first detect putative excitatory synaptic connections based on cross-correlations between the spike trains of millions of pairs of neurons. For the subset of pairs where a transient, excitatory effect was detected, we use a model-based approach to track fluctuations in synaptic efficacy and find that efficacy varies substantially on slow (~1 min) timescales over the course of these recordings. For many connections, the efficacy fluctuations are correlated with fluctuations in the presynaptic firing rate. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, we then model the detailed probability of postsynaptic spiking on a millisecond timescale, including both slow changes in postsynaptic excitability and monosynaptic inputs with short-term plasticity. The detailed model reproduces the slow efficacy fluctuations observed with many putative excitatory connections, suggesting that these fluctuations can be both directly predicted based on the time-varying presynaptic firing rate and, at least partly, explained by the cumulative effects of STP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The firing rates of individual neurons naturally vary because of stimuli, movement, and brain state. Models of synaptic transmission predict that these variations in firing rates should be accompanied by slow fluctuations in synaptic strength because of short-term depression and facilitation. Here, we characterize the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in synaptic strength <I>in vivo</I> using large-scale spike recordings. For putative excitatory connections from a wide range of brain areas, we find that typical synaptic efficacy varies as much as ~70%, and in many cases the fluctuations are well described by models of short-term synaptic plasticity. These results highlight the dynamic nature of <I>in vivo</I> synaptic transmission and the interplay between synaptic strength and firing rates in awake animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Nonsynaptic Transmission Mediates Light Context-Dependent Odor Responses in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent connectome analyses of the entire synaptic circuit in the nervous system have provided tremendous insights into how neural processing occurs through the synaptic relay of neural information. Conversely, the extent to which ephaptic transmission which does not depend on the synapses contributes to the relay of neural information, especially beyond a distance between adjacent neurons and to neural processing remains unclear. We show that ephaptic transmission mediated by extracellular potential changes in female <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> can reach &gt;200 &micro;m, equivalent to the depth of its brain. Furthermore, ephaptic transmission driven by retinal photoreceptor cells mediates light-evoked firing rate increases in olfactory sensory neurons. These results indicate that ephaptic transmission contributes to sensory responses that can change momentarily in a context-dependent manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although extracellular field potential activities are commonly observed in many nervous systems, this activity has been generally considered as a side effect of synchronized spiking of neurons. This study, however, shows that field potential changes in retinae evoked by a sensory stimulus can control the excitability of distant neurons <I>in vivo</I> and mediates multimodal sensory integration in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>. As such ephaptic transmission is more effective at a short distance, the ephaptic transmission from the retinae may contribute significantly to firing rate changes in downstream neurons of the photoreceptor cells in the optic lobe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Variability of the Surface Area of the V1, V2, and V3 Maps in a Large Sample of Human Observers</a></h4>

              
                <p>How variable is the functionally defined structure of early visual areas in human cortex and how much variability is shared between twins? Here we quantify individual differences in the best understood functionally defined regions of cortex: V1, V2, V3. The Human Connectome Project 7T Retinotopy Dataset includes retinotopic measurements from 181 subjects (109 female, 72 male), including many twins. We trained four "anatomists" to manually define V1-V3 using retinotopic features. These definitions were more accurate than automated anatomical templates and showed that surface areas for these maps varied more than threefold across individuals. This threefold variation was little changed when normalizing visual area size by the surface area of the entire cerebral cortex. In addition to varying in size, we find that visual areas vary in how they sample the visual field. Specifically, the cortical magnification function differed substantially among individuals, with the relative amount of cortex devoted to central vision varying by more than a factor of 2. To complement the variability analysis, we examined the similarity of visual area size and structure across twins. Whereas the twin sample sizes are too small to make precise heritability estimates (50 monozygotic pairs, 34 dizygotic pairs), they nonetheless reveal high correlations, consistent with strong effects of the combination of shared genes and environment on visual area size. Collectively, these results provide the most comprehensive account of individual variability in visual area structure to date, and provide a robust population benchmark against which new individuals and developmental and clinical populations can be compared.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Areas V1, V2, and V3 are among the best studied functionally defined regions in human cortex. Using the largest retinotopy dataset to date, we characterized the variability of these regions across individuals and the similarity between twin pairs. We find that the size of visual areas varies dramatically (up to 3.5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>) across healthy young adults, far more than the variability of the cerebral cortex size as a whole. Much of this variability appears to arise from inherited factors, as we find very high correlations in visual area size between monozygotic twin pairs, and lower but still substantial correlations between dizygotic twin pairs. These results provide the most comprehensive assessment of how functionally defined visual cortex varies across the population to date.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tunable Action Potential Repolarization Governed by Kv3.4 Channels in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Kv3.4 channel regulates action potential (AP) repolarization in nociceptors and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord. We hypothesize that this is a tunable role governed by protein kinase-C-dependent phosphorylation of the Kv3.4 cytoplasmic N-terminal inactivation domain (NTID) at four nonequivalent sites. However, there is a paucity of causation evidence linking the phosphorylation status of Kv3.4 to the properties of the AP. To establish this link, we used adeno-associated viral vectors to specifically manipulate the expression and the effective phosphorylation status of Kv3.4 in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from mixed-sex rat embryos at embryonic day 18. These vectors encoded GFP (background control), wild-type (WT) Kv3.4, phosphonull (PN) Kv3.4 mutant (PN = S[8,9,15,21]A), phosphomimic (PM) Kv3.4 mutant (PM = S[8,9,15,21]D), and a Kv3.4 nonconducting dominant-negative (DN) pore mutant (DN = W429F). Following viral infection of the DRG neurons, we evaluated transduction efficiency and Kv3.4 expression and function via fluorescence microscopy and patch clamping. All functional Kv3.4 constructs induced current overexpression with similar voltage dependence of activation. However, whereas Kv3.4-WT and Kv3.4-PN induced fast transient currents, the Kv3.4-PM induced currents exhibiting impaired inactivation. In contrast, the Kv3.4-DN abolished the endogenous Kv3.4 current. Consequently, Kv3.4-DN and Kv3.4-PM produced APs with the longest and shortest durations, respectively, whereas Kv3.4-WT and Kv3.4-PN produced intermediate results. Moreover, the AP widths and maximum rates of AP repolarization from these groups are negatively correlated. We conclude that the expression and effective phosphorylation status of the Kv3.4 NTID confer a tunable mechanism of AP repolarization, which may provide exquisite regulation of pain signaling in DRG neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The AP is an all-or-none millisecond-long electrical impulse that encodes information in the frequency and patterns of repetitive firing. However, signaling may also depend on the plasticity and diversity of the AP waveform. For instance, the shape and duration of the AP may regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission between a primary sensory afferent to a secondary neuron in the spinal cord. Here, we used mutants of the Kv3.4 voltage-gated potassium channel to manipulate its expression and effective phosphorylation status in dorsal root ganglion neurons and directly show how the expression and malleable inactivation properties of Kv3.4 govern the AP duration and repolarization rate. These results elucidate a mechanism of neural AP plasticity that may regulate pain signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Active Licking Shapes Cortical Taste Coding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) represent taste through time-varying changes in their spiking activity. The predominant view is that the neural firing rate represents the sole unit of taste information. It is currently not known whether the phase of spikes relative to lick timing is used by GC neurons for taste encoding. To address this question, we recorded spiking activity from &gt;500 single GC neurons in male and female mice permitted to freely lick to receive four liquid gustatory stimuli and water. We developed a set of data analysis tools to determine the ability of GC neurons to discriminate gustatory information and then to quantify the degree to which this information exists in the spike rate versus the spike timing or phase relative to licks. These tools include machine learning algorithms for classification of spike trains and methods from geometric shape and functional data analysis. Our results show that while GC neurons primarily encode taste information using a rate code, the timing of spikes is also an important factor in taste discrimination. A further finding is that taste discrimination using spike timing is improved when the timing of licks is considered in the analysis. That is, the interlick phase of spiking provides more information than the absolute spike timing itself. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the ability of GC neurons to distinguish among tastes is best when spike rate and timing is interpreted relative to the timing of licks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons represent information from the outside world via changes in their number of action potentials (spikes) over time. This study examines how neurons in the mouse gustatory cortex (GC) encode taste information when gustatory stimuli are experienced through the active process of licking. We use electrophysiological recordings and data analysis tools to evaluate the ability of GC neurons to distinguish tastants and then to quantify the degree to which this information exists in the spike rate versus the spike timing relative to licks. We show that the neuron's ability to distinguish between tastes is higher when spike rate and timing are interpreted relative to the timing of licks, indicating that the lick cycle is a key factor for taste processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Subcellular Distribution and Release Dynamics of Cotransmitted Cholinergic and GABAergic Synaptic Inputs Modify Dopaminergic Neuronal Excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>We identified three types of monosynaptic cholinergic inputs spatially arranged onto medial substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons in male and female mice: cotransmitted acetylcholine (ACh)/GABA, GABA-only, and ACh only. There was a predominant GABA-only conductance along lateral dendrites and soma-centered ACh/GABA cotransmission. In response to repeated stimulation, the GABA conductance found on lateral dendrites decremented less than the proximally located GABA conductance, and was more effective at inhibiting action potentials. While soma-localized ACh/GABA cotransmission showed depression of the GABA component with repeated stimulation, ACh-mediated nicotinic responses were largely maintained. We investigated whether this differential change in inhibitory/excitatory inputs leads to altered neuronal excitability. We found that a depolarizing current or glutamate preceded by cotransmitted ACh/GABA was more effective in eliciting an action potential compared with current, glutamate, or ACh/GABA alone. This enhanced excitability was abolished with nicotinic receptor inhibitors, and modulated by T- and L-type calcium channels, thus establishing that activity of multiple classes of ion channels integrates to shape neuronal excitability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our laboratory has previously discovered a population of substantia nigra dopaminegic neurons (DA) that receive cotransmitted ACh and GABA. This study used subcellular optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic presynaptic terminals to map the functional ACh and GABA synaptic inputs across the somatodendritic extent of substantia nigra DA neurons. We determined spatially clustered GABA-only inputs on the lateral dendrites while cotransmitted ACh and GABA clustered close to the soma. We have shown that the action of GABA and ACh in cotransmission spatially clustered near the soma play a critical role in enhancing glutamate-mediated neuronal excitability through the activation of T- and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.</p>
