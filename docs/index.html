	<p>Slowed information processing speed (IPS) is the hallmark and first cognitive domain to be altered in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Insufficient serum vitamin D was previously associated with disease development, relapses, and progression, but little is reported on cognition. However, vitamin D and cognitive impairment (CI) in other neurodegenerative diseases have already been linked. We explored the possible correlation between vitamin D and IPS at diagnosis and early disability at last follow-up in 81 MS patients. At diagnosis, we collected vitamin D levels and performed a Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Raw scores were adjusted for age, gender, and educational level. Early disability was evaluated with MS severity score (MSSS) and age-related MSSS (ARMSS). A total of 71 patients (86.58%) showed hypovitaminosis D (19.71 ± 8.76 ng/mL) and 18 patients (21.95%) had CI. Patients with CI showed severe hypovitaminosis D (p = 0.004). No patients with sufficient vitamin D levels had CI. We found a positive correlation between vitamin D levels at diagnosis and (1) SDMT raw and z-score that persisted after correction for sunlight exposure and MRI baseline characteristics, and (2) EDSS, MSSS, and ARMSS after a mean 2 year follow-up. Low vitamin D levels may affect both cognition and early disability in newly diagnosed MS patients.</p>

	<p>The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep have been widely documented, but longitudinal evaluations during different phases of the “COVID-19 era” are needed to disentangle the specific consequences of the r145estrictive measures on sleep variables. The aim of this study was to assess the immediate effect of the lockdown’s end on sleep and sleep-related dimensions in an Italian sample, also considering the stress and depressive symptoms. We used an online survey to longitudinally collect data on sociodemographic, environmental, clinical, sleep, and sleep-related variables in two time points: during and immediately after the lockdown. The final sample included 102 participants. The large prevalence of poor sleep quality, clinically relevant pre-sleep arousal, and depressive symptoms, as well as poor sleep quality and pre-sleep arousal score observed during the lockdown, remained stable after its end. On the other hand, the prevalence of moderate-to-severe event-related stress and intrusive symptom scores exhibited a drastic reduction after the end of home confinement. Both bedtime and rise time were anticipated after the lockdown, while sleep quality exhibited only a trend of post-lockdown sleep disturbance reduction. Our findings point to a reduced stress level (specific for the intrusive symptomatology) after the end of the lockdown and persistence of sleep problems, suggesting two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (a) the strict restrictive measures are not the main cause of sleep problems during the pandemic and (b) home confinement induces long-lasting effects on sleep observable after its end, and a longer period of time might be needed to observe an improvement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of strengthening exercise plus activities of daily living instructions in reducing pain in patients with lumbar disc herniation: a randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of chronic low back pain (CLBP) with sciatica. The exercise intervention was found effective in improving CLBP, although a paucity of research evaluated the effectiveness of exercise intervention to alleviate CLBP due to LDH. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of back and hip strengthening exercises and activities of daily living instructions (ADLIs) to improve CLBP with sciatica due to LDH. Method: This assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted on 70 patients with CLBP with sciatica due to LDH. The patients were randomly allocated either in the intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). Patients in IG received both back and hip strengthening exercises five days a week for six weeks. Patients in CG received pharmacological therapy for three weeks, followed by hot moist compression for another three weeks. Patients of both groups followed the ADLIs at the time of the intervention and at least three months after the intervention. Back pain intensity and perceived pain due to sciatica were measured by the Visual Analogue Scale and range of hip flexion during the Straight Leg Raising Test, respectively, at three weeks and six weeks of intervention, and three months after the intervention. Results: Back pain and sciatica improved significantly (p < 0.05) in both groups at the end of the intervention and follow-up, while the IG showed significantly better improvements (p < 0.05) at the end of the intervention. However, only ADLIs were not adequate to sustain the improvements after the intervention. Conclusion: The combination of back and hip strengthening exercises and ADLIs improves CLBP with sciatica due to LDH. Nevertheless, it is required to instruct patients to follow ADLIs and perform strengthening exercises regularly to maintain the improvements. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05021718.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq of TMA46 (DFRP1) and GIR2 (DFRP2) knockout yeast strains [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotes, stalled and collided ribosomes are recognized by several conserved multicomponent systems, which either block protein synthesis in situ and resolve the collision locally, or trigger a general stress response. Yeast ribosome-binding GTPases RBG1 (DRG1 in mammals) and RBG2 (DRG2) form two distinct heterodimers with TMA46 (DFRP1) and GIR2 (DFRP2), respectively, both involved in mRNA translation. Accumulated evidence suggests that the dimers play partially redundant roles in elongation processivity and resolution of ribosome stalling and collision events, as well as in the regulation of GCN1-mediated signaling involved in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). They also genetically interact with SLH1 (ASCC3) helicase, a key component of RQC trigger (RQT) complex disassembling collided ribosomes. Here, we present RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) data from S. cerevisiae strains with individual deletions of the TMA46 and GIR2 genes. Raw RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq data as well as gene-level read counts are available in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under GEO accession GSE185458 and GSE185286.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of cogon grass root ethanol extract on fatty acid binding protein 4 and oxidative stress markers in a sepsis mouse model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sepsis causes several immunological and metabolic alterations that induce oxidative stress. The modulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) has been shown to worsen this condition. Extract of cogon grass root (ECGR) contains flavonoids and isoeugenol compounds that exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to assess the effects of ECGR on FABP4 and oxidative stress–related factors in a sepsis mouse model. Methods: Twenty-nine male mice (Mus musculus) of the Deutsche Denken Yoken strain were divided into four groups: group 1, control; group 2, mice treated with 10 μL/kg body weight (BW) lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and groups 3 and 4, mice pre-treated with 90 and 115 mg/kg BW, respectively, and then treated with 10 μL/kg BW LPS for 14 d. Blood, liver, spleen, and cardiac tissue samples were collected and subjected to histological and complete blood examinations. Antioxidant activity, FABP4 levels, and immune system-associated biomarker levels were also measured. Results: Significant increases in platelet levels (p = 0.03), cardiomyocyte counts (p =0.004), and hepatocyte counts (p = 0.0004) were observed in group 4 compared with those in group 2. Conversely, compared with those in group 2, there were significant decreases in TNF-α expression in group 3 (p = 0.004), white pulp length and width in group 4 (p = 0.001), FABP4 levels in groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.012, respectively), lymphocyte counts in group 4 (p = 0.009), monocyte counts (p = 0.000) and polymorphonuclear cell counts in the livers (p = 0.000) and hearts (p = 0.000) of groups 3 and 4. Gpx3 activity was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Cogon grass root may aid in the development of herbal medicines and specific treatments for sepsis.

                Background: The study's objective was to compare whether there are differences in the perception of undergraduate and postgraduate students about the pedagogy of success.   Methods: This is non-experimental research with a comparative descriptive design, and a hypothetical deductive method was used. The perception of success pedagogy questionnaire was applied as a data collection technique with a sample of 50 university students with 23 items based on three dimensions: opportunity to learn (nine items), feedback (eight items), and consideration of the person (six items), with the following qualitative value scale, always = high, sometimes = middle, and never = low; the scale of quantitative value was from two to zero. To find the instrument's validity, it was subjected to expert judgment, calculating the content validity ratio for each item and considering the criteria of clarity and relevance. The instrument's reliability was determined using Cronbach's alpha, which found a high consistency between the items. For the questionnaire application, Google Forms was used to obtain fast, timely, and reliable answers. The data were processed through the SPSS V. 25.   Results: The pedagogical support of the postgraduate teacher is more effective than that of the undergraduate. The undergraduate teacher stands out for listening and being more empathic. Didactics is crucial for students to develop their cognitive and human potential. Academic success is related to the teacher's pedagogical skills and the student's motivation. In addition, teachers and students can develop cognitive skills through effective communication and socialization. Finally, the affective dimension allows students to achieve personal and professional goals.  Conclusions: There are significant differences in the perception of the pedagogy of success among undergraduate and postgraduate university students; therefore, the application of this methodology is more promoted towards postgraduate students than to their undergraduate peers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A nowcasting framework for correcting for reporting delays in malaria surveillance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tigist F. Menkir, Horace Cox, Canelle Poirier, Melanie Saul, Sharon Jones-Weekes, Collette Clementson, Pablo M. de Salazar, Mauricio Santillana, Caroline O. Buckee</p>

Time lags in reporting to national surveillance systems represent a major barrier for the control of infectious diseases, preventing timely decision making and resource allocation. This issue is particularly acute for infectious diseases like malaria, which often impact rural and remote communities the hardest. In Guyana, a country located in South America, poor connectivity among remote malaria-endemic regions hampers surveillance efforts, making reporting delays a key challenge for elimination. Here, we analyze 13 years of malaria surveillance data, identifying key correlates of time lags between clinical cases occurring and being added to the central data system. We develop nowcasting methods that use historical patterns of reporting delays to estimate occurred-but-not-reported monthly malaria cases. To assess their performance, we implemented them retrospectively, using only information that would have been available at the time of estimation, and found that they substantially enhanced the estimates of malaria cases. Specifically, we found that the best performing models achieved up to two-fold improvements in accuracy (or error reduction) over known cases in selected regions. Our approach provides a simple, generalizable tool to improve malaria surveillance in endemic countries and is currently being implemented to help guide existing resource allocation and elimination efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multivariable association discovery in population-scale meta-omics studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Himel Mallick, Ali Rahnavard, Lauren J. McIver, Siyuan Ma, Yancong Zhang, Long H. Nguyen, Timothy L. Tickle, George Weingart, Boyu Ren, Emma H.

It is challenging to associate features such as human health outcomes, diet, environmental conditions, or other metadata to microbial community measurements, due in part to their quantitative properties. Microbiome multi-omics are typically noisy, sparse (zero-inflated), high-dimensional, extremely non-normal, and often in the form of count or compositional measurements. Here we introduce an optimized combination of novel and established methodology to assess multivariable association of microbial community features with complex metadata in population-scale observational studies. Our approach, MaAsLin 2 (Microbiome Multivariable Associations with Linear Models), uses generalized linear and mixed models to accommodate a wide variety of modern epidemiological studies, including cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as a variety of data types (e.g., counts and relative abundances) with or without covariates and repeated measurements. To construct this method, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of a broad range of scenarios under which straightforward identification of meta-omics associations can be challenging. These simulation studies reveal that MaAsLin 2’s linear model preserves statistical power in the presence of repeated measures and multiple covariates, while accounting for the nuances of meta-omics features and controlling false discovery. We also applied MaAsLin 2 to a microbial multi-omics dataset from the Integrative Human Microbiome (HMP2) project which, in addition to reproducing established results, revealed a unique, integrated landscape of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) across multiple time points and omics profiles.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Systematic exploration of Escherichia coli phage–host interactions with the BASEL phage collection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Enea Maffei, Aisylu Shaidullina, Marco Burkolter, Yannik Heyer, Fabienne Estermann, Valentin Druelle, Patrick Sauer, Luc Willi, Sarah Michaelis, Hubert Hilbi, David S. Thaler, Alexander Harms</p>

Bacteriophages, the viruses infecting bacteria, hold great potential for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and other applications due to their unparalleled diversity and recent breakthroughs in their genetic engineering. However, fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying phage–host interactions is mostly confined to a few traditional model systems and did not keep pace with the recent massive expansion of the field. The true potential of molecular biology encoded by these viruses has therefore remained largely untapped, and phages for therapy or other applications are often still selected empirically. We therefore sought to promote a systematic exploration of phage–host interactions by composing a well-assorted library of 68 newly isolated phages infecting the model organism <i>Escherichia coli</i> that we share with the community as the BASEL (BActeriophage SElection for your Laboratory) collection. This collection is largely representative of natural <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> phage diversity and was intensively characterized phenotypically and genomically alongside 10 well-studied traditional model phages. We experimentally determined essential host receptors of all phages, quantified their sensitivity to 11 defense systems across different layers of bacterial immunity, and matched these results to the phages’ host range across a panel of pathogenic enterobacterial strains. Clear patterns in the distribution of phage phenotypes and genomic features highlighted systematic differences in the potency of different immunity systems and suggested the molecular basis of receptor specificity in several phage groups. Our results also indicate strong trade-offs between fitness traits like broad host recognition and resistance to bacterial immunity that might drive the divergent adaptation of different phage groups to specific ecological niches. We envision that the BASEL collection will inspire future work exploring the biology of bacteriophages and their hosts by facilitating the discovery of underlying molecular mechanisms as the basis for an effective translation into biotechnology or therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The economics of managing evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Troy Day, David A. Kennedy, Andrew F. Read, David McAdams</p>

Humans are altering biological systems at unprecedented rates, and these alterations often have longer-term evolutionary impacts. Most obvious is the spread of resistance to pesticides and antibiotics. There are a wide variety of management strategies available to slow this evolution, and there are many reasons for using them. In this paper, we focus on the economic aspects of evolution management and ask: When is it economically beneficial for an individual decision-maker to invest in evolution management? We derive a simple dimensionless inequality showing that it is cost-effective to manage evolution when the percentage increase in the effective life span of the biological resource that management generates is larger than the percentage increase in annual profit that could be obtained by not managing evolution. We show how this inequality can be used to determine optimal investment choices for single decision-makers, to determine Nash equilibrium investment choices for multiple interacting decision-makers, and to examine how these equilibrium choices respond to regulatory interventions aimed at stimulating investment in evolution management. Our results are illustrated with examples involving <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) crops and antibiotic use in fish farming.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Germline loss-of-function mutations in <i>DEPDC5</i>, and in its binding partners (<i>NPRL2/3</i>) of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) repressor GATOR1 complex, cause focal epilepsies and increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Here, we asked whether <i>DEPDC5</i> haploinsufficiency predisposes to primary cardiac defects that could contribute to SUDEP and therefore impact the clinical management of patients at high risk of SUDEP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical cardiac investigations were performed in 16 patients with pathogenic variants in <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>NPRL2</i>, or <i>NPRL3</i>. Two novel <i>Depdc5</i> mouse strains, a human HA-tagged <i>Depdc5</i> strain and a <i>Depdc5</i> heterozygous knockout with a neuron-specific deletion of the second allele (<i>Depdc5</i>
<sup>c/−</sup>), were generated to investigate the role of <i>Depdc5</i> in SUDEP and cardiac activity during seizures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Holter, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic (ECG) examinations provided no evidence for altered clinical cardiac function in the patient cohort, of whom 3 <i>DEPDC5</i> patients succumbed to SUDEP and 6 had a family history of SUDEP. There was no cardiac injury at autopsy in a postmortem <i>DEPDC5</i> SUDEP case. The HA-tagged <i>Depdc5</i> mouse revealed expression of <i>Depdc5</i> in the brain, heart, and lungs. Simultaneous electroencephalographic–ECG records on <i>Depdc5</i>
<sup>c/−</sup> mice showed that spontaneous epileptic seizures resulting in a SUDEP-like event are not preceded by cardiac arrhythmia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mouse and human data show neither structural nor functional cardiac damage that might underlie a primary contribution to SUDEP in the spectrum of <i>DEPDC5</i>-related epilepsies. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">target: an R package to predict combined function of transcription factors [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. Similarly, they use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the transcription factor overexpression or knockdown on its targets. Therefore, the integration of the binding and expression data can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. Here, we implemented the binding and expression target analysis (BETA) in an R/Bioconductor package. This algorithm ranks the targets based on the distances of their assigned peaks from the transcription factor ChIP experiment and the signed statistics from gene expression profiling with transcription factor perturbation. We further extend BETA to integrate two sets of data from two transcription factors to predict their targets and their combined functions. In this article, we briefly describe the workings of the algorithm and provide a workflow with a real dataset for using it. The gene targets and the aggregate functions of transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells were identified. Using the same datasets, we identified the shared targets of the two transcription factors, which were found to be, on average, more cooperatively regulated.

                Inactivation experiments in auditory cortex (AC) produce widely varying results that complicate interpretations regarding the precise role of AC in auditory perception and ensuing behaviour. The advent of optogenetic methods in neuroscience offers previously unachievable insight into the mechanisms transforming brain activity into behaviour. With a view to aiding the design and interpretation of future studies in and outside AC, here we discuss the methodological challenges faced in manipulating neural activity.

The N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat3 plays an essential role in autophagy by modifying actin cytoskeleton constituent Act1 and dynamin-like GTPase Vps1, which regulate the upstream transport of Atg9 vesicles and downstream fusion of autophagosomes with vacuoles.

                Samper-Martín et al. show that polyphosphate, a chain of orthophosphates, plays an essential role in oxidative stress response in human cells. In addition, they identify the human Nudt3 as a polyphosphate hydrolase, opening the door to modifying polyphosphate content, a tool to advance understanding of mammalian polyphosphate metabolism.

                Kim et al. show that, during development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), TM4SF5 mediates crosstalk between hepatocytes and macrophages to remodel the inflammatory environment. TM4SF5-dependent communication involves hepatic CCL20/CXCL10 and macrophagic IL-6 secretion, resulting in activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages that could be chronically reprogrammed to be pro-fibrotic for NAFLD progression.

                Oxidized phospholipids have diverse biological activities, many of which can be pathological, yet how they are inactivated in vivo is not fully understood. Here, we present evidence that a highly conserved host lipase, acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), can play a significant role in reducing the pro-inflammatory activities of two prominent products of phospholipid oxidation, 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. AOAH removed the sn-2 and sn-1 acyl chains from both lipids and reduced their ability to induce macrophage inflammasome activation and cell death in vitro and acute lung injury in mice. In addition to transforming Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide from stimulus to inhibitor, its most studied activity, AOAH can inactivate these important danger-associated molecular pattern molecules and reduce tissue inflammation and injury.

                Uveitis describes a heterogeneous group of inflammatory eye diseases characterized by infiltration of leukocytes into the uveal tissues. Uveitis associated with the HLA haplotype B27 (HLA-B27) is a common subtype of uveitis and a prototypical ocular immune-mediated disease. Local immune mechanisms driving human uveitis are poorly characterized mainly due to the limited available biomaterial and subsequent technical limitations. Here, we provide the first high-resolution characterization of intraocular leukocytes in HLA-B27-positive (n = 4) and -negative (n = 2) anterior uveitis and an infectious endophthalmitis control (n = 1) by combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with flow cytometry and protein analysis. Ocular cell infiltrates consisted primarily of lymphocytes in both subtypes of uveitis and of myeloid cells in infectious endophthalmitis. HLA-B27-positive uveitis exclusively featured a plasmacytoid and classical dendritic cell (cDC) infiltrate. Moreover, cDCs were central in predicted local cell-cell communication. This suggests a unique pattern of ocular leukocyte infiltration in HLA-B27-positive uveitis with relevance to DCs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microtubules regulate pancreatic β cell heterogeneity via spatiotemporal control of insulin secretion hot spots</a></h4>

              
                Heterogeneity of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic islets is physiologically important but poorly understood. Here, we utilize mouse islets to determine how microtubules affect secretion toward the vascular extracellular matrix at single cell and subcellular levels. Our data indicate that microtubule stability in the β-cell population is heterogenous, and that GSIS is suppressed in cells with highly stable microtubules. Consistently, microtubule hyper-stabilization prevents, and microtubule depolymerization promotes capacity of single β-cell for GSIS. Analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of secretion events shows that microtubule depolymerization activates otherwise dormant β-cells via initiation of secretion clusters (hot spots). Microtubule depolymerization also enhances secretion from individual cells, introducing both additional clusters and scattered events. Interestingly, without microtubules, the timing of clustered secretion is dysregulated, extending the first phase of GSIS and causing oversecretion. In contrast, glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was not affected by microtubule depolymerization yet required for secretion under these conditions, indicating that microtubule-dependent regulation of secretion hot spots acts in parallel with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Our findings uncover a novel microtubule function in tuning insulin secretion hot spots, which leads to accurately measured and timed response to glucose stimuli and promotes functional β-cell heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Maturation of persistent and hyperpolarization-activated inward currents shapes the differential activation of motoneuron subtypes during postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                The size principle underlies the orderly recruitment of motor units; however, motoneuron size is a poor predictor of recruitment amongst functionally defined motoneuron subtypes. Whilst intrinsic properties are key regulators of motoneuron recruitment, the underlying currents involved are not well defined. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology was deployed to study intrinsic properties, and the underlying currents, that contribute to the differential activation of delayed and immediate firing motoneuron subtypes. Motoneurons were studied during the first three postnatal weeks in mice to identify key properties that contribute to rheobase and may be important to establish orderly recruitment. We find that delayed and immediate firing motoneurons are functionally homogeneous during the first postnatal week and are activated based on size, irrespective of subtype. The rheobase of motoneuron subtypes become staggered during the second postnatal week, which coincides with the differential maturation of passive and active properties, particularly persistent inward currents. Rheobase of delayed firing motoneurons increases further in the third postnatal week due to the development of a prominent resting hyperpolarization-activated inward current. Our results suggest that motoneuron recruitment is multifactorial, with recruitment order established during postnatal development through the differential maturation of passive properties and sequential integration of persistent and hyperpolarization-activated inward currents.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) cooperates with estrogen receptor α (ERα) in the regulation of estrogen action in breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a key regulator of transcriptional responses to proteotoxic stress, was linked to estrogen (E2) signaling through estrogen receptor α (ERα). We found that an HSF1 deficiency may decrease ERα level, attenuate the mitogenic action of E2, counteract E2-stimulated cell scattering, and reduce adhesion to collagens and cell motility in ER-positive breast cancer cells. The stimulatory effect of E2 on the transcriptome is largely weaker in HSF1-deficient cells, in part due to the higher basal expression of E2-dependent genes, which correlates with the enhanced binding of unliganded ERα to chromatin in such cells. HSF1 and ERα can cooperate directly in E2-stimulated regulation of transcription, and HSF1 potentiates the action of ERα through a mechanism involving chromatin reorganization. Furthermore, HSF1 deficiency may increase the sensitivity to hormonal therapy (4-hydroxytamoxifen) or CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib). Analyses of data from the TCGA database indicate that HSF1 increases the transcriptome disparity in ER-positive breast cancer and can enhance the genomic action of ERα. Moreover, only in ER-positive cancers, an elevated <i>HSF1</i> level is associated with metastatic disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional diversification gave rise to allelic specialization in a rice NLR immune receptor pair</a></h4>

              
                Cooperation between receptors from the NLR superfamily is important for intracellular activation of immune responses. NLRs can function in pairs that, upon pathogen recognition, trigger hypersensitive cell death and stop pathogen invasion. Natural selection drives specialization of host immune receptors towards an optimal response, whilst keeping a tight regulation of immunity in the absence of pathogens. However, the molecular basis of co-adaptation and specialization between paired NLRs remains largely unknown. Here, we describe functional specialization in alleles of the rice NLR pair Pik that confers resistance to strains of the blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> harbouring AVR-Pik effectors. We revealed that matching pairs of allelic Pik NLRs mount effective immune responses whereas mismatched pairs lead to autoimmune phenotypes, a hallmark of hybrid necrosis in both natural and domesticated plant populations. We further showed that allelic specialization is largely underpinned by a single amino acid polymorphism that determines preferential association between matching pairs of Pik NLRs. These results provide a framework for how functionally linked immune receptors undergo co-adaptation to provide an effective and regulated immune response against pathogens. Understanding the molecular constraints that shape paired NLR evolution has implications beyond plant immunity given that hybrid necrosis can drive reproductive isolation.

                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells into biofluids and hold great promise as reservoirs of disease biomarkers. One of the main challenges in studying EVs is a lack of methods to quantify EVs that are sensitive enough and can differentiate EVs from similarly sized lipoproteins and protein aggregates. We demonstrate the use of ultrasensitive, single molecule array (Simoa) assays for the quantification of EVs using three widely expressed transmembrane proteins: the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81. Using Simoa to measure these three EV markers, as well as albumin to measure protein contamination, we were able to compare the relative efficiency and purity of several commonly used EV isolation methods in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): ultracentrifugation, precipitation, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We further used these assays, all on one platform, to improve SEC isolation from plasma and CSF. Our results highlight the utility of quantifying EV proteins using Simoa and provide a rapid framework for comparing and improving EV isolation methods from biofluids.

                Gene expression fundamentally shapes the structural and functional architecture of the human brain. Open-access transcriptomic datasets like the Allen Human Brain Atlas provide an unprecedented ability to examine these mechanisms in vivo; however, a lack of standardization across research groups has given rise to myriad processing pipelines for using these data. Here, we develop the abagen toolbox, an open-access software package for working with transcriptomic data, and use it to examine how methodological variability influences the outcomes of research using the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Applying three prototypical analyses to the outputs of 750,000 unique processing pipelines, we find that choice of pipeline has a large impact on research findings, with parameters commonly varied in the literature influencing correlations between derived gene expression and other imaging phenotypes by as much as <i>p </i>≥ 1:0. Our results further reveal an ordering of parameter importance, with processing steps that influence gene normalization yielding the greatest impact on downstream statistical inferences and conclusions. The presented work and the development of the abagen toolbox lay the foundation for more standardized and systematic research in imaging transcriptomics, and will help to advance future understanding of the influence of gene expression in the human brain.

                Influenza pandemics pose public health threats annually for lacking vaccine which provides cross-protection against novel and emerging influenza viruses. Combining conserved antigens that induce cross-protective antibody responses with epitopes that activate cross-protective T cell responses might be an attractive strategy for developing a universal vaccine. In this study, we constructed a recombinant protein named NMHC which consist of influenza viral conserved epitopes and a superantigen fragment. NMHC promoted the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to differentiate into Th1, Th2, and Th17 subtypes. Mice vaccinated with NMHC produced high levels of immunoglobulins that cross-bound to HA fragments from six influenza virus subtypes with high antibody titers. Anti-NMHC serum showed potent hemagglutinin inhibition effects to highly divergent group 1 (H1 subtype) and group 2 (H3 subtype) influenza virus strains. Furthermore, purified anti-NMHC antibodies bound to multiple HAs with high affinities. NMHC vaccination effectively protected mice from infection and lung damage when exposed to two subtypes of H1N1 influenza virus. Moreover, NMHC vaccination elicited CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that cleared the virus from infected tissues and prevented virus spread. In conclusion, this study provides proof of concept that NMHC vaccination triggers B and T cell immune responses against multiple influenza virus infections. Therefore, NMHC might be a candidate universal broad-spectrum vaccine for the prevention and treatment of multiple influenza viruses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differential adhesion regulates neurite placement via a retrograde zippering mechanism</a></h4>

              
                During development, neurites and synapses segregate into specific neighborhoods or layers within nerve bundles. The developmental programs guiding placement of neurites in specific layers, and hence their incorporation into specific circuits, are not well understood. We implement novel imaging methods and quantitative models to document the embryonic development of the <i>C. elegans </i>brain neuropil<i>,</i> and discover that differential adhesion mechanisms control precise placement of single neurites onto specific layers. Differential adhesion is orchestrated via developmentally-regulated expression of the IgCAM SYG-1, and its partner ligand SYG-2. Changes in SYG-1 expression across neuropil layers result in changes in adhesive forces, which sort SYG-2-expressing neurons. Sorting to layers occurs, not via outgrowth from the neurite tip, but via an alternate mechanism of retrograde zippering, involving interactions between neurite shafts. Our study indicates that biophysical principles from differential adhesion govern neurite placement and synaptic specificity <i>in vivo</i> in developing neuropil bundles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Wings and halteres act as coupled dual-oscillators in flies</a></h4>

              
                The mechanics of Dipteran thorax is dictated by a network of exoskeletal linkages which, when deformed by the flight muscles, generate coordinated wing movements. In Diptera, the forewings power flight, whereas the hindwings have evolved into specialized structures called halteres which provide rapid mechanosensory feedback for flight stabilization. Although actuated by independent muscles, wing and haltere motion is precisely phase-coordinated at high frequencies. Because wingbeat frequency is a product of wing-thorax resonance, any wear-and-tear of wings or thorax should impair flight ability. How robust is the Dipteran flight system against such perturbations? Here, we show that wings and halteres are independently-driven, coupled oscillators. We systematically reduced the wing length in flies and observed how wing-haltere synchronization was affected. The wing-wing system is a strongly-coupled oscillator, whereas the wing-haltere system is weakly-coupled through mechanical linkages which synchronize phase and frequency. Wing-haltere link acts in a unidirectional manner; altering wingbeat frequency affects haltere frequency, but not vice-versa. Exoskeletal linkages are thus key morphological features of the Dipteran thorax which ensure wing-haltere synchrony, despite severe wing damage.

                Adiponectin-mediated pathways contribute to mammalian homeostasis; however, little is known about adiponectin and adiponectin receptor signaling in arthropods. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Ixodes scapularis</i> ticks have an adiponectin receptor-like protein (ISARL) but lack adiponectin - suggesting activation by alternative pathways. <i>ISARL</i> expression is significantly upregulated in the tick gut after <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> infection suggesting that ISARL-signaling may be co-opted by the Lyme disease agent. Consistent with this, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of <i>ISARL</i> significantly reduced the <i>B. burgdorferi</i> burden in the tick. RNA-seq-based transcriptomics and RNAi assays demonstrate that ISARL-mediated phospholipid metabolism by phosphatidylserine synthase I is associated with <i>B. burgdorferi</i> survival. Furthermore, the tick complement C1q-like protein 3 interacts with ISARL, and <i>B. burgdorferi</i> facilitates this process. This study identifies a new tick metabolic pathway that is connected to the life cycle of the Lyme disease spirochete.

                The iris controls the level of retinal illumination by controlling pupil diameter. It is a site of diverse ophthalmologic diseases and it is a potential source of cells for ocular auto-transplantation. The present study provides foundational data on the mouse iris based on single nucleus RNA sequencing. More specifically, this work has (1) defined all of the major cell types in the mouse iris and ciliary body, (2) led to the discovery of two types of iris stromal cells and two types of iris sphincter cells, (3) revealed the differences in cell type-specific transcriptomes in the resting vs. dilated states, and (4) identified and validated antibody and in situ hybridization probes that can be used to visualize the major iris cell types. By immunostaining for specific iris cell types, we have observed and quantified distortions in nuclear morphology associated with iris dilation and clarified the neural crest contribution to the iris by showing that <i>Wnt1-Cre</i>-expressing progenitors contribute to nearly all iris cell types, whereas <i>Sox10-Cre</i>-expressing progenitors contribute only to stromal cells. This work should be useful as a point of reference for investigations of iris development, disease, and pharmacology, for the isolation and propagation of defined iris cell types, and for iris cell engineering and transplantation.

                The loss of motor function in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) is primarily due to the severing of the corticospinal tract (CST). Spinal motor neurons are located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and as the lower neurons of the CST, they control voluntary movement. Furthermore, its intrinsic axonal growth ability is significantly stronger than that of cerebral cortex pyramid neurons, which are the upper CST neurons. Therefore, we established an axonal regeneration model of spinal motor neurons to investigate the feasibility of repairing SCI by promoting axonal regeneration of spinal motor neurons. We demonstrated that conditionally knocking out pten in mature spinal motor neurons drastically enhanced axonal regeneration in vivo, and the regenerating axons of the spinal motor neurons re-established synapses with other cells in the damaged spinal cord. Thus, this strategy may serve as a novel and effective treatment method for SCI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cbln1 regulates axon growth and guidance in multiple neural regions</a></h4>

              
                The accurate construction of neural circuits requires the precise control of axon growth and guidance, which is regulated by multiple growth and guidance cues during early nervous system development. It is generally thought that the growth and guidance cues that control the major steps of axon guidance have been defined. Here, we describe cerebellin-1 (Cbln1) as a novel cue that controls diverse aspects of axon growth and guidance throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Cbln1 has previously been shown to function in late neural development to influence synapse organization. Here we find that Cbln1 has an essential role in early neural development. Cbln1 is expressed on the axons and growth cones of developing commissural neurons and functions in an autocrine manner to promote axon growth. Cbln1 is also expressed in intermediate target tissues and functions as an attractive guidance cue. We find that these functions of Cbln1 are mediated by neurexin-2 (Nrxn2), which functions as the Cbln1 receptor for axon growth and guidance. In addition to the developing spinal cord, we further show that Cbln1 functions in diverse parts of the CNS with major roles in cerebellar parallel fiber growth and retinal ganglion cell axon guidance. Despite the prevailing role of Cbln1 as a synaptic organizer, our study discovers a new and unexpected function for Cbln1 as a general axon growth and guidance cue throughout the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using OPM-MEG in contrasting magnetic environments</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been revolutionised in recent years by optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs). OPM-MEG offers higher sensitivity, better spatial resolution and lower cost than conventional instrumentation based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDS). Moreover, OPMs offer the possibility of motion robustness and lifespan compliance, dramatically expanding the range of MEG applications. However, OPM-MEG remains nascent technology; it places stringent requirements on magnetic shielding, and whilst a number of viable systems exist, most are custom made and there have been no cross-site investigations showing the reliability of data. In this paper, we undertake the first cross-site OPM-MEG comparison, using near identical commercial systems scanning the same participant. The two sites are deliberately contrasting, with different magnetic environments: a green field campus university site with an OPM-optimised shielded room (low interference) and a city centre hospital site with a standard (non-optimised) MSR (high interference). We show that despite a 25-fold difference in background field, and a 30-fold difference in low frequency interference, using dynamic field control and software-based suppression of interference we can generate comparable noise floors at both sites. In human data recorded during a visuo-motor task and a face processing paradigm, we were able to generate similar data, with source localisation showing that brain regions could be pinpointed with just ~10 mm spatial discrepancy and temporal correlations of > 80%. Overall, our study demonstrates that plug-and-play OPM-MEG systems exist and can be sited even in challenging magnetic environments.

                Characterizing age- and risk-related hippocampal vulnerabilities may inform about the neural underpinnings of cognitive decline. We studied the impact of three risk-factors, Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a family history of dementia, and central obesity, on CA1, CA2/3, dentate gyrus (DG) and subiculum in 158 cognitively healthy adults (38-71 years). Subfields were labelled with the Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) and FreeSurfer (version 6) protocols. Volumetric and microstructural measurements from quantitative magnetization transfer and Neurite Orientation Density and Dispersion Imaging were extracted for each subfield and reduced to three principal components capturing apparent myelin/neurite packing, size/complexity, and metabolism. Aging was associated with an inverse U-shaped curve on myelin/neurite packing and affected all subfields. Obesity led to reductions in myelin/neurite packing and size/complexity regardless of APOE and FH status. However, amongst individuals with a healthy Waist-Hip-Ratio, APOE4 carriers showed lower size/complexity than non-carriers. Protocol type did not affect this risk pattern. These findings provide novel evidence for interactive effects between APOE and central obesity on the hippocampal formation of cognitively healthy adults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retinal input influences pace of neurogenesis but not cell-type configuration of the visual forebrain</a></h4>

              
                The brain is assembled during development by both innate and experience-dependent mechanisms1-7, but the relative contribution of these factors is poorly understood. Axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) connect the eye to the brain, forming a bottleneck for the transmission of visual information to central visual areas. RGCs secrete molecules from their axons that control proliferation, differentiation and migration of downstream components7-9. Spontaneously generated waves of retinal activity, but also intense visual stimulation, can entrain responses of RGCs10 and central neurons11-16. Here we asked how the cellular composition of central targets is altered in a vertebrate brain that is depleted of retinal input throughout development. For this, we first established a molecular catalog17 and gene expression atlas18 of neuronal subpopulations in the retinorecipient areas of larval zebrafish. We then searched for changes in lakritz (atoh7-) mutants, in which RGCs do not form19. Although individual forebrain-expressed genes are dysregulated in lakritz mutants, the complete set of 77 putative neuronal cell types in thalamus, pretectum and tectum are present. While neurogenesis and differentiation trajectories are overall unaltered, a greater proportion of cells remain in an uncommitted progenitor stage in the mutant. Optogenetic stimulation of a pretectal area20,21 evokes a visual behavior in blind mutants indistinguishable from wildtype. Our analysis shows that, in this vertebrate visual system, neurons are produced more slowly, but specified and wired up in a proper configuration in the absence of any retinal signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebellar and subcortical atrophy contribute to psychiatric symptoms in frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have suggested that cerebellar and subcortical structures are impacted early in the disease progression of genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) due to microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), progranulin (GRN) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72). However, the clinical contribution of the structures involved in the cerebello-subcortical circuitry has been understudied in FTD given their potentially central role in cognition and behaviour processes. The present study aims to investigate whether there is an association between the atrophy of the cerebellar and subcortical structures, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (using the revised version of the Cambridge Behavioral Inventory, CBI-R) across genetic mutations and whether this association starts during the preclinical phase of the disease. Our study included 983 participants from the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI) including mutation carriers (n=608) and non-carrier first-degree relatives of known symptomatic carriers (n= 375). Voxel-wise analysis of the thalamus, striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, and the cerebellum was performed using deformation based morphometry (DBM) and partial least squares analyses (PLS) were used to link morphometry and behavioural symptoms. Our univariate results suggest that in this group of primarily presymptomatic subjects, volume loss in subcortical and cerebellar structure was primarily a function of aging, with only the C9orf72 group showing more pronounced volume loss in the thalamus compared to the non-carrier individuals. PLS analyses demonstrated that the cerebello-subcortical circuitry is related to all neuropsychiatric symptoms from the CBI-R, with significant overlap in brain/behaviour patterns, but also specificity for each genetic group. The biggest differences were in the extent of the cerebellar involvement (larger extent in C9orf72 group) and more prominent amygdalar contribution in the MAPT group. Finally, our findings demonstrated that C9orf72 and MAPT brain scores were related to estimated years before the age of symptom onset (EYO) in a second order relationship highlighting a steeper brain score decline 20 years before expected symptom onset, while GRN brain scores were related to age and not EYO. Overall, these results demonstrated the important role of the subcortical structures and especially of the cerebellum in genetic FTD symptom expression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relating spinal injury-induced neuropathic pain and spontaneous afferent activity to sleep and respiratory dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) can induce dysfunction in a multitude of neural circuits including those that lead to impaired sleep, respiratory dysfunction and neuropathic pain. We used a lower thoracic rodent contusion SCI model - known to develop mechanosensory stimulus hypersensitivity, and spontaneous activity in primary afferents that associates neuropathic pain - and paired this with new approaches that enabled chronic capture of three state sleep and respiration to characterize dysfunction and assess possible interrelations. Noncontact electric field sensors were embedded into home cages for noninvasive capture in naturally behaving mice of the temporal evolution of sleep and respiration changes for 6 weeks after SCI. Hindlimb mechanosensitivity was assessed weekly, and terminal experiments measured primary afferent spontaneous activity in situ from intact lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We observed that SCI led to increased spontaneous primary afferent activity (both firing rate and the number of spontaneously active DRGs) that correlated with reduced hindpaw mechanical sensitivity, increased respiratory rate variability, and increased sleep fragmentation. This is the first study to measure and link sleep dysfunction and variability in respiratory rate in a SCI model of neuropathic pain, and thereby provide broader insight into the magnitude of overall stress burden initiated by neural circuit dysfunction after SCI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improved two-photon imaging of GPCR-based optogenetic neurotransmitter sensors using orthogonally polarized excitation</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent proteins such as GFP are best excited by light that is polarized parallel to the dipole axis of the fluorophore. In most cases, fluorescent proteins are randomly oriented, resulting in unbiased images even when polarized light is used for excitation, e.g. in two-photon microcopy. Here we reveal a surprisingly strong polarization sensitivity in a class of GPCR-based neurotransmitter sensors where the fluorophore is anchored on both ends. In tubular structures such as dendrites, this effect led to a complete loss of membrane signal in dendrites running parallel to the polarization direction of the excitation beam. Our data reveal a major problem for two-photon measurements of neurotransmitter concentration that has not been recognized by the neuroscience community. To remedy the sensitivity to dendritic orientation, we designed an optical device that generates interleaved pulse trains of orthogonal polarization, removing the orientation bias from images. The passive device, which we inserted in the beam path of an existing two-photon microscope, also removed the strong direction bias in second harmonic generation (SHG) images. We conclude that for optical measurements of transmitter concentration with GPCR-based sensors, orthogonally polarized excitation is essential.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Postnatal development of centrifugal inputs to the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Processing in primary sensory areas is influenced by centrifugal inputs from higher brain areas, providing information about behavioral state, attention, or context. Activity in the olfactory bulb, the first central processing stage of olfactory information, is dynamically modulated by direct projections from a variety of areas in adult mice. Despite the early onset of olfactory sensation compared to other senses, the development of centrifugal inputs to the olfactory bulb remains largely unknown. Using retrograde tracing across development, we show that centrifugal projections to the olfactory bulb are established during the postnatal period in an area-specific manner. While feedback projections from the piriform cortex are already present shortly after birth, they strongly increase in number during postnatal development with an anterior-posterior gradient. Contralateral projections from the anterior olfactory nucleus are present at birth but only appeared postnatally for the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. Numbers of olfactory bulb projecting neurons from the lateral entorhinal cortex, ventral hippocampus, and cortical amygdala show a sudden increase at the beginning of the second postnatal week and a delayed development compared to more anterior areas. These anatomical data suggest that limited top-down influence on odor processing in the olfactory bulb may be present at birth, but strongly increases during postnatal development and is only fully established later in life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural decoding dissociates perceptual grouping between proximity and similarity in visual perception</a></h4>

              
                Previous research on perceptual grouping primarily focused on the dynamics of single grouping principle in light of the Gestalt psychology. Yet, there has been comparatively little emphasis on the dissociation across two or more grouping principles. To tackle this issue, the current study aims at investigating how, when, and where the processing of two grouping principles (proximity and similarity) are established in the human brain by using a dimotif lattice paradigm and adjusting the strength of one grouping principle. Specifically, we measured the modulated strength of the other grouping principle, thus forming six visual stimuli. The current psychophysical results showed that similarity grouping effect was enhanced with reduced proximity effect when the grouping cues of proximity and similarity were presented simultaneously. Meanwhile, electrophysiological (EEG) response patterns were able to decode the specific pattern out of the six visual stimuli involving both principles in each trail by using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). The onsets of the dissociation between the two grouping principles coincided within three time windows: the earliest proximity-defined local visual element arrangement in the middle occipital cortex, the middle-stage processing for feature selection modulating low-level visual cortex in the inferior occipital cortex and fusiform cortex, and the higher-level cognitive integration to make decisions for specific grouping preference in the parietal areas. In addition, brain responses were highly correlated with behavioral grouping. The results therefore provide direct evidence for a link between human perceptual space of grouping decision-making and neural space of these brain response patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Atypical relationships between neurofunctional features of print-sound integration and reading abilities in Chinese children with dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Conquering grapheme-phoneme correspondence is necessary for developing fluent reading in alphabetic orthographies. In neuroimaging research, this ability is associated with brain activation differences between the audiovisual congruent against incongruent conditions, especially in the left superior temporal cortex. Studies have also shown such a neural audiovisual integration effect is reduced in individuals with dyslexia. However, existing evidence is almost restricted to alphabetic languages. Whether and how multisensory processing of print and sound is impaired in Chinese dyslexia remains underexplored. Of note, semantic information is deeply involved in Chinese character processing. In this study, we applied a functional magnetic resonance imaging audiovisual integration paradigm to investigate the possible dysfunctions in processing character-sound pairs and pinyin-sound pairs in Chinese dyslexic children compared with typically developing readers. Unexpectedly, no region displayed significant group difference in the audiovisual integration effect in either the character or pinyin experiment. However, the results revealed atypical correlations between neurofunctional features accompanying audiovisual integration with reading abilities in Chinese children with dyslexia. Specifically, while the audiovisual integration effect in the left inferior cortex in processing character-sound pairs correlated with silent reading comprehension proficiency in both dyslexia and control group, it was associated with morphological awareness in the control group but with rapid naming in dyslexics. As for pinyin-sound associations processing, while the stronger activation in the congruent than incongruent conditions in the left occipito-temporal cortex and bilateral superior temporal cortices was associated with better oral word reading in the control group, an opposite pattern was found in children with dyslexia. On the one hand, this pattern suggests Chinese dyslexic children have yet to develop an efficient grapho-semantic processing system as typically developing children do. On the other hand, it indicates dysfunctional recruitment of the regions that process pinyin-sound pairs in dyslexia, which may impede character learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Function of FMRP domains in regulating distinct roles of neuronal protein synthesis</a></h4>

              
                The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is an RNA Binding Protein that regulates translation of mRNAs, essential for synaptic development and plasticity. FMRP interacts with a specific set of mRNAs and aids in their microtubule dependent transport and regulates their translation through its association with ribosomes. However, the biochemical role of individual domains of FMRP in forming neuronal granules and associating with microtubules and ribosomes is currently undefined. Here, we report that the C-terminus domain of FMRP is sufficient to bind to ribosomes as well as polysomes akin to the full-length protein. Furthermore, the C-terminus domain alone is essential and responsible for FMRP-mediated translation repression in neurons. However, FMRP-mediated puncta formation and microtubule association is favored by the synergistic combination of FMRP domains and not by individual domains. Interestingly, we show that the phosphorylation of hFMRP at Serine-500 is important in modulating the dynamics of translation by controlling ribosome/polysome association. This is a fundamental mechanism governing the size and number of FMRP puncta, which appear to contain actively translating ribosomes. Finally through the use of pathogenic mutations, we emphasize the hierarchy of the domains of FMRP in their contribution to translation regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting human decision making in psychological tasks with recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Unlike traditional time series, the action sequences of human decision making usually involve many cognitive processes such as beliefs, desires, intentions and theory of mind, i.e. what others are thinking. This makes predicting human decision making challenging to be treated agnostically to the underlying psychological mechanisms. We propose to use a recurrent neural network architecture based on long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the time series of the actions taken by the human subjects at each step of their decision making, the first application of such methods in this research domain. In this study, we collate the human data from 8 published literature of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma comprising 168,386 individual decisions and postprocess them into 8,257 behavioral trajectories of 9 actions each for both players. Similarly, we collate 617 trajectories of 95 actions from 10 different published studies of Iowa Gambling Task experiments with healthy human subjects. We train our prediction networks on the behavioral data from these published psychological experiments of human decision making, and demonstrate a clear advantage over the state-of-the-art methods in predicting human decision making trajectories in both single-agent scenarios such as the Iowa Gambling Task and multi-agent scenarios such as the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. In the prediction, we observe that the weights of the top performers tends to have a wider distribution, and a bigger bias in the LSTM networks, which suggests possible interpretations for the distribution of strategies adopted by each group.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Schema support for forming inferences in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Associative inference, the process of drawing novel links between existing knowledge to rapidly integrate associated information, is supported by the hippocampus and neocortex. Within the neocortex, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the rapid cortical learning of new information that is congruent with an existing framework of knowledge, or schema. How the brain integrates associations to form inferences, specifically how inferences are represented, is not well understood. In this study, we investigate how the brain uses schemas to facilitate memory integration in an associative inference paradigm (A-B-C-D). We conducted two event-related fMRI experiments in which participants retrieved previously learned direct (AB, BC, CD) and inferred (AC, AD) associations between word pairs for items that are schema congruent or incongruent. Additionally, we investigated how two factors known to affect memory, a delay with sleep, and reward, modulate the neural integration of associations within, and between, schema. Schema congruency was found to benefit the integration of associates, but only when retrieval immediately follows learning. RSA revealed that neural patterns of inferred pairs (AC) in the PHc, mPFC, and posHPC were more similar to their constituents (AB and BC) when the items were schema congruent, suggesting that schema facilitates the assimilation of paired items into a single inferred unit containing all associated elements. Furthermore, a delay with sleep, but not reward, impacted the assimilation of inferred pairs. Our findings reveal that the neural representations of overlapping associations are integrated into novel representations through the support of memory schema.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortex-independent open-loop control of a voluntary orofacial motor action</a></h4>

              
                Whether using our eyes or our hands, we interact with our environment through mobile sensors. The efficient use of these sensory organs implies the ability to track their position; otherwise, perceptual stability and prehension would be profoundly impeded. The nervous system may be informed about the position of a sensory organ via two complementary feedback mechanisms: peripheral reafference (external, sensory feedback) and efference copy (internal feedback). Yet, the potential contributions of these mechanisms remain largely unexplored. By training rats to place their vibrissae within a predetermined angular range without contact, a task that depends on knowledge of vibrissa position relative to their face, we found that peripheral reafference is not required. The presence of motor cortex is not required either, even in the absence of peripheral reafference. On the other hand, the red nucleus, which receives descending inputs from motor cortex and the cerebellum and projects to facial motoneurons, is critical for the execution of the vibrissa task. All told, our results demonstrate the existence of an open-loop control by an internal model that is sufficient to drive voluntary motion. The internal model is independent of motor cortex and likely contains the cerebellum and associated nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct properties in ventral pallidum projection neuron subtypes</a></h4>

              
                The ventral pallidum (VP), a major component of the basal ganglia, plays a critical role in motivational disorders. It sends projections to many different brain regions but it is not yet known whether and how these projections differ in their cellular properties, gene expression patterns, connectivity and role in reward seeking. In this study, we focus on four major outputs of the VP - to the lateral hypothalamus (LH), ventral tegmental area (VTA), mediodorsal thalamus (MDT), and lateral habenula (LHb) - and examine the differences between them in 1) baseline gene expression profiles using projection-specific RNA-sequencing; 2) physiological parameters using whole-cell patch clamp; and 3) their influence on cocaine reward using chemogenetic tools. We show that these four VP efferents differ in all three aspects and highlight specifically differences between the projections to the LH and the VTA. These two projections originate largely from separate populations of neurons, express distinct sets of genes related to neurobiological functions, and show opposite physiological and behavioral properties. Collectively, our data demonstrates for the first time that VP neurons exhibit distinct molecular and cellular profiles in a projection-specific manner, suggesting that they represent different cell types.

	<p>For incurable diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the prevention of progression and the preservation of quality of life play a crucial role over the entire therapy period. In MS, patients tend to become ill at a younger age and are so variable in terms of their disease course that there is no standard therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to enable a therapy that is as personalized as possible and to respond promptly to any changes, whether with noticeable symptoms or symptomless. Here, measurable parameters of biological processes can be used, which provide good information with regard to prognostic and diagnostic aspects, disease activity and response to therapy, so-called biomarkers Increasing digitalization and the availability of easy-to-use devices and technology also enable healthcare professionals to use a new class of digital biomarkers—digital health technologies—to explain, influence and/or predict health-related outcomes. The technology and devices from which these digital biomarkers stem are quite broad, and range from wearables that collect patients’ activity during digitalized functional tests (e.g., the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test, dual-tasking performance and speech) to digitalized diagnostic procedures (e.g., optical coherence tomography) and software-supported magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. These technologies offer a timesaving way to collect valuable data on a regular basis over a long period of time, not only once or twice a year during patients’ routine visit at the clinic. Therefore, they lead to real-life data acquisition, closer patient monitoring and thus a patient dataset useful for precision medicine. Despite the great benefit of such increasing digitalization, for now, the path to implementing digital biomarkers is widely unknown or inconsistent. Challenges around validation, infrastructure, evidence generation, consistent data collection and analysis still persist. In this narrative review, we explore existing and future opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers in the care of people with MS, which may lead to a digital twin of the patient. To do this, we searched published papers for existing opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers for different functional systems in the context of MS, and also gathered perspectives on digital biomarkers under development or already existing as a research approach.</p>

	<p> This study investigated the effect of educational level and of the syntactic representation of numbers in Arabic on the task of transcoding two-digit numbers from dictation. The participants were primary, junior-high, and high school pupils and higher education students. All spoke Arabic as a mother tongue. They performed a transcoding task, namely writing two-digit numbers from dictation. Units first\decades first writing patterns were collected depending on the differential syntactic structures of the two-digit number dictated (decades first: whole tens; units first: teen numbers; identical units and decades, remaining two-digit numbers). The findings reveal that in general, Arabic speakers adopt a decades-first writing pattern for two-digit numbers, especially when it is consistent with the syntactic structure of two-digit numbers, as in whole-tens numbers. This decade-first writing pattern is more evident and consistent in junior-high school, high school, and higher education than in primary school due to the improvement in mathematical skills and second and third languages. However, this pattern is modulated by the syntactic complexity of the unit–decade structure. This complexity is more pronounced in two-digit numbers whose processing is more dependent on numerical syntax. Thus, whole-tens numbers, teen numbers, and identical-decade–unit numbers are less complex than the remaining two-digit numbers.</p>

	<p>Background: Surgical planning with nTMS-based tractography is proven to increase safety during surgery. A preoperative risk stratification model has been published based on the M1 infiltration, RMT ratio, and tumor to corticospinal tract distance (TTD). The correlation of TTD with corticospinal tract to resection cavity distance (TRD) and outcome is needed to further evaluate the validity of the model. Aim of the study: To use the postop MRI-derived resection cavity to measure how closely the resection cavity approximated the preoperatively calculated corticospinal tract (CST) and how this correlates with the risk model and the outcome. Methods: We included 183 patients who underwent nTMS-based DTI and surgical resection for presumed motor-eloquent gliomas. TTD, TRD, and motor outcome were recorded and tested for correlations. The intraoperative monitoring documentation was available for a subgroup of 48 patients, whose responses were correlated to TTD and TRD. Results: As expected, TTD and TRD showed a good correlation (Spearman’s ρ = 0.67, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Both the TTD and the TRD correlated significantly with the motor outcome at three months (Kendall’s Tau-b 0.24 for TTD, 0.31 for TRD, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the TTD and TRD correlated only slightly with residual tumor volume, and only after correction for outliers related to termination of resection due to intraoperative monitoring events or the proximity of other eloquent structures (TTD ρ = 0.32, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; TRD ρ = 0.19, p = 0.01). This reflects the fact that intraoperative monitoring (IOM) phenomena do not always correlate with preoperative structural analysis, and that additional factors influence the intraoperative decision to abort resection, such as the adjacency of other vulnerable structures. The TTD was also significantly correlated with variations in motor evoked potential (MEP) responses (no/reversible decrease vs. irreversible decrease; p = 0.03). Conclusions: The TTD approximates the TRD well, confirming the best predictive parameter and giving strength to the nTMS-based risk stratification model. Our analysis of TRD supports the use of the nTMS-based TTD measurement to estimate the resection preoperatively, also confirming the 8 mm cutoff. Nevertheless, the TRD proved to have a slightly stronger correlation with the outcome as the surgeon’s experience, anatomofunctional knowledge, and MEP observations influence the expected EOR.</p>

	<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children is associated with several adverse family characteristics, such as higher parenting stress, more conflicted parent–child relationships, lower parental competence, and higher levels of parental psychopathology. Hence, children with ADHD more often grow up under suboptimal circumstances, which may impact the development of their attachment representations. Here, we investigated whether children with ADHD have more insecure and disorganized attachment representations than their typically developing peers, and which factors could explain this association. We included 104 children between 4 and 11 years old, 74 with ADHD (without Conduct Disorder) and 30 typically developing control children. Children completed a state-of-the-art story stem task to assess their attachment representation, and we measured parents’ expressed emotion (as an index of parent–child relationship quality), parents’ perceived sense of competence, parental education levels, and parent-rated ODD symptoms of the child. We found that, after controlling for multiple comparisons, children with ADHD had less secure and more ambivalent and disorganized attachment representations relative to their typically developing peers. These group differences were independent of comorbid ODD and parental education levels. There were no group differences on avoidant attachment representations. Explorative analyses within the ADHD group showed that attachment representations were not related to parent–child relationship quality, perceived parenting competence, parental education levels, and comorbid ODD symptoms. We conclude that children with ADHD disproportionately often have attachment problems. Although this conclusion is important, treatment implications of this co-occurrence are yet unclear as research on ADHD and attachment is still in its infancy.</p>

                Background: Rotenone treatment causes oxidative stress in neurons and forms the basis of animal models of Parkinson's disease. The reduced form of glutathione is predicted to detoxify rotenone from neurons in the brainstem. This study aims to measure the concentration of total glutathione and analyze the formation of protofibril in the brainstem of Wistar rats treated with rotenone. Methods: Seventy-two male Wistar rats aged 8–9 weeks weighing 200–250 g were divided into two investigations: total glutathione determination and protofibril analysis. The independent variables were treatment group, observation time, and location in the brainstem. The dependent variables were the concentration of total glutathione and protofibril density. Results: The concentration of total glutathione was not significantly different among treatment groups (p: 0.084), observation time (p: 0.608), or the location in the brainstem (p: 0.372). Protofibril density was different in the treatment groups (p: 0.001), observation time (p: 0.001), and between the upper and lower brainstem (p: 0.001). Rotenone treatment subcortically induced the concentration of total glutathione in the brainstem to decrease, but protofibril density tended to increase. Conclusions: The total glutathione concentration is inversely proportional to protofibril density. Total glutathione might be an early marker of neuronal damage.

                Background: The medical student is a part of education that has a pivotal role in contributing to the teaching-learning process. Assessing the learning process by student perception can give valuable input to predict academic achievement. This study aims to identify the student’s perspective regarding teaching-learning behaviour and which factor most influences academic achievement. Methods: A total of 443 medical students of the preclinical phase were selected to participate in this study. Design of the study comprised three single-groups time sequences with the observational approach. This study is divided into three phases: item construction by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA), validation through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and true surveys. Sample size calculation employed formulation of subject to item ratio for EFA and CFA; true survey utilized the estimate proportion population. Using regression linear, we determine the most influential factor to academic performance. Results: Results were summarized following two factors that influencing academic performance, namely learning experience (p value=0.013, r=0.041) and exam effectiveness (p value=0.041, r=0.028). Our work highlights the lecturer capacity and integrated module have contributed the academic success (79.46% and 77.80%). Conclusions: Our finding has novelty in which contribute the knowledge regarding exam significance on medicine. Meanwhile, related to the learning experience domain is increasingly proving an essential factor to achieve academic performance. The major strength of this study is the systematic manner in which it was conducted.

                Background: It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We first examined the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections a year previous. Second, we examined the concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the contemporaneous medical notes. Methods: This case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered in April 2020 on the Open Science Framework. Results: Current smokers had lower odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous (ORadj=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). There was no significant association among former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Smoking status recorded on the EHR (compared with the contemporaneous medical notes) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6%) controls (χ2(3)=256.5, p=<0.001) and 60 cases (13.5%) (χ2(3)=34.2, p=<0.001). Conclusions: In a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR-medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.

                Background: COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for health services and systems around the world, including Peru.  A viable alternative in the telemedicine field to guarantee patient nutritional care is telenutrition. Telenutrition involves the interactive use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to implement the nutrition care process with patients at a remote location. Information regarding the experience with this methodology and its potential effect on patients’ nutritional goals, does not exist in Peru. The aim of the study was to report the effect of the evaluation type (telenutrition vs. in-person) on weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and relative fat mass (RFM) in overweight and obese adult patients.  Methods: This retrospective study included 100 eligible patients in a single nutritional center, from January 2019 to March 2021. Telenutrition and in-person continuous variables were compared with independent sample t-test or U Mann-Whitney test. Results: There were significant differences in weight, BMI, WC and RFM by the end of follow-up period, in both evaluation modalities. Patients on the telenutrition group had a mean decrease of 6.80 ± 4.87 cm in WC, whereas the mean difference observed for the in-person group was 6.74 ± 4.55 cm. There were no significant differences in the changes of any anthropometric parameters when comparing both systems. Reductions were observed in weight (5.93 ± 3.88 kg vs. 4.92 ± 3.29 kg), BMI (2.23 ± 1.39 kg/ m2 vs. 1.83 ± 1.23 kg/ m2), WC (6.80 ± 4.87 cm vs. 6.74 ± 4.55 cm) and RFM (2.43 ± 1.78 vs. 2.63 ± 1.73) in telenutrition and in-person evaluation, respectively by the end of the follow-up period.  Conclusions: Telenutrition may be regarded as an alternative to in-person evaluation offering anthropometric changes and nutritional goals similar to those reported through the in-person modality, in overweight and obese adult people.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Intriguing effects of selection intensity on the evolution of prosocial behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex McAvoy, Andrew Rao, Christoph Hauert</p>

In many models of evolving populations, genetic drift has an outsized role relative to natural selection, or vice versa. While there are many scenarios in which one of these two assumptions is reasonable, intermediate balances between these forces are also biologically relevant. In this study, we consider some natural axioms for modeling intermediate selection intensities, and we explore how to quantify the long-term evolutionary dynamics of such a process. To illustrate the sensitivity of evolutionary dynamics to drift and selection, we show that there can be a “sweet spot” for the balance of these two forces, with sufficient noise for rare mutants to become established and sufficient selection to spread. This balance allows prosocial traits to evolve in evolutionary models that were previously thought to be unconducive to the emergence and spread of altruistic behaviors. Furthermore, the effects of selection intensity on long-run evolutionary outcomes in these settings, such as when there is global competition for reproduction, can be highly non-monotonic. Although intermediate selection intensities (neither weak nor strong) are notoriously difficult to study analytically, they are often biologically relevant; and the results we report suggest that they can elicit novel and rich dynamics in the evolution of prosocial behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating repeat spectra and genome length from low-coverage genome skims with RESPECT</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shahab Sarmashghi, Metin Balaban, Eleonora Rachtman, Behrouz Touri, Siavash Mirarab, Vineet Bafna</p>

The cost of sequencing the genome is dropping at a much faster rate compared to assembling and finishing the genome. The use of lightly sampled genomes (genome-skims) could be transformative for genomic ecology, and results using <i>k</i>-mers have shown the advantage of this approach in identification and phylogenetic placement of eukaryotic species. Here, we revisit the basic question of estimating genomic parameters such as genome length, coverage, and repeat structure, focusing specifically on estimating the <i>k</i>-mer repeat spectrum. We show using a mix of theoretical and empirical analysis that there are fundamental limitations to estimating the <i>k</i>-mer spectra due to ill-conditioned systems, and that has implications for other genomic parameters. We get around this problem using a novel constrained optimization approach (Spline Linear Programming), where the constraints are learned empirically. On reads simulated at 1X coverage from 66 genomes, our method, REPeat SPECTra Estimation (RESPECT), had < 1.5% error in length estimation compared to 34% error previously achieved. In shotgun sequenced read samples with contaminants, RESPECT length estimates had median error 4%, in contrast to other methods that had median error 80%. Together, the results suggest that low-pass genomic sequencing can yield reliable estimates of the length and repeat content of the genome. The RESPECT software will be publicly available at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_shahab-2Dsarmashghi_RESPECT.git&d=DwIGAw&c=-35OiAkTchMrZOngvJPOeA&r=ZozViWvD1E8PorCkfwYKYQMVKFoEcqLFm4Tg49XnPcA&m=f-xS8GMHKckknkc7Xpp8FJYw_ltUwz5frOw1a5pJ81EpdTOK8xhbYmrN4ZxniM96&s=717o8hLR1JmHFpRPSWG6xdUQTikyUjicjkipjFsKG4w&e=.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Causal inference regulates audiovisual spatial recalibration via its influence on audiovisual perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fangfang Hong, Stephanie Badde, Michael S. Landy</p>

To obtain a coherent perception of the world, our senses need to be in alignment. When we encounter misaligned cues from two sensory modalities, the brain must infer which cue is faulty and recalibrate the corresponding sense. We examined whether and how the brain uses cue reliability to identify the miscalibrated sense by measuring the audiovisual ventriloquism aftereffect for stimuli of varying visual reliability. To adjust for modality-specific biases, visual stimulus locations were chosen based on perceived alignment with auditory stimulus locations for each participant. During an audiovisual recalibration phase, participants were presented with bimodal stimuli with a fixed perceptual spatial discrepancy; they localized one modality, cued after stimulus presentation. Unimodal auditory and visual localization was measured before and after the audiovisual recalibration phase. We compared participants’ behavior to the predictions of three models of recalibration: (a) Reliability-based: each modality is recalibrated based on its relative reliability—less reliable cues are recalibrated more; (b) Fixed-ratio: the degree of recalibration for each modality is fixed; (c) Causal-inference: recalibration is directly determined by the discrepancy between a cue and its estimate, which in turn depends on the reliability of both cues, and inference about how likely the two cues derive from a common source. Vision was hardly recalibrated by audition. Auditory recalibration by vision changed idiosyncratically as visual reliability decreased: the extent of auditory recalibration either decreased monotonically, peaked at medium visual reliability, or increased monotonically. The latter two patterns cannot be explained by either the reliability-based or fixed-ratio models. Only the causal-inference model of recalibration captures the idiosyncratic influences of cue reliability on recalibration. We conclude that cue reliability, causal inference, and modality-specific biases guide cross-modal recalibration indirectly by determining the perception of audiovisual stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A cloud-based toolbox for the versatile environmental annotation of biodiversity data</a></h4>

A vast range of research applications in biodiversity sciences requires integrating primary species, genetic, or ecosystem data with other environmental data. This integration requires a consideration of the spatial and temporal scale appropriate for the data and processes in question. But a versatile and scale flexible environmental annotation of biodiversity data remains constrained by technical hurdles. Existing tools have streamlined the intersection of occurrence records with gridded environmental data but have remained limited in their ability to address a range of spatial and temporal grains, especially for large datasets. We present the Spatiotemporal Observation Annotation Tool (STOAT), a cloud-based toolbox for flexible biodiversity–environment annotations. STOAT is optimized for large biodiversity datasets and allows user-specified spatial and temporal resolution and buffering in support of environmental characterizations that account for the uncertainty and scale of data and of relevant processes. The tool offers these services for a growing set of near global, remotely sensed, or modeled environmental data, including Landsat, MODIS, EarthEnv, and CHELSA. STOAT includes a user-friendly, web-based dashboard that provides tools for annotation task management and result visualization, linked to Map of Life, and a dedicated R package (<i>rstoat</i>) for programmatic access. We demonstrate STOAT functionality with several examples that illustrate phenological variation and spatial and temporal scale dependence of environmental characteristics of birds at a continental scale. We expect STOAT to facilitate broader exploration and assessment of the scale dependence of observations and processes in ecology.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does receiving a cash grant improve individual earnings in a war-torn country?  Evidence from a randomized experiment in Afghanistan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this study, the effect of receiving a non-trivial cash grant and mentorship for business practice on individual earnings in Afghanistan was assessed.  Methods: This randomized control trial (RCT) included 2177 individuals (n=2177), with the age range of 18-35 years. The amount of cash grant (500 USD) was approximately equal to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the country.  By a process of lottery, eligible applicants were equally divided into the group that received the grant (treatment group) and the group that did not (control group). Results: Almost two years after this study, the percentage of increased annual income to the size of this cash grant was approximately 173 % and 69 % for males and females, respectively. This result was much higher than the estimated percentage reported in previous literature assessing the effect of microfinance loans and cash grants in other countries.  The treatment group had 7% higher probability of having an officially registered business than the control group. The treatment group also increased labor supply and employed additional workers, compared to the control group. The male treatment group bought more capital equipment (e.g., trike and commercial carts) than the male control group, while the female treatment group bought more domestic animals. Conclusion: A non-trivial cash grant has a strong positive effect on the earnings of the recipient of the cash grant in Afghanistan. If the state of increased income continues for the next few years, the sum of increased income will be more than the sum of the administration cost, the interest cost and the amount of cash grant given.  This implies that the project passes the standard criteria to determine the appropriateness of government program. Additionally, we did not find any economically and statistically significant positive effect of mentorship on income.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Oligodendrocytes, BK channels and the preservation of myelin [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes wrap multiple lamellae of their membrane, myelin, around axons of the central nervous system (CNS), to improve impulse conduction. Myelin synthesis is specialised and dynamic, responsive to local neuronal excitation. Subtle pathological insults are sufficient to cause significant neuronal metabolic impairment, so myelin preservation is necessary to safeguard neural networks. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent demyelinating disease of the CNS. In MS, inflammatory attacks against myelin, proposed to be autoimmune, cause myelin decay and oligodendrocyte loss, leaving neurons vulnerable. Current therapies target the prominent neuroinflammation but are mostly ineffective in protecting from neurodegeneration and the progressive neurological disability. People with MS have substantially higher levels of extracellular glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter. This impairs cellular homeostasis to cause excitotoxic stress. Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK channels) could preserve myelin or allow its recovery by protecting cells from the resulting excessive excitability. This review evaluates the role of excitotoxic stress, myelination and BK channels in MS pathology, and explores the hypothesis that BK channel activation could be a therapeutic strategy to protect oligodendrocytes from excitotoxic stress in MS. This could reduce progression of neurological disability if used in parallel to immunomodulatory therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An examination of determinants for e-wallet adoption in Malaysia: a combined approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this era of innovation in information technology, everything is embedded with technology, and the financial sector is no exception. The term “FinTech” (Financial Services Technology Consortium) attracted the attention of regulators, consumers and investors in 2014. It was initially applied to the back-end systems of financial and banking institutions. However, Fintech has now become more consumer-oriented, as the combination of financial services and information technology. Specifically, it refers to financial services for consumers through technology. The e-wallet is one of the examples of FinTech in payments and infrastructure that can be freely adopted by everyone. However, the penetration of e-wallet usage in Malaysia is still in its early stages compared to other countries. Methods: The aim of this research is to examine the factors that affect the adoption of e-wallets in Malaysia based on five aspects: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, social influence and government support. These variables were adopted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Questionnaires were given to a targeted group of 100 e-wallet users in Malaysia using the convenient sampling method. The contribution of each factor in explaining the adoption of e-wallets was analyzed using multiple regression. Results: The results show that social influence has a significant relationship with the adoption of e-wallets in Malaysia: the majority of the respondents are at their prime age and their behaviours tend to be influenced by the reference group. The results from this study may encourage more small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia to provide e-wallet payment options, transforming their conventional business into a digital business and spurring the growth of the  digital economy in Malaysia. Conclusions: High levels of adoption of e-wallets moves a country towards a cashless society, resulting in better economic growth and environment.

                This theory-building research intends to dig into the renewable energy industry and drawing from research on learning curves and energy polices, proposes a way to speed-up the energy shift from our fossil-fuel dependency to a green economy. Even though standard economic frameworks suggest that markets and not policy makers should decide winners and losers, we urge to accelerate renewable energy competitiveness, proposing that by limiting the number of maturing renewable technologies where resources are allocated to at government level, we reduce the time within which renewables will achieve technological price parity with fossil fuels. In turn, by analyzing the energy demand and supply curves, the study suggests that this action will also mediate the relation between quantity and price, shifting only the supply curve, leaving the demand curve unaffected. It continues by proposing the standardization of a unique renewable energy supply chain model, defined as the SURESC model, relating the indirect effect of limiting the number of maturing technologies to allocate resources, to achieve renewable price-parity with conventional energy sources faster. This is a preliminary theoretical study intended to provide a holistic approach to a known problem.

     alt="DARPP-32 distinguishes a subset of adult-born neurons in zebra finch HVC"/>
<p>We have discovered that the phosphoprotein DARPP-32 is expressed in half of all adult-born neurons (HVC NNs) in the songbird premotor brain region HVC (proper name) during their first month post-mitosis. We demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs cannot be backfilled from target nucleus RA, receive putative catecholaminergic synaptic contacts, and have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs at one month post-mitosis. These data suggest that there are two distinct subtypes of adult-born neurons in songbird HVC.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult male zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) continually incorporate adult-born neurons into HVC, a telencephalic brain region necessary for the production of learned song. These neurons express activity-dependent immediate early genes (e.g., <i>zenk</i> and <i>c-fos</i>) following song production, suggesting that these neurons are active during song production. Half of these adult-born HVC neurons (HVC NNs) can be backfilled from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and are a part of the vocal motor pathway underlying learned song production, but the other half do not backfill from RA, and they remain to be characterized. Here, we used cell birth-dating, retrograde tract tracing, and immunofluorescence to demonstrate that half of all HVC NNs express the phosphoprotein DARPP-32, a protein associated with dopamine receptor expression. We also demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs are contacted by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers, suggesting that they receive catecholaminergic input, have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs, and do not backfill from RA. Taken together, these findings help characterize a group of HVC NNs that have no apparent projections to RA and so far have eluded positive identification other than HVC NN status.</p>

                Background: The modern concept of oligometastatic (OM) state has been initially developed to describe patients with a low burden of disease and with a potential for cure with local ablative treatments. We systematically assessed the risk of death and relapse of oligometastatic (OM) cancers compared to cancers with more diffuse metastatic spread, through a meta-analysis of published data.  Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting prognosis of patients with OM solid tumors. Risk of death and relapse were extracted and pooled to provide an adjusted hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval (HR 95%CI).  The primary outcome of the study refers to overall mortality in OM vs. polymetastatic (PM) patients.  Results. Mortality and relapse associated with OM state in patients with cancer were evaluated among 104,234 participants (n=173 studies). Progression-free survival was better in patients with OM disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.62, 95% CI 0.57–0.68; P <.001; n=69 studies). Also, OM cancers were associated with a better overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68; P<.01; n=161 studies). In colorectal (CRC), breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the reduction in the risk of death for OM patients were 35, 38, 30 and 42%, respectively. Biliary tract and cervical cancer do not significantly better in OM stage likely for paucity of data. Conclusions. Patients with OM cancers have a significantly better prognosis than those with more widespread stage IV tumors. In OM cancer patients a personalized approach should be pursued.

                Background  The presence of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase positive bacteria in hospital setting is an aggravating influential factor for hospitalized patients, and its consequences may be hazardous. Therefore, there is a need for rapid detection methods for newly emerging drug-resistant bacteria. This study was aimed at the molecular characterization of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase -positive  Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from the patients of a teaching hospital in Sindh, Pakistan.   Methods  A total of 513  K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from various clinical samples during June 2019 to May 2020. The collected isolates were investigated for antimicrobial susceptibility (antibiogram), and PCR and DNA sequencing were performed to analyse the ESBL genes.   Results  Among the 513 isolates, as many as 359 (69.9%) were Extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers and 87.5% were multi-drug resistant, while none had resistance to imipenem. PCR scored 3% blaTEM, 3% blaSHV, and 60% blaCTX-M-15 genes for the tested isolates.   Conclusion  The study showed that CTX-M-15 was the major prevalent Extended-spectrum β-lactamase type among the isolates. Additionally, all the isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Screening and detection of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase tests are necessary among all isolates from the enterobacteriaceae family in routine microbiology laboratory to prevent associated nosocomial infections. A larger study is essential to understand molecular epidemiology of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing organisms to minimize morbidities due to these multidrug resistant organisms.

                Background: Case detection for Tuberculosis remains low in high burden communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the first point of contact for many Nigerians in the rural areas and have been found useful in active case finding. This study assessed the effect of cash incentives and training on tuberculosis case detection by CHWs in six Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A randomised control trial was conducted in three PHC clusters. The intervention Arm (A) received cash incentives for every presumptive case referred. The Training Arm(B) had no cash incentives and the control had neither training nor cash incentives. Case notification rates from the TB program were used to assess the effect of cash incentives on TB case finding. Data was analyzed using Graph Pad Prism. Descriptive data was presented in tables and bivariate data was analyzed using chi square. Mean increases in case notification rates was calculated Statistical significance was set as P=0.05. Results: The intervention identified 394 presumptive TB cases, contributing 30.3% of all presumptive cases notified in the LGAs. Findings also showed an increase of 14.4% (ꭓ2=2.976, P value=0.2258) in case notification rates for the Arm A that received cash incentives alongside training, there was also an increase of 7.4% (ꭓ2= 1.999, P value=0.1575) in Arm B that received Training only. Secondary outcomes indicated a 144.8%(ꭓ2= 4.147, P value=0.1258)  increase in community outreaches conducted in the Arm that were given cash incentives. Conclusion: The study demonstrated an increase in TB control activities of case notification and outreaches among community health workers that received cash incentives and training.  These findings support the use training and cash incentives for CHWs in high burden TB settings to improve TB case detection rates.

                Recent studies have suggested close functional links between overt visual attention and decision making. This suggests that the corresponding mechanisms may interface in brain regions known to be crucial for guiding visual attention – such as the frontal eye field (FEF). Here, we combined brain stimulation, eye tracking, and computational approaches to explore this possibility. We show that inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right FEF has a causal impact on decision making, reducing the effect of gaze dwell time on choice while also increasing reaction times. We computationally characterize this putative mechanism by using the attentional drift diffusion model (aDDM), which reveals that FEF inhibition reduces the relative discounting of the non-fixated option in the comparison process. Our findings establish an important causal role of the right FEF in choice, elucidate the underlying mechanism, and provide support for one of the key causal hypotheses associated with the aDDM.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ripples reflect a spectrum of synchronous spiking activity in human anterior temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Direct brain recordings have provided important insights into how high frequency activity captured through intracranial EEG (iEEG) supports human memory retrieval. The extent to which such activity is comprised of transient fluctuations that reflect the dynamic coordination of underlying neurons, however, remains unclear. Here, we simultaneously record iEEG, local field potential (LFP), and single unit activity in the human temporal cortex. We demonstrate that fast oscillations within the previously identified 80-120 Hz ripple band contribute to 70-200 Hz high frequency activity in the human cortex. These ripple oscillations exhibit a spectrum of amplitudes and durations related to the amount of underlying neuronal spiking. Ripples in the macro-scale iEEG are related to the number and synchrony of ripples in the micro-scale LFP, which in turn are related to the synchrony of neuronal spiking. Our data suggest that neural activity in the human temporal lobe is organized into transient bouts of ripple oscillations that reflect underlying bursts of spiking activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural control of growth and size in the axolotl limb regenerate</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms that regulate growth and size of the regenerating limb in tetrapods such as the Mexican axolotl are unknown. Upon the completion of the developmental stages of regeneration, when the regenerative organ known as the blastema completes patterning and differentiation, the limb regenerate is proportionally small in size. It then undergoes a phase of regeneration that we have called the 'tiny-limb' stage, that is defined by rapid growth until the regenerate reaches the proportionally appropriate size. In the current study we have characterized this growth and have found that signaling from the limb nerves is required for its maintenance. Using the regenerative assay known as the Accessory Limb Model, we have found that growth and size of the limb positively correlates with nerve abundance. We have additionally developed a new regenerative assay called the Neural Modified-ALM (NM-ALM), which decouples the source of the nerves from the regenerating host environment. Using the NM-ALM we discovered that non-neural extrinsic factors from differently sized host animals do not play a prominent role in determining the size of the regenerating limb. We have also discovered that the regulation of limb size is not autonomously regulated by the limb nerves. Together, these observations show that the limb nerves provide essential cues to regulate ontogenetic allometric growth and the final size of the regenerating limb.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Elevated FBXO45 promotes liver tumorigenesis through enhancing IGF2BP1 ubiquitination and subsequent PLK1 upregulation</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation of tumor-relevant proteins may contribute to human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis. FBXO45 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is frequently elevated expression in human HCC. However, it remains unknown whether FBXO45 is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and how to treat HCC patients with high FBXO45 expression. Here, IHC and qPCR analysis revealed that FBXO45 protein and mRNA were highly expressed in 54.3% (57 of 105) and 52.2% (132 of 253) of the HCC tissue samples, respectively. Highly expressed FBXO45 promoted liver tumorigenesis in transgenic mice. Mechanistically, FBXO45 promoted IGF2BP1 ubiquitination at the Lys190 and Lys450 sites and subsequent activation, leading to the upregulation of PLK1 expression and the induction of cell proliferation and liver tumorigenesis <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo</i>. PLK1 inhibition or IGF2BP1 knockdown significantly blocked FBXO45-driven liver tumorigenesis in FBXO45 transgenic mice, primary cells and HCCs. Furthermore, IHC analysis on HCC tissue samples revealed a positive association between the hyperexpression of FBXO45 and PLK1/IGF2BP1, and both had positive relationship with poor survival in HCC patients. Thus, FBXO45 plays an important role in promoting liver tumorigenesis through IGF2BP1 ubiquitination and activation, and subsequent PLK1 upregulation, suggesting a new strategy for treating HCC by targeting FBXO45/IGF2BP1/PLK1 axis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Relating multivariate shapes to genescapes using phenotype-biological process associations for craniofacial shape</a></h4>

              
                Realistic mappings of genes to morphology are inherently multivariate on both sides of the equation. The importance of coordinated gene effects on morphological phenotypes is clear from the intertwining of gene actions in signaling pathways, gene regulatory networks, and developmental processes underlying the development of shape and size. Yet, current approaches tend to focus on identifying and localizing the effects of individual genes and rarely leverage the information content of high dimensional phenotypes. Here, we explicitly model the joint effects of biologically coherent collections of genes on a multivariate trait-craniofacial shape - in a sample of<i> n </i>= 1,145 mice from the Diversity Outbred (DO) experimental line. We use biological process gene ontology (GO) annotations to select skeletal and facial development gene sets and solve for the axis of shape variation that maximally covaries with gene set marker variation. We use our process-centered, multivariate genotype-phenotype (process MGP) approach to determine the overall contributions to craniofacial variation of genes involved in relevant processes and how variation in different processes corresponds to multivariate axes of shape variation. Further, we compare the directions of effect in phenotype space of mutations to the primary axis of shape variation associated with broader pathways within which they are thought to function. Finally, we leverage the relationship between mutational and pathway-level effects to predict phenotypic effects beyond craniofacial shape in specific mutants. We also introduce an online application which provides users the means to customize their own process-centered craniofacial shape analyses in the DO. The process-centered approach is generally applicable to any continuously varying phenotype and thus has wide-reaching implications for complex-trait genetics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The entorhinal cortex modulates trace fear memory formation and neuroplasticity in the mouse lateral amygdala via cholecystokinin</a></h4>

              
                Although fear memory formation is essential for survival and fear-related mental disorders, the neural circuitry and mechanism are incompletely understood. Here, we utilized trace fear conditioning to study the formation of trace fear memory in mice. We identified the entorhinal cortex (EC) as a critical component of sensory signaling to the amygdala. We adopted both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to demonstrate that release of the cholecystokinin (CCK) from the EC is required for trace fear memory formation. We discovered that CCK-positive neurons project from the EC to the lateral nuclei of the amygdala (LA), and inhibition of CCK-dependent signaling in the EC prevented long-term potentiation of the auditory response in the LA and formation of trace fear memory. In summary, high-frequency activation of EC neurons triggers the release of CCK in their projection terminals in the LA, potentiating auditory response in LA neurons. The neural plasticity in the LA leads to trace fear memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Immunomodulatory drug discovery from herbal medicines: Insights from organ-specific activity and xenobiotic defenses</a></h4>

              
                Traditional herbal medicines, which emphasize a holistic, patient-centric view of disease treatment, provide an exciting starting point for discovery of new immunomodulatory drugs. Progress on identification of herbal molecules with proven single agent activity has been slow, in part because of insufficient consideration of pharmacology fundamentals. Many molecules derived from medicinal plants exhibit low oral bioavailability and rapid clearance, leading to low systemic exposure. Recent research suggests that such molecules can act locally in the gut or liver to activate xenobiotic defense pathways that trigger beneficial systemic effects on the immune system. We discuss this hypothesis in the context of four plant-derived molecules with immunomodulatory activity: indigo, polysaccharides, colchicine, and ginsenosides. We end by proposing research strategies for identification of novel immunomodulatory drugs from herbal medicine sources that are informed by the possibility of local action in the gut or liver, leading to generation of systemic immune mediators.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Live imaging reveals the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activation</a></h4>

              
                SARM1 is an inducible NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase that triggers axon loss and neuronal cell death in the injured and diseased nervous system. While SARM1 activation and enzyme function are well defined, the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activity but prior to axonal demise are much less well understood. Defects in calcium, mitochondria, ATP, and membrane homeostasis occur in injured axons, but the relationships among these events have been difficult to disentangle because prior studies analyzed large collections of axons in which cellular events occur asynchronously. Here we used live imaging of mouse sensory neurons with single axon resolution to investigate the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activity. Our studies support a model in which SARM1 NADase activity leads to an ordered sequence of events from loss of cellular ATP, to defects in mitochondrial movement and depolarization, followed by calcium influx, externalization of phosphatidylserine, and loss of membrane permeability prior to catastrophic axonal self-destruction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mesoscale organization of syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 is determined by SNARE-SNARE-interactions</a></h4>

              
                SNARE proteins have been described as the effectors of fusion events in the secretory pathway more than two decades ago. The strong interactions between SNARE-domains are clearly important in membrane fusion, but it is unclear whether they are involved in any other cellular processes. Here, we analyzed two classical SNARE proteins, syntaxin 1A and SNAP25. Although they are supposed to be engaged in tight complexes, we surprisingly find them largely segregated in the plasma membrane. Syntaxin 1A only occupies a small fraction of the plasma membrane area. Yet, we find it is able to redistribute the far more abundant SNAP25 on the mesoscale by gathering crowds of SNAP25 molecules onto syntaxin-clusters in a SNARE-domain dependent manner. Our data suggests that SNARE-domain interactions are not only involved in driving membrane fusion on the nanoscale, but also play an important role in controlling the general organization of proteins on the mesoscale. Further, we propose this mechanisms preserves active syntaxin 1A-SNAP25 complexes at the plasma membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tracking the movement of discrete gating charges in a voltage-gated potassium channel</a></h4>

              
                Positively-charged amino acids respond to membrane potential changes to drive voltage sensor movement in voltage-gated ion channels, but determining the displacements of voltage sensor gating charges has proven difficult. We optically tracked the movement of the two most extracellular charged residues (R1, R2) in the Shaker potassium channel voltage sensor using a fluorescent positively-charged bimane derivative (qBBr) that is strongly quenched by tryptophan. By individually mutating residues to tryptophan within the putative pathway of gating charges, we observed that the charge motion during activation is a rotation and a tilted translation that differs between R1 and R2. Tryptophan-induced quenching of qBBr also indicates that a crucial residue of the hydrophobic plug is linked to the Cole-Moore shift through its interaction with R1. Finally, we show that this approach extends to additional voltage-sensing membrane proteins using the <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> voltage sensitive phosphatase (CiVSP) (Murata et al., 2005a).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phases of cortical actomyosin dynamics coupled to the neuroblast polarity cycle</a></h4>

              
                The Par complex dynamically polarizes to the apical cortex of asymmetrically dividing <i>Drosophila </i>neuroblasts where it directs fate determinant segregation. Previously we showed that apically directed cortical movements that polarize the Par complex require F-actin (Oon and Prehoda, 2019). Here we report the discovery of cortical actomyosin dynamics that begin in interphase when the Par complex is cytoplasmic but ultimately become tightly coupled to cortical Par dynamics. Interphase cortical actomyosin dynamics are unoriented and pulsatile but rapidly become sustained and apically-directed in early mitosis when the Par protein aPKC accumulates on the cortex. Apical actomyosin flows drive the coalescence of aPKC into an apical cap that is depolarized in anaphase when the flow reverses direction. Together with the previously characterized role of anaphase flows in specifying daughter cell size asymmetry, our results indicate that multiple phases of cortical actomyosin dynamics regulate asymmetric cell division.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Control of neurotransmitter release by two distinctmembrane-binding faces of the Munc13-1 C­1C2B region</a></h4>

              
                Munc13-1 plays a central role in neurotransmitter release through its conserved C-terminal region, which includes a diacyglycerol (DAG)-binding C<sub>1</sub> domain, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding C<sub>2</sub>B domain, a MUN domain and a C<sub>2</sub>C domain. Munc13-1 was proposed to bridge synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane through distinct interactions of the C­<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region with the plasma membrane: i) one involving a polybasic face that is expected to yield a perpendicular orientation of Munc13-1 and hinder release; and ii) another involving the DAG-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding face that is predicted to result in a slanted orientation and facilitate release. Here we have tested this model and investigated the role of the C­<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region in neurotransmitter release. We find that K603E or R769E point mutations in the polybasic face severely impair Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome bridging and fusion in in vitro reconstitution assays, and synaptic vesicle priming in primary murine hippocampal cultures. A K720E mutation in the polybasic face and a K706E mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops have milder effects in reconstitution assays and do not affect vesicle priming, but enhance or impair Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release, respectively. The phenotypes caused by combining these mutations are dominated by the K603E and R769E mutations. Our results show that the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region of Munc13-1 plays a central role in vesicle priming and support the notion that two distinct faces of this region control neurotransmitter release and short-term presynaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ZHX2 promotes HIF1α oncogenic signaling in triple-negative breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and highly lethal disease, which warrants the critical need to identify new therapeutic targets. We show that Zinc Fingers and Homeoboxes 2 (<i>ZHX2</i>) is amplified or overexpressed in TNBC cell lines and patients. Functionally, depletion of ZHX2 inhibited TNBC cell growth and invasion in vitro, orthotopic tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, ZHX2 bound with hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) family members and positively regulated HIF1a activity in TNBC. Integrated ChIP-Seq and gene expression profiling demonstrated that ZHX2 co-occupied with HIF1a on transcriptionally active promoters marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, thereby promoting gene expression. Among the identified ZHX2 and HIF1a co-regulated genes, overexpression of <i>AP2B1</i>, <i>COX20</i>, <i>KDM3A</i>, or <i>PTGES3L</i> could partially rescue TNBC cell growth defect by <i>ZHX2</i> depletion, suggested that these downstream targets contribute to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in an accumulative fashion. Furthermore, multiple residues (R491, R581 and R674) on ZHX2 are important in regulating its phenotype, which correspond with their roles on controlling ZHX2 transcriptional activity in TNBC cells. These studies establish that ZHX2 activates oncogenic HIF1a signaling, therefore serving as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glial Nrf2 signaling mediates the neuroprotection exerted by Gastrodia elata Blume in Lrrk2-G2019S Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The most frequent missense mutations in familial Parkinson's disease (PD) occur in the highly conserved <i>LRRK2/PARK8</i> gene with G2019S mutation. We previously established a fly model of PD carrying the <i>LRRK2-G2019S</i> mutation that exhibited the parkinsonism-like phenotypes. An herbal medicine-<i>Gastrodia elata</i> Blume (GE), has been reported to have neuroprotective effects in toxin-induced PD models. However, the underpinning molecular mechanisms of GE beneficiary to G2019S-induced PD remain unclear. Here, we show that these G2019S flies treated with water extracts of GE (WGE) and its bioactive compounds, gastrodin and 4-HBA, displayed locomotion improvement and dopaminergic neuron protection. WGE suppressed the accumulation and hyperactivation of G2019S proteins in dopaminergic neurons, and activated the antioxidation and detoxification factor Nrf2 mostly in the astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia. Glial activation of Nrf2 antagonizes G2019S-induced Mad/Smad signaling. Moreover, we treated <i>LRRK2-G2019S</i> transgenic mice with WGE and found the locomotion declines, the loss of dopaminergic neurons, and the number of hyperactive microglia were restored. WGE also suppressed the hyperactivation of G2019S proteins and regulated the Smad2/3 pathways in the mice brains. We conclude that WGE prevents locomotion defects and the neuronal loss induced by G2019S mutation via glial Nrf2/Mad signaling, unveiling a potential therapeutic avenue for PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Essential functions of MLL1 and MLL2 in retinal development and cone cell maintenance</a></h4>

              
                MLL1 (KMT2A) and MLL2 (KMT2B) are homologous members of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family of histone methyltransferases involved in epigenomic transcriptional regulation. Their sequence variants have been associated with neurological and psychological disorders, but little is known about their roles and mechanism of action in CNS development. Using mouse retina as a model, we previously reported the roles of MLL1 in retinal neurogenesis and horizontal cell maintenance. Here we determine roles of MLL2 and MLL1/MLL2 together in retinal development using conditional knockout (CKO) mice. Deleting Mll2 from Chx10+ retinal progenitors resulted in a similar phenotype as Mll1 CKO, but removal of both alleles produced much more severe deficits than each single CKO: 1-month double CKO mutants displayed null light responses in electroretinogram; thin retinal layers, including shorter photoreceptor outer segments with impaired phototransduction gene expression; and reduced numbers of M-cones, horizontal and amacrine neurons, followed by fast retinal degeneration. Despite moderately reduced progenitor cell proliferation at P0, the neurogenic capacity was largely maintained in double CKO mutants. However, upregulated apoptosis and reactive gliosis were detected during postnatal retinal development. Finally, the removal of both MLLs in fated rods produced a normal phenotype, but the CKO in M-cones impaired M-cone function and survival, indicating both cell non-autonomous and autonomous mechanisms. Altogether, our results suggest that MLL1/MLL2 play redundant roles in maintaining specific retinal neurons after cell fate specification and are essential for establishing functional neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning a new class of multisensory associations: High-density electrophysiological mapping of the temporal course of audio-visual object processing.</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory objects that are frequently encountered in the natural environment lead to strong associations across a distributed sensory cortical network, with the end result experience of a unitary percept. Remarkably little is known, however, about the cortical processes sub-serving multisensory object formation and recognition. To advance our understanding in this important domain, the present study investigated the brain processes involved in learning and identification of novel visual-auditory objects. Specifically, we introduce and test a rudimentary three-stage model of multisensory object-formation and processing. Thirty adults were remotely trained for a week to recognize a novel class of multisensory objects (3D shapes paired to complex sounds), and high-density event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to the corresponding unisensory (shapes or sounds only) and multisensory (shapes and sounds) stimuli, before and after intensive training. We identified three major stages of multisensory processing: 1) an early, multisensory, automatic effect (<100 ms) in occipital areas, related to the detection of simultaneous audiovisual signals and not related to multisensory learning 2) an intermediate object-processing stage (100-200 ms) in occipital and parietal areas, sensitive to the learned multi-sensory associations and 3) a late multisensory processing stage (>250 ms) that appears to be involved in both object recognition and possibly memory consolidation. Results from this study provide support for multiple stages of multisensory object learning and recognition that are subserved by an extended network of cortical areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Word structure tunes electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses in the frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                As a morphological impoverished language, how does word structure impact Chinese lexical processing in the brain? To address this issue, the current study examined the temporal signatures and localizations in the human brain for morphological priming effect (compound/derivation constitute priming vs. non-morphological priming) and word structure modulation (derivation vs. compound) in light of EEG-fNIRS fusion. Whilst morphological priming effect was manifested in behavioral performance and left prefrontal hemodynamic responses, word structure effect was prominent drawing on behavioral, ERP, and fNIRS data. Chinese derivations elicited greater activation in the frontal cortex and engaged more distributed network than lexicalized compounds. The results were interpreted by the differing connection patterns between constitute morphemes within a given word structure from spreading activation perspective. Together, Chinese word structure effect showed a distinct pattern from the dual-route mechanism in alphabetic languages. Meanwhile, the current study for the first time identified dissociable behavioral and neurophysiological responses of Chinese derivations and coordinate compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Repressing PTB is incapable to convert reactive astrocytes to dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Lineage reprograming of resident glia cells to induced dopaminergic neurons (iDAns) holds attractive prospect for cell-replacement therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, whether repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) could truly achieve efficient astrocyte-to-iDAn conversion in substantia nigra and striatum aroused widespread controversy. Although reporter+ iDAns were observed by two groups after delivering adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a reporter with shRNA or Crispr-CasRx to repress astroglial PTB, the possibility of AAV leaking into endogenous DAns could not be excluded without using a reliable lineage tracing method. By adopting stringent lineage tracing strategy, two other studies showed that neither knockdown nor genetic deletion of quiescent astroglial PTB fails to obtain iDAns under physiological condition. However, the role of reactive astrocyte might be underestimated since upon brain injury, reactive astrocyte could acquire certain stem cell hallmarks which may facilitate the lineage conversion process. Therefore, whether reactive astrocytes could be genuinely converted to DAns after PTB repression in a PD model needs further validation. In this study, we used Aldh1l1-CreERT2-mediated specific astrocyte-lineage tracing method to investigate whether reactive astrocytes could be converted to DAns in the 6-OHDA PD model. However, we found that no astrocyte-originated DAns was generated after effective knockdown of astroglial PTB either in the substantia nigra or in the striatum, while AAV leakage to nearby neurons was observed. Our results further confirmed that repressing PTB is unable to convert astrocytes to DA neurons no matter in physiological or PD-related pathological conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid reconstruction of neural circuits using tissue expansion and lattice light sheet microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Electron microscopy (EM) allows for the reconstruction of dense neuronal connectomes but suffers from low throughput, limiting its application to small numbers of reference specimens. We developed a protocol and analysis pipeline using tissue expansion and lattice light-sheet microscopy (ExLLSM) to rapidly reconstruct selected circuits across many samples with single synapse resolution and molecular contrast. We validate this approach in Drosophila, demonstrating that it yields synaptic counts similar to those obtained by EM, can be used to compare counts across sex and experience, and to correlate structural connectivity with functional connectivity. This approach fills a critical methodological gap in studying variability in the structure and function of neural circuits across individuals within and between species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Insightful inference compensates for distorted perception</a></h4>

              
                Introspective agents can recognize the extent to which their internal perceptual experiences deviate from the actual states of the external world. This ability, also known as insight, is critically required for reality testing and is impaired in psychosis, yet very little is known about its cognitive underpinnings. We developed a Bayesian modeling framework and a novel psychophysics paradigm to quantitatively characterize this type of insight while participants experienced a motion-aftereffect illusion. Participants could compensate for the illusion when judging the actual direction of a motion stimulus. Furthermore, confidence, reaction-time, and pupil-dilation data all showed signatures consistent with inferential adjustments in the Bayesian insight model. Our results suggest that people can question what they see and make insightful inferences that incorporate introspective knowledge about internal distortions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping of individual sensory nerve axons from digits to spinal cord with the Transparent Embedding Solvent System</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the connections and projections of neurons has been a fundamental issue for neuroscience. Although strategies have been developed to map the projection of individual axons within the mouse brain, high resolution mapping of individual peripheral nerve axons in peripheral organs or spinal cord has never been achieved. Here, we designed the Transparent Embedding Solvent System (TESOS) method and developed a technical pipeline for imaging, reconstructing and analyzing large samples containing various tissue types at sub-micron resolution. The mouse whole body was reconstructed at micron-scale resolution. We were able to image, reconstruct and analyze the complete axonal projection of individual sensory neurons within an intact mouse paw or spinal cord at sub-micron resolution. Furtherly, we imaged and reconstructed the entire projection course of individual sensory neurons from adult mouse digits to the spinal cord. The TESOS method provides an efficient tool for micron-scale connectome mapping of the peripheral nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale algorithmic search identifies stiff and sloppy dimensions in synaptic architectures consistent with murine neocortical wiring</a></h4>

              
                Complex systems can be defined by "sloppy" dimensions, meaning that their behavior is unmodified by large changes to specific parameter combinations, and "stiff" dimensions whose changes result in considerable modifications. In the case of the neocortex, sloppiness in synaptic architectures would be crucial to allow for the maintenance of spiking dynamics in the normal range despite a diversity of inputs and both short- and long-term changes to connectivity. Using simulations on neural networks with spiking matched to murine visual cortex, we determined the stiff and sloppy parameters of synaptic architectures across three classes of input (brief, continuous, and cyclical). Large-scale algorithmically-generated connectivity parameter values revealed that specific combinations of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity are stiff and that all other architectural details are sloppy. Stiff dimensions are consistent across a range of different input classes with self-sustaining synaptic architectures occupying a smaller subspace as compared to the other input classes. We also find that experimentally estimated connectivity probabilities from mouse visual cortex are similarly stiff and sloppy when compared to the architectures that we identified algorithmically. This suggests that simple statistical descriptions of spiking dynamics are a sufficient and parsimonious description of neocortical activity when examining structure-function relationships at the mesoscopic scale. Moreover, this study provides further evidence of the importance of the interrelationship of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity to establish and maintain stable spiking dynamical regimes in neocortex.

Significance StatementConnections between neurons are continuously changing to allow learning and adaptation to new stimuli. However, the ability of neural networks to vary these connections while avoiding excessively high- or low-activity states is still not well understood. We tackled this question by studying how changes in the parameters of connectivity within and between different neuronal populations impacted network activity in computational models. We identified specific combinations of parameters, deemed "stiff", that must be maintained to observe activity consistent with recordings from murine visual cortex, while the rest of the parameters can be varied freely with minimal effects on activity. Our results agree with experimentally measured connectivity statistics demonstrating the importance of balancing opposing forces to maintain activity in a natural regime.

                Having measurable physiological correlates, hypnosis should be measurable generally itself. The precise, continual, quantitative assessment (versus phenomenological one) of a current trance level (i.e., "depth") is possible only instrumentally. We've shown that electrophysiological patterns of a trance are stable from session to session, but significantly vary among subjects. Hence, to measure the trance level individually we proposed the following Brain-Computer interface approach and tested it on the 27 video-EEG recordings of 8 outpatients with anxiety and depressive disorders: on the data of the first session using Common Spatial Pattern filtering and Linear Discriminant Analysis classification, we trained the predictive models to discriminate conditions of "a wakefulness" and "a deep trance" and applied them to the subsequent sessions to predict the deep trance probability (in fact, to measure the trance level). We obtained integrative individualized continuously changing parameter reflecting the hypnosis level graphically online, providing the trance microdynamics control. The classification accuracy was high, especially while filtering the signal in 1.5-14 and 4-15 Hz. The applications and perspectives are being discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical-subcortical structural connections support transcranial magnetic stimulation engagement of the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala processes valenced stimuli, influences affective states, and exhibits aberrant activity across anxiety disorders, depression, and PTSD. Interventions that modulate amygdala activity hold promise for treating transdiagnostic affective symptoms. We investigated (N=45) whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) elicits indirect changes in amygdala activity when applied to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), a region important for affect regulation. Harnessing in-scanner interleaved TMS/functional MRI (fMRI), we reveal that vlPFC neurostimulation evoked acute, dose-dependent modulations of amygdala fMRI BOLD signal. Larger TMS-evoked changes in amygdala fMRI signal were associated with higher fiber density in a vlPFC-amygdala white matter pathway, suggesting this pathway facilitated stimulation-induced communication between cortex and subcortex. This work provides evidence of amygdala engagement by TMS, highlighting stimulation of vlPFC-amygdala circuits as a candidate treatment for affective psychopathology. More broadly, it indicates that targeting cortical-subcortical connections may enhance the impact of TMS on subcortical neural activity and, by extension, subcortex-subserved behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory processing sensitivity and axonal microarchitecture: Identifying brain structural characteristics for behavior</a></h4>

              
                Previously, researchers used functional MRI to identify regional brain activations associated with sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), a proposed normal phenotype trait. To further validate SPS as a behavioral entity, to characterize it anatomically, and to test the usefulness in psychology of methodologies that assess axonal properties, the present study correlated SPS proxy questionnaire scores (adjusted for neuroticism) with diffusion tensor imaging measures. Participants (n=408) from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project that are free of neurologic and psychiatric disorders were investigated. We computed mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). A voxelwise, exploratory analysis showed that MD and RD correlated positively with SPS proxy scores in the right and left subcallosal and anterior ventral cingulum bundle, and the right forceps minor of the corpus callosum (peak Cohens D effect size = 0.269). Further analyses showed correlations throughout the entire right and left ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate and arcuate fasciculus. These prefrontal regions are generally involved in emotion, reward and social processing. FA was negatively correlated with SPS proxy scores in white matter of the right premotor/motor/somatosensory/supramarginal gyrus regions, which are associated with empathy, theory of mind, primary and secondary somatosensory processing. Region of interest (ROI) analysis, based-on previous fMRI results and Freesurfer atlas-defined areas, showed small effect sizes, (+0.151 to -0.165) in white matter of the precuneus and inferior frontal gyrus. Other ROI effects were found in regions of the dorsal and ventral visual pathways and primary auditory cortex. The results reveal that in a large, diverse group of participants axonal microarchitectural differences can be identified with SPS traits that are subtle and in the range of typical behavior. The results suggest that the heightened sensory processing in people who show SPS may be influenced by the microstructure of white matter in specific neocortical regions. Although previous fMRI studies had identified most of these general neocortical regions, the DTI results put a new focus on brain areas related to attention and cognitive flexibility, empathy, emotion and low-level sensory processing, as in the primary sensory cortex. Psychological trait characterization may benefit from diffusion tensor imaging methodology by identifying influential brain systems for traits.

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain. The complement-phagosome pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Here we measured levels of complement-phagocytosis molecules, including galectin-3, C3, C4, and cathepsin D, in the plasma of 56 patients with PD, and 46 normal controls (NCs). Plasma levels of galectin-3 (9.93 ± 3.94 ng/mL) were significantly higher in PD patients compared with NCs (8.39 ± 1.95 ng/mL, p = 0.012), and demonstrated a positive correlation with Hoehn and Yahr stages in PD patients (R2 = 0.218, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). On the other hand, plasma C3 levels were significantly lower in PD patients (305.27 ± 205.16 μg/mL) compared with NCs (444.34 ± 245.54 μg/mL, p = 0.002). However, the levels did not correlate with Hoehn and Yahr stages (R2 = 0.010, p = 0.469). Plasma levels of C4 and cathepsin D in PD patients were similar to those in NCs. Our results show possible altered complement-phagocytosis signals in the peripheral blood of PD patients, highlighting the potential of galectin-3 as a biomarker of PD.</p>

	<p>Peripheral inflammation plays a key role in the development of depression-like behaviors. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the level of citrullinated histone H3 (cit-H3) significantly increased in the plasma of wildtype mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which indicated that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were formed. Moreover, the LPS-induced depression-like and asocial behaviors were significantly alleviated in the mice deficient of NETs. Mechanistically, NETs formation aggravated peripheral inflammation by increasing the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in plasma, which are major proinflammatory cytokines that can enter the brain, resulting in microglia activation and reduced astrocytes. Following this, increased TNF-α and IL-1β were released into brain, inducing neuroinflammation and finally depression-like behaviors. Prohibiting NETs by PAD4 ablation significantly prevented LPS-induced microglia activation and the loss of astrocytes. Our results propose the role for peripheral NETs in LPS-induced depression-like behavior, and that NETs might be a potential target to prevent inflammation-induced major depressive disorder.</p>

	<p>Categorization based on quasi-joint stiffness (QJS) may help clinicians select appropriate ankle foot orthoses (AFOs). The objectives of the present study were to classify the gait pattern based on ankle joint stiffness, also called QJS, of the gait in patients after stroke and to clarify differences in the type of AFO among 72 patients after stroke. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify gait patterns based on QJS at least one month before the study, which revealed three distinct subgroups (SGs 1, 2, and 3). The proportion of use of AFOs, articulated AFOs, and non-articulated AFOs were significantly different among SGs 1–3. In SG1, with a higher QJS in the early and middle stance, the proportion of the patients using articulated AFOs was higher, whereas in SG3, with a lower QJS in both stances, the proportion of patients using non-articulated AFOs was higher. In SG2, with a lower QJS in the early stance and higher QJS in the middle stance, the proportion of patients using AFOs was lower. These findings indicate that classification of gait patterns based on QJS in patients after stroke may be helpful in selecting AFO. However, large sample sizes are required to confirm these results.</p>
