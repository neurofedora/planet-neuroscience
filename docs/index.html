                arXiv:2502.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural population activity exhibits complex, nonlinear dynamics, varying in time, over trials, and across experimental conditions. Here, we develop Conditionally Linear Dynamical System (CLDS) models as a general-purpose method to characterize these dynamics. These models use Gaussian Process (GP) priors to capture the nonlinear dependence of circuit dynamics on task and behavioral variables. Conditioned on these covariates, the data is modeled with linear dynamics. This allows for transparent interpretation and tractable Bayesian inference. We find that CLDS models can perform well even in severely data-limited regimes (e.g. one trial per condition) due to their Bayesian formulation and ability to share statistical power across nearby task conditions. In example applications, we apply CLDS to model thalamic neurons that nonlinearly encode heading direction and to model motor cortical neurons during a cued reaching task

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17172">Teleology-Driven Affective Computing: A Causal Framework for Sustained Well-Being</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.17172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affective computing has made significant strides in emotion recognition and generation, yet current approaches mainly focus on short-term pattern recognition and lack a comprehensive framework to guide affective agents toward long-term human well-being. To address this, we propose a teleology-driven affective computing framework that unifies major emotion theories (basic emotion, appraisal, and constructivist approaches) under the premise that affect is an adaptive, goal-directed process that facilitates survival and development. Our framework emphasizes aligning agent responses with both personal/individual and group/collective well-being over extended timescales. We advocate for creating a "dataverse" of personal affective events, capturing the interplay between beliefs, goals, actions, and outcomes through real-world experience sampling and immersive virtual reality. By leveraging causal modeling, this "dataverse" enables AI systems to infer individuals' unique affective concerns and provide tailored interventions for sustained well-being. Additionally, we introduce a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm to train agents in simulated environments, allowing them to adapt to evolving affective concerns and balance hierarchical goals - from immediate emotional needs to long-term self-actualization. This framework shifts the focus from statistical correlations to causal reasoning, enhancing agents' ability to predict and respond proactively to emotional challenges, and offers a foundation for developing personalized, ethically aligned affective systems that promote meaningful human-AI interactions and societal well-being.

                arXiv:2502.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy logic provides a robust framework for enhancing explainability, particularly in domains requiring the interpretation of complex and ambiguous signals, such as brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Despite significant advances in deep learning, interpreting human emotions remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we present iFuzzyAffectDuo, a novel computational model that integrates a dual-filter fuzzy neural network architecture for improved detection and interpretation of emotional states from neuroimaging data. The model introduces a new membership function (MF) based on the Laplace distribution, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches. By refining the extraction of neural signals associated with specific emotions, iFuzzyAffectDuo offers a human-understandable framework that unravels the underlying decision-making processes. We validate our approach across three neuroimaging datasets using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalography (EEG), demonstrating its potential to advance affective computing. These findings open new pathways for understanding the neural basis of emotions and their application in enhancing human-computer interaction.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17464">Large Cognition Model: Towards Pretrained EEG Foundation Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.17464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography provides a non-invasive window into brain activity, offering valuable insights for neurological research, brain-computer interfaces, and clinical diagnostics. However, the development of robust machine learning models for EEG analysis is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets and the inherent variability of EEG signals across subjects and recording conditions. Inspired by the success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision, we propose the Large Cognition Model-a transformer-based foundation model designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and downstream tasks. Unlike traditional approaches, our proposed transformer-based architecture demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across datasets and tasks, even without pretraining, surpassing some existing EEG universal models on specific downstream applications. LCM leverages large-scale self-supervised learning techniques to capture universal EEG representations, enabling efficient fine-tuning for applications such as cognitive state decoding, disease classification, and neurofeedback systems. We introduce a novel architecture that integrates temporal and spectral attention mechanisms, optimizing the model's ability to extract meaningful features from raw EEG signals. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LCM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple EEG benchmarks, exhibiting strong cross-subject and cross-task generalization. Our findings highlight the potential of pretrained EEG foundation models to accelerate advancements in neuroscience, personalized medicine, and BCI technology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17762">A digital eye-fixation biomarker using a deep anomaly scheme to classify Parkisonian patterns</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.17762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oculomotor alterations constitute a promising biomarker to detect and characterize Parkinson's disease (PD), even in prodromal stages. Currently, only global and simplified eye movement trajectories are employed to approximate the complex and hidden kinematic relationships of the oculomotor function. Recent advances on machine learning and video analysis have encouraged novel characterizations of eye movement patterns to quantify PD. These schemes enable the identification of spatiotemporal segments primarily associated with PD. However, they rely on discriminative models that require large training datasets and depend on balanced class distributions. This work introduces a novel video analysis scheme to quantify Parkinsonian eye fixation patterns with an anomaly detection framework. Contrary to classical deep discriminative schemes that learn differences among labeled classes, the proposed approach is focused on one-class learning, avoiding the necessity of a significant amount of data. The proposed approach focuses only on Parkinson's representation, considering any other class sample as an anomaly of the distribution. This approach was evaluated for an ocular fixation task, in a total of 13 control subjects and 13 patients on different stages of the disease. The proposed digital biomarker achieved an average sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.63, respectively, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.95. A statistical test shows significant differences (p < 0.05) among predicted classes, evidencing a discrimination between patients and control subjects.

                arXiv:2502.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stroboscopic light stimulation (SLS) on closed eyes typically induces simple visual hallucinations (VHs), characterised by vivid, geometric and colourful patterns. A dataset of 862 sentences, extracted from 422 open subjective reports, was recently compiled as part of the Dreamachine programme (Collective Act, 2022), an immersive multisensory experience that combines SLS and spatial sound in a collective setting. Although open reports extend the range of reportable phenomenology, their analysis presents significant challenges, particularly in systematically identifying patterns. To address this challenge, we implemented a data-driven approach leveraging Large Language Models and Topic Modelling to uncover and interpret latent experiential topics directly from the Dreamachine's text-based reports. Our analysis confirmed the presence of simple VHs typically documented in scientific studies of SLS, while also revealing experiences of altered states of consciousness and complex hallucinations. Building on these findings, our computational approach expands the systematic study of subjective experience by enabling data-driven analyses of open-ended phenomenological reports, capturing experiences not readily identified through standard questionnaires. By revealing rich and multifaceted aspects of experiences, our study broadens our understanding of stroboscopically-induced phenomena while highlighting the potential of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models in the emerging field of computational (neuro)phenomenology. More generally, this approach provides a practically applicable methodology for uncovering subtle hidden patterns of subjective experience across diverse research domains.

                arXiv:2211.15278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past few decades, there have been intense debates whether the brain operates at a critical state. To verify the criticality hypothesis in the neuronal networks is challenging and the accumulating experimental and theoretical results remain controversial at this point. Here we simulate how visual information of a nature image is processed by the finite Kinouchi-Copelli neuronal network, extracting the trends of the mutual information (how sensible the neuronal network is), the dynamical range (how sensitive the network responds to external stimuli) and the statistical fluctuations (how criticality is defined in conventional statistical physics). It is rather remarkable that the optimized state for visual recognition, although close to, does not coincide with the critical state where the statistical fluctuations reach the maximum. Different images and/or network sizes of course lead to differences in details but the trend of the information optimization remains the same. Our findings pave the first step to investigate how the information processing is optimized in different neuronal networks and suggest that the criticality hypothesis may not be necessary to explain why a neuronal network can process information smartly.

                arXiv:2403.17687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.

                arXiv:2502.15104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In both artificial and biological systems, the centered kernel alignment (CKA) has become a widely used tool for quantifying neural representation similarity. While current CKA estimators typically correct for the effects of finite stimuli sampling, the effects of sampling a subset of neurons are overlooked, introducing notable bias in standard experimental scenarios. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis showing how this bias is affected by the representation geometry. We then introduce a novel estimator that corrects for both input and feature sampling. We use our method for evaluating both brain-to-brain and model-to-brain alignments and show that it delivers reliable comparisons even with very sparsely sampled neurons. We perform within-animal and across-animal comparisons on electrophysiological data from visual cortical areas V1, V4, and IT data, and use these as benchmarks to evaluate model-to-brain alignment. We also apply our method to reveal how object representations become progressively disentangled across layers in both biological and artificial systems. These findings underscore the importance of correcting feature-sampling biases in CKA and demonstrate that our bias-corrected estimator provides a more faithful measure of representation alignment. The improved estimates increase our understanding of how neural activity is structured across both biological and artificial systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15634">Sparks of cognitive flexibility: self-guided context inference for flexible stimulus-response mapping by attentional routing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible cognition demands discovering hidden rules to quickly adapt stimulus-response mappings. Standard neural networks struggle in such tasks requiring rapid, context-driven remapping. Recently, Hummos (2023) introduced a fast-and-slow learning algorithm to mitigate this shortcoming, but its scalability to complex, image-computable tasks was unclear. Here, we propose the Wisconsin Neural Network (WiNN), which extends Hummos' fast-and-slow learning to image-computable tasks demanding flexible rule-based behavior. WiNN employs a pretrained convolutional neural network for vision, coupled with an adjustable "context state" that guides attention to relevant features. If WiNN produces an incorrect response, it first iteratively updates its context state to refocus attention on task-relevant cues, then performs minimal parameter updates to attention and readout layers. This strategy preserves generalizable representations in the sensory and attention networks, reducing catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate WiNN on an image-based extension of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, revealing several markers of cognitive flexibility: (i) WiNN autonomously infers underlying rules, (ii) requires fewer examples to do so than control models reliant on large-scale parameter updates, (iii) can perform context-based rule inference solely via context-state adjustments-further enhanced by slow updates of attention and readout parameters, and (iv) generalizes to unseen compositional rules through context-state updates alone. By blending fast context inference with targeted attentional guidance, WiNN achieves "sparks" of flexibility. This approach offers a path toward context-sensitive models that retain knowledge while rapidly adapting to complex, rule-based tasks.

                arXiv:2409.03749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of a brain or a neural network to efficiently learn depends crucially on both the task structure and the learning rule. Previous works have analyzed the dynamical equations describing learning in the relatively simplified context of the perceptron under assumptions of a student-teacher framework or a linearized output. While these assumptions have facilitated theoretical understanding, they have precluded a detailed understanding of the roles of the nonlinearity and input-data distribution in determining the learning dynamics, limiting the applicability of the theories to real biological or artificial neural networks. Here, we use a stochastic-process approach to derive flow equations describing learning, applying this framework to the case of a nonlinear perceptron performing binary classification. We characterize the effects of the learning rule (supervised or reinforcement learning, SL/RL) and input-data distribution on the perceptron's learning curve and the forgetting curve as subsequent tasks are learned. In particular, we find that the input-data noise differently affects the learning speed under SL vs. RL, as well as determines how quickly learning of a task is overwritten by subsequent learning. Additionally, we verify our approach with real data using the MNIST dataset. This approach points a way toward analyzing learning dynamics for more-complex circuit architectures.

                arXiv:2502.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of lexicase selection has led to various extensions, including its combination with down-sampling, which further increased performance. However, recent work found that down-sampling also leads to significant improvements in the performance of tournament selection. This raises the question of whether tournament selection combined with down-sampling is the better choice, given its faster running times. To address this question, we run a set of experiments comparing epsilon-lexicase and tournament selection with different down-sampling techniques on synthetic problems of varying noise levels and problem sizes as well as real-world symbolic regression problems. Overall, we find that down-sampling improves generalization and performance even when compared over the same number of generations. This means that down-sampling is beneficial even with way fewer fitness evaluations. Additionally, down-sampling successfully reduces code growth. We observe that population diversity increases for tournament selection when combined with down-sampling. Further, we find that tournament selection and epsilon-lexicase selection with down-sampling perform similar, while tournament selection is significantly faster. We conclude that tournament selection should be further analyzed and improved in future work instead of only focusing on the improvement of lexicase variants.

                arXiv:2502.17496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this era of AI revolution, massive investments in large-scale data-driven AI systems demand high-performance computing, consuming tremendous energy and resources. This trend raises new challenges in optimizing sustainability without sacrificing scalability or performance. Among the energy-efficient alternatives of the traditional Von Neumann architecture, neuromorphic computing and its Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising choice due to their inherent energy efficiency. However, in some real-world application scenarios such as complex continuous control tasks, SNNs often lack the performance optimizations that traditional artificial neural networks have. Researchers have addressed this by combining SNNs with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL), yet scalability remains unexplored. In this paper, we extend our previous work on SpikeRL, which is a scalable and energy efficient framework for DeepRL-based SNNs for continuous control. In our initial implementation of SpikeRL framework, we depended on the population encoding from the Population-coded Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN) method for our SNN model and implemented distributed training with Message Passing Interface (MPI) through mpi4py. Also, further optimizing our model training by using mixed-precision for parameter updates. In our new SpikeRL framework, we have implemented our own DeepRL-SNN component with population encoding, and distributed training with PyTorch Distributed package with NCCL backend while still optimizing with mixed precision training. Our new SpikeRL implementation is 4.26X faster and 2.25X more energy efficient than state-of-the-art DeepRL-SNN methods. Our proposed SpikeRL framework demonstrates a truly scalable and sustainable solution for complex continuous control tasks in real-world applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17844">LeanKAN: A Parameter-Lean Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Layer with Improved Memory Efficiency and Convergence Behavior</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.17844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is a promising alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for data-driven modeling. While original KAN layers were only capable of representing the addition operator, the recently-proposed MultKAN layer combines addition and multiplication subnodes in an effort to improve representation performance. Here, we find that MultKAN layers suffer from a few key drawbacks including limited applicability in output layers, bulky parameterizations with extraneous activations, and the inclusion of complex hyperparameters. To address these issues, we propose LeanKANs, a direct and modular replacement for MultKAN and traditional AddKAN layers. LeanKANs address these three drawbacks of MultKAN through general applicability as output layers, significantly reduced parameter counts for a given network structure, and a smaller set of hyperparameters. As a one-to-one layer replacement for standard AddKAN and MultKAN layers, LeanKAN is able to provide these benefits to traditional KAN learning problems as well as augmented KAN structures in which it serves as the backbone, such as KAN Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) or Deep Operator KANs (DeepOKAN). We demonstrate LeanKAN's simplicity and efficiency in a series of demonstrations carried out across both a standard KAN toy problem and a KAN-ODE dynamical system modeling problem, where we find that its sparser parameterization and compact structure serve to increase its expressivity and learning capability, leading it to outperform similar and even much larger MultKANs in various tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07275">Multi-compartment Neuron and Population Encoding Powered Spiking Neural Network for Deep Distributional Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2301.07275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the brain's information processing using binary spikes, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer significant reductions in energy consumption and are more adept at incorporating multi-scale biological characteristics. In SNNs, spiking neurons serve as the fundamental information processing units. However, in most models, these neurons are typically simplified, focusing primarily on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) point neuron model while neglecting the structural properties of biological neurons. This simplification hampers the computational and learning capabilities of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired deep distributional reinforcement learning algorithm based on SNNs, which integrates a bio-inspired multi-compartment neuron (MCN) model with a population coding approach. The proposed MCN model simulates the structure and function of apical dendritic, basal dendritic, and somatic compartments, achieving computational power comparable to that of biological neurons. Additionally, we introduce an implicit fractional embedding method based on population coding of spiking neurons. We evaluated our model on Atari games, and the experimental results demonstrate that it surpasses the vanilla FQF model, which utilizes traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), as well as the Spiking-FQF models that are based on ANN-to-SNN conversion methods. Ablation studies further reveal that the proposed multi-compartment neuron model and the quantile fraction implicit population spike representation significantly enhance the performance of MCS-FQF while also reducing power consumption.

                arXiv:2408.02340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to simultaneously locate multiple global peaks and achieve certain accuracy on the found peaks are two key challenges in solving multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs). In this paper, a landscape-aware differential evolution (LADE) algorithm is proposed for MMOPs, which utilizes landscape knowledge to maintain sufficient diversity and provide efficient search guidance. In detail, the landscape knowledge is efficiently utilized in the following three aspects. First, a landscape-aware peak exploration helps each individual evolve adaptively to locate a peak and simulates the regions of the found peaks according to search history to avoid an individual locating a found peak. Second, a landscape-aware peak distinction distinguishes whether an individual locates a new global peak, a new local peak, or a found peak. Accuracy refinement can thus only be conducted on the global peaks to enhance the search efficiency. Third, a landscape-aware reinitialization specifies the initial position of an individual adaptively according to the distribution of the found peaks, which helps explore more peaks. The experiments are conducted on 20 widely-used benchmark MMOPs. Experimental results show that LADE obtains generally better or competitive performance compared with seven well-performed algorithms proposed recently and four winner algorithms in the IEEE CEC competitions for multimodal optimization.

                arXiv:2405.15618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), the remarkable ability to solve a task from only input exemplars, is often assumed to be a unique hallmark of Transformer models. By examining commonly employed synthetic ICL tasks, we demonstrate that multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can also learn in-context. Moreover, MLPs, and the closely related MLP-Mixer models, learn in-context comparably with Transformers under the same compute budget in this setting. We further show that MLPs outperform Transformers on a series of classical tasks from psychology designed to test relational reasoning, which are closely related to in-context classification. These results underscore a need for studying in-context learning beyond attention-based architectures, while also challenging prior arguments against MLPs' ability to solve relational tasks. Altogether, our results highlight the unexpected competence of MLPs in a synthetic setting, and support the growing interest in all-MLP alternatives to Transformer architectures. It remains unclear how MLPs perform against Transformers at scale on real-world tasks, and where a performance gap may originate. We encourage further exploration of these architectures in more complex settings to better understand the potential comparative advantage of attention-based schemes.

Abstract: We propose a new concept, Evolution 6.0, which represents the evolution of robotics driven by Generative AI. When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.

Functional magnetic resonance data from 551 children in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database were analyzed, focusing on six dopamine-related brain regions as regions of interest. Functional connectivity between these ROIs and across the whole brain was assessed. Machine learning techniques then evaluated the ability of the dopamine system’s imaging features to predict autism spectrum disorder. Functional connectivity was significantly higher in autism spectrum disorder children between the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and between the substantia nigra and hypothalamus compared to typically developing children. Additionally, clustering methods identified two autism spectrum disorder subtypes, achieving over 0.8 accuracy. Subtype 1 showed higher stereotyped behavior scores than subtype 2 in both genders, with subtype-specific functional connectivity differences between male and female autism spectrum disorder groups. These findings suggest that abnormal functional connectivity in the dopamine system serves as a diagnostic biomarker for autism spectrum disorder and can support clinical decision-making and personalized treatment optimization.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Qualitatively different topographical patterns of connections are thought to underlie individual differences in thought and behavior, particularly at heteromodal association areas. As such, we hypothesized that connections unique to 16p11.2 deletion carriers compared to controls, rather than hyper- or hypo-connectivity, would serve as a better model to explain the cognitive and behavioral changes observed in individuals carrying this autism-risk copy number variation. Using a spatially-unbiased, data-driven approach we found that differential links clustered non-uniformly across the cortex—particularly at the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, posterior insula, cingulate sulcus, and inferior parietal lobule bilaterally. At these hotspots, altered local connectivity that spanned across the borders of cortical large-scale networks coincided with aberrant distant interconnectivity between large-scale networks. This was most evident between the auditory and the dorsomedial default (DNb) networks—such that greater between-network interconnectivity was associated with greater communication and social impairment. Entangled connectivity between large-scale networks may preclude each network from having the necessary fidelity to operate properly, particularly when the 2 networks have opposing organization principles—namely, local specialization (segregation) versus global coherency (integration).</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), is regulated by the excitatory amino acid transporters glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST). Following traumatic brain injury, extracellular glutamate levels increase, contributing to excitotoxicity, circuit dysfunction, and morbidity. Increased neuronal glutamate release and compromised astrocyte-mediated uptake contribute to elevated glutamate, but the mechanistic and spatiotemporal underpinnings of these changes are not well established. Using the controlled cortical impact model of TBI and iGluSnFR glutamate imaging, we quantified extracellular glutamate dynamics after injury. Three days postinjury, glutamate release was increased, and glutamate uptake and GLT-1 expression were reduced. Seven and 14 days postinjury, glutamate dynamics were comparable between sham and controlled cortical impact animals. Changes in peak glutamate response were unique to specific cortical layers and proximity to injury. This was likely driven by increases in glutamate release, which was spatially heterogeneous, rather than reduced uptake, which was spatially uniform. The astrocyte K<sup>+</sup> channel, Kir4.1, regulates activity-dependent slowing of glutamate uptake. Surprisingly, Kir4.1 was unchanged after controlled cortical impact and accordingly, activity-dependent slowing of glutamate uptake was unaltered. This dynamic glutamate dysregulation after traumatic brain injury underscores a brief period in which disrupted glutamate uptake may contribute to dysfunction and highlights a potential therapeutic window to restore glutamate homeostasis.</span>

This study used a mock purchase task to investigate consumer decision-making and its underlying neurological mechanisms when purchasing gifts of different prices for recipients with varying levels of intimacy. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to record neural activity during the task. Behavioral results found that the lover group had a much higher purchasing rate than the friend group, particularly when acquiring premium products. Analysis of the functional near-infrared spectroscopy data found that neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex decreased when items were discounted, with lower activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in lovers during the purchasing of premium products. Furthermore, we identified significant differences in functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex under different conditions. We compared the support vector machine algorithm and logistic regression, finding that logistic regression better predicts purchasing tendencies based on neuroactivation levels. In our view, a stronger emotional connection leads to a more rewarding experience for consumers when buying premium products. This study reveals the impact of intimate relationships on consumer decision-making and provides guidance for businesses in developing marketing strategies targeted at the lover’s market.</span>

                Background Darwin assumed that the peacock’s long train was maladaptive and was the indirect effect of selection by female mate choice based on the train’s beauty. While a relationship between the feathers’ elaborate features and mating success has been shown in some studies, what features of the train females are attracted to remains controversial. Methods We used museum specimens to examine the anatomical plan underlying feather development responsible for the train’s symmetry. We developed a model based on an alternate arrangement of primordial feather buds during development and locations of concentric circles of eyespot distribution using the pattern on the train as a template. Results We observed a zigzag pattern of feather follicles that determined both the number and the arrangement of eyespots on the train. Our model explains the bilateral symmetry of train feathers, the hexagonal arrangement of eyespots on the train, and the concentric color rings of the eyespots. While the zigzag pattern explains the symmetry, complexity, and (structural) beauty of the peacock’s train, it also precludes variation in eyespot number except by annual addition of new feathers as a function of age. Conclusions We propose a multimodal model of mate choice which holds that (1) eyespot number and feather length are developmentally correlated and females see them not as separate traits but as one complex trait combining both, (2) females may not always choose males with the largest number of eyespots, as old males may lack vigor, and (3) females may choose mates on the basis of train size, vigor, and beauty. The maladaptation of the long tail is a byproduct of the adaptation of the tall train. Who would have thought that zigzag arrangement, the densest form of spherical packing, when applied to the living world would produce such profound effects on phenotypic diversity.

                <p>The adrenal medulla is packed with chromaffin cells, modified postganglionic sympathetic neurons that secrete the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, during the fight-or-flight response. Sometimes overlooked is a population of immune cells that also resides within the gland but whose distribution and function are not clear. Here I examine the location of CD45+ hematopoietic cells in the mouse adrenal medulla and show the majority are F4/80+/Lyz2+ macrophages. These cells are present from early postnatal development and widely distributed. Anatomically they are associated with chromaffin cells, found aligned alongside synapsin-IR neuronal varicosities and juxtaposed to CD31-IR blood vessels. Using Lyz2cre-GCaMP6f mice to quantify calcium signaling in macrophages revealed these cells respond directly and indirectly to a wide variety of neuromodulators, including pre- and postganglionic transmitters and systemic hormones. Purinergic agonists, histamine, acetylcholine, and bradykinin rapidly and reversibly increased intracellular calcium. These results are consistent with a substantial resident population of innate immune cells in the adrenal medulla. Their close association with chromaffin cells and the preganglionic input suggests they may regulate sympatho-adrenal activity and thus the strength of the fight-or-flight response.</p>

                Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for human-computer interaction, particularly through eye-gesture recognition, enabling intuitive control for users and accessibility for individuals with physical impairments. Methods We developed an AI-driven eye-gesture recognition system using tools like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to translate eye movements into commands. The system was trained on a dataset of 20,000 gestures from 100 diverse volunteers, representing various demographics, and tested under different conditions, including varying lighting and eyewear. Results The system achieved 99.63% accuracy in recognizing gestures, with slight reductions to 98.9% under reflective glasses. These results demonstrate its robustness and adaptability across scenarios, confirming its generalizability.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002990">Synovial joints were present in the common ancestor of jawed fish but lacking in jawless fish</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Neelima Sharma, Yara Haridy, Neil Shubin</p>

Synovial joints, characterized by reciprocally congruent and lubricated articular surfaces separated by a cavity, can simultaneously provide mobility and load bearing. Here, we study the early evolution of synovial joints by examining the morphological, genetic, and molecular features required for the development and function of the joints in elasmobranchs and cyclostomes. We show the presence of cavitated and articulated joints in the skeleton of elasmobranchs, such as the little skate (<i>Leucoraja erinacea</i>) and bamboo shark (<i>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</i>). However, our results do not support the presence of articular cavities between cartilaginous elements in cyclostomes such as sea lampreys (<i>Petromyozon marinus</i>) and hagfish (<i>Myxine glutinosa</i>). Immunostaining reveals the expression of lubrication-related proteoglycans like aggrecan and glycoproteins such as hyaluronic acid receptor (CD44) at the articular surfaces in little skates. Analysis of joint development in little skate embryos shows the expression of growth differentiation factor-5 (Gdf5) and <i>β</i>-catenin at the joint interzones like tetrapods. Muscle paralysis in little skate embryos leads to joint fusion, suggesting that muscle activity is necessary for the formation of synovial cavity and development of normal articular surfaces, in a manner similar to zebrafish and tetrapods. Together, these data suggest that synovial joints originated in the common ancestor of extant gnathostomes. A review of fossils from the extinct clades along the gnathostome stem suggests that joints with reciprocally articulating surfaces arose in the dermal skeleton of the common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates. Synovial joints in cartilaginous tissue were a subsequent gnathostome innovation.

                Background Syphilis is a cosmopolitan infection, with recent infections (primary or secondary syphilis <1 year) posing the highest risk of mother-to-child transmission. In such cases, early treatment is crucial in determining obstetric prognosis. Objective This study aims to present current data and improve the management of syphilis in pregnant women in the city of Kisangani. Methods This is an analytical case-control study covering the period from July 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023. The study was conducted at Makiso Kisangani General Referral Hospital, with a study population of 976 pregnant women. A non-exhaustive sampling method was used, selecting a sample of 145 pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis and 145 others diagnosed with out syphilis. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.3. Results The prevalence of syphilis during pregnancy was 16.9%. The most represented age group was 20 to 34 years (61.4%). The majority of pregnant women with syphilis were married (61.4%), in monogamous relationships (72.4%), and had unemployed partners (26.9%). The most common risk factors were having a partner who was a driver (OR: 3.31; p = 0.028), a trader (OR: 8.08; p <0.001), and having a history of STIs (p <0.001) or multiple sexual partners (p = 0.011). In 75% of cases, pregnancy resulted in the birth of a live fetus. Conclusion The prevalence of syphilis among pregnant women in the city of Kisangani is on the rise compared to previous years. Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with syphilis could be reduced through early detection and standard treatment of syphilis for pregnant women and their husbands/sexual partners.

                Background Most antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, largely in children under 5 years old, and often inappropriately. This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and behaviours (KABs) towards common childhood infections, antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), among parents of children under 5 years old. The concept of individual sacrifice (forgoing antibiotics—a selective pressure for AMR) to mitigate future societal risk of AMR and how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped views were explored. Methods This qualitative study included three, one-hour, virtual focus groups with mothers from parenting networks across inner-city London and semi-rural England, held mid-pandemic (2020). All had ≥1 child <5 years old. The Framework Method of analysis was used. Parents’ KABs towards antibiotic use/AMR formed the primary outcome, with emphases on their sense of personal agency towards mitigating the threat of AMR for society, plus how the pandemic influenced views on infection prevention and care. Results Fourteen mothers (groups of six, four, four) participated, with mixed ethnicities, education and employment status. Parent perceptions of their individual child’s immediate need for antibiotics outweighed concerns for any possible future threat of AMR to society. Four key themes were identified: uncertainty around symptoms; impact of socio-cultural background on KAB; poor understanding of how antibiotics/AMR work; and opportunities within the doctor–patient dialogue to shape mindset around AMR. The pandemic influenced views across themes. Conclusion Parents prioritising their child’s perceived, immediate, individual ‘need’ for antibiotics over any future impact of AMR on society highlights a continuing need to engage parents in how to mitigate AMR through appropriate antibiotic use, reducing threat to both their child and others. Framing point-of-care dialogue around antibiotic use/AMR in the present (versus future), drawing on pandemic insights and tailoring according to nuanced socio-cultural influences, may encourage a greater sense of personal agency towards taking action to mitigate antibiotic resistance.

                Background This study investigates the implementation of non-formal educational programs for refugees, which have been implemented in the last seven years in Greek islands in the North and South Aegean Sea. Its main aim is to examine the types of the learning that take place in these educational environments, according to a certain strand of Adult Education (AE) theories, which classifies learning according to whether it is focused on: a) the learner, b) knowledge, c) assessment, or d) the learning community. Methods The study’s methodology is based on the implementation of semi-structured individual interviews, and, through this effort, an attempt is made to develop a broader reflection in relation to the objectives of language education for adult refugees in Greece and to assess the validity of the above framework for the case of AE for refugees in Greece. The research is based on reflections by volunteer educators, who have extensive teaching experience in non-formal educational environments. Results The study showed that the composition of classes characterized by linguistic diversity favors the design of teaching interventions that give meaning to the learning needs of refugees (learner-centered learning) and the creation of a learning community (community-centered learning), and that these interventions utilize the principles of inclusion, differentiated teaching, as well as experiential and work-based learning. Conclusions The findings of the present study reveal that the field of language learning for adults—especially refugees—is increasingly connected not only to communication and survival needs, but also to identity construction, a process involving significant “border crossing” in geographical, legal, social, and psychological terms.

                Failure to reject a null-hypothesis may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the absence of an association or inadequate statistical power. Because an estimate (and its variance) can never be exactly zero, traditional statistical tests cannot conclusively demonstrate the absence of an association. Instead, estimates of accuracy should be used to identify settings in which an association and its variability are sufficiently small to be clinically acceptable, directly providing information on safety and efficacy. Post-hoc power calculations should be avoided, as they offer no additional information beyond statistical tests and p-values. Furthermore, post-hoc power calculations can be misleading because of an inability to distinguish between results based on insufficient sample size and results that reflect clinically irrelevant differences. Most multiple testing procedures unrealistically assume that all positive results are false positives. However, in applied settings, results typically represent a mix of true and false positives. This implies that multiplicity corrections do not effectively differentiate between true and false positives. Instead, considering the distributions of p-values and the proportion of significant results can help to identify bodies of evidence unlikely to be driven by false-positive results. In conclusion, rather than attempting to categorize results as true or false, medical research should embrace established statistical methods that focus on estimation accuracy, replication, and consistency.

                Background The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought transformative benefits across industries, yet it also presents significant security challenges due to the proliferation of connected devices. Methods This study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) model leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect and classify multiple types of IoT attacks, including distributed denial of service (DDoS), reconnaissance, brute force, spoofing, and Mirai attacks, using the CICIoT2023 dataset. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets to ensure accurate performance assessment. After training, the models were tested, and their effectiveness was evaluated through metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices. Results and conclusions Among the algorithms used, the decision tree model outperformed than others, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.34%. In contrast, Bayes classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression achieved accuracy rates of 92%, 91.5%, and 75%, respectively. These results highlight the significant potential of machine learning techniques in detecting and mitigating various IoT attacks, offering promising avenues for enhancing IoT security. The improvement of the performance of the IoT attack detection model using large datasets and the appropriate using deep learning algorithms with their parameters will be our future consideration in the domain.

                Background Maxillofacial fractures, frequently arising from road traffic incidents, falls, and acts of interpersonal aggression, are a considerable public health issue, exhibiting diverse epidemiological patterns according to demographic factors. The application of miniplates for fracture stabilization is a recognized technique, with innovative methods such as 3D plate systems emerging. Nonetheless, consequences including infections and hardware malfunctions persist. This systematic review seeks to present current evidence regarding the complications linked to miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures over the last ten years. Methods A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA principles. Databases such as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus were examined from September 2014 to September 2024. Studies documenting problems related to miniplate placement were included, without language constraints. The ROBINS-I tool was utilized for non-randomized studies, whereas the Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to randomized controlled trials. Results From 2,289 initially found studies, 56 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among these, 28 employed interventional designs, whilst the remaining 28 were observational research. The predominant problems documented in several investigations encompassed infection, wound dehiscence, malocclusion, paraesthesia, malunion/non-union, segment movement, hardware failure, and palpable hardware. Advanced methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms were linked to diminished complication rates. Conclusion This systematic analysis presents a decade of updated research about problems associated with miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures. Novel methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms demonstrate promise in mitigating problems relative to conventional techniques. These findings can facilitate informed decision-making in clinical practice. Additional study utilizing standardized outcomes and prospective designs is essential to enhance comprehension of the long-term effects of miniplate utilization.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The entorhinal cortex sends afferent information to the hippocampus by means of the perforant path (PP). The PP input to the dentate gyrus (DG) terminates in the suprapyramidal (sDG) and infrapyramidal (iDG) blades. Different electrophysiological stimulation patterns of the PP can generate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Whether frequency-dependent synaptic plasticity differs in the sDG and iDG is unclear. Here, we compared medial PP–DG responses in freely behaving adult rats and found that synaptic plasticity in the sDG is broadly frequency dependent, whereby long-term depression (LTD, &gt; 24 h) is induced with stimulation at 1 Hz, short-term depression (&lt; 2 h) is triggered by 5 or 10 Hz, and long-term potentiation (LTP) of increasing magnitudes is induced by 200 and 400 Hz stimulation, respectively. By contrast, although the iDG expresses STD following 5 or 10 Hz stimulation, LTD induced by 1 Hz is weaker, LTP is not induced by 200 Hz and LTP induced by 400 Hz stimulation is significantly smaller in magnitude than LTP induced in sDG. Furthermore, the stimulus–response relationship of iDG is suppressed compared to sDG. These differences may arise from differences in granule cell properties, or the complement of NMDA receptors. Patch clamp recordings, in vitro, revealed reduced firing frequencies in response to high currents, and different action potential thresholds in iDG compared to sDG. Assessment of the expression of GluN subunits revealed significantly lower expression levels of GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B in the middle molecular layer of iDG compared to sDG. Taken together, these data indicate that synaptic plasticity in the iDG is weaker, less persistent and less responsive to afferent frequencies than synaptic plasticity in sDG. Effects may be mediated by weaker NMDA receptor expression and differences in neuronal responses in iDG versus sDG. These characteristics may explain reported differences in experience-dependent information processing in the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades of the DG.</p>

     alt="Mammalian Retinal Bipolar Cells: Morphological Identification and Systematic Classification in Rabbit Retina With a Comparative Perspective"/>
<p>A total pf 772 cone bipolar cells from 11 Golgi-impregnated rabbit retinas were analyzed morphometrically and classified according to dendritic branching pattern and axon terminal morphology, dendritic and axon terminal field sizes, based upon camera lucida drawings, and level of axon terminal stratification, with reference to overlapping starburst amacrine and fiducial ganglion cells. Sixteen types were characterized, and these were compared with bipolar cells in mouse, monkey and ground squirrel retinas.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) convey visual signals from photoreceptors to more than 50 types of rabbit retinal ganglion cells (Famiglietti, 2020). More than 40 years ago, 10–11 types of bipolar cells were recognized in rabbit and cat retinas (Famiglietti, 1981). Twenty years later, 10 were identified in mouse, rat, and monkey, while recent molecular genetic studies indicate that there are 15 types of bipolar cell in mouse retina (Shekhar et al., 2016). The present detailed study of more than 800 bipolar cells in 11 Golgi-impregnated rabbit retinas indicates that there are 14–16 types of cone bipolar cell and one type of rod bipolar cell in rabbit retina. These have been carefully analyzed in terms of dendritic and axonal morphology and axon terminal stratification with respect to fiducial starburst amacrine cells. In fortuitous proximity, several types of bipolar cell can be related to identified ganglion cells by stratification and by contacts suggestive of synaptic connection. These results are compared with other studies of rabbit bipolar cells. Homologies with bipolar cells of mouse and monkey are considered in functional terms.</p>

                'Brain fog' is commonly reported in more than a dozen chronic diseases, but what is it? We review research across conditions which has characterised brain fog and evaluate its definitions and objective correlates. Brain fog has been used to refer to a variable set of overlapping symptoms implicating cognition, fatigue, and affect. It has been defined as a distinct symptom, a syndrome, or a nonspecific term. We consider the evidence that brain fog is a transdiagnostic entity with a common phenomenology and profile of objective cognitive deficits. We discuss where these commonalities arise and argue that linguistic ambiguity, shared cognitive impairments, and noncognitive factors are more likely than shared neurobiology. We suggest how future research might apply existing tools to disambiguate the phenomena that brain fog conflates.

Increasing neuronal PUFA levels increased survival of Drosophila models of ALS/FTD and patient neurons, suggesting that interventions that increase neuronal PUFA levels in patients with ALS/FTD may also be beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88468">A statistical framework for quantifying the nuclear export rate of influenza viral mRNAs</a></h4>

              
                Influenza A virus transcribes viral mRNAs from the eight segmented viral genome when it infects. The kinetics of viral transcription, nuclear export of viral transcripts, and their potential variation between the eight segments are poorly characterised. Here, we introduce a statistical framework for estimating the nuclear export rate of each segment from a snapshot of <i>in situ</i> mRNA localisation. This exploits the cell-to-cell variation at a single time point observed by an imaging-based <i>in situ</i> transcriptome assay. Using our model, we revealed the variation in the mRNA nuclear export rate of the eight viral segments. Notably, the two influenza viral antigens hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were the slowest segments in the nuclear export, suggesting the possibility that influenza A virus uses the nuclear retention of viral transcripts to delay the expression of antigenic molecules. Our framework presented in this study can be widely used for investigating the nuclear retention of nascent transcripts produced in a transcription burst.

                Environmental factors can influence ecological networks, but these effects are poorly understood in the realm of the phylogeny of host-parasitoid interactions. Especially, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the ways that biotic factors, including plant species richness, overall community phylogenetic and functional composition of consumers, and abiotic factors such as microclimate, determine host-parasitoid network structure and host-parasitoid community dynamics. To address this, we leveraged a 5-year dataset of trap-nesting bees and wasps and their parasitoids collected in a highly controlled, large-scale subtropical tree biodiversity experiment. We tested for effects of tree species richness, tree phylogenetic, and functional diversity, and species and phylogenetic composition on species and phylogenetic diversity of both host and parasitoid communities and the composition of their interaction networks. We show that multiple components of tree diversity and canopy cover impacted both, species and phylogenetic composition of hosts and parasitoids. Generally, phylogenetic associations between hosts and parasitoids reflected nonrandomly structured interactions between phylogenetic trees of hosts and parasitoids. Further, host-parasitoid network structure was influenced by tree species richness, tree phylogenetic diversity, and canopy cover. Our study indicates that the composition of higher trophic levels and corresponding interaction networks are determined by plant diversity and canopy cover, especially via trophic links in species-rich ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97511">Aeromonas hydrophila CobQ is a new type of NAD+- and Zn2+-independent protein lysine deacetylase</a></h4>

              
                Protein N<sup>Ɛ</sup>-lysine acetylation (Kac) modifications play crucial roles in diverse physiological and pathological functions in cells. In prokaryotic cells, there are only two types of lysine deacetylases (KDACs) that are Zn<sup>2+</sup>- or NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent. In this study, we reported a protein, AhCobQ, in <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> ATCC 7966 that presents NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent KDAC activity. Furthermore, its KDAC activity is located in an unidentified domain (from 195 to 245 aa). Interestingly, AhCobQ has no homology with current known KDACs, and no homologous protein was found in eukaryotic cells. A protein substrate analysis showed that AhCobQ has specific protein substrates in common with other known KDACs, indicating that these KDACs can dynamically co-regulate the states of Kac proteins. Microbiological methods employed in this study affirmed AhCobQ’s positive regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) enzymatic activity at the K388 site, implicating AhCobQ in the modulation of bacterial enzymatic activities. In summary, our findings present compelling evidence that AhCobQ represents a distinctive type of KDAC with significant roles in bacterial biological functions.

                The T6SS of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> plays an essential role in the establishment of chronic infections. Inflammasome-mediated inflammatory cytokines are crucial for host defense against bacterial infections. We found that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection activates the non-canonical inflammasome in macrophages, yet it inhibits the downstream activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The VgrG2b of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is recognized and cleaved by caspase-11, generating a free C-terminal fragment. The VgrG2b C-terminus can bind to NLRP3, inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by rejecting NEK7 binding to NLRP3. Administration of a specific peptide that inhibits caspase-11 cleavage of VgrG2b significantly improves mouse survival during infection. Our discovery elucidates a mechanism by which <i>P. aeruginosa</i> inhibits host immune response, providing a new approach for the future clinical treatment of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97765">Precision-based causal inference modulates audiovisual temporal recalibration</a></h4>

              
                Cross-modal temporal recalibration guarantees stable temporal perception across ever-changing environments. Yet, the mechanisms of cross-modal temporal recalibration remain unknown. Here, we conducted an experiment to measure how participants’ temporal perception was affected by exposure to audiovisual stimuli with constant temporal delays that we varied across sessions. Consistent with previous findings, recalibration effects plateaued with increasing audiovisual asynchrony (nonlinearity) and varied by which modality led during the exposure phase (asymmetry). We compared six observer models that differed in how they update the audiovisual temporal bias during the exposure phase and in whether they assume a modality-specific or modality-independent precision of arrival latency. The causal-inference observer shifts the audiovisual temporal bias to compensate for perceived asynchrony, which is inferred by considering two causal scenarios: when the audiovisual stimuli have a common cause or separate causes. The asynchrony-contingent observer updates the bias to achieve simultaneity of auditory and visual measurements, modulating the update rate by the likelihood of the audiovisual stimuli originating from a simultaneous event. In the asynchrony-correction model, the observer first assesses whether the sensory measurement is asynchronous; if so, she adjusts the bias proportionally to the magnitude of the measured asynchrony. Each model was paired with either modality-specific or modality-independent precision of arrival latency. A Bayesian model comparison revealed that both the causal-inference process and modality-specific precision in arrival latency are required to capture the nonlinearity and asymmetry observed in audiovisual temporal recalibration. Our findings support the hypothesis that audiovisual temporal recalibration relies on the same causal-inference processes that govern cross-modal perception.

">A computational architecture incorporating shallow brain networks: integrating parallel cortical and subcortical processing</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks commonly have deep hierarchical structures that were originally inspired by the neuroanatomical evidence of cortico-cortical connectivity pattern found in the mammalian brain. Largely neglected in those models are non-hierarchical aspects of brain architecture, namely the subcortical pathways and the interactions between cortical and subcortical areas regardless of their hierarchical locations. Inspired by this principle, we present a computational model combining cortical hierarchical processing with subcortical pathways based on neuroanatomical evidence. We show the versatility of our model by implementing the cortical hierarchy in two alternative ways-a convolutional feedforward network and a predictive coding network. Both model variants can replicate behavioral observations in humans and monkeys on a perceptual context-dependent decision-making task. The model also reveals that subcortical structures lead decisions for easy trials while the more complex hierarchical network is necessary for the harder trials. Our results suggest that the parallel cortico-subcortical processing explored in the model represents a fundamental property that cannot be neglected in understanding the computational principles used by the brain.

">Super Quantum Neuroelectromagnetic Dynamics of Action and Percept Potentials</a></h4>

              
                The spatiotemporal selectivity of neurons to sensory stimuli that underlie the center and surround receptive fields represents the anticommutative and, thus, symmetry that defines sensorimotor transformation. However, owing to the nonabelian nature of the irresponsiveness of neurons to sensory stimuli characterized by inexcitations, symmetry and, thus, transformation does not become apparent. Hence, a neuroscientific model that describes the precise mechanism of the nonabelian gauge group in the brain is unknown. Using quantum field theory, we show visuomotor transformation of natural images in which the superposition of opposite parallel cortical columns creates visual fields and annihilates motor fields. The creation and annihilation operators, magnetic and electric charged particles, are opposed inertia systems that act on each other by raising and lowering each other's particles, leading to momentum-energy trade-offs, in our case, retinotopic gain and retinomotion loss, and vice versa. The magnetic charged particles -, +, -, intrinsic to a magnetic neuron, nabla, are predicted to exist opposite parallel to the electrically charged particles +, -, + of the electrical pyramidal neuron in the neocortex. The implication is that the physical neocortex or electric brain is in concert with a nonphysical complex neocortex or magnetic brain that is hardly detectable but much alive and proactive.

                The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by neurodegeneration and atrophy in particular brain regions, especially in the temporal cortex. However, the influence of genetic risk on cortical thickness in non-demented individuals prior to disease onset remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between two AD risk genes (APOE/PICALM) and cortical thickness in selected regions of interest (ROIs) in non-demented, middle-aged individuals. Sixty-nine (N = 69) participants (34 females, 35 males; age: 55.45{+/-}3.19) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They were divided into three groups based on their AD risk. Cortical thickness was analyzed using CAT12 software (surface-based morphometry with the Destrieux atlas) based on T1-weighted MR images in five ROIs referred as "the cortical signature of AD" in previous studies. APOE-e4 with PICALM-AA/AG carriers (A+P-) are characterized by a thinner cortex in the right temporal pole compared to non-carriers, controlling for sex. No other differences in cortical thickness were found in the selected ROIs. The direction of the findings aligns with existing literature reporting cortical thinning in amyloid-positive individuals, as well as in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease when compared to control groups.

">Fractional and Geometric Neural Dynamics: Investigating Intelligence-Related Differences in EEG Symmetry and Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding intelligence-related variations in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity requires advanced mathematical approaches capable of capturing geometric transformations and long-range dependencies in neural dynamics. These approaches may provide methodological advantages over conventional spectral and connectivity-based techniques by offering deeper insights into the structural and functional organization of neural networks. In this study, we integrate Clifford algebra, Noether's theorem and fractional calculus to analyze EEG signals from high- and low-IQ individuals, looking for key intelligence-related differences in cortical organization. Clifford algebra enables the representation of EEG signals as multivectors, preserving both magnitude and directional relationships across cortical regions. Noether's theorem provides a quantitative measure of symmetry properties linked to spectral features, identifying conserved functional patterns across distinct brain regions. Mittag-Leffler functions, derived from fractional calculus, characterize long-range dependencies in neural oscillations, allowing for the detection of memory effects and scale-invariant properties often overlooked by traditional methods. We found significant differences between high- and low-IQ individuals in geometric trajectories, hemispheric connectivity, spectral properties and fractional-order dynamics. High-IQ individuals exhibited increased spectral asymmetry, enhanced spectral differentiation, distinct geometric trajectories and greater fractional connectivity, particularly in frontal and central regions. In contrast, low-IQ individuals displayed more uniform hemispheric connectivity and heightened fractional activity in occipital areas. Mittag-Leffler fractional exponents further indicated that high-IQ individuals possessed more varied neural synchronization patterns. Overall, our multi-faceted approach suggests that intelligence-related neural dynamics are characterized by an asymmetric, functionally specialized and fractionally complex cortical organization. This results in significant differences in network topology, efficiency, modularity and long-range dependencies.

">Metabolic state modulates risky foraging behavior via multiple branches of the insulin/IGF-1-like pathway in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Foraging to acquire nutrients is an essential and sometimes risky behavior displayed by nearly all animals. Appropriately balancing foraging risks with nutrient requirements is pivotal for peak survival and reproduction, and metabolic state (i.e., how urgently the animal requires nutrients) is a strong modulator of risky foraging behavior. In this study, we asked what molecular signal allows C. elegans to change its foraging behavior in response to changes in its metabolic state. We used an assay of risky foraging behavior, where wild type worms increase risky foraging behavior after food deprivation, to screen for candidate genes. We found that DAF-2, the singular receptor in the C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, is necessary for worms to modulate risky foraging behavior in response to short-term food deprivation. Worms with mutations in genes upstream and downstream of daf-2 in the IIS pathway also exhibited a reduction in the effect of food deprivation. While a canonical understanding of the IIS pathway would suggest that the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is the primary downstream IIS pathway target, we found that DAF-16 was not required for worms to exhibit food-deprivation-driven changes in foraging behavior. Furthermore, we determined that the calsyntenin ortholog CASY-1, which allows DAF-2c to traffic to axons, is required for food deprivation to modulate risky foraging behavior. These results both validate the IIS receptor as a pivotal regulator of risky foraging behavior and suggest a multi-pronged downstream pathway. Overall, these data enrich our understanding of how organisms transduce metabolic state information to make vital decisions about when to engage in risky foraging behaviors.

">Tryptophan metabolites as biomarkers to predict the severity and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke patients</a></h4>

              
                Background: A growing body of evidence indicates alterations in metabolite levels and enzyme activities associated with the conversion of tryptophan (TRP) throughout the course of cerebral ischemia. In this study we aim to explore the potential relationship between TRP metabolism and clinical prognosis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients of mainland China. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from a cohort of 304 AIS patients. The concentrations of ten TRP metabolites were quantified utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. LASSO regression and random forest algorithms were employed to identify key TRP metabolism parameters associated with prognosis. Results: The metabolites TRP, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTP), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA)/3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HKYN) showed a negative correlation with the NIHSS score, while 3-HKYN, kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-HKYN/kynurenine (KYN), KYN/TRP, KYNA/KYN, 3-HKYN/TRP, N-formylkynurenine (NFK)/TRP and KYNA/TRP ratio exhibited a positive correlation with the NIHSS score. Three robust parameters related to TRP metabolism were identified. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for covariates, revealed that TRP (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26 - 0.76, p = 0.004), the KYN/TRP ratio (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.23 - 3.60, p = 0.008), and the KYNA/TRP ratio (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.23 - 4.12, p = 0.014) were independently associated with poor functional prognosis. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that TRP metabolism is associated with the severity and prognosis of AIS. The TRP, KYN/TRP ratio and KYNA/TRP ratio may serve as potential biomarkers for 3-month prognostic evaluation.

">A piece of evidence for pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease caused by blood-brain barrier dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Background: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction caused by endothelial cell injury is one of the widely accepted pathogenesis of small cerebral vessel disease (CSVD). However, the early microcirculation studies were notably deficient in providing compelling imaging evidence, which has hampered a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological processes underlying BBB dysfunction in CSVD. The onset of CSVD is insidious and the clinical manifestations are diverse, diagnosis of CSVD relies primarily on neuroimaging information currently. These MRI imaging features mainly represent the end-stage brain parenchyma injury, rather than the vascular lesion itself. Therefore, clarifying the pathophysiological processes related to cerebral microcirculation in CSVD is of great significance for early treatment intervention of CSVD. Methods: Twenty rats were used to prepare CSVD animal model by ultrasound combined with ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent. MRI, functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging and ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) were used to evaluate microcirculation changes in acute and chronic models. Results: Currently, our research has successfully validated that the imaging characteristics of this model align with the four established criteria outlined in the STRIVE-2 classification. FUS shows increased microflow velocity in the molding area, which can be used for initial evaluation of CSVD models in the acute phase. ULM has revealed a progressive reduction in the density of both the short cortical arteries and the long medullary arteries, along with their respective branches, over time. Concurrently, there has been a noted deviation in blood flow velocity. Conclusion: This model offers compelling evidence at the microvascular level, suggesting that blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a central pathophysiological mechanism in the etiology of CSVD. Then it provides a straightforward, efficient, and widely applicable tool and continuous monitoring method for the further investigation of CSVD from the macroscopic to the microscopic circulation level, with significant long-term implications for CSVD diagnosis and treatment.

">Explainable AI techniques for dynamic functional brain imaging: validation and analysis of E/I imbalance in autism</a></h4>

              
                Deep neural networks are increasingly crucial for analysing dynamic functional brain imaging data, offering unprecedented accuracy in distinguishing brain activity patterns across health and disease. However, they often function as black boxes obscuring the neurobiological features driving classifications between groups. This study systematically investigates explainable AI (xAI) methods to address this challenge, employing two complementary simulation approaches: recurrent neural networks for controlled parameter exploration, and The Virtual Brain for biophysically realistic whole-brain modelling. These simulations generate fMRI datasets with known regional alterations in excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, mimicking mechanisms implicated in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Our comprehensive validation demonstrates that Integrated Gradients and DeepLift successfully identify ground-truth affected regions across challenging conditions, including high noise (-10dB SNR), low prevalence (1% of regions), and subtle E/I alterations. This performance remains robust across three different attribution methods and baseline choices, establishing the reliability of xAI for functional neuroimaging analysis. Critically, successful cross-species validation using both human (68-region) and mouse (426-region) connectomes demonstrates the approach's ability to detect mechanistic alterations across different scales of brain organization. Application to the multisite ABIDE resting-state fMRI dataset (N=834) reveals that regions within the default mode network, particularly the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, most clearly differentiated children with autism from neurotypical controls. The convergence between these empirical findings and our biophysical simulations of E/I imbalance provides computational support for mechanistic theories of E/I imbalance in autism while demonstrating how xAI can bridge cellular-level mechanisms with clinical biomarkers. This work establishes a framework for reliable interpretation of deep neural network models in functional neuroimaging, with implications for understanding brain disorders and developing targeted brain stimulation strategies.

">Activity Protects Spinal Premotor Interneurons from Microglial Phagocytosis and Transneuronal Degeneration After Corticospinal Injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal premotor circuits play a fundamental role in motor control. The corticospinal tract (CST) provides control signals to premotor circuits in the spinal cord, guiding voluntary skilled movements. Unilateral selective lesion of the CST in the medullary pyramidal tract (PTX) produces transneuronal degeneration, whereby Choline Acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT) premotor interneurons contralesionally undergo non-apoptotic degeneration by microglial phagocytosis. Evidence shows that transneuronal degeneration has an activity dependence: MCX inactivation produces transneuronal degeneration and spinal DC neuromodulation after PTX ameliorates it. This study expands our understanding of transneuronal degeneration mechanisms by examining the activity-dependence of degeneration vulnerability and the implications for motor recovery in a mouse model of a complete CST lesion model (bilateral PTX). We address four key unanswered questions: Are Chx10 (VGlut2) interneurons, the largest spinal interneuron class to receive direct synaptic connections from the CST vulnerable to transneuronal degeneration after CST loss; using DREADD neuromodulation, what are effective sources of presynaptic activation for protecting spinal premotor interneurons after CST loss; how are ameliorating transneuronal interneuron degeneration and reducing microglial activation associated; and does effective rescue of interneuron degeneration rescue grip strength after injury? Transneuronal degeneration is a pervasive pathophysiological change injury; CST lesion produces significant Chx10 interneuron loss. Multiple sources of neuronal DREADD activation--motor cortex, reticular formation, and spinal interneurons--are effective in ameliorating transneuronal degeneration. Interneuron rescue is strongly associated with ameliorating inflammation, showing potential causality between interneuron degeneration and inflammation after CST lesion. Finally, rescuing spinal interneurons was associated with restoring function. Our findings demonstrate the interplay between neuronal activity, microglia actions mediating transneuronal degeneration, and motor recovery following CNS injury.

">Ketogenic interventions prevent alterations of the gut microbiome in transgenic Alzheimer Disease mice</a></h4>

              
                Alterations in the gut microbiome constitute a feature of aging and therefore represent a therapeutic target for aging-related diseases. In this study, we investigated the impact of ketogenic interventions on the microbiome of mice genetically predisposed to Alzheimer disease (AD). AD mice exhibited several microbial alterations, notably increased levels of Bifidobacterium and decreased levels of Bacteroidetes. Ketogenic interventions, either a medium-chain triglyceride-enriched diet (MCT) or carbohydrate-free high-fat diet (CFHF), administered for 1 month restored the levels of more than 50% of the bacteria altered in AD mice, including a strong reduction in Bifidobacterium levels. Ketogenic interventions induced a shift in the gut microbiome associated with increased levels of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae and Muribaculaceae. MCT and CFHF also triggered diet-specific microbial changes, which may contribute to the distinct physiological effects of these diets. In conclusion, ketogenic interventions may influence AD pathophysiology by modulating the gut microbiome.

">Lifespan Mapping of EEG Source Spectral Dynamics with Xi-AlphaNET</a></h4>

              
                We formulate a new class of parametric, multivariate, and structurally informed spectral components model of the EEG, the Xi-AlphaNET, that allows us to map the Lifespan of EEG source spectral dynamics across a large data set of EEG cross spectrum at high spatial resolution. This approach accurately estimates source spectral components and effective connectivity through the use of biophysical modeling while maintaining computational efficiency, as confirmed by simulation benchmarks. We are able to analyze source dynamics with a resolution of 8,003 voxels from the HarMNqEEG dataset, which includes scalp EEG cross-spectrum tensors collected from 1965 subjects across 9 countries, using various devices and accounting for different age groups. Our findings indicate that the Bayesian Model Inversion of the Xi-AlphaNET allows to map Lifespan of conduction delays that follows a U-shaped trajectory, which contrasts with independently recorded myelin concentration measurements. Moreover, we assess the spatiotemporal distribution of spectral components, revealing that the aperiodic or fractal component has an isotropic spatial distribution on the cortical surface. While the generator's spectral peak in the alpha band, i.e., alpha-rythms, is localized on the visual areas of the brain. Using a Zero Inflated Gaussian model, our findings indicate that the mode frequency that characterizes the alpha-rythms or Peak Alpha Frequency shows an inverted U-shaped trajectory for both hemispheres across the Lifespan and a spatial gradient of zero inflation in PAF across the cortex that flattens the trajectory from posterior to frontal areas. We provide both the code of the Xi-AlphaNET and the source solution of the spectral dynamics for the HarMNqEEG.

">Cluster replicability in single-cell and single-nucleus atlases of the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell RNA sequencing has advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. Ensuring the replicability of identified cell clusters across studies is essential for determining their biological robustness. We assess the replicability of cell clusters identified in two large mouse brain atlases, one generated using single-cell RNA sequencing and the other with single nuclei. Both profile over 4 million cells and group them into over 5000 clusters. Using transcriptome-wide neighbor voting, we identify 2009 reciprocally matched cluster pairs with consistent spatial localization and coordinated gene expression, which were also observed in datasets from multiple species. Reciprocal clusters are enriched in the cerebellum, where lower diversity aids replicability, while the hypothalamus's heterogeneity limits agreement. Distinguishing close clusters is much more challenging than differentiating a cluster from most others, especially when using marker genes. By incorporating replicability data, we provide a stronger foundation for investigating the newly identified clusters and their biological meaning.

">MuFIX - Enabling Combinations of Concurrent Optogenetics and Lock-in Amplification Fiber Photometry via Removal of Optogenetic Stimulation Crosstalk</a></h4>

              
                Simultaneous fiber photometry and optogenetics is a powerful emerging technique for precisely studying the interactions of neuronal brain networks. However, spectral overlap between photometry and optogenetic components has severely limited the application of an all-optical approach. Due to spectral overlap, light from optogenetic stimulation saturates the photosensor and occludes photometry fluorescence, which is especially problematic in physically smaller model organism brains like mice. Here, we demonstrate the Multi-Frequency Interpolation X-talk removal algorithm (MuFIX) for recovering crosstalk-contaminated photometry responses recorded with lock-in amplification. MuFIX exploits multi-frequency lock-in amplification by modeling the remaining uncontaminated data to interpolate across crosstalk-affected segments (R2 ~ 1.0); we found that this approach accurately recovers the original photometry response after demodulation (Pearson's r ~ 1.0). When applied to crosstalk-contaminated data, MuFIX recovered a photometry response closely resembling the dynamics of non-crosstalk photometry recorded simultaneously. Upon further verification using simulated and empirical data, we demonstrated that MuFIX reproduces any signal that underwent simulated crosstalk contamination (r ~ 1.0). We believe adopting MuFIX will enable experimental designs using simultaneous fiber photometry and optogenetics that were previously not feasible due to crosstalk.

                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is well-established for its ability to induce synaptic plasticity. However, its impact on structural and functional remodeling within stimulated networks remains not well-understood. To bridge the gap between cellular and network-level effects, we investigated plasticity mechanisms in entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures subjected to a clinically approved 600-pulse intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS600) protocol. Using a comprehensive methodological approach---including c-Fos immunostaining, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, time-lapse imaging of dendritic spines, and calcium imaging---we conducted a 24-hour analysis of iTBS600-rMS induced plasticity. We observed long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses in dentate granule cells, accompanied by transient c-Fos expression in the dentate gyrus, but not in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3. Structural remodeling of dendritic spines was temporally linked to enhanced synaptic transmission, while spontaneous firing rates remained stable, reflecting the engagement of homeostatic mechanisms. Despite the widespread electric field generated by rTMS, its effects were spatially and temporally precise, driving Hebbian plasticity and region-specific spine dynamics. These findings provide critical insight into how rTMS-induced LTP mediates targeted plasticity while preserving network stability, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the persistent effects of rTMS.

">Morphine self-administration induces region-specific brain volume changes and microglial phenotypic alterations without affecting neuronal density in male Wistar rats</a></h4>

              
                Addiction to opioids, including morphine, is a major public health crisis in the U.S. It has been associated with brain volume changes in reward-related regions, neuronal death, and neuroinflammation. However, the link between structural changes and neuroinflammation is not well understood. In this study, we used operant conditioning to induce morphine self-administration in rats and examined brain volume and cellular changes, focusing on microglial phenotypes. Male Wistar rats were conditioned to morphine self-administration (0.01 mg/kg) for 20 days under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule. In vivo structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were conducted at the beginning and end of self-administration. Brains were stained for Iba1 and NeuN proteins, and confocal images were analyzed for cell counts and microglial morphology. We used Deformation-Based Morphometry for MRI volume analysis and Principal Component Analysis with K-means clustering for microglial phenotyping. Our results showed that morphine self-administration led to volume changes in addiction-related brain regions, including increased globus pallidus and decreased insular cortex volume. Additionally, morphine caused widespread neuroinflammation, evidenced by elevated microglial density in the caudate-putamen, dentate gyrus, globus pallidus, and insular cortex, without affecting neuron counts. Finally, we observed region-specific variations in microglial phenotypes, suggesting region-specific neuroinflammatory roles. In conclusion, our study shows that morphine self-administration induces structural and microglial changes in addiction-related brain regions without neuronal loss, highlighting the role of neuroinflammation in opioid-induced adaptations. The variability in microglial phenotypes underscores their complexity, emphasizing the need to study their progression in addiction and their potential as therapeutic targets.

">Sex-differences in catecholamine transporter expression in the rodent prefrontal cortex following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury and methylphenidate treatment</a></h4>

              
                Irregular catecholamine transmitter activity is theorized to underly impaired prefrontal cortex (PFC)-mediated executive functions following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI). The psychostimulant, methylphenidate (MPH), enhances catecholamine neurotransmission by blocking reuptake transporters and is used off-label to treat post-TBI executive dysfunction. Although rmTBI and MPH have been shown to independently alter catecholamine transporter levels, the present report evaluated the interactive effects of rmTBI and a sub-chronic therapeutic dose of MPH on expression levels of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) and norepinephrine reuptake transporter (NET) within subregions of the PFC in both male and female rats. Treatment with MPH restored rmTBI-induced reductions in transporter expression in females. However, in males subjected to rmTBI, MPH exacerbated reductions in transporter expression within the PFC. These results suggest MPH treatment produces beneficial effects in females but exaggerates pathological outcomes in males when used to treat post-rmTBI symptoms.

">Apolipoprotein E abundance is elevated in the brains of individuals with Down syndrome-Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Trisomy of chromosome 21, the cause of Down syndrome (DS), is the most commonly occurring genetic cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we compare the frontal cortex proteome of people with Down syndrome-Alzheimer's disease (DSAD) to demographically matched cases of early-onset AD and healthy ageing controls. We find wide dysregulation of the proteome, beyond proteins encoded by chromosome 21, including an increase in the abundance of the key AD-associated protein, APOE, in people with DSAD compared to matched cases of AD. To understand the cell types that may contribute to changes in protein abundance, we undertook a matched single-nuclei RNA-sequencing study, which demonstrated that APOE expression was elevated in subtypes of astrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes in DSAD. We further investigate how trisomy 21 may cause increased APOE. Increased abundance of APOE may impact the development of, or response to, AD pathology in the brain of people with DSAD, altering disease mechanisms with clinical implications. Overall, these data highlight that trisomy 21 alters both the transcriptome and proteome of people with DS in the context of AD, and that these differences should be considered when selecting therapeutic strategies for this vulnerable group of individuals who have high-risk of early-onset dementia.

">The glare illusion in individuals with schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with schizophrenia are known to demonstrate unique reactions to visual illusions, and prior research has indicated a potential link between their increased susceptibility to geometric illusions and specific symptom profiles. While various illusory experiences have been examined among individuals with schizophrenia, their responses to brightness-related illusions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how individuals with schizophrenia perceive the glare illusion, in which the apparent brightness of the central region is increased. A total of 30 patients with schizophrenia and 34 control participants were recruited. During each trial, a glare or control image (standard stimulus) was presented alongside a control image (comparison stimulus) with one of seven luminance levels. In the glare condition, the standard stimulus was a glare image; in the control condition, two control images were presented, but only the luminance of the comparison stimulus varied. The participants were asked to judge which central region appeared brighter. The results revealed that the individuals with schizophrenia exhibited greater susceptibility to the glare illusion than did the control participants. However, no significant associations were found between susceptibility to the glare illusion and scores assessing symptom severity. These findings suggest that differences in visual processing in patients with schizophrenia may increase their susceptibility to brightness illusions, although this phenomenon is independent of symptom characteristics. Understanding these perceptual alterations may aid in the development of objective measures of visual cognition for patients with schizophrenia.

">Axially decoupled photo-stimulation and two photon readout (ADePT) for mapping functional connectivity of neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                All optical physiology in vivo provides a conduit for investigating the function of neural circuits in 3-D. Here, we report a new strategy for flexible, axially-decoupled photo-stimulation and two photon readout (ADePT) of neuronal activity. To achieve axially-contained widefield optogenetic patterned stimulation, we couple a digital micro-mirror device illuminated by a solid-state laser with a motorized holographic diffuser. In parallel, we use multiphoton imaging of neural activity across different z-planes. We use ADePT to analyze the excitatory and inhibitory functional connectivity of the mouse early olfactory system. Specifically, we control the activity of individual input glomeruli on the olfactory bulb surface, and map the ensuing responses of output mitral and tufted cell bodies in deeper layers. This approach identifies cohorts of sister mitral and tufted cells, whose firing is driven by the same parent glomerulus, and also reveals their differential inhibition by other glomeruli. In addition, selective optogenetic activation of glomerular GABAergic/dopaminergic (DAT+) interneurons triggers dense, but spatially heterogeneous suppression of mitral and tufted cell baseline activity and odor responses, further demonstrating specificity in the inhibitory olfactory bulb connectivity. In summary, ADePT enables high-throughput functional connectivity mapping in optically accessible brain regions.

">New insights into the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 and amyloid-β 42 derived cytotoxicity relevant to Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The multifunctional mitochondrial enzyme 17{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (HSD10) plays an important role in the pathology of several diseases, of which Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most debated. HSD10 overexpression and its interplay with amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}) are considered a factor contributing to mitochondrial damage and neuronal stress observed in AD patients. This study confirms that individual overexpression of HSD10 or APP (amyloid precursor protein that gives rise to A{beta}) leads to cytotoxicity, and both pathological conditions are linked to mitochondrial damage. However, the metabolic changes caused by these two overexpressions significantly differ, particularly in their effect on the tricarboxylic acid cycle and {beta}-oxidation. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of HSD10 is identified as the primary factor of HSD10 cytotoxicity, which is significantly exacerbated in an A{beta}-rich environment and can be partially reversed by HSD10 inhibitors. Notably, a previously published and competitive benzothiazole inhibitor was effective in restoring the viability of HSD10 overexpressing cells alone and in an A{beta}-rich environment, implying the potential benefit of HSD10 inhibitors in mitochondrial diseases and/or AD treatment.

">PLXNB1 and other signaling drives a pathologic astrocyte state contributing to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the coordinated emergence of disease-associated cell states across multiple cell types. Here, we first performed a meta-analysis of single-nucleus transcriptomic (snRNAseq) data from 869 brains of diverse decedents, confirming the critical role of an SLC38A2highSMTNhighCACNA1Dhigh astrocyte subset, Astrocyte 10 (Ast10), in AD and aging-related cognitive decline. We then investigated the signaling drivers of Ast10's emergence in the aging brain, focusing on interactions among microglial and astrocytic subsets. Analysis of the snRNAseq data prioritized a set of ligands and receptors that are robustly predictive of Ast10 proportions across participants, and we confirm our predictions in multiple studies. Independent validation with spatial transcriptomics reveals striking colocalization of these prioritized ligands with the Ast10 signature in AD brain tissue, but not with other astrocytic states. Genetic ablation of a top receptor PLXNB1 in murine and human iPSC-derived astrocytes decreased the Ast10 signature, confirming its regulatory role. Finally, we find that Ast10 may contribute to cognitive decline through synaptic loss and is associated with cognitive decline independent of AD. Thus, Ast10 and its regulators are potential points of convergence for multiple neurodegenerative mechanisms and may be promising targets for therapeutic development to preserve cognitive function.

">Transfer of learned object manipulations between two- and five-digit grasps</a></h4>

              
                Successful object manipulation involves integrating object properties into a motor plan and scaling fingertip forces through learning. This study investigated whether learned manipulations using a two-digit grip transfer to a five-digit grip and vice versa, focusing on the challenges posed by added degrees of freedom in force distribution. The goal of the task was to exert the necessary compensatory torque (Tcom) and vertical forces to minimize object roll on a visually symmetrical object that with an asymmetrical mass distribution. To examine this, subjects performed blocked consecutive learning trials before switching grip type. Our results support the learning transfer between two-digits and five-digit grasp configurations despite challenges in maintaining perfect stability during the grip switch. Subjects adapted their grip forces (GF), center of pressure (CoP), and Tcom to minimize object roll, with significant improvements observed from novel (1st) to transfer (11th) trials. These findings suggest high-level, effector-independent representations of object manipulation that enable generalization across grip types, though some limitations in force distribution and digit position arise during transfers.

                The method of loci is a technique to effectively boost memory, but its impact on the underlying neural representations is poorly understood. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and representational similarity analysis to compare the neural representations of memory athletes ranked among the world's top 50 in memory sports to those of mnemonics-naive controls. In a second study, mnemonics-naive individuals underwent a 6-week-long memory training, working memory training, or no intervention. Results showed distinct neural representations in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal, and posterior parietal regions as memory athletes and the memory training group studied novel content. Neural representations were also distinct between these experienced individuals, which was related to better memory performance after 4 months. Our findings highlight how extensive memory training affects neocortical memory engrams. We suggest that the method of loci may bolster memory uniqueness within one's "memory palace", setting the stage for exceptional memory performance.

">Development and Characterization of a Sf-1-Flp Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                The use of genetically engineered tools, including combinations of Cre-LoxP and Flp-FRT systems, enable the interrogation of complex biology. Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) is expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH). Development of genetic tools, such as mice expressing Flp recombinase (Flp) in SF-1 neurons (Sf-1-Flp), will be useful for future studies that unravel the complex physiology regulated by the VMH. Here, we developed and characterized Sf-1-Flp mice and demonstrated its utility. Flp sequence was inserted into Sf-1 locus with P2A. This insertion did not affect Sf-1 mRNA expression levels and Sf-1-Flp mice do not have any visible phenotypes. They are fertile and metabolically comparable to wild-type littermate mice. Optogenetic stimulation using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-bearing Flp-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) increased blood glucose and skeletal muscle PGC-1 in Sf-1-Flp mice. This was similar to SF-1 neuronal activation using Sf-1-BAC-Cre and AAV-bearing Cre-dependent ChR2. Finally, we generated Sf-1-Flp mice that lack {beta}2-adrenergic receptors (Adr{beta}2) only in skeletal muscle with a combination of Cre/LoxP technology (Sf-1-Flp::SKM{triangleup}Adr{beta}2). Optogenetic stimulation of SF-1 neurons failed to increase skeletal muscle PGC-1 in Sf-1-Flp::SKM{triangleup}Adr{beta}2 mice, suggesting that Adr{beta}2 in skeletal muscle is required for augmented skeletal muscle PGC-1 by SF-1 neuronal activation.

">Motivating Effects of Negative-hedonic Valence Encoded in Engrams</a></h4>

              
                Engrams are neuronal alterations that encode associations between environmental contexts and subjectively rewarding or aversive experiences within sparsely activated neuronal assemblies that regulate behavioral responses. How positive- or negative-hedonic states are represented in brain neurocircuits is a fundamental question relevant for understanding the processing of emotionally meaningful stimuli that drive appropriate or maladaptive behavior, respectively. It is well-known that animals avoid noxious stimuli and experiences. Little is known, however, how the conditioning of environmental or contextual stimuli to behavior that leads to amelioration of dysphoric states establishes powerful associations leading to compulsive maladaptive behavior. Here we have studied engrams that encode the conditioned effects of alcohol-related stimuli associated with the reversal of the dysphoric withdrawal state in alcohol dependent rats and document the recruitment of engrams in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), and the Dorsal Striatum (DS). The findings suggest that the encoding of associations between reversal of negative hedonic states and environmental contexts in these engrams may serve as a neural mechanism for compulsive alcohol seeking and vulnerability to relapse associated with dysregulation of reward to a pathological allostatic level.

">Within-Individual Precision Mapping of Brain Networks Exclusively Using Task Data</a></h4>

              
                Precision mapping of brain networks within individuals has become a widely used tool that prevailingly relies on functional connectivity analysis of resting-state data. Here we explored whether networks could be precisely estimated solely using data acquired during active task paradigms. The straightforward strategy involved extracting residualized data after application of a task-based general linear model (GLM) and then applying standard functional connectivity analysis. Functional correlation matrices estimated from task data were highly similar to those derived from traditional resting-state fixation data. The largest factor affecting similarity between correlation matrices was the amount of data. Networks estimated within-individual from task data displayed strong spatial overlap with those estimated from resting-state fixation data and predicted the same triple functional dissociation in independent data. The implications of these findings are that (1) existing task data can be reanalyzed to estimate within-individual network organization, (2) resting-state fixation and task data can be pooled to increase statistical power, and (3) future studies can exclusively acquire task data to both estimate networks and extract task responses. Most broadly, the present results suggest that there is an underlying, stable network architecture that is idiosyncratic to the individual and persists across task states.

">Assessing the impact of artifact correction and artifact rejection on the performance of SVM-based decoding of EEG signals</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have demonstrated that eyeblinks and other large artifacts can decrease the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG data, resulting in decreased statistical power for conventional univariate analyses. However, it is not clear whether eliminating these artifacts during preprocessing enhances the performance of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA; decoding), especially given that artifact rejection reduces the number of trials available for training the decoder. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of artifact-minimization approaches on the decoding performance of support vector machines. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to correct ocular artifacts, and artifact rejection was used to discard trials with large voltage deflections from other sources (e.g., muscle artifacts). We assessed decoding performance in relatively simple binary classification tasks using data from seven commonly-used event-related potential paradigms (N170, mismatch negativity, N2pc, P3b, N400, lateralized readiness potential, and error-related negativity), as well as more challenging multi-way decoding tasks, including stimulus location and stimulus orientation. The results indicated that the combination of artifact correction and rejection did not improve decoding performance in the vast majority of cases. However, artifact correction may still be essential to minimize artifact-related confounds that might artificially inflate decoding accuracy. Researchers who are decoding EEG data from paradigms, populations, and recording setups that are similar to those examined here may benefit from our recommendations to optimize decoding performance and avoid incorrect conclusions.

">Caspase-dependent ablation of indirect medium spiny neurons projecting to external globus pallidus promotes compulsive ethanol-seeking and drinking behaviors</a></h4>

              
                The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is primarily recognized for regulating goal-directed reward-seeking behaviors, while the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is predominantly associated with movement and habitual behaviors. In this study, we sought to investigate two pathways, direct medium spiny neuron (dMSN) and indirect medium spiny neuron (iMSN) in the two dorsal striatal subregions (DMS and DLS) in ethanol-seeking and drinking behaviors. Here, we selectively ablated iMSN(DMS-GPe) and iMSN(DLS-GPe) and trained mice to exhibit goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking behaviors using random ratio (RR) and random interval (RI) operant conditioning, respectively. We found that partial ablation of iMSN(DLS-GPe) exhibited increased resilience to bitter-tasting ethanol solution when subjected to quinine adulterated reward in operant conditioning paradigms, suggesting compulsive-like seeking behavior. Consistently, in a separate cohort of mice, we found that the iMSN(DLS-GPe) ablated mice show higher preference and consumption of quinine adulterated ethanol solution than control mice in two-bottle choice continuous access drinking, with increasing quinine concentration and exhibit more compulsive-like behavior. On the other hand, ablation of iMSN(DMS-GPe) resulted in insensitivity to satiety-based reward devaluation in RR-trained mice, consistent with a shift toward habitual behavior but no change in compulsive ethanol-seeking and drinking behavior. Together, our findings demonstrate that DLS iMSN function is essential in inhibiting compulsive-like behavior.

">Astrocytic activation of EMMPRIN contributes to their pathological phenotype in ALS.</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterised by the degeneration of upper and lower motoneurons. Onset and progression of the disease are determined by both cell-autonomous neuronal dysfunctions and non-cell-autonomous factors, mainly due to activation of glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia. The Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinases INducer (EMMPRIN), a glycoprotein expressed by various cell types including neurons, is the major activator of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) synthesis and release. EMMPRIN activation can be induced by peptidyl-prolyl isomerase A (PPIA), a chaperone protein with cis/trans isomerase activity, that exhibits cytokine- and chemokine-like behaviour. Previous studies showed that PPIA is highly released in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients and animal models where, by activating EMMPRIN on motoneurons, induces neuronal death. Here, we show that EMMPRIN is expressed also by astrocytes, suggesting this cell type as sensitive as motoneurons to PPIA-mediated EMMPRIN activation. We observed that that PPIA-mediated EMMPRIN activation prompt astrocytes toward a pro-inflammatory profile. Interestingly, we found that this pathogenic profile can be reverted by an anti-EMMPRIN antibody. Finally, we provide evidence that the activation of EMMPRIN is relevant for mutant SOD1 and TDP-43 conditions. In conclusion, we demonstrate that EMMPRIN activation in ALS occurs also in astrocytes where it exacerbates their pathological phenotype possibly contributing to the progression of the disease. Furthermore, we suggest the potential use of an anti-EMMPRIN antibody to reduce astrocytic activation during the disease.

">Targeting the ferroptosis pathway: A novel compound, AZD1390, protects the brain after ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. This process has been implicated in various diseases, including ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke leads to oxidative stress, iron overload, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which collectively may trigger ferroptotic neuronal cell death. However, the regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in stroke remain poorly understood. Previous studies have identified ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a DNA damage kinase, as a critical regulator of ferroptosis. However, the therapeutic potential of this discovery remains unknown. Methods: We investigated the effect of ATM inhibitors, including the brain-penetrant AZD1390, on ferroptosis using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models of ischemic stroke. Our analysis included assessments of cell viability, lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis marker expression, and infarct volume. Results: ATM inhibitors significantly alleviated ferroptosis-induced cell death in cultured cells and ex vivo murine brain slice cultures. In the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke model, treatment with AZD1390 reduced the expression of ferroptosis markers (xCT and PTGS2) and diminished neuronal cell death in rat and mouse brain slices. Furthermore, in a mouse model of ischemic stroke, AZD1390 decreased infarct volume confirming its therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conclusions: This study identifies ferroptosis as a critical mechanism in ischemic stroke-induced neuronal cell death and highlights ATM inhibition, particularly with AZD1390, as a promising therapeutic candidate for mitigating stroke-associated damage. Targeting ferroptosis may provide a translationally relevant strategy to mitigate neuronal injury and improve clinical outcomes for stroke patients.

Given the potential of intrinsic neural timescales as a neural marker for psychiatric disorders, investigating their reliability is crucial. This study, using an open-source database, aimed to evaluate the test–retest reliability of ACW-0 and ACW-50 under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions across three sessions. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were employed to quantify the reliability of the intrinsic neural timescales. Our results showed that intrinsic neural timescales exhibited good reliability (ICC &gt; 0.6) at the whole-brain level across different index types and eye states. Spatially, except for the right temporal region in the eyes-open condition, all other regions showed moderate-to-high ICCs. Over 60% of the electrodes demonstrated moderate-to-high intrinsic neural timescale ICCs under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, with ACW-0 being more stable than ACW-50. Moreover, in the new dataset, the above results were consistently reproduced. The present study comprehensively assessed the reliability of intrinsic neural timescale under various conditions, providing robust evidence for their stability in neuroscience and psychiatry.</span>

Multiple-regression analysis using latent factors of psychological characteristics revealed that a factor representing autobiographical significance was associated with activation in the posterior medial memory system, including the angular cortex, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex, during counterfactual simulation. Furthermore, representation similarity analysis using patterns of factor scores revealed significant clusters in the posterior medial system and parts of cerebellar parcels, mainly during counterfactual simulation.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Stuttering is a speech disorder involving fluency disruptions like repetitions, prolongations, and blockages, often leading to emotional distress and social withdrawal. Here, we present Augmented Multisensory Feedback Stimulation (AMFS), a novel personalized intervention to improve speech fluency in people who stutter (PWS). AMFS includes a five-day intensive phase aiming at acquiring new skills, plus a reinforcement phase designed to facilitate the transfer of these skills across different contexts and their automatization into effortless behaviors. The concept of our intervention derives from the prediction of the neurocomputational model Directions into Velocities of Articulators (DIVA). The treatment applies dynamic multisensory stimulation to disrupt PWS&amp;amp;rsquo; maladaptive over-reliance on sensory feedback mechanisms, promoting the emergence of participants&amp;amp;rsquo; natural voices. Methods: Forty-six PWS and a control group, including twenty-four non-stuttering individuals, participated in this study. Stuttering severity and physiological measures, such as heart rate and electromyographic activity, were recorded before and after the intensive phase and during the reinforcement stage in the PWS but only once in the controls. Results: The results showed a significant reduction in stuttering severity at the end of the intensive phase, which was maintained during the reinforcement training. Crucially, worse performance was found in PWS than in the controls at baseline but not after the intervention. In the PWS, physiological signals showed a reduction in activity during the training phases compared to baseline. Conclusions: Our findings show that AMFS provides a promising approach to enhancing speech fluency. Future studies should clarify the mechanisms underlying such intervention and assess whether effects persist after the treatment conclusion.</p>

In Mexico&amp;amp;mdash;and many other countries&amp;amp;mdash;reliable epidemiological data are lacking; however, estimates suggest that PPA accounts for 0.5&amp;amp;ndash;2.5% of neurodegenerative disease cases in Memory Clinics, with an incidence of approximately 1 per 100,000 and an average survival of 8 years. This review aims to provide clinicians with an overview of PPA&amp;amp;rsquo;s epidemiology, clinical features, and classification, thereby enhancing understanding of its subtypes and distinguishing characteristics from other aphasic conditions, such as vascular aphasia. Methods: This narrative review was conducted through a literature search using databases such as PubMed and Scopus. Relevant studies addressing the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and classification of PPA were identified, selected, and synthesized to offer a broad, clinically oriented overview of the condition. This approach was chosen to inform clinical practice and highlight the need for further targeted investigations, such as future systematic reviews focusing on specific aspects like therapeutic strategies. Key Contents and Findings: (a) Epidemiology: PPA is estimated to affect 0.5&amp;amp;ndash;2.5% of patients with neurodegenerative diseases in Memory Clinics, with an incidence of roughly 1 per 100,000. Average survival time is around 8 years (ranging from 3 to 17 years), with a generally balanced gender ratio, though some studies indicate a predominance of men. A positive family history is observed in 20&amp;amp;ndash;40% of cases, with about 10% following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. (b) Clinical Characteristics and Classification: PPA is marked by a gradual decline in language abilities, differentiating it from vascular aphasias. Subtypes include non-fluent forms (non-fluent progressive aphasia [nfPPA] and logopenic progressive aphasia [lPPA]), fluent forms (progressive fluent aphasia [PFA] and semantic dementia [SD]), and mixed forms (progressive mixed aphasia [PMA]). The neurodegenerative process in PPA extends beyond vascular boundaries, often resulting in presentations that deviate from classical Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s and Wernicke&amp;amp;rsquo;s aphasias. Common symptoms include difficulties in word finding and naming, sometimes mistaken for memory loss, and, in the case of semantic dementia, personality changes that may go unnoticed by the patient. Conclusions: PPA is a heterogeneous and complex group of neurodegenerative disorders with significant clinical variability and a profound impact on patients and their families. While current epidemiological data are limited, this review emphasizes the need for further research to better delineate disease progression and refine diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Future systematic reviews will be essential to address specific aspects of PPA, such as treatment strategies, to further improve patient care.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) presents a challenging diagnosis due to its clinical overlap with other neurodegenerative disorders, especially other &amp;amp;alpha;-synucleinopathies. The main purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess neurofilament light chain (NfL) differences in the CSF and blood of patients with MSA versus the healthy control group (HC), patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD). Secondarily, the diagnostic metrics of CSF and circulating NfL in MSA versus HC, PD, LBD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) were discussed. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were thoroughly searched for relevant case-control studies. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated separately for CSF and blood NfL per comparison. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed based on the Q and I^2 statistics. Results: Twenty-five relevant studies were retrieved. Quantitative syntheses revealed elevated CSF and circulating NfL levels in individuals with MSA versus HC [SMD = 1.80 (95%CI = 1.66, 1.94) and SMD = 2.00 (95%CI = 1.36, 2.63), respectively] versus PD [SMD = 1.65 (95%CI = 1.26, 2.03) and SMD = 1.63 (95%CI = 0.84, 2.43), respectively] as well as versus LBD [SMD = 1.17, (95%CI = 0.71, 1.63) and SMD = 0.65 (95%CI = 0.30, 1.00), respectively]. Diagnostic accuracy was outstanding for CSF and blood NfL in MSA versus HC and PD, and it was moderate in MSA versus LBD. On the other hand, it was suboptimal in MSA vs. PSP and CBD. Conclusions: Both CSF and circulating NfL levels are elevated in MSA compared to HC, PD and LBD. To achieve optimal diagnostic properties, further work is required in the standardization of processes and the establishment of reference NfL intervals and/or thresholds.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This research examined the impact of reframing on decision confidence and its link with individual decision-making styles in a sample of healthy adults. Methods: Participants completed a Resistance to Reframe Task, which involved two decision-making steps. In each step, they chose the best option from four alternatives for a workplace situation and rated their confidence in the decision. Then, the task was reframed to highlight the negative consequences of their initial choice, and they reassessed their confidence. Confidence scores and reaction times (RTs) were recorded for the confidence ratings of each step. The General Decision-Making Style (GDMS) and Maximization Scale (MS) were also used to profile decision-making styles and explore their links to behavioral responses. Results: Findings demonstrated that reframing significantly reduces participants&amp;amp;rsquo; confidence, particularly in the first step, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging initial choices. Additionally, higher RTs after reframing emphasize the cognitive complexity introduced by the change of perspective and allows us to describe the dynamic of the decision-making process. Correlational findings suggested that while some traits (e.g., dependent style) reduce confidence after the reframing, others (e.g., high standards, decision difficulty) seem to reinforce it. Similarly, decision-making style as MS alternative search increases RTs, reflecting the heightened complexity of reframed decision contexts. Conclusions: The results underscored the importance of considering confidence in the decision and individual differences when studying decision-making under reframing conditions. Individual differences in decision-making styles may act as protective or vulnerability factors to reframe in decision-making processes.</p>

	<p>Background: This study investigates the complex relationship between accentuation and attention in visual perception, extending classical Gestalt principles by introducing dissimilarity as a complementary mechanism to similarity in perceptual organization. Objectives and Methods: Through a series of phenomenological experiments, we demonstrate how accentuation, driven by dissimilarity, plays a crucial role in shaping visual experience and guiding attention. Results: Our findings reveal that accentuation serves as a pre-attentive mechanism for highlighting salient features, influencing initial perceptual organization, and modulating the apparent shape and orientation of visual elements. We show that while accentuation operates rapidly and automatically, attention acts as a flexible, selective mechanism that can either reinforce or override accentuation-based percepts. This interplay suggests a two-stage process of visual perception, with implications for theories of consciousness and information processing in biological systems. This study also explores the evolutionary significance of accentuation in camouflage and sexual selection, providing insights into how perceptual mechanisms may have evolved to enhance adaptive fitness. Conclusions: Our results have broad implications for understanding visual cognition, design, and clinical applications related to attentional disorders.</p>

	<p>Background: Diazinon, a well-known organophosphorus compound, is recognized for its neurotoxic effects, primarily through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and induction of oxidative stress. Aim: This study evaluates the neuroprotective effects of naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, against diazinon-induced cerebellar damage in male albino rats. Materials and methods: Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups: control, naringenin, diazinon, and diazinon with naringenin. Results: Histological examination revealed altered structures of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of the diazinon group. Naringenin co-treatment significantly improved cerebellar histology and modulated oxidative stress markers by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels. Additionally, naringenin exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;) levels, while increasing interleukin-10 (IL-10). It also reduced apoptotic markers, including p53, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3, while increasing the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2. Furthermore, naringenin modulated AChE activity, leading to decreased acetylcholine levels and reduced neurotoxicity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that naringenin&amp;amp;rsquo;s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties contribute to its neuroprotective role against diazinon-induced cerebellar damage.</p>

	<p>Background: Exposure to visually appealing food items can enhance their subjective realism, leading to increased cravings, salivation, and automatic approach tendencies. Prior research suggests that brief mindfulness instructions promoting dereification&amp;amp;mdash;recognizing stimuli as transient mental events&amp;amp;mdash;can mitigate these automatic reactions. Objectives: This study assesses whether brief mindfulness instruction can mitigate automatic consumption tendencies induced by food advertisements, exploring the corresponding behavioral, physiological, and neurophysiological mechanisms. Methods: Sixty participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving brief mindfulness instruction and the other a non-dereifying control instruction while exposed to advertised foods. This was followed by an approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance task (AAT), during which behavioral data, salivary volume, event-related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalogram recordings, and self-reports were collected. Results: The results showed no significant differences in approach behaviors between the groups. Hunger, food craving, and salivation levels increased uniformly in response to food cues for both groups. The N1, N2, P3, and late positive potential (LPP) ERPs remained unaltered by the instructions and consistent with the established AAT literature. Advertising heightened the appeal of neutral foods, as evidenced by increased N2, P3, and LPP responses. Conclusions: The brief mindfulness instruction failed to shield participants from the automatic responses elicited by food advertising, contrasting with the effects seen with non-advertised food.</p>

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                Long-read sequencing technologies have transformed the field of epigenetics by enabling direct, single-base resolution detection of DNA modifications, such as methylation. This produces novel opportunities for studying the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation, imprinting, and disease. However, the unique characteristics of long-read data, including the modBAM format and extended read lengths, necessitate the development of specialised software tools for effective analysis. The NanoMethViz package provides a suite of tools for loading in long-read methylation data, visualising data at various data resolutions. It can convert the data for use with other Bioconductor software such as bsseq, DSS, dmrseq and edgeR to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In this workflow article, we demonstrate the process of converting modBAM files into formats suitable for comprehensive downstream analysis. We leverage NanoMethViz to conduct an exploratory analysis, visually summarizing differences between samples, examining aggregate methylation profiles across gene and CpG islands, and investigating methylation patterns within specific regions at the single-read level. Additionally, we illustrate the use of dmrseq for identifying DMRs and show how to integrate these findings into gene-level visualization plots. Our analysis is applied to a triplicate dataset of haplotyped long-read methylation data from mouse neural stem cells, allowing us to visualize and compare the characteristics of the parental alleles on chromosome 7. By applying DMR analysis, we recover DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualise the methylation patterns of these genes summarised at single-read resolution. Through DMR analysis, we identify DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualize their methylation patterns at single-read resolution. This streamlined workflow is adaptable to common experimental designs and offers flexibility in the choice of upstream data sources and downstream statistical analysis tools.

                <p>by Paul Henriot, Mohamed El-Kassas, Wagida Anwar, Samia A. Girgis, Maha El Gaafary, Kévin Jean, Laura Temime</p>

Mathematical models are powerful tools to analyze pathogen spread and assess control strategies in healthcare settings. Nevertheless, available models focus on nosocomial transmission through direct contact or aerosols rather than through blood, even though bloodborne pathogens remain a significant source of iatrogenic infectious risk. Herein, we propose an agent-based SEI (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected) model to reproduce the transmission of bloodborne pathogens dynamically within hospitals. This model simulates the dynamics of patients between hospital wards, from admission to discharge, as well as the dynamics of the devices used during at-risk invasive procedures, considering that patient contamination occurs after exposure to a contaminated device. We first illustrate the use of this model through a case study on hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Egypt. Model parameters, such as HCV upon-admission prevalence and transition probabilities between wards or ward-specific probabilities of undergoing different invasive procedures, are informed with data collected in Ain Shams University Hospital in Cairo. Our results suggest a low risk of HCV acquisition for patients hospitalized in this university hospital. However, we show that in a low-resource hospital, frequent device shortages could lead to increased risk. We also find that systematically screening patients in a few selected high-risk wards could significantly reduce this risk. We then further explore potential model applications through a second illustrative case study based on HBV nosocomial transmission in Ethiopia. In the future, this model could be used to predict the potential burden of emerging bloodborne pathogens and help implement effective control strategies in various hospital contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-229/v1?src=rss">Exploring antecedents of built environment for walkability of older adults: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This systematic literature review (SLR) explores how urban design influences walking access in the built environment for walking of older adults, summarizing existing studies. Examining various theories, it analyses themes like safety, security, comfort, convenience, aesthetics, governance, and policy frameworks. By critically reviewing the literature, it seeks to understand current research trends and suggest future directions. Methods The study employs an evidence-based systematic approach, following the standard procedure of SLR to identify relevant studies and extract information. Results It was found that five prominent theories dominated research literature: Active Aging Framework (AAF) (35.4%), Social-Ecological Model of Health Promotion (SEMHP) (25%), Community-Engaged Urban Design Theory (CEUDT) (18%), Neighbourhood Social Environment Theory (NSET) (11%), and the fifth Ecological Model of Aging (EMA) (8%). Empirical research dominated (37.5%), followed by grounded theory (20.8%), case study (18.8%), comparative study (12.5%), document analysis (8.3%), and analytical research (2.1%) in terms of the research type. The SLR revealed that most research uses empirical methods and focuses on applying existing theories. Conclusions It identifies opportunities for future research, suggesting areas for model integration, advancement, and application. Notably, it highlights the potential of combining the two most relevant theories for interventions promoting older adults’ health through walkable environments. This review can aid practitioners and researchers in identifying the theoretical underpinning of key factors for designing walkable cities that cater to older adults’ needs. A potential limitation is its focus on dominant theories, excluding others that might offer valuable insights.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Ofatumumab presents a potentially promising alternative to current second-line immunotherapy for refractory anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor autoimmune encephalitis (NMDAR-AE). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab as a novel second-line immunotherapy for NMDAR-AE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, multicenter, nested cohort study compared patients with NMDAR-AE from the CHina Autoimmune encephalitiS outcomE study registry (CHASE) recruited between October 2011 and February 2024, treated with and without ofatumumab. The primary outcome was the proportion reaching a favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≤2) at the last follow-up. Secondary outcomes included mRS scores and Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE) scores over the first 24-month follow-up and the proportion with further mRS score improvement after ofatumumab initiation. A propensity score matching was performed to balance major confounders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 715 patients with AE were screened. Fifty-eight propensity score-matched patients with NMDAR-AE each in the ofatumumab group and non-ofatumumab group were analyzed. Fifty-four patients (93.1%) in the ofatumumab group achieved further mRS score improvement with a median time of 14 days from ofatumumab initiation, and 53 (91.4%) reached a favorable functional outcome at the last follow-up. For those who failed first-line immunotherapy, the ofatumumab group demonstrated a faster mRS score and CASE score improvement and more frequently reached a favorable functional outcome at the last follow-up compared with the non-ofatumumab group (87.9% vs. 64.7%, odds ratio [OR] 3.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–13.94; <i>p</i> = 0.026). No serious adverse events associated with ofatumumab treatment were reported.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Ofatumumab showed substantial efficacy and safety, particularly in patients who failed first-line immunotherapy, warranting its consideration in NMDAR-AE management. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background The goal of eliminating tuberculosis has not yet shown a bright spot. Specifically for HIV patients (PLHIV), WHO has made it a special category as a pillar for eliminating tuberculosis. The tuberculosis screening has not yet reached the national target because it is carried out manually by health workers, requiring optimization following technological developments. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of tuberculosis case finding using a self-assessment paradigm in HIV patients. Methods This research was cross-sectional. The data obtained from HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application for 3 months each was analyzed using the compare mean independent t-test. Then the Chi-squared test was carried out on the E-TIBI screening characteristic variables. Result In total, there were 921 respondents with 148 (16%) presumptive TB. It was found that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the number of presumptive TB cases found in HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application. The person with presumptive TB showed 20 of 24 characteristic variables that were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion E-TIBI can increase the tuberculosis case finding in HIV patients so it has the potential to be implemented as a screening tool in the PLHIV community.

     alt="Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Anatomical Correlation of Human Temporal Lobe Landmarks in 3D Euclidean Space: A Study of Control and Epilepsy Disease Subjects"/>
<p>A 3D network of distances between anatomical brain landmarks identified by MRI is provided in control (CO) and epileptic (EP) cases, The use of one distance (end of hippocampus to end of caudate nucleus in one plane) provides a 96% of correct classification between CO and EP cases; adding the rostrocaudal distance between the start of the amygdala to the end of the anterior commissure (in the middle), a 100% correct classification between CO and EP cases is obtained. The classification between CO, temporal (TLE) and extratemporal (ETLE) lobe epilepsies is more complicated, requiring 12 distances to obtain a 100% correct classification.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder of great importance to patients and society. Sclerosis is associated with neuronal loss and neurodegeneration in specific regions of the hippocampal formation. The hippocampal formation and temporal lobe are not the only regions affected; the chronicity of the disease extends the involvement to other brain regions. Our aim is to investigate the spatial relationship of anatomical structures in both control (CO) and epileptic (EP) subjects using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to determine changes in epileptic patients compared to healthy anatomical structures. Anatomical landmarks are identified and registered in 3D space to provide a reference for the brain structures; the 3D network is described quantitatively using planar distances, as well as measuring rostrocaudal and Euclidean distances. The planar and rostrocaudal distances are the most remarkable discriminators between CO and EP groups, especially between structures located in and outside the temporal lobe. The study achieves a 100% discrimination between the control group and the epileptic group with the discriminant use of two distances: D_PL, Hpe/Cde and D_RC, As/cae. Finally, discriminates 100% between the three study groups, control group CO, extratemporal lobe epilepsy ETLE and temporal lobe epilepsy TLE, with a total of 12 distances distributed in the three axes of space. This study allows us to hope for a future application, its clinical utility may allow us not only to identify processes (in our case, epilepsy), but also to obtain parameters of the evolution of the disease.</p>

The model unifies observations from environments of varying sizes and dimensions in multiple species, suggesting that a common mechanism underlies the hippocampal spatial code.

                Goto et al. measure the pulsatile activity of the reproductive center in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus during puberty in female mice. They discover that food availability rapidly and bidirectionally modulates this pulsatile activity, partially through the hunger center within the same arcuate nucleus, potentially influencing the timing of puberty.

                Chadwick et al. report that in vitro microevolution of Cryptococcus neoformans under high carbon dioxide leads to loss-of-function mutations in Avc1 that confer CO2 tolerance and virulence to CO2-intolerant/low-virulence strains. Similar AVC1 mutations emerge in patients with relapsed cryptococcosis, suggesting that adaptation to CO2 increases fitness in the host.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00096-8?rss=yes">Multiple mechanisms of termination modulate the dynamics of RNAPI transcription</a></h4>

              
                Petfalski et al. reveal complexities in RNAPI termination. Torsion release, through nascent pre-rRNA cleavage by Rnt1, favors RNAPI pausing and torpedo termination by the exonuclease Rat1, aided by Nsi1 roadblocks and RNAPI-mediated endonuclease cleavage. Termination of prematurely stalled RNAPI is facilitated by TRAMP-mediated nascent transcript polyadenylation and a reverse torpedo mechanism.

As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative’s FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. These are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guidelines for adoption and fodder for discussion. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105446">Chronic RNA G-quadruplex accumulation in aging and Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                As the world population ages, new molecular targets in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are needed to combat the expected influx of new AD cases. Until now, the role of RNA structure in aging and neurodegeneration has largely remained unexplored. In this study, we examined human hippocampal <i>postmortem</i> tissue for the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in aging and AD. We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurons with the accumulation of phospho-tau immunostaining contained rG4s, rG4 structure can drive tau aggregation, and rG4 staining density depended on APOE genotype in the human tissue examined. Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation is linked to proteostasis collapse. These morphological findings suggest that further investigation of RNA structure in neurodegeneration is a critical avenue for future treatments and diagnoses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99373">Endosomal chemokine receptor signalosomes regulate central mechanisms underlying cell migration</a></h4>

              
                Chemokine receptors are GPCRs that regulate the chemotactic migration of a wide variety of cells including immune and cancer cells. Most chemokine receptors contain features associated with the ability to stimulate G protein signaling during β-arrestin-mediated receptor internalization into endosomes. As endosomal signaling of certain non-GPCR receptors plays a major role in cell migration, we chose to investigate the potential role of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling on mechanisms governing this function. Applying a combination of pharmacological and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate that the model chemokine receptor CCR7 recruits G protein and β-arrestin simultaneously upon chemokine stimulation, which enables internalized receptors to activate G protein from endosomes. Furthermore, spatiotemporal-resolved APEX2 proteome profiling shows that endosomal CCR7 uniquely enriches specific Rho GTPase regulators as compared to plasma membrane CCR7, which is directly associated with enhanced activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 and chemotaxis of immune T cells. As Rac1 drives the formation of membrane protrusions during chemotaxis, our findings suggest an important integrated function of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling in cell migration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99455">Genetic inactivation of the β1 adrenergic receptor prevents cerebral cavernous malformations in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed that propranolol reduces experimental murine cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) and prevents embryonic caudal venous plexus (CVP) lesions in zebrafish that follow mosaic inactivation of <i>ccm2</i> (Li et al., 2021). Because morpholino silencing of the β1 adrenergic receptor (<i>adrb1</i>) prevents the embryonic CVP lesion, we proposed that <i>adrb1</i> plays a role in CCM pathogenesis. Here, we report that <i>adrb1<sup>-/-</sup></i> zebrafish exhibited 86% fewer CVP lesions and 87% reduction of CCM lesion volume relative to wild type brood mates at 2dpf and 8–10 weeks stage, respectively. Treatment with metoprolol, a β1 selective antagonist, yielded a similar reduction in CCM lesion volume. <i>Adrb1<sup>-/-</sup></i> zebrafish embryos exhibited reduced heart rate and contractility and reduced CVP blood flow. Similarly, slowing the heart and eliminating the blood flow in CVP by administration of 2,3-BDM suppressed the CVP lesion. In sum, our findings provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that the therapeutic effect of propranolol on CCM is achieved through β1 receptor antagonism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97830">Altered hepatic metabolism mediates sepsis preventive effects of reduced glucose supply in infected preterm newborns</a></h4>

              
                Preterm infants are susceptible to neonatal sepsis, a syndrome of pro-inflammatory activity, organ damage, and altered metabolism following infection. Given the unique metabolic challenges and poor glucose regulatory capacity of preterm infants, their glucose intake during infection may have a high impact on the degree of metabolism dysregulation and organ damage. Using a preterm pig model of neonatal sepsis, we previously showed that a drastic restriction in glucose supply during infection protects against sepsis via suppression of glycolysis-induced inflammation, but results in severe hypoglycemia. Now we explored clinically relevant options for reducing glucose intake to decrease sepsis risk, without causing hypoglycemia and further explore the involvement of the liver in these protective effects. We found that a reduced glucose regime during infection increased survival via reduced pro-inflammatory response, while maintaining normoglycemia. Mechanistically, this intervention enhanced hepatic oxidative phosphorylation and possibly gluconeogenesis, and dampened both circulating and hepatic inflammation. However, switching from a high to a reduced glucose supply after the debut of clinical symptoms did not prevent sepsis, suggesting metabolic conditions at the start of infection are key in driving the outcome. Finally, an early therapy with purified human inter-alpha inhibitor protein, a liver-derived anti-inflammatory protein, partially reversed the effects of low parenteral glucose provision, likely by inhibiting neutrophil functions that mediate pathogen clearance. Our findings suggest a clinically relevant regime of reduced glucose supply for infected preterm infants could prevent or delay the development of sepsis in vulnerable neonates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96290">DNA methylome regulates virulence and metabolism in Pseudomonas syringae</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial pathogens employ epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, to adapt to environmental changes, and these mechanisms play important roles in various biological processes. <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> is a model phytopathogenic bacterium, but its methylome is less well known than that of other species. In this study, we conducted single-molecule real-time sequencing to profile the DNA methylation landscape in three model pathovars of <i>P. syringae</i>. We identified one Type I restriction–modification system (HsdMSR), including the conserved sequence motif associated with <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine (6mA). About 25–40% of the genes involved in DNA methylation were conserved in two or more of the strains, revealing the functional conservation of methylation in <i>P. syringae</i>. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis highlighted the involvement of HsdMSR in virulent and metabolic pathways, including the Type III secretion system, biofilm formation, and translational efficiency. The regulatory effect of HsdMSR on transcription was dependent on both strands being fully 6mA methylated. Overall, this work illustrated the methylation profile in <i>P. syringae</i> and the critical involvement of DNA methylation in regulating virulence and metabolism. Thus, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of epigenetic transcriptional control in <i>P. syringae</i> and related bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97437">Improved base editing and functional screening in Leishmania via co-expression of the AsCas12a ultra variant, a T7 RNA polymerase, and a cytosine base editor</a></h4>

              
                The ability to analyze the function of all genes in a genome is highly desirable, yet challenging in <i>Leishmania</i> due to a repetitive genome, limited DNA repair mechanisms, and lack of RNA interference in most species. While our introduction of a cytosine base editor (CBE) demonstrated potential to overcome these limitations (Engstler and Beneke, 2023), challenges remained, including low transfection efficiency, variable editing rates across species, parasite growth effects, and competition between deleterious and non-deleterious mutations. Here, we present an optimized approach addressing these issues. We identified a T7 RNAP promoter variant ensuring high editing rates across <i>Leishmania</i> species without compromising growth. A revised CBE single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) scoring system was developed to prioritize STOP codon generation. Additionally, a triple-expression construct was created for stable integration of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into a <i>Leishmania</i> safe harbor locus using AsCas12a ultra-mediated DNA double-strand breaks, increasing transfection efficiency by ~400-fold to 1 transfectant per 70 transfected cells. Using this improved system for a small-scale proof-of-principle pooled screen, we successfully confirmed the essential and fitness-associated functions of CK1.2, CRK2, CRK3, AUK1/AIRK, TOR1, IFT88, IFT139, IFT140, and RAB5A in <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>, demonstrating a significant improvement over our previous method. Lastly, we show the utility of co-expressing AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, and CBE for hybrid CRISPR gene replacement and base editing within the same cell line. Overall, these improvements will broaden the range of possible gene editing applications in <i>Leishmania</i> species and will enable a variety of loss-of-function screens in the near future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104069">Axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons</a></h4>

              
                Sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons have a unique pseudo-unipolar morphology in which a stem axon bifurcates into a peripheral and a central axon, with different regenerative abilities. Whereas peripheral DRG axons regenerate, central axons are unable to regrow. Central axon regeneration can however be elicited by a prior conditioning lesion to the peripheral axon. How DRG axon asymmetry is established remains unknown. Here we developed a rodent in vitro system replicating DRG pseudo-unipolarization and asymmetric axon regeneration. Using this model, we observed that from early development, central DRG axons have a higher density of growing microtubules. This asymmetry was also present in vivo and was abolished by a conditioning lesion that decreased microtubule polymerization of central DRG axons. An axon-specific microtubule-associated protein (MAP) signature, including the severases spastin and katanin and the microtubule regulators CRMP5 and tau, was found and shown to adapt upon conditioning lesion. Supporting its significance, interfering with the DRG MAP signature either in vitro or in vivo readily abolished central-peripheral asymmetries in microtubule dynamics and regenerative ability. In summary, our data unveil that axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the constantly changing environment that characterizes our daily lives, the ability to predict and adapt to new circumstances is crucial. This study examines the influence of sequence and knowledge adaptiveness on predictive coding in skill learning and rewiring. Participants were exposed to two different visuomotor sequences with overlapping probabilities. By applying temporal decomposition and multivariate pattern analysis, we dissected the neural underpinnings across different levels of signal coding. The study provides neurophysiological evidence for the influence of knowledge adaptiveness on shaping predictive coding, revealing that these are intricately linked and predominantly manifest at the abstract and motor coding levels. These findings challenge the traditional view of a competitive relationship between learning context and knowledge, suggesting instead a hierarchical integration where their properties are processed simultaneously. This integration facilitates the adaptive reuse of existing knowledge in the face of new learning. By shedding light on the mechanisms of predictive coding in visuomotor sequences, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of how the brain navigates and adapts to environmental changes, offering insights into the foundational processes that underlie learning and adaptation in dynamic contexts.</span>

	<p>Background: Healthy cognitive functioning is a primary component of well-being, independence, and successful aging. Cognitive deficits can arise from various conditions, such as brain injury, mental illness, and neurological disorders. Rehabilitation is a highly specialized service limited to patients who have access to institutional settings. In response to this unmet need, telehealth solutions are ideal for triggering the migration of care from clinics to patients&amp;amp;rsquo; homes. Objectives: The aim of EARLY-COGN^3 will be threefold: (1) to test the efficacy of a digital health at-home intervention (tele@cognitive protocol) as compared to an unstructured cognitive at-home rehabilitation in a cohort of patients with Chronic Neurological Diseases (CNDs); (2) to investigate its effects on the biomolecular and neurophysiological marker hypothesizing that people with CNDs enrolled in this telerehabilitation program will develop changes in biological markers and cortical and subcortical patterns of connectivity; (3) to analyze potential cognitive, neurobiological, and neurophysiological predictors of response to the tele@cognitive treatment. Method: In this single-blind, randomized, and controlled pilot study, we will assess the short- and long-term efficacy of cognitive telerehabilitation protocol (tele@cognitive) as compared to an unstructured cognitive at-home rehabilitation (Active Control Group&amp;amp;mdash;ACG) in a cohort of 60 people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Subjective Cognitive Complaints (SCCs), or Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD). All participants will undergo a clinical, functional, neurocognitive, and quality of life assessment at the baseline (T0), post-treatment (5 weeks, T1), and at the 3-month (T2) follow-up. Neurophysiological markers and biomolecular data will be collected at T0 and T1. Conclusions: EARLY-COGN^3 project could lead to a complete paradigm shift from the traditional therapeutic approach, forcing a reassessment on how CNDs could take advantage of a digital solution.

	<p>Background: Major depressive disorder is a common mental health issue characterized by persistently low mood and high morbidity and mortality. The major pathophysiology is neuroinflammation, as evidenced by elevated cytokine levels. Patients often fail to achieve full remission with the use of currently available antidepressants, prompting the search for new treatment options. Schaftoside (SS), a flavonoid found in traditional Chinese herbs, has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its antidepressant effects are poorly understood. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment to induce depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. SS was administered at 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg for 28 days. The effect on depression-like behaviors was assessed using behavioral assays, and ELISA was used to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and hippocampus. Results: SS significantly decreased immobility in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, increased sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test, and reduced feeding latency in the novelty-suppressed feeding test. These findings indicate improved depression and anxiety-like behaviors. ELISA showed that SS lowered interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the serum and hippocampus of CUMS mice. Conclusions: Our study indicates that SS has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, possibly through neuroinflammatory processes, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for depression, and thus deserves further investigation into its mechanisms and clinical efficacy.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive decline and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pose a major challenge for the ageing population, with impaired synaptic plasticity playing a central role in their pathophysiology. This article explores the hypothesis that cortico&amp;amp;ndash;cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, can restore synaptic function by targeting impaired spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a key mechanism disrupted in AD. Methods: We reviewed existing studies investigating the effects of ccPAS on neuroplasticity in both ageing and AD populations. Results: Findings suggest age-specific effects, with ccPAS improving motor performance in young adults but showing limited efficacy in older adults, likely due to age-related declines in synaptic plasticity and cortical excitability. In AD, ccPAS studies reveal significant impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity, while long-term depression (LTD)-like mechanisms appear relatively preserved, emphasising the need for targeted neuromodulation approaches. Conclusions: Despite promising preliminary results, evidence remains limited and largely focused on motor function, with the impact of ccPAS on cognitive domains still underexplored. To bridge this gap, future research should focus on larger and more diverse cohorts to optimise ccPAS protocols for ageing and AD populations and investigate its potential for enhancing cognitive function. By refining stimulation parameters and integrating neuroimageing-based personalisation strategies, ccPAS may represent a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating neuroplasticity deficits in ageing and neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

	<p>Background: Blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI) can result in depression-like behaviors in the acute and chronic phases. SSRIs have been shown to significantly alleviate depression-like behaviors in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by increasing serotonin (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. However, the therapeutic effects of SSRIs on depression caused by bTBI remain unclear. Objective: Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the therapeutic effects of SSRIs on depression-like behaviors in bTBI models. Methods: We created a rat model to study mild TBI by subjecting rats to increased blast overpressures (BOP) and injecting fluoxetine and escitalopram SSRIs intraperitoneally for 28 days. Results: On day 14 post-BOP exposure, rats treated with SSRIs showed decreased depression-like behaviors. This finding was accompanied by higher 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and increased numbers of Nestin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, rats treated with SSRIs exhibited increased pCREB and BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus on days 7, 14, and 28 after bTBI. Conclusions: Overall, our findings indicate that SSRI-induced recovery from depression-like behaviors after mild bTBI is associated with the upregulation of 5-HT levels, pCREB and BDNF expression, and neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Suicides among U.S. military veterans are alarmingly high, driven by factors such as mental health issues, combat exposure, and history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)/concussion. This study aims to examine the relationship between concussion history, combat experience, and their effects on mental health issues and suicide ideation among military veterans. Additionally, this study investigates the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on these variables. Methods: A total of 78 veterans (62 males, 16 females) participated in this study. Participants completed a demographic survey and the Global Well-being Index (GWI) to assess concussion history and residual symptoms. A licensed social worker interviewed the veterans using the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder survey (7 Items) (GAD-7) for anxiety, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) for suicide ideation. A 2 &amp;amp;times; 2 cross-tabulation analysis examined the relationships between concussion history, combat experience, and outcomes of anxiety, depression, and suicide ideation. PTSD was also assessed as both a predictor and an outcome. Statistical analyses yielded odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), Chi-square, and Cramer&amp;amp;rsquo;s V (V) correlations along with associated p-values. Results: The combination of concussion history and combat experience strongly predicted either anxiety, depression, or suicide ideation (OR = 7.97, 95% CI: 1.70, 37.44; V = 0.334, (p = 0.003)), more than either factor alone. Combat experience was the strongest predictor of PTSD (OR = 11.12, 95% CI: 3.30, 37.47; V = 0.485, p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), both individually and when combined with concussion history. PTSD strongly influenced mental health issues and suicide ideation (OR = 8.16, 95% CI: 1.74, 38.25; V = 0.339, p = 0.003). Stratification by PTSD status (positive or negative) affected the relationships between independent and dependent variables. Small cell counts resulted in a wide 95% CI for some ORs, though some statistically significant Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s Exact Test results were observed. Credibility analysis using the critical prior interval (CPI) metric confirmed the intrinsic credibility of the results. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the relationships between concussion history, combat experience, and their impacts on mental health issues and suicide ideation among military veterans.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental fatigue can impair sport, exercise and cognitive performance. Warmup activities can improve performance when the individual is rested. However, their effectiveness when individual is fatigued has yet to be established. The research objectives were to evaluate the effects of physical and combined physical plus cognitive warmup activities on subsequent sport, exercise, and cognitive performance when rested and fatigued by sleep restriction in athletes (Study 1) and older adults (Study 2). Methods: In Study 1, 31 padel players completed a padel performance test and Stroop task after physical and combined warmups when rested and fatigued by sleep deprivation. In Study 2, 32 older adults completed sit&amp;amp;ndash;stand, arm curl, walking, Stroop, and psychomotor vigilance tests after no warmup, physical warmup, and combined warmup when rested and fatigued by sleep deprivation. In both studies, combined warmups intermixed short-, medium-, or long-duration cognitive tasks between physical warmup activities. Mental fatigue was measured using visual analog scale ratings. Results: In both studies, sleep deprivation increased mental fatigue and impaired performance. In Study 1, relative to a physical warmup, padel and Stroop performance were improved by combined warmups (with short-to-medium cognitive tasks) when rested and fatigued. In Study 2, relative to no warmup, sit&amp;amp;ndash;stand, arm curl, walking, Stroop, and reaction time performance were improved by physical and combined warmups (with short-to-medium cognitive tasks) when rested and fatigued. Conclusions: The negative effects of sleep deprivation on sport, exercise, and cognitive performance were best mitigated by combined warmups with short-to-medium cognitive tasks. Combined warmups are effective countermeasures against the deleterious effects of mental fatigue on performance.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Interest in diversity is growing worldwide. Today, an understanding and social acceptance of diverse people is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s gray matter volume (GMV), which is thought to reflect brain health, and their understanding of diversity (gender, sexuality (LGBTQ), and origin). Methods: GMV was determined as the value of the Gray Matter Brain Healthcare Quotient (GM-BHQ) based on MRI image analysis. Meanwhile, participants&amp;amp;rsquo; understanding and acceptance of diversity was calculated based on their answers to the psychological questions included in the World Values Survey Wave 7 (WVS7). Results: Our analysis indicated that, in the group of participants with the highest understanding of diversity (PHUD. n = 11), not only the GMV at the whole brain level (t = 2.587, p = 0.027, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.780) but also the GMV of the central executive network (CEN: t = 2.700, p= 0.022, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.814) and saliency network (SN: t = 3.100, p = 0.011, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.935) were shown to be significantly higher than the theoretical value estimated from sex, age, and BMI at the 5% level. In addition, the GMV of the default mode network (DMN: t = 2.063, p = 0.066, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.622) was also higher than the theoretical value at the 10% level. Meanwhile, in the group of others (n = 10), there was no significant difference from the theoretical value. These differences between PHUD and others were also observed when comparing the two with and without controlling for educational and occupational covariates at the 5% or 10% levels. Conclusions: These results suggest that understanding diversity requires a healthy brain, centered on three networks that govern rational judgment, emotion regulation, other-awareness, self-awareness, and the valuing of actions. This is the first study to show that brain structure is related to an understanding and acceptance of the diversity of people.</p>
