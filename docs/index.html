              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-244/v1?src=rss">Why COVID-19 vaccination cannot be ruled out as an explanation for all-cause excess mortality in the pandemic’s aftermath: A population-level study of over 3,000 US counties with over 320 million people [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research has shown consistent excess all-cause mortality since the COVID-19 pandemic, but without a clear explanation. In parallel, research has shown side effects from COVID-19 vaccination and increased deaths. Therefore, one cannot rule out COVID-19 vaccination as an explanation for the excess mortality. Methods US county-level data were used to model 2022 and 2023 all-cause excess mortality as dependent variables and per capita COVID-19 vaccine uptake at the end of 2021 and 2022 as independent variables. I included lagged dependent variables as controls. The data include over 3,000 US counties. Results A one-unit increase in per-capita vaccination uptake was significantly associated with a .042 (95% CI: .030–.055) increase in 2022 all-cause excess mortality, and significantly associated with a.030 (95% CI: .024–.036) increase in 2023. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine uptake was significantly positively associated with all-cause excess mortality. Given the time asymmetry between vaccine uptake and all-cause excess mortality, the inclusion of lagged dependent variables as controls, and the large number of observations, the study has strong internal validity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10361">ENIGMA: EEG-to-Image in 15 Minutes Using Less Than 1% of the Parameters</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To be practical for real-life applications, models for brain-computer interfaces must be easily and quickly deployable on new subjects, effective on affordable scanning hardware, and small enough to run locally on accessible computing resources. To directly address these current limitations, we introduce ENIGMA, a multi-subject electroencephalography (EEG)-to-Image decoding model that reconstructs seen images from EEG recordings and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the research-grade THINGS-EEG2 and consumer-grade AllJoined-1.6M benchmarks, while fine-tuning effectively on new subjects with as little as 15 minutes of data. ENIGMA boasts a simpler architecture and requires less than 1% of the trainable parameters necessary for previous approaches. Our approach integrates a subject-unified spatio-temporal backbone along with a set of multi-subject latent alignment layers and an MLP projector to map raw EEG signals to a rich visual latent space. We evaluate our approach using a broad suite of image reconstruction metrics that have been standardized in the adjacent field of fMRI-to-Image research, and we describe the first EEG-to-Image study to conduct extensive behavioral evaluations of our reconstructions using human raters. Our simple and robust architecture provides a significant performance boost across both research-grade and consumer-grade EEG hardware, and a substantial improvement in fine-tuning efficiency and inference cost. Finally, we provide extensive ablations to determine the architectural choices most responsible for our performance gains in both single and multi-subject cases across multiple benchmark datasets. Collectively, our work provides a substantial step towards the development of practical brain-computer interface applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11054">A Dynamical Microscope for Multivariate Oscillatory Signals: Validating Regime Recovery on Shared Manifolds</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate oscillatory signals from complex systems often exhibit non-stationary dynamics and metastable regime structure, making dynamical interpretation challenging. We introduce a ``dynamical microscope'' framework that converts multichannel signals into circular phase--amplitude features, learns a data-driven latent trajectory representation with an autoencoder, and quantifies dynamical regimes through trajectory geometry and flow field metrics. Using a coupled Stuart--Landau oscillator network with topology-switching as ground-truth validation, we demonstrate that the framework recovers differences in dynamical laws even when regimes occupy overlapping regions of state space. Group differences can be expressed as changes in latent trajectory speed, path geometry, and flow organization on a shared manifold, rather than requiring discrete state separation. Speed and explored variance show strong regime discriminability ($\eta^2 > 0.5$), while some metrics (e.g., tortuosity) capture trajectory geometry orthogonal to topology contrasts. The framework provides a principled approach for analyzing regime structure in multivariate time series from neural, physiological, or physical systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03111">Multi-modal Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders for Neural and Behavioral Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.03111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the relationship between neural population activity and behavioral data is a central goal of neuroscience. While latent variable models (LVMs) are successful in describing high-dimensional time-series data, they are typically only designed for a single type of data, making it difficult to identify structure shared across different experimental data modalities. Here, we address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts temporally evolving shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously recorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with temporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders (GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a latent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping to observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning latent variability into components that are either shared between or independent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the Fourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach over standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal data consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate smoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to not only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities accurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates on held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world multi-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging alongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements from ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01253">Metareasoning in uncertain environments: a meta-BAMDP framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.01253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \textit{Reasoning} may be viewed as an algorithm $P$ that makes a choice of an action $a^* \in \mathcal{A}$, aiming to optimize some outcome. However, executing $P$ itself bears costs (time, energy, limited capacity, etc.) and needs to be considered alongside explicit utility obtained by making the choice in the underlying decision problem. Finding the right $P$ can itself be framed as an optimization problem over the space of reasoning processes $P$, generally referred to as \textit{metareasoning}. Conventionally, human metareasoning models assume that the agent knows the transition and reward distributions of the underlying MDP. This paper generalizes such models by proposing a meta Bayes-Adaptive MDP (meta-BAMDP) framework to handle metareasoning in environments with unknown reward/transition distributions, which encompasses a far larger and more realistic set of planning problems that humans and AI systems face. As a first step, we apply the framework to Bernoulli bandit tasks. Owing to the meta problem's complexity, our solutions are necessarily approximate. However, we introduce two novel theorems that significantly enhance the tractability of the problem, enabling stronger approximations that are robust within a range of assumptions grounded in realistic human decision-making scenarios. These results offer a resource-rational perspective and a normative framework for understanding human exploration under cognitive constraints, as well as providing experimentally testable predictions about human behavior in Bernoulli Bandit tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08640">Universal Approximation Theorems for Dynamical Systems with Infinite-Time Horizon Guarantees</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.08640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal approximation theorems establish the expressive capacity of neural network architectures. For dynamical systems, existing results are limited to finite time horizons or systems with a globally stable equilibrium, leaving multistability and limit cycles unaddressed. We prove that Neural ODEs achieve $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ closeness -- trajectories within error $\varepsilon$ except for initial conditions of measure $< \delta$ -- over the \emph{infinite} time horizon $[0,\infty)$ for three target classes: (1) Morse-Smale systems (a structurally stable class) with hyperbolic fixed points, (2) Morse-Smale systems with hyperbolic limit cycles via exact period matching, and (3) systems with normally hyperbolic continuous attractors via discretization. We further establish a temporal generalization bound: $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ closeness implies $L^p$ error $\leq \varepsilon^p + \delta \cdot D^p$ for all $t \geq 0$, bridging topological guarantees to training metrics. These results provide the first universal approximation framework for multistable infinite-horizon dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10233">ImprovEvolve: Ask AlphaEvolve to Improve the Input Solution and Then Improvise</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve, have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. In this article, we present ImprovEvolve, a simple yet effective technique for enhancing LLM-based evolutionary approaches such as AlphaEvolve. Given an optimization problem, the standard approach is to evolve program code that, when executed, produces a solution close to the optimum. We propose an alternative program parameterization that maintains the ability to construct optimal solutions while reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. Specifically, we evolve a program (implementing, e.g., a Python class with a prescribed interface) that provides the following functionality: (1) propose a valid initial solution, (2) improve any given solution in terms of fitness, and (3) perturb a solution with a specified intensity. The optimum can then be approached by iteratively applying improve() and perturb() with a scheduled intensity. We evaluate ImprovEvolve on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: hexagon packing in a hexagon and the second autocorrelation inequality. For hexagon packing, the evolved program achieves new state-of-the-art results for 11, 12, 15, and 16 hexagons; a lightly human-edited variant further improves results for 14, 17, and 23 hexagons. For the second autocorrelation inequality, the human-edited program achieves a new state-of-the-art lower bound of 0.96258, improving upon AlphaEvolve's 0.96102.

                arXiv:2602.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas most brain-computer interface research has focused on decoding neural signals into behavior or intent, the reverse challenge-using controlled stimuli to steer brain activity-remains far less understood, particularly in the visual domain. However, designing images that consistently elicit desired neural responses is difficult: subjective states lack clear quantitative measures, and EEG feedback is both noisy and non-differentiable. We introduce MindPilot, the first closed-loop framework that uses EEG signals as optimization feedback to guide naturalistic image generation. Unlike prior work limited to invasive settings or low-level flicker stimuli, MindPilot leverages non-invasive EEG with natural images, treating the brain as a black-box function and employing a pseudo-model guidance mechanism to iteratively refine images without requiring explicit rewards or gradients. We validate MindPilot in both simulation and human experiments, demonstrating (i) efficient retrieval of semantic targets, (ii) closed-loop optimization of EEG features, and (iii) human-subject validations in mental matching and emotion regulation tasks. Our results establish the feasibility of EEG-guided image synthesis and open new avenues for non-invasive closed-loop brain modulation, bidirectional brain-computer interfaces, and neural signal-guided generative modeling.

                arXiv:2602.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work utilized a non-sequential simulation-based inference algorithm to provide an amortized neural density estimator, which approximates the posterior distribution for seven parameters of the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron model of the analog neuromorphic BrainScaleS-2 substrate. We constrained the large parameter space by training a binary classifier to predict parameter combinations yielding observations in regimes of interest, i.e. moderate spike counts. We compared two neural density estimators: one using handcrafted summary statistics and one using a summary network trained in combination with the neural density estimator. The summary network yielded a more focused posterior and generated posterior predictive traces that accurately captured the membrane potential dynamics. When using handcrafted summary statistics, posterior predictive traces match the included features but show deviations in the exact dynamics. The posteriors showed signs of bias and miscalibration but were still able to yield posterior predictive samples that were close to the target observations on which the posteriors were constrained. Our results validate amortized simulation-based inference as a tool for parameterizing analog neuron circuits.

                arXiv:2602.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task policy search is a challenging problem because policies are required to generalize beyond training cases. Curriculum learning has proven to be effective in this setting, as it introduces complexity progressively. However, designing effective curricula is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain expertise. LLM-based curriculum generation has only recently emerged as a potential solution, but was limited to operate in static, offline modes without leveraging real-time feedback from the optimizer. Here we propose an interactive LLM-assisted framework for online curriculum generation, where the LLM adaptively designs training cases based on real-time feedback from the evolutionary optimization process. We investigate how different feedback modalities, ranging from numeric metrics alone to combinations with plots and behavior visualizations, influence the LLM ability to generate meaningful curricula. Through a 2D robot navigation case study, tackled with genetic programming as optimizer, we evaluate our approach against static LLM-generated curricula and expert-designed baselines. We show that interactive curriculum generation outperforms static approaches, with multimodal feedback incorporating both progression plots and behavior visualizations yielding performance competitive with expert-designed curricula. This work contributes to understanding how LLMs can serve as interactive curriculum designers for embodied AI systems, with potential extensions to broader evolutionary robotics applications.

                arXiv:2509.20284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing biologically plausible learning algorithms that can achieve performance comparable to error backpropagation remains a longstanding challenge. Existing approaches often compromise biological plausibility by entirely avoiding the use of spikes for error propagation or relying on both positive and negative learning signals, while the question of how spikes can represent negative values remains unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce Bidirectional Spike-based Distillation (BSD), a novel learning algorithm that jointly trains a feedforward and a backward spiking network. We formulate learning as a transformation between two spiking representations (i.e., stimulus encoding and concept encoding) so that the feedforward network implements perception and decision-making by mapping stimuli to actions, while the backward network supports memory recall by reconstructing stimuli from concept representations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including image recognition, image generation, and sequential regression, show that BSD achieves performance comparable to networks trained with classical error backpropagation. These findings represent a significant step toward biologically grounded, spike-driven learning in neural networks. Our code is available at https://github.com/alden199/Bidirectional-Spike-Based-Distillation.

                arXiv:2510.17392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Cortical Neural Pool (CNP) architecture featuring a high-speed, resource-efficient CORDIC based Hodgkin-Huxley (RCHH) neuron model. Unlike shared CORDIC-based DNN approaches, the proposed neuron leverages modular and performance-optimised CORDIC stages with a latency-area trade-off. We introduce a novel Constraint-Aware Modular Parallelism (CAMP) with Precision & Stability handling to leverage maximum speedup and utilisation of hardware through hardware software co-design. The FPGA implementation of the RCHH neuron shows 24.5% LUT reduction and 35.2% improved speed, compared to SoTA designs, with 70% better normalised root mean square error (NRMSE). Furthermore, the CNP exhibits 2.85x higher throughput (12.69 GOPS) than a functionally equivalent CORDIC-based DNN engine, with only a 0.35% accuracy drop relative to the DNN counterpart on the MNIST dataset. The overall results indicate that the design shows biologically accurate, low-resource spiking neural network implementations for resource-constrained edge AI applications. The reproducibility codes are publicly available at https://github.com/mukullokhande99/CNP RCHH, facilitating rapid integration and further development by researchers.

                arXiv:2507.06082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: evortran is a modern Fortran library designed for high-performance genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimization. evortran can be used to tackle a wide range of problems in high-energy physics and beyond, such as derivative-free parameter optimization, complex search taks, parameter scans and fitting experimental data under the presence of instrumental noise. The library is built as an fpm package with flexibility and efficiency in mind, while also offering a simple installation process, user interface and integration into existing Fortran (or Python) programs. evortran offers a variety of selection, crossover, mutation and elitism strategies, with which users can tailor an evolutionary algorithm to their specific needs. evortran supports different abstraction levels: from operating directly on individuals and populations, to running full evolutionary cycles, and even enabling migration between independently evolving populations to enhance convergence and maintain diversity. In this paper, we present the functionality of the evortran library, demonstrate its capabilities with example benchmark applications, and compare its performance with existing genetic algorithm frameworks. As physics-motivated applications, we use evortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct gravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA mock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.

                arXiv:2601.01082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms are typically limited to low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the state-of-the-art CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and hence receive the same discount value. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new capabilities for QD algorithms by introducing two new domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other existing black-box QD algorithms.

                arXiv:2601.21557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained solely on massive text data, have achieved high performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a benchmark proposed to measure commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities about the real world. This suggests that the language produced by humanity describes a significant portion of the world with considerable nuance. In this study, we attempt to harness the high expressive power of language within cellular automata. Specifically, we express cell states and rules in natural language and delegate their updates to an LLM. Through this approach, cellular automata can transcend the constraints of merely numerical states and fixed rules, providing us with a richer platform for simulation. Here, we propose LOGOS-CA (Language Oriented Grid Of Statements - Cellular Automaton) as a natural framework to achieve this and examine its capabilities. We confirmed that LOGOS-CA successfully performs simple forest fire simulations and also serves as an intriguing subject for investigation from an Artificial Life (ALife) perspective. In this paper, we report the results of these experiments and discuss directions for future research using LOGOS-CA.

                arXiv:2602.08515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of shallow physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving forward and inverse problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). By reformulating PINNs as nonlinear systems, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is employed to efficiently optimize the network parameters. Analytical expressions for the neural network derivatives with respect to the input variables are derived, enabling accurate and efficient computation of the Jacobian matrix required by LM. The proposed approach is tested on several benchmark problems, including the Burgers, Schr\"odinger, Allen-Cahn, and three-dimensional Bratu equations. Numerical results demonstrate that LM significantly outperforms BFGS in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and final loss values, even when using shallow network architectures with only two hidden layers. These findings indicate that, for a wide class of PDEs, shallow PINNs combined with efficient second-order optimization methods can provide accurate and computationally efficient solutions for both forward and inverse problems.

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant opportunities to improve the field of implementation science by supporting key activities such as evidence synthesis, contextual analysis, and decision-making to promote the adoption and sustainability of evidence-based practices. This living scoping review aims to: (1) map applications of AI in implementation research and practice; (2) identify evaluation approaches, reported outcomes, and potential risks; and (3) synthesize reported research gaps and opportunities for advancing the use of AI in implementation science. Methods This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the Cochrane guidance for living systematic reviews. A living scoping review is warranted to keep up with the rapid changes in AI and its growing use in implementation science. We will include empirical studies, systematic reviews, grey literature, and policy documents that describe or evaluate applications of AI to support implementation science across the steps of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Model. AI methods and models of interest include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, large language models, and related technologies and approaches. A search strategy will be applied to bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science), relevant journals, conference proceedings, and preprint servers. Two reviewers will independently screen studies and extract data on AI characteristics, specific implementation task according to the KTA Model, evaluation methods, outcome domains, risks, and research gaps. Extracted data will be analyzed descriptively and synthesized narratively using a mapping approach aligned with the KTA Model. Discussion This living review will consolidate the evidence base on how AI is applied across the spectrum of implementation science. It will inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to harness AI to improve the adoption, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, while identifying areas for methodological advancement and risk mitigation.

                Background In the context of accelerating digital transformation, the alignment between digital transformation initiatives and sustainable supply chain finance has become an important issue for firms seeking to improve operational coordination and financial efficiency. This alignment, however, is influenced not only by technological adoption but also by organizational and contextual conditions such as governance structures, strategic orientation, and resource availability. Existing studies have not sufficiently examined how these contextual factors jointly shape the integration of digital transformation and supply chain finance. Methods This study adopts a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis based on survey data with qualitative insights. A multidimensional analytical framework is developed to examine the contextual factors affecting the integration between digital transformation and sustainable supply chain finance. The framework includes leadership vision, strategic orientation, information-sharing mechanisms, supplier collaboration, organizational resources, process readiness, and access to financial and credit resources. Results The findings indicate that these contextual factors collectively influence the degree of alignment between digital transformation initiatives and sustainable supply chain financial models. Leadership vision and clear strategic orientation play a central role in guiding coordination among supply chain actors. Effective information-sharing mechanisms support collaboration and transparency across partners. In addition, organizational resources and process readiness significantly affect the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing digital solutions linked to supply chain finance. Access to financial and credit resources also conditions firms’ ability to operationalize such initiatives. Conclusion The study provides empirical evidence on how organizational and contextual conditions shape the integration of digital transformation with sustainable supply chain finance. The results suggest that alignment depends on a combination of strategic direction, internal capabilities, and coordination mechanisms, offering useful implications for firms seeking to design digital transformation initiatives that are consistent with their organizational capacities and operational contexts.

                Background The detection of malware in network traffic remains a critical cybersecurity challenge. Traditional signature-based intrusion detection demonstrates a high level of familiarity with issues that have been recorded in the database; but show significantly lower effectiveness when it comes to polymorphic or zero-day attacks. Conversely, anomaly-based approaches are also endowed with the ability to detect new incursions, but often have a high false-positive rate. Methods This study proposes a combined malware-detection framework which makes use of RNA encoding network-flow attributes alongside Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers. The framework has three functionalities: a Signature-CNN, which is trained on RNA-encoded representation of known malicious flows; an Anomaly-CNN, which is developed to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic without any signature prior knowledge; and a Hybrid-CNN, which combines both paradigms in a two-stage detection pipeline. Results Experiments conducted on the Malicious Network Dataset show that the Signature-CNN achieves 91% accuracy with strong precision on known threats, the Anomaly-CNN achieves 93% detection rate on unknown malware, and the Hybrid-CNN achieves the best overall performance with 95% detection rate and 94.5% F1 score. Conclusions The results demonstrate that RNA encoding combined with CNN classifiers offers a robust and scalable solution for malware detection in networked environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-240/v1?src=rss">Smart School Attendance: Virtual Solution to Optimize Registration and Parental Monitoring in Secondary Level Schools in Imperial, Cañete. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background School attendance monitoring is an essential component of educational management in public schools, especially at secondary schools. In Peruvian rural regions such as Imperial-Cañete, attendance is registered manually, generating inefficiencies, human error, and lack of immediate traceability. This situation is amplified by digital divide: only 18.5% of rural houses have stable internet access, limiting the implementation platforms that depend on constant connectivity. Methods The study was realized using agile methodology (Scrum) with five phases to develop a web-based attendance system. Phase one involved analyzing requirements for the attendance system based on needs of school employees and parents. Phase two involved prioritizing requirements and defining tasks with deadlines. Implementation used modern web technologies (Next.js, Node.js, WebSockets) and hybrid data architecture (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Google Drive) to ensure efficient and reliable operation. Finally, after completing previous phases, developed software was implemented and additional testing to ensure correct functionality. Results After implementation of the web platform, we identified significant improvements: complete automation of attendance registration using QR codes, which drastically reduced registration times and errors associated with manual methods; successful implementation of real-time parental monitoring, allowing parents access to their children’s daily and monthly attendance registers; integration of automatic email notifications to tutors and administrators in cases of consecutive absences or tardiness; and differentiated role-based access for school employees (assistants, teachers, and directors). The use of information technology ensured operational consistency even under poor connectivity conditions through local caching (IndexedDB) and synchronization. Conclusions This research focuses specifically on optimizing attendance management in rural secondary schools using information technology. The study is characterized by its personalized web platform designed to support the specific needs of educational institutions with limited connections. The results demonstrated the efficiency of this robust approach and its positive impact on school attendance management.

                <p>Cognitive flexibility, a mental process crucial for adaptive behavior, involves multiscale functioning across several neuronal organization levels. While its neural underpinnings have been studied for decades, limited knowledge exists about the structure and age-related differentiation of the white matter (WM) subserving brain regions implicated in cognitive flexibility. This study investigated the population-level relationship between cognitive flexibility and WM properties across two periods of human adulthood, aiming to discern how these associations vary over different life stages and brain tracts among men and women. We propose a novel framework to study age effects in brain structure&ndash;function associations. First, a meta-analysis was conducted to identify neural regions associated with cognitive flexibility. Next, projections of these neural regions were traced through the Human Connectome Project tractography template to identify the subserving WM associated with cognitive flexibility. Then, a cohort analysis was performed to characterize myelin-related macromolecular features using a subset of the UK Biobank magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which has a companion functional/behavioral dataset. We found that (1) the wiring of cognitive flexibility is defined by a subset of brain tracts, which present undifferentiated features early in adulthood and significantly differentiated types in later life. (2) These MRI-derived properties are correlated with individual subprocesses of cognition closely related to cognitive flexibility. (3) In late life, homogeneity of specific WM tracts implicated in cognitive flexibility declines with age, a phenomenon not observed in early life. Our findings support the age-related differentiation of WM implicated in cognitive flexibility as a natural substrate of adaptive cognitive function.</p>

                <p>Natural environments contain behaviorally relevant information along many stimulus dimensions, each of which sensory systems must encode in order to guide behaviors. For example, the mammalian visual cortex encodes features of visual scenes such as spatial information related to object identity and temporal information about the motion of those objects in space. In order to reliably encode these behaviorally relevant visual features, neural representations should be robust to changes in environmental conditions. Further, information about changes in environmental conditions, such as the luminance changes that occur over the course of a day, is also important for guiding behaviors. In this study, we asked whether mouse primary visual cortex (V1) jointly represents the spatial properties of visual stimuli along with changes in the mean luminance of the visual scene. We find that while V1 neurons, in mice of either sex, encode spatial aspects of visual information in an invariant manner across luminance conditions, the V1 population response also contains a robust representation of luminance. Importantly, V1 populations encode changes in stimulus orientation and mean luminance along orthogonal axes in the neural response space, such that a change in one stimulus variable is encoded independently from the other.</p>

                <p>Neurexins (Nrxns) are presynaptic cell adhesion molecules essential for synapse development and function. Of the many neurexin isoforms, only &beta;-Nrxns contain the histidine-rich domain (HRD). While the HRD has been implicated in several pathological contexts, its normal physiological role remains unclear. To address this, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 method to generate a new mouse line expressing in-frame truncated Nrxn1&beta; lacking the HRD. We found that HRD deletion did not affect mouse viability, gross brain development, or general behavior of either sex. However, loss of the HRD significantly altered neuroligin-1-dependent excitatory, but not inhibitory, presynaptic differentiation in primary cultured neurons. Moreover, this deletion affected presynaptic short-term plasticity, but not basal synaptic transmission, at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-&gt;CA1 synapses. These findings identify the Nrxn1&beta; HRD as a potential contributor to excitatory presynaptic organization and function, providing new insight into the molecular diversity and specialization of Nrxns.</p>

                <p>Social cognition, central to emotional and cognitive well-being, is particularly vulnerable to aging, where impairments can lead to isolation and functional decline. Despite compelling evidence that altered social behavior is associated with cognitive decline and dementia risk, experimental strategies for testing causative links remain scarce. To address this gap, we aimed to establish a rat model for research on social neurocognitive aging. We conducted a large-scale behavioral study in 169 male young (6&nbsp;months) and aged (24&ndash;25&nbsp;months) Long&ndash;Evans rats. In order to explore potential relationships among aging outcomes, we first documented individual differences in a widely validated water maze test of hippocampal learning and memory. Sociability and social novelty were then evaluated in the same subjects using the three-chamber social interaction test. Aging induced a selective shift in social novelty preference, marked by a striking familiarity bias in a substantial subpopulation of old rats, while sociability remained entirely normal. Changes in social novelty preference were completely independent of individual differences in spatial memory and unrelated to anxiety or sensorimotor function. Notably, neuromodulation via TMS enhanced social novelty preference selectively in aged rats that exhibited a social introversion phenotype before treatment, consistent with the possibility that this aging condition reflects a distinct and modifiable neural network state. Together, the results establish a valuable preclinical framework for developing a comprehensive neurobiology of social cognition in aging.</p>

                Background Rapid advances in general-purpose artificial intelligence are compressing automation timelines: around 40–50% of tasks in advanced economies are technically automatable, and a quarter of total hours could be migrated to machines before 2030. Fears of large-scale displacement from artificial-intelligence (AI) adoption have prompted calls for either mass reskilling or unconditional cash transfers. Another option, the emergence of a “supervisory economy” in which humans specialise in overseeing AI systems, remains empirically under-examined. Methods Using a balanced panel of 12 economies observed annually from 2014 to 2023, we construct a sector-weighted AI-exposure index and match it to labour-force data on unemployment, supervisory employment, public transfers, R&D, and GDP per capita. Two-way fixed-effects regressions are estimated, first linearly and then with a quadratic AI term to capture non-linearity in technology shocks. Robustness checks include lagged covariates, alternative normalisations and clustered standard errors. Results The preferred quadratic specification reveals an inverted-U relationship between aggregate AI exposure and unemployment: joblessness rises at low-to-moderate exposure but falls once adoption surpasses approximately 1.7 standard deviations above the mean. Supervisory depth—measured as the share of senior- and middle-management roles—has no significant standalone effect and does not significantly moderate AI’s impact. Higher real income consistently dampens unemployment, while public transfers and contemporaneous R&D outlays show limited short-run cushioning. Conclusions National labour markets appear to follow a concave AI trajectory: modest automation initially displaces routine labour, but at high penetration, complementary demand offsets job losses. However, simply expanding managerial layers is insufficient to buffer early shocks; effective resilience likely hinges on coupling oversight capacity with targeted technical upskilling and productivity-enhancing growth. Policy mixes that rely primarily on cash transfers or untargeted innovation spending risk delaying, rather than mitigating, employment re-equilibration in the age of AI.

                Background Multicultural education plays a crucial role in the era of globalization; however, the influence of gender and certification status on teachers’ online multicultural teaching competency (OMTC) remain underexplored. This study aims to analyze the impact of gender and certification status on teachers’ OMTC, focusing on skills, knowledge, and overall multicultural competence. Method A mixed method approach (explanatory sequential design) was employed, involving 106 elementary school teachers from West Java Province, Indonesia (M±SD age = 37.44±9.17; teaching experience = 10.17±9.18), including 41 males (38.68%) and 65 females (61.32%), selected through a simple random sampling. Quantitative data were collected using the Multicultural Teaching Competency Scale (MTCS), and qualitative data were gathered through structured interviews. The quantitative were analyzed using an independent samples-test, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The quantitative results indicate that gender had no significant effect on OMTC. However, certification status significantly influenced multicultural teaching skills, though it not affect multicultural teaching knowledge or the overall OMTC score. The qualitative findings identified key thematic factors contributing to these differences, including conceptual understanding, lesson planning, integration of minority cultures, empathy and reflection, and community collaboration. Certified teachers were found to be more proficient in designing inclusive learning experience and fostering empathy. However, conceptual understanding remained varied, and community collaboration was limited. Conclusions The study concludes that certification is more effective in enhancing technical competencies, rather than conceptual or affective aspects. These finding suggest that teacher training should adopt a transformative, reflective, and contextually grounded approach to comprehensively enhance teachers’ OMTC.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-237/v1?src=rss">The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm and suicidal behaviours in children and young people: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective The COVID-19 pandemic brought global disruption, increased mortality, and concern about mental health impacts. Although children and young people (CYP) generally experienced less severe physical symptoms, public health measures such as school closures and restricted social interactions likely had adverse effects. Concerns were raised that risks of suicide and self-harm could increase during and after the pandemic. This review examined the extent to which these concerns were reflected in published evidence. Design A systematic search of databases was conducted for quantitative observational studies reporting suicide deaths, self-harm (including non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempts), or suicidal ideation in individuals aged 24 years and under. Studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2022 were included. Quality was assessed using National Institutes of Health tools. Due to methodological heterogeneity, findings were synthesised narratively. Results Eighty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 23 reported on suicide, 53 on self-harm, and 27 on suicidal ideation. Two were not peer-reviewed; all were observational. Most were conducted in healthcare settings and presented pre- and post-pandemic data. Half were rated low quality. Suicide data, largely from high-income countries, showed little or no overall change, though some studies reported increases among males. Moderate- or high-quality studies of self-harm indicated increases, especially from late 2020 into 2021/2022, and more pronounced among females. Increases in suicidal ideation were also reported, mainly in cohort or healthcare-based studies, though most were low quality. Conclusions The pandemic appeared to have minimal immediate impact on suicide rates in CYP. There was limited evidence from low- and middle-income countries, ethnic minorities, low-income households, and marginalised groups. Evidence of increased self-harm, particularly among females, highlights the need for age- and gender-specific policies, care pathways, and prevention strategies that are adaptable during future public health crises and ensure timely access to effective support.

                Background The present study is concerned with the challenges facing international trade in the agricultural sector, which are related to diversification, competitiveness and sustainability. In this regard, it is imperative for agricultural export companies dealing in lima beans to develop effective export strategies in order to strengthen their commercial performance. This research aims to determine the extent of the effectiveness of export strategies in export companies in the agricultural sector, based on a bibliometric analysis of scientific literature. Methods The PRISMA 2020 methodology was applied, processing 8,578 records from Scopus, Dimensions and Web of Science, using Bibliometrix (RStudio) and VOSviewer tools for the analysis and visualisation of thematic networks, of which 44 articles between 1976 and 2024 met the inclusion criteria. The final corpus included 44 articles published between 1976 and 2024. Results The results identify four thematic blocks: (i) product and market diversification strategy, (ii) associativity strategy, (iii) quality and sustainability strategy, and (iv) international marketing strategy, where scientific production is concentrated in China, the United Kingdom and the United States, with little participation from Latin America. Conclusions As demonstrated by the study, the integration of export strategies is a pivotal factor contributing to the enhancement of companies’ commercial performance in international markets. This phenomenon has been shown to consolidate and balance the sustainability and competitiveness of agro-export chains in the agricultural sector.

                Introduction Indonesia is located along the “Thalassemia Belt,” a hotspot region for hemoglobinopathies, including beta thalassemia, with approximately 3–10% of the Indonesian population diagnosed with this disease. Thalassemia was diagnosed using the Hb analysis results. However, the single nucleotide variant (SNVs) database for the Indonesian population, which leads to β-thalassemia disease, has not been extensively studied. This study aimed to profile the genetic variations in Indonesian β-thalassemia patients and conduct in silico characterization of their functional effects. Methods Twenty thalassemia patients were recruited for this study. The sample collected from the respondents was whole blood in EDTA tubes, with a minimum collection time of 14 days after blood transfusion. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using a commercial kit, directly amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with specific primers for β-globin and sequenced using Sanger Sequencing. All variants located in exon regions were analyzed using FinchTV, BioEdit, and Biovia Discovery Studio to determine their functional impact. Results Ten reported pathogenic variants were observed along with one rare variant. Genetic variations found according to its common name and nomenclature based on Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) are IVS1nt.1 (HGVS: c.92+1G>A), IVS1nt.1 (HGVS: c.92+1G>T), IVS1nt.2 (HGVS: c.92+2G>T), IVS1nt.5 (HGVS: c.92+5G>C), IVS2nt.654 (HGVS: c.316-197C>T), Cd15 (HGVS: c.47G>A), Cd26 (HGVS: c.79G>A), Cd30 (HGVS: c.92G>C), Cd41/42 (c.126_129delCTTT), and Cd35 (HGVS: c.110delC). Analysis of amino acid interactions revealed that disease-causing mutations were clinically relevant in each subject. Conclusions This study has bioinformatically proven the effect of genetic mutations and predicted their effect on amino acid interactions. These findings contribute to the study of Indonesian thalassemia and require further research.

                <p>by Chenfei Zhang, Edmund T. Rolls, Jianfeng Feng</p>

How transform-invariant visual representations of objects and faces are learned in the ventral visual cortical pathway is a massive computational problem. Here we describe key advances towards a biologically plausible four-layer network that performs these computations from the primary visual cortex to the inferior temporal visual cortex. The architecture is a four-layer competitive network with layer-to-layer convergence using a short-term memory trace local synaptic learning rule to associate transforming inputs from an object during natural viewing. The key advances towards biological plausibility include: (1) a synaptic modification rule including long-term depression dependent on synaptic strength instead of artificial synaptic weight normalization; (2) limiting the strength of synapses promotes distributed weights, improving transform-invariant learning; (3) reducing the ability of low firing rate neurons to participate in learning analogous to the NMDA receptor non-linearity can increase the storage capacity; (4) demonstrated network scalability towards high capacity. These advances have many implications for better understanding of cortical computations. These advances in biological plausibility of this approach are compared with artificial networks of the same ventral cortical processing stream that do not use a local synaptic learning rule and are less biologically plausible, and implications for AI models are described.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013956">A comparative study of statistical methods for identifying differentially expressed genes in spatial transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yishan Wang, Chenxuan Zang, Ziyi Li, Charles C. Guo, Dejian Lai, Peng Wei</p>

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides unprecedented insights into gene expression patterns while retaining spatial context, making it a valuable tool for understanding complex tissue architectures, such as those found in cancers. Seurat, by far the most popular tool for analyzing ST data, uses the Wilcoxon rank-sum test by default for differential expression analysis. However, as a nonparametric method that disregards spatial correlations, the Wilcoxon test can lead to inflated false positive rates and misleading findings. This limitation highlights the need for a more robust statistical approach that effectively incorporates spatial correlations. To this end, we propose a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) framework as a robust solution for differential gene expression analysis in ST. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the GEE-based tests with existing methods, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and <i>z</i>-test. By appropriately accounting for spatial correlations, extensive simulations showed that the GEE test with robust standard error, referred to as the Independent GEE, demonstrated superior Type I error control and comparable power relative to other methods. Applications to ST datasets from breast and prostate cancer showed poor calibration of the p-values and potential false positive findings from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Our comparative study based on simulations and real data applications suggests that the Independent GEE test is well-suited for ST data, offering more accurate identification of biologically relevant gene expression changes and complementing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We have implemented the proposed method in R package “SpatialGEE”, available on GitHub.

                <p>by Mahboubeh Ahmadipour, Federico Fattorini, Nicolò Meneghetti, Alberto Mazzoni</p>

In Parkinson’s disease (PD), the beta band (12–30 Hz) component of basal ganglia activity is pathologically high. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment to suppress symptoms of PD and is known to suppress pathological beta activity. However, the mechanism underlying this effect is not completely understood. Here, we tested the circuital effects of DBS in a computational model of the basal ganglia network in dopamine-depleted condition mimicking PD. Our model reproduces suppression of beta pathological oscillations in the basal ganglia network induced by subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. Crucially, this occurs for realistic levels of DBS intensity only if we incorporate short-term plasticity in projections from STN, increasing the DBS intensity required for suppression of pathological beta oscillations. STN stimulation hampers beta oscillations in the subthalamo-pallidal beta loop. This induces a progressive dephasing between this loop and the striato-pallidal beta loop, which leads in turn to a network-wide suppression of beta oscillations. This is also reflected in a restoration of the balance between D1 and D2 firing rates, which was altered by dopamine depletion. Moreover, the model also reproduces the DBS-induced gamma activity associated with symptom recovery. Finally, we explored the circuital effects of a broad range of DBS parameters in suppressing beta oscillations, focusing on the clinically relevant range of 60–150 Hz stimulation. The model suggests that 60–80 Hz stimulation frequencies might achieve beta desynchronization for an intensity even lower than the one needed at the standard 130 Hz frequency. Overall, our model lays the ground for in-silico tests of a broad spectrum of stimulation patterns.

Recent developments in DNA synthesis and sequencing allowed the construction of comprehensive gene variant libraries and their functional analysis. Achieving high-replication and thorough mutation characterization remains technically and financially challenging for long genes. Here, we developed an efficient, affordable, and scalable library construction approach that relies on low-cost DNA synthesis and standard cloning technologies, which will increase accessibility to mutational studies and help advance the field of protein science. Each degenerate codon variant is physically associated with multiple DNA barcodes during synthesis, which overcomes the need for long-read sequencing for linking variants to barcodes. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by constructing a complete library for <i>PDR1</i>, a 3.2 kb multidrug resistance gene encoding a pleiotropic transcription factor in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We demonstrate a near-perfect correspondence in the measurement of amino acid variants impact when assessed by barcode sequencing and direct sequencing of the mutated coding sequence.

                Background Although digital workplaces are increasingly being adopted across academic institutions, many universities still perceive them merely as technological tools rather than as integrated socio-organizational systems that foster productive organizational energy. This study addresses this gap by examining the effect of digital workplace dimensions—digital space, aesthetics, capabilities, and intelligence—on productive organizational energy at the University of Fallujah. Methods Using a descriptive-analytical approach, data from 290 respondents were analyzed using SPSS v.28 and Smart PLS v.4, employing confirmatory factor analysis and multiple regression. Results The overall digital workplace demonstrated a strong positive influence on productive organizational energy (β = 0.892, R2 = 0.75, F = 865.962, P < 0.001). Among these dimensions, digital intelligence exerted the highest impact (β = 0.819, R2 = 0.69), followed by digital capabilities (β = 0.775, R2 = 0.67), digital space (β = 0.651, R2 = 0.59), and digital aesthetics (β = 0.665, R2 = 0.48). These findings confirm that smart technologies and analytics significantly enhance emotional, cognitive, and behavioral energy across staff, thereby improving motivation and efficiency. Conclusions Theoretically, this research extends the digital transformation literature by linking digital workplace constructs to organizational energy, underscoring the necessity of strengthening digital intelligence and employee capabilities to advance institutional performance.

                Water pollution is an escalating environmental issue, particularly in developing nations. The Euphrates and Nadhim Al-Warar rivers in Ramadi City are heavily affected by waste from industrial, agricultural, and medical sources, resulting in significant changes to their physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of water treatment methods by examining the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the Euphrates and Nadhim Al-Warar rivers both prior to and following treatment. Water samples were gathered from both rivers from August 2023 to January 2024. The analysis included physical parameters (turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity), chemical constituents (dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness), and levels of microbiological contamination, utilizing established laboratory protocols such as bacterial culture and identification methods. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the T-test with SPSS (2019). The results demonstrated significant reductions in turbidity, TDS, and TSS after treatment at both study sites (P ≤ 0.05), which points to an improvement in water clarity and a decrease in both particulate and dissolved loads. However, most other physicochemical parameters did not show significant differences between the values recorded before and after treatment. Microbial analysis indicated high levels of contamination, with E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus found in 90% of Al-Warar samples, along with Klebsiella (70%), Salmonella (40%), and Proteus (20%). Similar results were noted in the Euphrates, which also revealed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although water treatment led to improvements in certain physical characteristics, its impact on dissolved pollutants was limited. The ongoing presence of pathogenic bacteria underscores the necessity for more advanced purification techniques to guarantee safe water quality for human uses.

                Background To evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in the integral care of patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods A pre-experimental study was carried out with 103 patients with diabetes mellitus treated at Essalud, La Libertad, during the second quarter of 2024. Pre and post educational intervention information was collected about knowledge of the disease, complications, physical activity and diet, adherence to treatment and family support, number of medical and nursing controls per quarter, glycemia values, HbA1c and compliance with treatment after informed consent. The educational intervention included theoretical aspects of diabetes mellitus, self-care, physical activity, nutrition and family support in 2-hour workshops, once a week, for 2 months. Results Predominantly female, mean age 63.22 years, higher education, marital status married/cohabiting and main occupation employed/independent. The 97.1% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 38.8% reported disease duration < 5 years, 72.8% were treated with metformin and the main comorbidity was hypertension (58.3%). The educational intervention improved knowledge about diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), achieved a significant change in eating habits (p = 0.022) and family support (p = 0.043), and homogenized the level of support among families (p = 0.025). 51.5% of the participants were noncompliant with the prescribed treatment. A significant difference (p < 0.01) was observed in the proportion of patients complying with treatment before and after the intervention. 76.8% of patients who initially complied with treatment continued to do so after the intervention. The efficacy of the educational program on glycemic control was not evidenced. Regarding integral control, 83.5 % of the patients received quarterly medical care and 44.7 % received nursing care. Conclusion The educational program was effective in improving knowledge about DM2, adherence to healthy eating and significantly improved the level of family support and compliance with treatment.

                Lee et al. reveal that short-term acidosis suppresses cancer cell aggressiveness across cell types. Hypoxia overrides acidosis-mediated inhibition of motility by restoring NHE1/ILK function and maintaining bioenergetic balance through compensatory glycolysis. Adaptation to chronic acidosis is cell-specific and depends on a cell’s ability to restrain ROS via fatty acid oxidation.

                Fungal infections can induce ER stress, but whether ER stress affects antifungal immune signaling remains unclear. Wu et al. reveal that upon fungal stimulation, the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response pathway is activated by triglyceride synthesis and then mediates autophagic degradation of SHP-1 to amplify SYK-associated antifungal immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104978">Single-cell atlas of AML reveals age-related gene regulatory networks in t(8;21) AML</a></h4>

              
                Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by cellular and genetic heterogeneity, which correlates with clinical course. Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reflects this diversity to some extent, the low sample numbers in individual studies limit the analytic potential when comparing specific patient groups. We performed large-scale integration of published scRNA-seq datasets to create a unique single-cell transcriptomic atlas for AML (AML scAtlas), totaling 748,679 cells, from 159 AML patients and 51 healthy donors from 20 different studies. This is the largest single-cell data resource for human AML to our knowledge, publicly available at <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/071b706a-7ea7-47a4-bddf-6457725839fc">https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/071b706a-7ea7-47a4-bddf-6457725839fc</a>. This AML scAtlas allowed investigations into 20 patients with t(8;21) AML, where we explored the clinical importance of age, given the in-utero origin of pediatric disease. We uncovered age-associated gene regulatory network (GRN) signatures, which we validated using bulk RNA sequencing data to delineate distinct groups with divergent biological characteristics. Furthermore, using an additional multiomic dataset (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq), we validated our initial findings and created a de-noised enhancer-driven GRN reflecting the previously defined age-related signatures. Applying integrated data analysis of the AML scAtlas, we reveal age-dependent gene regulation in t(8;21) AML, potentially reflecting immature/fetal HSC origin in prenatal origin disease vs postnatal origin. Our analysis revealed that BCLAF1, which is particularly enriched in pediatric AML with t(8;21) of inferred in-utero origin, is a promising prognostic indicator. The AML scAtlas provides a powerful resource to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying different AML subtypes.

">Hierarchical binding of cognition to action in the human basal ganglia-thalamic circuit</a></h4>

              
                Flexible behavior requires binding actions to their underlying cognitive variables, yet classical basal ganglia models emphasize a serial architecture where striatal action selection precedes a pallidothalamic motor gate. We tested this framework by recordeding single-neuron activity across the human pallidothalamic circuit while participants reported perceptual decisions with confidence-weighted reaching movements. Neurons in globus pallidus externus and internus, subthalamic nucleus, and motor thalamus exhibited sharp activity increases at movement onset that persisted through execution and feedback. Choice and confidence were continuously encoded before, during, and after movement. Population decoding revealed a transformation along the circuit, from dynamic upstream representations to stable, low-dimensional representations downstream, particularly in motor thalamus. After feedback, outcome signals emerged selectively in subthalamic nucleus and motor thalamus. In motor thalamus, confidence and outcome converged into a representation consistent with unsigned reward prediction error. These findings redefine the human pallidothalamic circuit as an interface that binds decision, action, and evaluation during behavior.

">Coupling of death receptor p75NTR to the RhoA and NF-kB pathways differentially regulates internalization in hippocampal and cerebellar neurons</a></h4>

              
                Receptor internalization regulates the duration and qualitative output of intracellular signaling. Although generic mechanisms of receptor internalization are well characterized, how these are deployed and regulated in different cell types remains much less understood. Here we show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a key regulator of neuron survival and function, internalizes in hippocampal (HCNs)and cerebellar granule (CGNs)neurons with very different kinetics, regulated by distinct mechanisms. Compared to HCNs, p75NTR internalizes at a much slower rate and shows stronger interaction with caveolin in CGNs. In both cell types, p75NTR internalization was enhanced by nerve growth factor (NGF)but reduced by inhibitors of the RhoA and PKC pathways. In line with this, internalization of a p75NTR mutant specifically impaired in RhoA signaling was significantly reduced and insensitive to NGF in both neuron types. Accordingly, this mutant showed a much stronger interaction with caveolin than wild type p75NTR. On the other hand, internalization of a mutant specifically impaired in coupling to the NF-kB signaling pathway was greatly accelerated in CGNs but unaffected in HCNs. These results reveal the crucial role of intracellular signaling in p75NTR internalization and demonstrate that the receptor is differentially wired to the endocytosis machinery in different neuron types, leading to distinct internalization behaviors.

">Dynamic Routing on a Static Structure: Noradrenergic Gatingof Cortical Wave Propagation</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus-evoked cortical responses range from tightly localized activations to spatially extended traveling waves, yet the mechanisms through which these distinct regimes are flexibly recruited remain unclear. Based on neuroanatomical and neuroimaging evidence, we hypothesize that the noradrenergic (NA) arousal system, originating in the locus coeruleus (LC), dynamically modulates cortical gain to shape spatiotemporal propagation under a fixed anatomical backbone. To test this hypothesis, we extend an empirically grounded corticothalamic neural field model to incorporate an LC which delivers modulatory (gain-changing) rather than driving inputs to cortex. We then examine evoked responses under phasic versus tonic NA modulation, with geometry given by distance-dependent connectivity plus additional long-range fast-conducting non-local projections (FNPs). Phasic LC activation produces spatiotemporally sustained traveling waves of cortical activity, whereas tonic activation yields temporally prolonged but spatially localized responses; without modulation, waves are weak and dissipative. Timing and spatial pattern of LC engagement gate wave-onset latency and impose anisotropy, restricting propagation to modulated territories and halting it across unmodulated gaps. In the presence of long-range FNPs, modulation enables rapid non-local activation of distant cortical regions and sharply lowers the gain required for long-distance routing. These results identify NA phasic gain control as a parsimonious mechanism for variability in evoked dynamics and for context-dependent privileging of specific communication pathways over a largely static connectome.

">Objective Quality Assessment for Precision Functional MRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Precision functional mapping (PFM) enables individual-level characterization of brain network organization but requires substantially more and higher-quality fMRI data than is standard. Despite its growing use, objective criteria for data sufficiency and quality needed to ensure interpretable and replicable individual-level results remain unclear. Here, we introduce the Network Similarity Index (NSI), an objective measure of the extent to which functional connectivity (FC) patterns in an individual dataset express the large-scale network structure required for PFM. NSI captures the integrity of low-spatial-frequency, coherent network organization and denoising fidelity, and aligns closely with blinded expert assessments of PFM usability. NSI also accounts for variability in the rate at which FC becomes reliable across individuals. Here, we provide an open-source framework for NSI-based data quality evaluation and models for linking NSI values with expert-judged PFM suitability. This framework can also inform expected returns from additional data collection, enabling principled decisions about data sufficiency and replication in precision fMRI research.

">Individual differences in artificial neural networks capture individual differences in human behavior</a></h4>

              
                Human behavior differs substantially across individuals. While artificial neural networks (ANNs) are regarded as promising models of human perception, they are often assumed to lack such individual differences. Here, we demonstrate that multiple instances of the same ANN architecture exhibit substantial individual differences in behavior that mimic those observed in humans. We trained and tested 60 ANN instances from three architectures on a digit recognition task and found notable individual differences in overall accuracy, confidence, and response time (RT). Critically, these individual differences in ANN instances mapped consistently onto the individual differences produced by 60 humans performing the same task, with the mapping strength often approaching the human-to-human benchmark across all three behavioral metrics (accuracy, confidence, RT). The mapping generalized even across behavioral metrics: an ANN instance that aligned with an individual human on accuracy also aligned with the same individual on confidence and RT. These findings generalized to a more complex, 10-choice blurry object recognition task, though the human-ANN mapping was generally less robust than the human-human benchmark. Overall, these findings open the possibility of using ANN ensembles as computational proxies for probing the mechanisms underlying human variability.

">Exposure to a low dose mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals alters the brain transcriptome and animal behavior</a></h4>

              
                Exposures to pervasive chemical toxicants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are associated with adverse neurological and neurodevelopmental deficits. Although EDCs are widespread as sparse mixtures in the environment, most research has focused on single chemicals at high concentrations. Here, we studied the effects of ldEDC: a low-dose mixture of widely prevalent toxicants at doses representative of normal human exposure levels. Primary cultured mouse neurons treated with ldEDC exhibited altered gene expression compared to vehicle controls in genes critical for neuron activity, indicating low doses EDCs can affect neuronal function directly. We next tested persistent exposure through the maternal diet to define perinatal effects on offspring. Exposed offspring exhibited differences in development, tactile sensitivity, and sex-specific changes in motor behavior. Cortical single-nuclei sequencing identified broad transcriptomic changes, particularly in distinct cortical layer subpopulations, excitatory neurons, and astrocytes. Cell-cell signaling between neurons and non-neuronal populations were altered in exposed mice, specifically in pathways associated with cellular adhesion. Transcriptomic differences were also sex-specific. Together, these in vitro and in vivo findings reveal molecular and phenotypic consequences of EDC exposure at a mixture of doses well below commonly studied levels and highlights common functional pathways of susceptibility.

">The representation of voluntary and reflexive fast eye movements in the macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP)</a></h4>

              
                The macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP) is known for its role in visually guided saccades as well as in higher cognitive functions. However, its contribution to more basic visuomotor processes remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether neural activity in area LIP is also related to involuntary reflexive eye movements, specifically the fast phases of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). To address this question, we compared spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in area LIP of two male macaque monkeys during visually guided saccades and during kinematically similar OKN fast phases. Neurons exhibiting robust perisaccadic activation during voluntary saccades showed markedly reduced or no activity around the time of OKN fast phases and were not modulated by fast-phase amplitude or frequency. Using a Generalized Linear Model, we found that during OKN slow phases, area LIP reliably encoded gaze position and the direction of visual motion driving the reflexive eye movement. LFP analyses further revealed that beta-band power differed between voluntary saccades and OKN fast phases, whereas theta-band phase coherence increased following both types of fast eye movements, suggesting distinct local processing but shared post-movement network coordination. Our results reinforce the view of area LIP as a key area for integrating sensory and cognitive signals relevant for goal-directed action rather than a generic oculomotor controller.

">Correlations of 276 missense variants of PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP on the production of Aβ peptides against variant effect predictors and biophysical structures</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Early-onset Alzheimers disease (EOAD) is mostly caused by mutations in Presenilin-1,2 (PSEN1, PSEN2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. Both genetic and experimental evidence has supported the PSEN-APP amyloid hypothesis as the leading pathogenesis of AD. Thus far, 276 missense variants from PSEN1,2, and APP have been identified. Herein, we report the development of algorithm platforms for predicting the degrees of pathogenic potentials of these various missense mutations in AD. METHODS: We performed extensive pairwise correlations between 276 in vitro functional assays of missense variants from PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP and clinical data among EOAD patients against 37 variant effect predictors (VEPs). Furthermore, we used the structural models of all three proteins to refine understanding of the molecular basis of missense variants in dominant negative (DN) or loss-of-function (LoF) effects. RESULTS: We found that VEPs were consistently correlated with age of onset (AAO) among EOAD patients and the A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratio biomarker. This study also identified discrepancies in the predictor variable leading to an increase in the A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratio; The increased A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratio was due to decreased A{beta}40 levels by Sun et al., (2016), while Petit et al., (2022) argued that increased A{beta}42 level was the culprit. We also identified that with increased predicted pathogenicity, there were decreased A{beta}38 levels. Conversely, this study found no direct correlations with A{beta}37 and A{beta}43. Lastly, structural studies show characteristics of either DN and LoF mechanisms, as there were numerous variants located in buried hydrophobic domains and those on charged surfaces of the proteins. DISCUSSION: Currently, a major limitation in the field is the lack of reliable approaches for predicting the pathogenicity of variants in EOAD. Our study also illuminates the need for experimental studies to identify the predictor variable causing the increased A{beta}42/A{beta}40 biomarker.

">Limits of optimal decoding under synaptic coarse-tuning</a></h4>

              
                Sensory information propagates through successive processing stages in the brain, where synaptic weight patterns between stations determine how downstream neurons decode information from upstream populations. Although optimized synaptic connectivity can enhance information transmission, it requires precise weight tuning. Recent evidence depicting substantial synaptic volatility raises two fundamental questions: How does coarse-tuning of synaptic connectivity affect information transmission? What strategies could the nervous system employ to maintain reliable communication despite synaptic fluctuations? We addressed these questions by analyzing the signal-to-noise ratio SNR for binary stimulus discrimination under two decoding schemes: a naive population average and an optimized linear decoder. For the naive decoder, we found that SNR remains largely insensitive to synaptic imprecision, since performance is already limited by correlated noise in neuronal responses. For the optimal decoder, we identified three distinct regimes, that is, weak, moderate and strong coarse-tuning. Under weak coarse-tuning, SNR^2 scales linearly with population size N. Under moderate coarse-tuning, scaling becomes sublinear. Strikingly, under strong coarse-tuning, the regime most consistent with observed neuronal heterogeneity, SNR saturates and can not be improved by recruiting larger populations. This limitation persists even when incorporating feedforward or recurrent network architectures. These findings suggest that in the biologically relevant regime of strong coarse-tuning, naive and optimal decoders can achieve qualitatively similar performance. The analysis shows that effective readout under synaptic volatility is constrained to an invariant low-dimensional manifold aligned with the naive decoder, potentially pointing to a fundamental principle for robust neural computation in the face of ongoing synaptic remodeling.

">Reprogrammed neutrophils with impaired transit mechanics drive multi-organ capillary stalling after stroke</a></h4>

              
                Beyond the focal brain lesion, stroke causes systemic complications including cardiac failure, pneumonia, renal injury, and sustained immune dysfunction. The source of this multiorgan vulnerability remains unresolved. By imaging over 16,000 vessels of healthy, inflamed and ischemic brains, we identify a circulating neutrophil subpopulation reprogrammed by stroke into a pathological stalling phenotype, occluding capillaries in the brain, heart, kidneys, retina and lungs. Combining transcriptomics, genetic models, integrated microfluidics, cell mechanics assays, and in vivo imaging, we show that this subpopulation exhibits an atypical morphology, increased actin polymerization, and heightened adhesion that impair transit through capillary networks. This phenotype is present in patients with stroke, transmissible by adoptive transfer, and selectively sensitive to inhibition of the Src-family kinase Fgr. Both pharmacological and genetic inactivation of Fgr normalize neutrophil adhesion, reduce capillary stalls, and improve neurological recovery after stroke. These findings identify immune cell transit failure as a systemic driver of post-stroke pathology and a therapeutic target to improve both cerebral and multi-organ outcomes.

">Object recognition along the ventral stream: effects of visual noise</a></h4>

              
                Psychophysical studies using critical-band masking have established that human object recognition is most impaired by stimulus noise in a narrow, 1.5 octave band of spatial frequency. This shows that visual recognition relies on this narrow band. Here, we investigate the biological basis of this recognition band. We used fMRI to measure BOLD responses along the ventral stream (V1 [-&gt;] V2 [-&gt;] V3 [-&gt;] V4 [-&gt;] ventral temporal cortex, VTC) to band-pass noise and to natural images perturbed by that noise. The response to noise alone widens from 2 octaves in V1 to 5 octaves in VTC, diverging more and more from the behavioral 1.5 octave recognition bandwidth. In contrast, a correlation classifier applied to the BOLD response to noisy images shows that the recognition bandwidth is conserved at 2 octaves. This contrast shows that the recognition band is more like a readout constraint than an early sensory filter. Furthermore, this 2-octave band becomes increasingly tolerant to noise, approaching behavioral tolerance in VTC. Thus, it seems that recognition improves along the ventral stream by maintaining a narrow object channel while increasing noise tolerance.

">Classification of the lower limb motor imagery and execution using high vs. low channel EEG devices</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate brain signals into commands for external devices with motor imagery (MI) BCIs decoding imagined movements to aid neurorehabilitation. Although high-channel EEG offers rich data, such systems are bulky and impractical for everyday use. This study assesses whether a low-channel, consumer-grade headset (Muse) can match a clinical-grade system (OpenBCI) in classifying lower limb MI and motor execution (ME). Six healthy volunteers performed left and right knees and ankles MI and ME tasks while EEG was recorded concurrently from both devices. Signals were band-pass filtered (8-30 Hz), segmented into overlapping one second windows, and features were extracted across time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. Feature dimensionality were reduced via mutual information-based minimum redundancy maximum relevance and principal component analysis. Five classifiers (support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and AdaBoost) were applied to nine binary discrimination scenarios and evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation via 100 Monte Carlo iterations. Frequency domain features, particularly those derived from Welch's power spectral density, were most frequently selected. Mutual information analysis indicated that C3 and C4 electrodes were most informative for OpenBCI, while in Muse, the channels contributed more evenly, except in laterality classification scenarios, where TP9 played a key role. OpenBCI outperformed Muse in classifier-based accuracy with superiority ranging from 0.4% to 4.8%, while task-based differences were more variable, ranging from -0.3% to 8.7%. Despite its lower spatial resolution, the Muse system achieved competitive performance, especially in motor vs. rest tasks, and shows promise as an affordable, user-friendly alternative for home-based neurorehabilitation BCIs.

">EEG brain reconfiguration during meditation-induced extended cessation of consciousness: A dense-sampling multi-participant microstate study</a></h4>

              
                Extended cessation (EC) is a rare, non-ordinary meditative endpoint characterized by a temporary absence of reportable phenomenal experience, followed by an extraordinary perceptual vividness, openness, equanimity and affective balance. EC thus offers a unique, non-pharmacological window into the brain dynamics underlying suspension of conscious experience and the subsequent psychological transformations. The present study investigated whole-brain electrophysiological changes induced by EC using a dense-sampling electroencephalographic microstate analysis, in five highly trained meditators. Temporal parameters and transition probabilities of canonical microstates during EC were compared with two control conditions (counting and memory tasks) across six frequency bands (broadband, delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma). EC was characterized by alterations in global explained variance and coverage of microstates B and C, both associated with self-referential processing. Specifically, EC involved less frequent and shorter occurrences of microstate B, and more frequent and longer occurrences of microstate C. Transition probabilities also reconfigured: transitions from A and B to C increased, whereas transitions from A to B decreased. These broadband effects were distributed across delta, theta, and beta frequency sub-bands. Additional band specific changes emerged for microstate A and D. Delta band showed longer microstate A and increased B-to-A transitions during EC, while beta band showed less frequent and shorter D and decreased bidirectional B-to-D transitions. These scalp-level findings support a precision re-weighting account of EC, reflecting self-referential reconfigurations with enhanced sensory-anchored inflow. This study provides initial evidence for the neurophysiological correlates of EC, with potential implications for human wellbeing.

">Making sense of touch: spatial tactile cues promote efficient visuosomatosensory integration and restore motor accuracy under sensory conflict</a></h4>

              
                Effective interaction with complex environments relies on integrating somatosensory and visual signals into coherent spatial representations of the body in external space. When these signals conflict, as during movement under mirror reversed visual feedback, motor performance deteriorates. Under such conflict, visual information typically facilitates motor performance, whereas tactile feedback impairs it. Here, we tested whether providing tactile input with explicit spatial structure renders visuosomatosensory integration functionally relevant and stabilizes motor behaviour under sensory conflict. Healthy adults performed a mirror tracing task, tracing the contour of a shape with the index finger while tactile feedback conveyed either motion related cues alone or additional discrete spatial landmarks aligned with the outline. Spatially structured tactile cues preserved accuracy and smoothness relative to motion related tactile input, indicating more effective online motor control. EEG source analyses further revealed that, when spatial tactile cues were present, somatosensory activity increased and functional connectivity became more focal within sensorimotor networks. In contrast, when absent, sensory conflict was associated with widespread reductions in cortical activity, including in somatosensory areas, and with a diffuse functional connectivity pattern consistent with elevated sensorimotor uncertainty. Together, these findings demonstrate that spatial tactile cues bias hand-displacement encoding toward an external reference frame, promote efficient visuosomatosensory integration and mitigate the detrimental impact of sensory conflict on motor action.

">SHANK3-CAMSAP2 interaction links synapses to dendritic microtubule organisation in PV neurons</a></h4>

              
                The microtubule cytoskeleton plays an essential role in establishing and maintaining neuronal polarity. In neurons, microtubules are initially generated at the centrosome which gradually loses this role in development. In mature neurons, microtubules are stabilised by the microtubule minus end-binding protein CAMSAP2. How and where microtubule minus ends are anchored within dendrites of mammalian neurons remains an open question. Here, we show that microtubules are directly attached to the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses through an interaction of CAMSAP2 with the scaffolding protein SHANK3. This process is particularly relevant in parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neurons, in which excitatory synapses are predominantly located directly on the dendritic shaft in direct proximity to microtubules. Notably, this association is strongly enhanced by the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)-associated SHANK3L68P mutation, leading to an increase of synaptic levels of CAMSAP2. This promotes an increased microtubule association with the synapse and alters microtubule dynamics. Downregulation of CAMSAP2 in SHANK3L68P parvalbumin neurons tips the balance between site-specific microtubule stabilisation and dynamics, reshaping dendritic architecture, connecting SHANK3-CAMSAP2 dependent microtubule regulation to synaptic ASD pathology.

">Food intake habits and preference affects the activity of medial frontal cortex during eating; functional near-infrared spectroscopy is potential biosensor for appetite study.</a></h4>

              
                Even if they have no dementia, some elderly people find it difficult to imagine the food they may want to eat. However, research into treatments for anorexia in elderly people has not progressed sufficiently due to the lack of a method that can easily measure brain function in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to clarify the relationship of food-dependent medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity with food preference and intake frequency by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to determine ways to treat the appetite loss and have difficulty in explain what they want to eat. For this purpose, we firstly establish the methodology using young participants experiment. All young participants were asked about their food preferences and intake frequency using a questionnaire, and they were instructed to look and then eat the control dish (CD: typical Japanese home-cooked meal) and their preferred dish (PD: each participant purchased the dish themselves on the day of the experiments) on separate days, and activity of MPFC in each participant was recorded by fNIRS. We found that activity of MPFC during "just-looking" and "eating" were affected by food intake habits and preference. Especially, activity of MPFC during CD eating was affected by food preference (has dislike food or not). We concluded that the activity of MPFC during eating of dishes varies depending on the food intake habits and fNIRS could be a potential technique for estimating such activity.

">Convergent molecular signatures of ageing and injury in the peripheral nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nervous system (PNS) ageing is marked by structural and functional decline, yet it remains unclear whether ageing constitutes a distinct biological programme or reflects a chronic injury-like state. To address this, we performed an unbiased, comparative molecular analysis of PNS ageing, neuroprotective dietary restriction (DR), and nerve injury. We conducted transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves from young, old and geriatric mice fed ad libitum or subjected to long-term DR, and proteomics of nerves collected at multiple time points following injury. Age-associated molecular changes followed both linear and non-linear trajectories, and DR partially attenuated these ageing-related alterations. Notably, ageing- and injury-induced proteomic signatures showed considerable similarities, supporting the concept that an aged nerve resembles an injured nerve. Together, our study provides the most comprehensive molecular resource of PNS changes during ageing, DR, and injury, enabling the definition of key molecular signatures underlying PNS physiology. All datasets are integrated into the '' PNS-omics Viewer '', a Shiny web application designed to facilitate data mining of the herein presented datasets (tba).

">Intravenous anti-abeta immunotherapy acutely increases cerebral amyloid angiopathy and vascular damages in APOE4 mice</a></h4>

              
                Anti-abeta immunotherapies for Alzheimer Disease (AD) have high rates of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), an adverse side effect with markedly higher rates in APOE4 carriers. We developed a mouse model of ARIA centered on human APOE3 and APOE4 genotypes with amyloidosis (5xFAD transgene) and microglia tagged with green fluorescent protein (from the CX3CR1 promoter). We measured acute changes following a single intravenous treatment with 3D6 anti-abeta immunotherapy. Across 82 mice, APOE4 mice showed stepwise reductions in the number of plaques from one to ten days, with significant reductions in the subiculum (48%) and thalamus (40%) at ten days. There was no significant reduction in APOE3 mice. There was a concomitant significant increase in deposition of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in APOE4 mice at one (76%) and three (51%) days in leptomeningeal vessels. The increased CAA correlated with a significant 189% increase in abeta within microglia of APOE4 (but not APOE3) mice at one day. Smooth muscle actin staining showed significant 58% reduction near CAA. MRI analysis revealed a significant 32% increase in microhemorrhages ten days following treatment. These data demonstrate an APOE4-specific redistribution of parenchymal amyloid to CAA by 3D6 within days, leading to increased vascular damages associated with ARIA.

">Effect of endogenous and exogenous ketosis in acute spinal cord injury in Wistar rats.</a></h4>

              
                Acute spinal cord injury is a condition with a poor prognosis, leading to reduced quality of life and high economic costs for both patients and health systems, and only a minority of patients with this injury can achieve a meaningful recovery. Given the high frequency of traumatic events such as vehicle collisions and falls, research aimed at limiting injury extension, promoting neuronal recovery, and improving prognosis is essential. It has been shown that ketone bodies have anti-inflammatory properties and also mediate the Nrf2 pathway, exerting antioxidant effects. The aim was to identify any alternative to mitigate the extension and progression of secondary injury by using 1,3 butanediol as a {beta}-hydroxybutyrate source. An experimental model (n= 60) of clinically healthy male Wistar rats were used, divided into five groups (n=12) as a control group, while the remaining rats were subjected to extradural spinal cord clipping according to the following groups (n=12): Spinal Cord Injury (SCI); endogenous ketosis + methylprednisolone (Endo-K+MP); exogenous ketosis + methylprednisolone (Exo-K+MP), and methylprednisolone (MP). After 8 hours of spinal cord injury, tissue was collected, immunohistochemistry and PCR analyses were carried out. Nrf2 and 3NT for the antioxidant pathway, and HIF-1, NFkB, NLRP3, TNF-? and IL-1{beta} for inflammation were analyzed. Results demonstrated that the groups thrown into a ketosis state had better outcomes, and, according to the Exo-k+MP and Endo-k+MP groups, increased Nrf2 and decreased 3NT (p < 0.05), which resulted in an upregulation of antioxidant pathways. According to HIF-1 and NF{kappa}B, Endo-K+MP showed better outcomes p<0.05 and proinflammatory cytokines showed the same pattern as the standard treatment (MP) p<0.05). Overall, our results also demonstrated a downregulation of inflammatory pathways.

">Amyloid-Induced Network Resilience and Collapse in Alzheimer's Disease: Insights from Computational Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive synaptic loss and cognitive decline, with amyloid-beta ( ) accumulation playing a central pathological role. While the molecular effects of are well-characterized, the cascade from local synaptic dysfunction to largescale network collapse remains poorly understood. We present a biophysically grounded computational model that integrates small-world network topology, Izhikevich neuron dynamics, short-term plasticity (STP), and A -induced synaptic pruning to investigate how amyloid burden degrades functional brain connectivity over time. Crucially, we simulate the evolving network dynamics across disease stages, revealing how firing rate, synchrony, variability (CV), and Fano factor evolve in response to progressive structural degradation. Our results demonstrate a two-phase deterioration: initial compensatory dynamics followed by abrupt disintegration of coordinated activity. This temporal dissociation mirrors clinical observations and offers mechanistic insight into AD progression. We further identify a critical amyloid threshold beyond which network collapse becomes inevitable, preceded by early-warning indicators such as declining global efficiency. Network topology, synaptic time constants, and repair mechanisms strongly influence resilience, with small-world networks showing delayed collapse and greater functional compensation. Finite-size scaling reveals that larger networks experience earlier and sharper phase transitions.These findings unify molecular, structural, and dynamical perspectives, suggesting that fluctuations in global efficiency and synchrony could serve as sensitive biomarkers for early detection. Our model offers a predictive, multiscale framework for understanding AD progression and evaluating therapeutic strategies.

">Intrathecal (G4C2)149 delivery in C9orf72-deficient mice yields mild motor dysfunction and ALS/FTD pathological hallmarks</a></h4>

              
                A repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), yet existing mouse models incompletely engage spinal regions implicated in disease. Here, an adeno-associated virus encoding (G4C2)149 repeats was delivered via neonatal intrathecal injection, achieving widespread CNS expression with robust spinal cord targeting. This approach was applied to mice with graded loss of endogenous C9orf72 to interrogate both gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms. Longitudinal motor, behavioral, and pathological analyses revealed that repeat expression primarily drives mild, progressive muscle weakness, whereas coordination deficits were largely genotype dependent. Subtle gait abnormalities and hyperactivity were also observed. Within spinal motor regions, repeat-expressing mice exhibited dipeptide repeat protein accumulation, reduced NeuN-positive area, glial activation, and sparse phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology. Cross-domain correlations further linked repeat expression, spinal pathology, and motor dysfunction. Collectively, these findings establish that CNS-wide repeat expression combined with reduced C9orf72 produces a coherent, mild ALS/FTD model.

">Isoflurane preferentially modulates synaptic responses to corticocortical stimulation over thalamocortical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To test the effect of Isoflurane on synaptic transmission of cortico-cortical and thalamocortical projections to the auditory cortex, and investigate how it modulates cortical sensory information processing to produce unconsciousness. Methods: Using murine auditory thalamocortical brain slices, afferent pathways from the medial geniculate body (MGB) and layer 1 of the proximal cortex were stimulated to evoke excitatory postsynaptic potentials (eEPSPs) in cortical neurons. Whole-cell recordings were made from pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons in layer 2/3 and layer 5. eEPSPs were evaluated along with intrinsic membrane properties in response to stimulation of both pathways with and without isoflurane. Results: Isoflurane administration resulted in significant eEPSP amplitude reduction following stimulation of both thalamic and cortical pathways, in layer 2/3 (p=0.015, p<0.001) and layer 5 (p<0.001, p<0.001) pyramidal neurons; while it only significantly reduced eEPSP amplitude in fast-spiking interneurons with cortical stimulation (p<0.001). Overall, isoflurane preferentially suppressed synaptic responses to cortico-cortical stimulation compared to thalamocortical (p=0.0002). Under isoflurane, cortico-cortical compared to thalamocortical stimulation evoked eEPSPs with reduced 10-90% rise time in both layer 2/3 and 5 pyramidal neurons, and shorter latency layer 5 neurons. Paired pulse ratio was not changed by isoflurane application, although an interesting loss of depression trend appear in layer 5 pyramidal neurons stimulated by cortical activation. Additional intrinsic neuronal measurements revealed that isoflurane reduced spike threshold significantly in both layer 2/3 and layer 5 neurons, reduced spike latency in layer 2/3 neurons, and input resistance in layer 5 neurons. However, these intrinsic neuronal changes were not seen in fast-spiking interneurons. All isoflurane induced changes were reversible during wash out. Conclusions: Application of 1% isoflurane to brain slices significantly reduced the amplitudes of eEPSPs and modulated intrinsic neuronal properties. The effects on eEPSP amplitude were greater for cortical stimulation compared to thalamic stimulation. Isoflurane modulated intrinsic neuronal firing properties in pyramidal neurons, but not in fast-spiking interneurons.

">External validation and time-stability analysis of STARE, a blood-free quantification tool for irreversible PET tracers</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: "Gold standard" blood-based quantification of dynamic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data has limited practical clinical applications due to cost and complexity of data collection and analysis. We previously presented a blood-free quantification alternative, STARE (Source-to-Target Automatic Rotating Estimation), that was validated on 18F-FDG data acquired on a ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner. Here, we extend that initial work by externally validating STARE using within-subject data acquired with both a Siemens Biograph mCT scanner and a portable Brain Biosciences CerePET scanner. Methods: Performance was assessed by comparing regional net influx rates (Ki) estimated using STARE and the standard blood-based Patlak approach. Twenty participants underwent 60-minute 18F-FDG scans, on two different days, once in each scanner. The time-stability of both STARE- and Patlak-based Ki estimates was evaluated by applying each method to the first 20 (STARE only), 30, 40, and 50 minutes of data. Results: STARE demonstrated high correlation with Patlak Ki estimates across both scanner types, particularly in the Biograph mCT (r = 0.93), with lower correlation in the CerePET (r = 0.71). In the Biograph dataset, STARE provided reliable Ki estimates at all evaluated scan durations (20 minutes and above), while in the CerePET dataset, only the 50-minute duration yielded STARE Ki estimates that were not significantly different from the full 60 minutes. The Patlak approach provided Ki estimates at 40 minutes scan duration and above that did not differ from the 60-min scan results in both datasets. Conclusion: STARE is a viable, noninvasive alternative to traditional blood-based quantification of dynamic 18F-FDG PET data, facilitating shorter, blood-free acquisition. This advancement could make dynamic 18F-FDG PET imaging more accessible and comfortable for patients, promoting broader clinical adoption.

">Compositional decoding of neural activity enhances generalization in handwriting BCIs</a></h4>

              
                Recent brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in decoding behavior from neural activity. These models are typically trained on a constrained set of behaviors, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world settings where behavior is variable, complex, and context-dependent. However, many complex behaviors can be decomposed into a set of reusable behavioral motifs, indicating a compositional organization. Here, we analyze human intracortical neural activity underlying attempted handwriting and find signatures of neural compositionality at a finer resolution than individual letters. We further introduce a compositional temporal decoding model, MOtif-based Temporal Inference Framework (MOTIF), that jointly predicts the fine-scale behavioral motifs (e.g., strokes, phonemes) and the longer-timescale behavior class (e.g., characters, words). We show that the compositional structure leveraged by MOTIF enables improved generalization in few-shot learning. Our results demonstrate that explicitly incorporating compositionality into neural decoders can enhance generalization and sample efficiency, while providing a principled approach to designing more scalable, robust, and interpretable BCIs.

">Laminin and BDNF synergistically induce local translation in axonal growth cones</a></h4>

              
                The laminins are a family of extracellular matrix proteins that regulate numerous cellular processes, including adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and axon guidance. However, it remains unclear whether laminin regulates axon guidance through local translation. Here, we show that laminin is necessary for local translation in axonal growth cones. Local translation is significantly increased in growth cones of embryonic day 17 mouse cortical neurons, either cultured on or acutely stimulated with soluble laminin 111, in the presence of BDNF. When cultured on laminin isoforms 211 or 221 in the presence of BDNF, there was a remarkable decrease in local translation in growth cones. Using a puromycin-proximity ligation assay to examine newly synthesized {beta}-actin specifically, we find a significant increase in growth cones of neurons cultured on laminin 111 in the presence of BDNF. However, soluble laminin 111 alone results in a significant reduction in nascent {beta}-actin protein synthesis. These results indicate that laminin isoforms can act in multiple ways, including synergistically with guidance cues and independently, to modulate local mRNA translation, thereby differentially influencing axon growth and guidance during development.

">Transregional astrocyte-dependent metaplasticity in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Learning-related synaptic plasticity is regulated by metaplasticity, which adjusts plasticity thresholds in an activity-dependent manner. We have previously described a heterodendritic form of metaplasticity whereby priming stimulation in stratum oriens (SO) inhibits subsequent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the neighboring stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region. Here, we report that this metaplasticity is in fact transregional, in that the SO priming stimulation also inhibits later LTP induction at dentate gyrus (DG) middle molecular layer (MML) synapses, both in vitro and in vivo. This effect operates across the hippocampal fissure since it occurs in the absence of CA3, thus highlighting a previously unappreciated reverse-direction and long-distance hippocampal crosstalk. Our findings demonstrate an essential role of astrocytes as SO priming elicited a sustained increase in the frequency of Ca2+ events in astrocytes in the DG MML, while the metaplasticity effect was blocked by calcium-buffering in MML astrocytes. It could be triggered by either activation of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors or group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, and was critically dependent on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 signaling. The transregional inhibition of LTP was mediated by astrocytic release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which likely acts in an autocrine fashion on astrocytic TNF type 1 receptors (TNFR1s). Downstream of TNF-TNFR1 signaling, the inhibition of MML LTP was mediated by the activation of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Thus, a complex, bidirectional neuron-glia signaling cascade orchestrates long-distance metaplasticity across hippocampal subregions, providing a novel framework for understanding how hippocampal neuronal networks dynamically regulate plasticity thresholds across space and time.

">Distinct spatial and non-spatial response properties of excitatory narrow-spike and burst-firing neurons in the marmoset auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cell types are the basic units of the cerebral cortex. Broad and narrow spike waveforms (BW and NW) are the primary criteria for classifying putative excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, particularly in non-human primates where genetic accessibility is limited. We have classified cell types in the auditory cortex of marmosets using spike waveforms and firing patterns and identified a new type of neuron: the NW-burst neuron. NW-burst neurons are excitatory, as they drive but do not suppress the firing of connected neurons. Furthermore, NW-burst neurons displayed shorter response latencies, lower response variability, smaller receptive fields, stronger correlations between spatial and non-spatial selectivity, and higher decoding accuracy than other neurons. Together, these findings suggest that cortical NW-burst neurons in non-human primates represent a distinct excitatory cell type.

">Cognition, but not affect, rests upon a segregated intrinsic network architecture</a></h4>

              
                The brain's intrinsic organization into resting-state networks has long been suggested to be fundamental for the offline support of mental processes. Extensive task-based evidence support the relevance of the crosstalk between network segregation, supporting systems specialization, and network integration, allowing to flexibly implement complex behavior. However, only scarce evidence focusing on few behavioral measures directly link changes in these network properties at rest with interindividual differences in behavior. In this work, we investigated whether the maintenance of behavior is associated with a segregated intrinsic resting-state networks organization. Using a comprehensive set of behavioral measures spanning cognition, emotion, and personality together with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from the human connectome project, we performed functional connectivity prediction of behavior combined with model interpretability and latent connectivity-behavior factors extraction. We then assessed whether connectivity-behavior patterns were associated with changes in segregation or integration based on GINNA, a 33 resting-state-networks atlas with cognitive characterization, providing opportunities for comparison of the involved cognitive processes. We found that connectivity relevant for behavior organizes into 3 main latent dimensions, summarizing Cognition, Positive Affect and Negative Affect. Crucially, we show that only Cognition, but not Affect, was associated with global network segregation and reduced network integration, suggesting that Cognition is supported by an intrinsic segregated network architecture, necessary for modular specialization, while Affect may rely on distributed mechanisms across intrinsic brain networks. We further reveal differential resting-state-networks involvements, with Cognition associated with the segregation of higher-level resting-state-networks, and the integration of lower-level, visual networks. All in all, the present results reinforce the view that cognition rests upon a segregated intrinsic brain architecture, fostering the maintenance of specialized cognitive modules.

">CUT homeobox factors modulate chromatin accessibility in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal identity relies on coordinated transcriptional programs that include both neuron type-specific features and broadly shared pan-neuronal properties. While transcription factors that control neuronal gene expression have been defined, how these regulators interface with chromatin accessibility at neuronal loci remains poorly understood. CUT homeobox factors are broadly expressed in the C. elegans nervous system and provide a genetically defined system to examine transcription factor associated chromatin accessibility in neurons. Here, we establish a fluorescence-activated sorting workflow to enrich neuronal nuclei using a pan-neuronal nuclear marker and apply bulk ATAC-seq to profile chromatin accessibility in wild-type and CUT mutant animals. We identify CUT-dependent accessibility differences in neuronal nuclei, with changes concentrated at promoter-proximal regions and linked to neuronal genes, including neuronally enriched and pan-neuronal categories. Together, this work provides in vivo neuronal chromatin accessibility profiles and defines CUT-dependent changes at a subset of neuronal regulatory regions.

">Grasping at the organization of object knowledge: testing different object-related dimensions as organizational principles of ventral temporal cortex.</a></h4>

              
                In our daily lives we encounter a myriad of things with which we might need to interact as we navigate our environment. Mental representations of these things must be computed and stored in our brains to be manipulated to support cognition. How are such representations organized in the brain? Several proposals have been put forth on what the principles of organization of object information in the brain might be: within ventral temporal cortex - regions thought to support object recognition - possible dimensions include the animacy status of target stimuli, their real size, their texture and material properties, and potentially their graspable status, amongst others. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate approaches to discriminate patterns of activation for different categories of objects to test the role of these dimensions as organizing principles of object information in the brain. We show that pattern discriminability between different categories of objects does not seem to follow differences in their animacy status in any continuous way. Moreover, graspability of the target stimuli and their haptic texture properties are better predictors of representational content within ventral temporal cortex than animacy and real size. These results are in line with recent studies demonstrating the importance of computational contingencies superimposed by bi-directional functional coupling between parietal regions dedicated to the processing of object manipulation and grasping and ventral temporal regions responsible for object recognition, potentially involving material and texture processing.

                <p>by Nan Sheng, Yunzhi Liu, Ling Gao, Wenju Hou, Lan Huang, Yan Wang</p>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal regulators of drug resistance and sensitivity in cancer cells, functioning as tumor suppressors or oncogenes that modulate the cellular response to anticancer drugs. While experimental identification of miRNA-mediated drug resistance and sensitivity is both costly and laborious, computational methods present a promising alternative. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) offer new opportunities to leverage large-scale unlabeled biomolecular data for enhanced relationship prediction. In this study, we introduce PLMF-MDA, a PLM-based cross-modal fusion model designed to predict miRNA-drug resistance (MDR) and miRNA-drug sensitivity (MDS) associations. PLMF-MDA integrates miRNA and drug multimodal embeddings derived from PLMs and intrinsic feature extractors, and employs a cross-modal attention fusion module to adaptively capture key interactions between modalities. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we manually constructed two benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the PLMF-MDA achieves superior prediction performance. Furthermore, case studies on anticancer drug docetaxel demonstrate its potential in discovering novel MDR (MDS) associations. All data and source code are available on GitHub: https://github.com/sheng-n/PLMF-MDA.

                <p>by David Hart, Kylie Cashwell, Anita Bhandari, Jayath Premasinghe, Cameron Schmidt</p>

Since the 1980s, semi-automated sperm motility analysis of phase contrast microscopy videos has been used to measure and categorize sperm motility patterns. Motility categories are determined from various kinematic parameters such as Curvilinear Velocity (VCL) and Beat Cross Frequency (BCF). These measures ultimately rely on the quality of the tracking for each individual sperm in the microscopy video. However, common approaches to sperm tracking require sample dilution and shortening the time window of observation (less than 1 to 2 seconds) to avoid tracking errors that occur when sperm cross paths. The post-ejaculatory lifespan of sperm can exceed several hours to days in some species, and long-term adaptive changes in motility pattern may be an important distinguishing factor for predictive modeling of sperm fertilizing competence. Improving the predictive value of computer assisted semen analysis will require accurate tracking of sperm trajectories over physiologically-relevant time scales and at the high cell densities typically found in semen. In this work, we identify a framework for accurately assessing the quality of sperm trajectory tracking that is independent of standard motility measures. We utilize cell tracking metrics adapted from the more common task of tracking adherent somatic cells and propose modifications based on the unique challenges of sperm video-microscopy. We also provide a small dataset of microscopy videos that includes 340 labeled sperm trajectories to allow for future comparisons and developments. Finally, we demonstrate that variations in configuration can lead to as much as a 30% improvement on metrics, showcasing their effectiveness at analyzing tracking quality.

                <p>by Lin Yuan, Yufeng Jiang, Boyuan Meng, Qingxiang Wang, Cuihong Wang, De-Shuang Huang</p>

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide powerful tools for analyzing spatial distribution patterns of gene expression in tissue samples. However, they are limited by sparse gene detection and incomplete expression coverage. Several computational approaches based on reference scRNA-seq have been proposed to impute ST data and have achieved impressive results. However, these methods fail to fully explore latent temporal dependencies among cells and cannot accurately capture hidden gene-level regulatory mechanisms. To overcome those limitations, we propose SpaLSTF, a novel method for enhancing ST gene expression using a conditional diffusion model guided by scRNA-seq data. SpaLSTF captures gene expression relationships through a dual Markov process: one progressively perturbs scRNA-seq data with noise, while the other denoises it to reconstruct the original distribution. To effectively model contextual dependencies among cell states, we adopt a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. Furthermore, we design a cross-covariance attention mechanism within a Transformer (XCA-Transformer) to efficiently compute attention coefficients between gene expression and accurately predict the noise added at each step. In addition, we introduce a variational lower bound (VLB) objective and introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a regularization term, along with mean squared error loss, to ensure that the generated noise follows the target distribution. We compared the performance of SpaLSTF with seven state-of-the-art methods on twelve cross-platform datasets covering a variety of tissues and organs using nine evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrated that SpaLSTF outperforms competing methods in gene expression imputation, cell population identification, and spatial structure preservation.

                <p>by Jie Hu, Marius Moisa, Christian C. Ruff</p>

Cooperation, productivity, and cohesion in human societies depend on altruism, the tendency to share resources with others even though this is costly. While altruism is a widely shared social norm, people vary strongly in their inclination to behave altruistically, in particular across situations with different types of inequality in resource distribution. What neurobiological factors underlie this variability? And can these be targeted by interventions to enhance altruistic behavior? Here, we build on electroencephalography (EEG) evidence that altruistic choices during disadvantageous inequality correlate with oscillatory gamma-band coherence between frontal regions (representing other’s interest) and parietal regions (representing neural evidence accumulation). We apply a transcranial alternating current stimulation protocol designed to exogenously enhance this fronto-parietal coherence and find that this leads to increased altruism, specifically during disadvantageous inequality as hypothesized based on the EEG findings. Computational modeling reveals that this transcranial entrainment does not just add noise to the decision process but specifically increases the weight individuals assign to other-regarding concerns during choices. Our findings show that altruism can be enhanced by neurostimulation designed to enhance oscillatory synchronization between frontal and parietal areas. This establishes a neural basis for altruism and identifies a neural target for interventions aimed at improving prosocial behavior.

                Background Drawing on the literature on Strategic Management and the Entrepreneurial University approach, particularly through the lens of the Resource-Based View, this study explores how the Dynamic Managerial Capabilities (DMC) of campus leaders foster institutional capacity building in the context of post-conflict higher education. This study aims to develop a clear and detailed understanding of the current status of the University of Fallujah to support post-ISIS recovery efforts while enhancing overall institutional quality. An additional motivation is to assist university administrators in optimally using limited funds and resources by prioritizing core rebuilding areas that can improve institutional performance. Methods This study adopts a qualitative case study approach and employs a Higher Education Institutional Capacity Assessment Tool (HEICAT). This study aims to generate specific and concrete evidence on institutional needs that can inform the development efforts of scholars and stakeholders. It also seeks to build capacity among local administrators by supporting their ability to conduct ongoing institutional self-assessments using internationally recognized good practices. Results The findings reveal that institutional performance challenges in the case study stem less from material scarcity and more from underdeveloped human, social, and cognitive capital among the campus leaders. Conclusions Strengthening the managerial capabilities of campus leaders is essential for advancing institutional adaptability, improving quality assurance, and aligning with international academic standards in post-conflict higher education environments.

                Background Public sector organisations operating under decentralised governance systems increasingly rely on change management strategies to enhance employee performance. Limited empirical evidence explains how specific change management strategies influence employee performance within local governments in developing country contexts. This study examined the relationship between change management strategies and employee performance in Kasese and Kabarole District Local Governments in Western Uganda, drawing on Complexity Theory and Public Policy Theory to conceptualise performance as an outcome of interacting behavioural, motivational, and systemic forces within public institutions. Methods The study adopted a convergent parallel mixed-methods design that integrated descriptive and correlational quantitative approaches with qualitative case study and phenomenological inquiry. The target population comprised 252 permanent district employees, from whom a sample of 155 respondents was selected using Yamane’s formula. Quantitative data were collected using self-administered questionnaires and analysed using SPSS version 28. Qualitative data were generated through unstructured interviews. Pilot testing was conducted in Mitooma District to ensure instrument validity and reliability. Results Regression analysis demonstrated that change management strategies had a statistically significant positive effect on employee performance (B = 0.262, Beta = 0.441, t = 6.080, p < 0.001). Qualitative findings corroborated the quantitative results, revealing that leadership support, flexible organisational rules, and enhanced staff motivation played a critical role in improving employee performance within the district local governments. Conclusions The study concludes that effective change management strategies are central to improving employee performance in decentralised public institutions. Policy and practice implications include strengthening staff motivation and performance appraisal systems, promoting equitable employment opportunities, enhancing institutional flexibility, reducing excessive central government interference, and increasing fiscal support to local governments. The study contributes to public administration scholarship by extending the application of Complexity Theory and Public Policy Theory to decentralised governance contexts and advancing empirical evidence on the role of change management strategies in shaping employee performance outcomes within Sub-Saharan African local governments.
