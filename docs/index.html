              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17068">Cross-Modal Epileptic Signal Harmonization: Frequency Domain Mapping Quantization for Pre-training a Unified Neurophysiological Transformer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) are vital for epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. Their unified analysis offers the potential to harness the complementary strengths of each modality but is challenging due to variations in recording montages, amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and frequency components. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper introduces EpiNT, a novel Transformer-based pre-trained model for unified EEG and iEEG analysis. EpiNT employs channel-independent modeling with masked autoencoders (MAE) and vector quantization (VQ), along with a frequency domain mapping quantizer to capture crucial frequency features. Pre-trained on over 2,700 hours of multi-modal clinical neurophysiological data from 1,199 patients, EpiNT outperformed both randomly initialized models and other pre-trained methods on six downstream classification tasks, demonstrating robust representation learning capabilities. This work presents a promising approach for unified epilepsy neurophysiology analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17079">Efficient and faithful reconstruction of dynamical attractors using homogeneous differentiators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the attractors of complex nonlinear dynamical systems from available measurements is key to analyse and predict their time evolution. Existing attractor reconstruction methods typically rely on topological embedding and may produce poor reconstructions, which differ significantly from the actual attractor, because measurements are corrupted by noise and often available only for some of the state variables and/or their combinations, and the time series are often relatively short. Here, we propose the use of Homogeneous Differentiators (HD) to effectively de-noise measurements and more faithfully reconstruct attractors of nonlinear systems. Homogeneous Differentiators are supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees about their de-noising capabilities, and their results can be fruitfully combined with time-delay embedding, differential embedding and functional observability. We apply our proposed HD-based methodology to simulated dynamical models of increasing complexity, from the Lorenz system to the Hindmarsh-Rose model and the Epileptor model for neural dynamics, as well as to empirical data of EEG recordings. In the presence of corrupting noise of various types, we obtain drastically improved quality and resolution of the reconstructed attractors, as well as significantly reduced computational time, which can be orders of magnitude lower than that of alternative methods. Our tests show the flexibility and effectiveness of Homogeneous Differentiators and suggest that they can become the tool of choice for preprocessing noisy signals and reconstructing attractors of highly nonlinear dynamical systems from both theoretical models and real data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17083">Brain-inspired interpretable reservoir computing with resonant recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional artificial neural networks consist of nodes with non-oscillatory dynamics. Biological neural networks, on the other hand, consist of oscillatory components embedded in an oscillatory environment. Motivated by this feature of biological neurons, we describe a reservoir computing framework with explicit damped, oscillatory node dynamics. We express the oscillatory dynamics using two history dependent terms to connect these dynamics with existing artificial neural network approaches and apply physical and stationary constraints to reduce the number of free parameters. We then optimize and illustrate reservoir performance by classifying different brain rhythms associated with epilepsy and show that reservoir elements support classification by resonating with features of the input signals. Applying the same reservoir network to visual and auditory signal types, we show the reservoir generalizes for accurate classification with few trainable parameters. Compared to existing artificial neural network approaches, the proposed resonant reservoir network (RRN) utilizes oscillatory dynamics expressed as a straightforward extension of traditional artificial neural networks, produces interpretable features for classification, avoids computationally expensive training (e.g., backpropagation), and performs well with few parameters in different classification scenarios. We propose that RRNs may serve as efficient, biologically implemented building blocks to achieve complex goals in biological and artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2506.16838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to explore the optimization of mental performance through the analysis of metrics associated with the psychological state known as flow. Several clinical studies have shown a correlation between the mental state of flow (characterized by deep and relaxed concentration and high psychophysical efficiency) and brain activity measured through electroencephalography (EEG). This study confirms such a correlation, focusing in particular on the sports field, where the flow state tends to occur more frequently. To conduct the study, Sporthype developed proprietary software that integrates several predictive models, in particular the Flow State Index (FSI), implemented within the Holytics system. An analytical protocol was established, including mental exercises and data collection sessions using the portable EEG device Muse, accompanied by a questionnaire to gather athletes' subjective perceptions of their mental state. The results revealed a significant alignment between the EEG data and the subjective experiences reported in the questionnaires, confirming the feasibility of detecting the flow state through prefrontal cortex activity. Furthermore, the psychological exercises included in the study protocol showed a tangible positive effect in enhancing flow during athletic performance. Flow improves performance through a more harmonious synchronization between mind and body. Although golf was the main context of the experimentation, the mathematical models developed within Holytics were designed to be applicable to a wide range of sports. In addition to golf, preliminary tests have been conducted in other sports such as tennis, as well as in non-sport contexts, including gaming and mental training practices such as mindfulness, concentration, and visualization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01767">Anti-seizure medication load is not correlated with early termination of seizure spread</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.01767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy, yet their effect on seizure spread is not fully understood. Higher ASM doses have been associated with shorter and less severe seizures. We aimed to test if this effect was due to limiting seizure spread through early termination of otherwise unchanged seizures.
  Methods: We retrospectively examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in 15 subjects who underwent ASM tapering during pre-surgical monitoring. We estimated ASM plasma concentrations based on pharmaco-kinetic modeling. In each subject, we identified seizures that followed the same onset and initial spread patterns, but some seizures terminated early (truncated seizures), and other seizures continued to spread (continuing seizures). We first compared seizure duration to ASM concentration for all seizures and the subset of seizures included in truncated-continuing pairs. Then we compared durations of the matched truncated and continuing seizures. Finally, we compared ASM concentrations at the times of truncated seizures and continuing seizures.
  Results: Seizure durations were found to be significantly longer at lower ASM concentrations. Continuing seizures were significantly longer in duration than matched truncated seizures. We found no substantial difference between ASM concentrations when truncated vs. continuing seizures occurred.
  Significance: The lack of difference between ASM concentrations at the time of truncated vs. continuing seizures implies a separate mechanism for shortening the duration of seizures beyond stopping the spread pathways early. Additionally, the mechanism causing seizures to be truncated remains unclear. Further research is needed to understand how ASM may modulate seizure duration and severity.

                arXiv:2502.10098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective planning is crucial for navigating complex environments and achieving goals efficiently. In this study, we investigated how environmental structure influences the selection of planning strategies. Forty-two participants navigated a space station to collect colored spheres, with environments either structured (spheres grouped by color) or unstructured (spheres scattered randomly). We tested three types of plans: hierarchical (grouping spheres by color), shortest path (minimizing travel distance), and neutral (none of the above). By manipulating environmental structure, we were able to nudge participants toward a preference for hierarchical planning in structured environments, while shortest path plans were favored in unstructured environments. A mismatch between self-reported preferences and actual choices indicated that participants often adopted implicit strategies, unaware of their decision-making processes. These findings highlight the powerful effect of environmental cues on planning and suggest that even subtle changes in structure can guide the selection of planning strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08429">Visual Image Reconstruction from Brain Activity via Latent Representation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.08429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual image reconstruction, the decoding of perceptual content from brain activity into images, has advanced significantly with the integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative models. This review traces the field's evolution from early classification approaches to sophisticated reconstructions that capture detailed, subjective visual experiences, emphasizing the roles of hierarchical latent representations, compositional strategies, and modular architectures. Despite notable progress, challenges remain, such as achieving true zero-shot generalization for unseen images and accurately modeling the complex, subjective aspects of perception. We discuss the need for diverse datasets, refined evaluation metrics aligned with human perceptual judgments, and compositional representations that strengthen model robustness and generalizability. Ethical issues, including privacy, consent, and potential misuse, are underscored as critical considerations for responsible development. Visual image reconstruction offers promising insights into neural coding and enables new psychological measurements of visual experiences, with applications spanning clinical diagnostics and brain-machine interfaces.

                arXiv:2506.11015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory -- systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval, error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological "schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and workforce training in the age of large language models.

                arXiv:2506.15737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) frequently encounters difficulties, including substantial computing expense and the risk of converging to local optima, attributable to its dependence on partial weight gradients. Therefore, this work investigates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) - two population-based Metaheuristic Optimizers (MHOs) - as alternatives to SGD to mitigate these constraints. A hybrid PSO-SGD strategy is developed to improve local search efficiency. The findings indicate that the hybrid PSO-SGD technique decreases the median training MSE by 90 to 95 percent relative to conventional GA and PSO across various network sizes (e.g., from around 0.02 to approximately 0.001 in the Sphere function). RMHC attains substantial enhancements, reducing MSE by roughly 85 to 90 percent compared to GA. Simultaneously, RS consistently exhibits errors exceeding 0.3, signifying subpar performance. These findings underscore that hybrid and evolutionary procedures significantly improve training efficiency and accuracy compared to conventional optimization methods and imply that the Building Block Hypothesis (BBH) may still be valid, indicating that advantageous weight structures are retained during evolutionary search.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15746">Neural Cellular Automata for ARC-AGI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), are highly expressive and capable of surprisingly complex behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically, this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16795">Robust Dynamic Material Handling via Adaptive Constrained Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic material handling (DMH) involves the assignment of dynamically arriving material transporting tasks to suitable vehicles in real time for minimising makespan and tardiness. In real-world scenarios, historical task records are usually available, which enables the training of a decision policy on multiple instances consisting of historical records. Recently, reinforcement learning has been applied to solve DMH. Due to the occurrence of dynamic events such as new tasks, adaptability is highly required. Solving DMH is challenging since constraints including task delay should be satisfied. A feedback is received only when all tasks are served, which leads to sparse reward. Besides, making the best use of limited computational resources and historical records for training a robust policy is crucial. The time allocated to different problem instances would highly impact the learning process. To tackle those challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive constrained evolutionary reinforcement learning (ACERL) approach, which maintains a population of actors for diverse exploration. ACERL accesses each actor for tackling sparse rewards and constraint violation to restrict the behaviour of the policy. Moreover, ACERL adaptively selects the most beneficial training instances for improving the policy. Extensive experiments on eight training and eight unseen test instances demonstrate the outstanding performance of ACERL compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms. Policies trained by ACERL can schedule the vehicles while fully satisfying the constraints. Additional experiments on 40 unseen noised instances show the robust performance of ACERL. Cross-validation further presents the overall effectiveness of ACREL. Besides, a rigorous ablation study highlights the coordination and benefits of each ingredient of ACERL.

Abstract: This study investigates columnar-organized spiking neural networks (SNNs) for continual learning and catastrophic forgetting. Using CoLaNET (Columnar Layered Network), we show that microcolumns adapt most efficiently to new tasks when they lack shared structure with prior learning. We demonstrate how CoLaNET hyperparameters govern the trade-off between retaining old knowledge (stability) and acquiring new information (plasticity). Our optimal configuration learns ten sequential MNIST tasks effectively, maintaining 92% accuracy on each. It shows low forgetting, with only 4% performance degradation on the first task after training on nine subsequent tasks.

                arXiv:2506.17040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively. Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

Abstract: We study the learning problem associated with spiking neural networks. Specifically, we focus on spiking neural networks composed of simple spiking neurons having only positive synaptic weights, equipped with an affine encoder and decoder; we refer to these as affine spiking neural networks. These neural networks are shown to depend continuously on their parameters, which facilitates classical covering number-based generalization statements and supports stable gradient-based training. We demonstrate that the positivity of the weights enables a wide range of expressivity results, including rate-optimal approximation of smooth functions and dimension-independent approximation of Barron regular functions. In particular, we show in theory and simulations that affine spiking neural networks are capable of approximating shallow ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we apply these affine spiking neural networks to standard machine learning benchmarks and reach competitive results. Finally, we observe that from a generalization perspective, contrary to feedforward neural networks or previous results for general spiking neural networks, the depth has little to no adverse effect on the generalization capabilities.

                arXiv:2404.12746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in the field of mathematical runtime analysis of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), the performance of MOEAs on discrete many-objective problems is little understood. In particular, the few existing performance guarantees for classic MOEAs on classic benchmarks are all roughly quadratic in the size of the Pareto front.
  In this work, we consider a large class of MOEAs including the (global) SEMO, SMS-EMOA, balanced NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and SPEA2. For these, we prove near-tight runtime guarantees for the four most common benchmark problems OneMinMax, CountingOnesCountingZeros, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump, and this for arbitrary numbers of objectives. Most of our bounds depend only linearly on the size of the largest incomparable set, showing that MOEAs on these benchmarks cope much better with many objectives than what previous works suggested. Most of our bounds are tight apart from small polynomial factors in the number of objectives and length of bitstrings. This is the first time that such tight bounds are proven for many-objective uses of MOEAs.For the runtime of the SEMO on the LOTZ benchmark in $m \ge 6$ objectives, our runtime guarantees are even smaller than the size of the largest incomparable set. This is again the first time that such runtime guarantees are proven.

                arXiv:2308.05636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used today, especially through deep neural networks (DNNs), however, increasing computational load and resource requirements have led to cloud-based solutions. To address this problem, a new generation of networks called Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) has emerged, which mimic the behavior of the human brain to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption. These networks often process large amounts of sensitive information, such as confidential data, and thus privacy issues arise. Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a solution, allowing calculations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. This research compares traditional DNNs and SNNs using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) encryption scheme. The LeNet-5 model, a widely-used convolutional architecture, is used for both DNN and SNN models based on the LeNet-5 architecture, and the networks are trained and compared using the FashionMNIST dataset. The results show that SNNs using HE achieve up to 40% higher accuracy than DNNs for low values of the plaintext modulus t, although their execution time is longer due to their time-coding nature with multiple time-steps.

                arXiv:2308.12053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization has been a cornerstone of machine learning that enabled the vast advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development over the past decades. However, this type of optimization requires differentiation, and with recent evidence of the benefits of non-differentiable (e.g. neuromorphic) architectures over classical models w.r.t. efficiency, such constraints can become limiting in the future. We present Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP), a novel training principle for neural network-like predictors that utilizes methods from the domain of explainability to decompose a reward to individual neurons based on their respective contributions. Leveraging these neuron-wise rewards, our method then implements a greedy approach reinforcing helpful parts of the network and weakening harmful ones. While having comparable computational complexity to gradient descent, LFP does not require gradient computation and generates sparse and thereby memory- and energy-efficient parameter updates and models. We establish the convergence of LFP theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness on various models and datasets. Via two applications - neural network pruning and the approximation-free training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) - we demonstrate that LFP combines increased efficiency in terms of computation and representation with flexibility w.r.t. choice of model architecture and objective function. Our code is available at https://github.com/leanderweber/layerwise-feedback-propagation.

">Reward impulsivity is linked to addictive-like behaviors towards sweet food and sugary drinks but not fatty food</a></h4>

              
                Overconsumption of hyperpalatable food is a worldwide problem. Although many previous studies have shown the link between monetary delay discounting and propensity to overconsume food, the studies did not focus on the link between delay discounting and various subcategories of palatable food. In the present study, we investigate the link between the individual propensity to choose smaller immediate rather than larger delayed reward and the degree of problematic eating behavior for five types of palatable food (sweets, sugary drinks, fatty food, salty snacks, and starchy food). The delay discounting task was used to measure propensity to choose immediate rather than delayed rewards, while the degree of addictive-like behavior was measured using the modified Yale food addiction scale (mYFAS) for each food category. Both model-free and model-based analysis showed that there is a significant correlation between the addiction score for sweet food and the tendency to choose smaller immediate rather than larger delayed rewards. A model-based analysis showed the same significant correlation for sugary drinks. However, no such correlation was observed for other food categories (fatty, salty, or starchy food), suggesting that reward impulsivity may play different roles in addictive-like behavior towards various food categories.

">Neurobiological and Chemical Characterization of the Cyanobacterial Metabolite Veraguamide E</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Natural products have long been recognized as a rich source of therapeutics, accounting for over 60% of currently approved small-molecule drugs and underscoring their pivotal role in drug discovery. Marine cyanobacteria produce structurally diverse secondary metabolites with a wide array of biological activities. Among these are the veraguamides, a family of depsipeptides that have shown promise as future therapeutics in our recent studies. This work presents a detailed biological and chemical characterization of veraguamide E (Ver E), isolated from a Panamanian marine cyanobacterial collection. The {sigma}2R/TMEM97 system has been identified as a promising target to address unmet need for non-opioid therapeutics which can modulate neuronal excitability in the context of chronic pain. Discovery and identification of novel compounds which modulate this system can help us better understand its function as well as allow us to develop future therapeutics targeting this pathway. Summary: Ver E's structure was validated by 1H NMR, HRMS, and molecular networking analyses. Computational docking and NMR titration confirmed direct, saturable, and tight binding of Ver E to the human Sigma-2 receptor/transmembrane protein 97 ({sigma}2R/TMEM97). Functional calcium imaging in primary mouse sensory neurons revealed that Ver E increases intracellular Ca2+ levels without modulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Multi-well microelectrode array experiments using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived nociceptors showed that Ver E significantly reduced neuronal activity at physiological temperatures, but not under heat-stress conditions. Ver E exhibited no cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 30 M in HEK293 cells, and immunocytochemistry confirmed that it does not alter phosphorylated eIF2 (p-eIF2) expression, indicating a mechanism distinct from integrated stress response modulators. Collectively, these findings position Ver E as a non-toxic compound capable of selectively modulating neuronal excitability, thereby advancing the development of novel therapeutics for pain management.

">Brain Region-Specific Gene Co-expression Networks Reveal Neuroinflammation and ER Stress Signatures in Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

              
                This study aims to investigate gene expression changes in different brain regions of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients using transcriptomics and bioinformatics approaches. Through differential expression gene (DEG) analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we aimed to identify key genes, pathways, and co-expression modules associated with MDD, with particular emphasis on the role of neuroinflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways in MDD pathology and their region-specific characteristics. The findings of this study will provide novel insights into the complex molecular mechanisms of MDD and lay the foundation for the future development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

">Post Adversity Changes in Nigro-Striatal Dopamine: a Mechanism for Anxiety Induced Exacerbated Innate Repetitive Behaviors.</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety is known to exacerbate symptoms in various psychiatric disorders. In several conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or Tourette syndrome, anxiety intensifies stereotypic and repetitive behaviors. Rodent self-grooming, a structured, repetitive innate behavior, serves as an effective rodent model for studying these behaviors in neuropsychiatric research. Anxiety has also been linked to altered functioning of the dopamine (DA) system, particularly within the substantia-nigra pars compacta (SNc), the main DA source to the dorsal striatum through the nigro-striatal pathway. Striatal modulation by DA signal plays a complex role in repetitive behaviors such as grooming, with hyperactivity in cortico-striatal pathways strongly associated with OCD-like symptoms. This suggests that anxiety-induced exacerbation of repetitive behavior may be driven by changes in DA activity. In the present study, we observed several long term effects of anxiety inducing, aversive exposure to foot shock on grooming behavior. Recordings single unit neuronal activity in the SNC revealed three distinct response patterns related to grooming behavior with changes in the magnitude and timing following the shock treatment. Notably, DA neurons of different nigro-striatal pathways demonstrated different changes in different types of response pattern units. DA neurons projecting to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) showed increased transient activity, while those targeting the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) exhibited reduced transient activity - suggesting a shift toward stimulus-response (S-R) behavioral control in the cortico-striatal circuitry. These neural changes were correlated with the observed behavioral alterations following adversity. Furthermore, targeted stimulation of DLS-projecting DA neurons successfully rescued the anxiety-induced behavioral effects, highlighting the critical role of the nigro-striatal pathway to the DLS in mediating the interaction between anxiety and repetitive behaviors, thus offering future direction for mitigation of relevant psychiatric symptoms.

">Dynamic cholinergic signaling differentially desynchronizes cortical microcircuits dependent on modulation rate and network topology</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine (ACh) affects both the intrinsic properties of individual neurons and the oscillatory tendencies of neuronal microcircuits by modulating the muscarinic-receptor gated m-current. However, despite contemporary experimental evidence of ACh concentrations changing at millisecond timescales, computational studies traditionally model ACh solely as a tonic neuromodulator. How time-varying, dynamic cholinergic modulation of the m-current affects the dynamics of neuronal microcircuits therefore remains an open question. Using a new implementation of a time-varying cholinergic signal in computational excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) spiking neuronal networks, we here delineate how the interaction between dynamic cholinergic modulation and network topology influences the oscillatory tendencies of these systems. While the dynamics of networks with dominant inter-connectivity (strong E-to-I and I-to-E synaptic weights) are minimally affected, networks with dominant intra-connectivity (strong E-to-E and I-to-I synaptic weights) exhibit dynamics heavily dependent upon dynamic cholinergic signaling. Further investigation of these latter type of networks reveals that their firing patterns are sensitive to the timecourse of cholinergic modulation and that relatively minor changes to the E-I connectivity strength promote distinct desynchronization mechanisms. Our results indicate that network topology plays a paramount role in dictating the modulatory effects of time-varying cholinergic signals, a finding of broad relevance to our understanding of cholinergic modulation and potentially impactful in the design of neurostimulation therapies believed to act through cholinergic pathways.

">Projection-Specific Intersectional Optogenetics for Precise Excitation and Inhibition in the Marmoset Brain</a></h4>

              
                The primate cerebral cortex relies on long-range connections to integrate information between functionally specialized areas. Investigating these processes requires tools that can selectively modulate specific projection pathways. While cell-class-specific optogenetics can modulate local circuits, these approaches often lack pathway specificity. Projection-specific optogenetics offers greater precision, especially in primates, where cortical areas are spatially and functionally well-separated. To address challenges in translating this approach from rodents to primates, we developed a mouse-to-marmoset pipeline. We first validated that optogenetic targeting of inhibitory neurons (AAV9-Dlx-ChR2) effectively silenced local cortical areas in marmosets. We then tested selective excitation and inhibition of defined projection pathways. By intersecting retrogradely delivered Cre-recombinase (AAVretro-Cre) with locally injected Cre-dependent opsins (AAV8-FLEx-ChR2 or Jaws), we achieved efficient, direction-specific labeling of both callosal and longitudinal projections. This intersectional strategy enabled precise excitatory and inhibitory control of cortical activity using distinct light wavelengths, advancing projection-specific optogenetics for investigating primate brain circuit function.

">EEG-based Decoding of Auditory Attention to Conversations with Turn-taking Speakers</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) refers to the process of identifying which sound source a listener is attending to, based on neural recordings, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Most AAD studies use a competing speaker paradigm where two continuously active speech signals are simultaneously presented, in which the participant is instructed to attend to one speaker and ignore the other speaker. However, such a competing two-speaker scenario is uncommon in real life, as speakers typically take turns rather than speaking simultaneously. In this paper, we argue that decoding attention to conversations (rather than individual speakers) is a more relevant paradigm for testing AAD algorithms. In such a conversation-tracking paradigm, the AAD algorithm focusses on switching between entire conversations, resulting in less frequent attention shifts (ignoring turn-taking within conversations), thereby allowing for more relaxed constraints on the decision time. Design: To test AAD performance in such a conversation-tracking paradigm, we simulated a challenging restaurant scenario with three simultaneous two-speaker conversations, which were podcasts presented in front of the listener and in the back left and back right of the room. We conducted an EEG experiment on 20 normal-hearing participants to compare the performance of AAD in the commonly used competing speaker paradigm with two speakers versus the conversation tracking paradigm with 2 or 3 conversations, each containing two turn-taking speakers. Results: We found that AAD, using stimulus decoding, worked well under all experimental conditions, and that the accuracy was not influenced by the direction of attention, the proximity to the target conversation, or the presence of within-trial attention switches (versus a condition with sustained attention). Given the challenging scenario, we probed for the participants listening experience and found a correlation between the neural decoding performance and the perceived listening effort and self-reported speech intelligibility. To gain insight into the speech intelligibility of the participants in our setup, they performed a speech-in-noise test (Flemish matrix sentence test), but we did not find a correlation between the speech intelligibility performance and the AAD performance.

">Nicotinic Modulation of Fast-spiking Neurons in Rat Somatosensory Cortex Across Development</a></h4>

              
                Signaling at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) is vital for normal development of cerebral cortical circuits. These developing circuits are also shaped by fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory cortical neurons. While nicotinic dysfunction in FS neurons is implicated in a number of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, FS neurons are thought to not have nicotinic responses in adults. Here, we establish a timeline of FS neuron response to nicotine pre- and postsynaptically in primary somatosensory cortex in male and female rats. We found that nicotine increases the frequency of spontaneous synaptic inputs to FS neurons during the second postnatal week, and this effect persisted through development. In contrast, FS neurons in S1 had no postsynaptic responses to nicotine from as early as they can be reliably identified. This was not attributable to receptor desensitization, and we further revealed that FS neurons express abundant mRNA for several nAChR subunits, beginning early in development. To determine why FS neurons do not respond to nicotine, despite expressing these receptors, we probed for the expression of lynx1, a negative nicotinic modulator. Lynx1 mRNA was expressed in FS neurons from early development, with expression increasing dramatically during the second postnatal week.

">Hierarchical microstructural tissue growth of the gray and white matter of human visual cortex during the first year of life</a></h4>

              
                Development of gray and white matter tissue microstructure is critical for the emergence of sensory and cognitive functions. However, it is unknown how microstructural tissue properties of the human visual system develop in the first year of human life. Here, we use tissue relaxation rate (R1) obtained using quantitative MRI to measure the longitudinal development of gray and white matter in brain areas spanning three visual processing streams: dorsal, lateral, and ventral, during the first year of life. R1 in gray and white matter of all visual regions in the three processing streams increases postnatally, indicating microstructural tissue growth. R1 increases faster between 0-6 months than 6-12 months, and faster in white matter than gray matter, with white matter R1 surpassing that of gray matter after two months of age. Strikingly, this microstructural growth is hierarchical: across all streams, early visual areas are more mature at birth than higher-level areas but develop more slowly postnatally than higher-level areas. The exception is TO1 (MT) which is similar to V1: it is microstructurally more mature at birth and develops slower than neighboring areas. Overall, our findings provide the first comprehensive measurement of microstructural tissue growth in infancy across three visual processing streams and propose a new hypothesis that functional development of the visual cortex may be coupled with microstructural development and follows a similar hierarchical trajectory.

">Non-cell autonomous control of presynaptic remodeling by the hypothalamic autophagy/NPY axis</a></h4>

              
                Macroautophagy/autophagy, a critical cellular degradation pathway essential for maintaining neuronal proteostasis, declines with age and has been increasingly implicated in the regulation of synaptic integrity and circuit resilience. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), the most abundantly expressed neuropeptide in the mammalian brain, has emerged as a key modulator of both autophagy and aging-related processes. In Drosophila, the NPY-family peptide short Neuropeptide F (sNPF) has been shown to causally influence aging-associated changes in synaptic architecture and function, particularly at the presynaptic active zone (AZ), via non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Extending this concept to mammals, we investigated whether NPY and autophagy interact within NPY-secreting neurons to regulate age-related AZ remodeling. Our results indicate that hypothalamic NPY/AgRP neurons may exert geroprotective effects through the release of NPY and potentially other signaling molecules, thereby influencing both metabolic homeostasis and brain-wide synaptic function. These data suggest a conserved role for autophagy in maintaining presynaptic organization and resilience during aging.

">Visual Working Memory Guides Attention Rhythmically</a></h4>

              
                How does internal representation held in visual working memory (VWM), known as the attentional template, guide attention? A longstanding debate concerns whether only one (Single-Item-Template theory) or multiple (Multiple-Item-Template theory) items serve as attentional templates simultaneously. Here we propose a Rhythmic-Item-Template hypothesis, successfully reconciling these seemingly contradictory theories. Using the classical VWM-guided attention task, we found that two VWM items alternately dominate behavioral guidance in theta-rhythmic (4-8 Hz), with anti-correlated activation states in time, and more importantly, this rhythmic oscillation was not driven by the retro-cue processing. Neural recordings revealed that occipital alpha-oscillation (8-14 Hz) governed item-specific prioritization and its amplitude closely tracked subjects behavioral guidance, while frontal theta-oscillations phase-led and coupled with occipital alpha-oscillations during the item transition. Our Rhythmic-Item-Template results not only resolve previous Single-Item-Template versus Multiple-Item-Template debate but also advance our understanding of how distributed brain rhythms coordinate flexible resource allocation in multi-item memory systems.

">Functional Specialization of Angular Gyrus and Precuneus Subregions for Perspective-Guided Autobiographical Memory Retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval involves goal-directed and reconstructive processes that unfold over time. A key feature of this process is the visual perspective adopted during remembering, which shapes subjective memory experience. Using fMRI, we cued participants to retrieve AMs from an own-eyes, observer, or natural perspective followed by an event probe. Our design dissociates preparatory (cue phase) and reconstructive (probe phase) mechanisms to isolate the neural signatures of retrieval orientation, the strategic use of cues to optimize retrieval. Whole-brain and ROI analyses revealed that the angular gyrus (AG) and precuneus support perspective-guided retrieval in distinct ways. During the cue phase, PGp showed greater activity for instructed perspectives than natural retrieval, consistent with preparatory perspective selection. During the probe phase, observer-perspective retrieval elicited greater activity in PGp and precuneus (7P), supporting sustained perspective maintenance. Brain-behavior models linked PGp and 7P activity to greater vividness and perspective stability, while precuneus (7M) activity was negatively associated with emotional intensity, especially in the observer condition. These findings reveal phase- and subregion-specific contributions of posterior parietal cortex to the subjective qualities of memory. AG subregions support goal-directed perspective selection and implementation, while precuneus subregions flexibly modulate phenomenological features during memory reconstruction.

">Combined Auditory, Tactile, and Visual fMRI Reveals Sensory-Biased and Supramodal Working Memory Regions in Human Frontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual vs. auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform N-back WM judgements in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula and pre-supplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual- and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.

">Schizophrenia-associated 22q11.2 deletion elevates striatal acetylcholine and disrupts thalamostriatal projections to produce amotivation in mice</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, hallucinations, and negative symptoms such as amotivation. Negative symptoms are largely resistant to current antipsychotic treatments, and the neural circuits underlying amotivational states remain poorly defined. Here, using a mouse model of schizophrenia-associated 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), we report amotivation and weakened glutamatergic synaptic transmission between the thalamic parafascicular nucleus (Pf) and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Thalamostriatal disruption is attributed to hyperactivity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CHIs), which is associated with enhanced Trpc3 and Pex51 (Trip8b) gene expression. Elevated acetylcholine levels in the DMS act on presynaptic M2 muscarinic receptors to weaken Pf-DMS glutamatergic transmission. Importantly, disruption of Pf-DMS synaptic transmission or hyperactivation of CHIs are each sufficient to cause amotivation in wild-type mice. These results identify a striatal hypercholinergic state and subsequent thalamostriatal disruption as core pathogenic events causing amotivation in 22q11DS, providing potential therapeutic targets.

">Twinfilin-1 phosphorylation in reelin signaling regulates actin dynamics and spine development</a></h4>

              
                Reelin is an extracellular glycoprotein essential for neuronal migration, spine development, and synaptic plasticity. Impaired reelin signaling is linked to neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. While reelin mutant (reeler) mice exhibit behavioral deficits associated with impaired spine formation, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identified Twinfilin-1 (Twf1) as a downstream effector of reelin signaling via phosphoproteomic analysis, based on its reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in reeler mice. We found that Src regulated Twf1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 309, and reelin stimulation increased Twf1 phosphorylation in neurons, an effect blocked by the Src inhibitor PP2. A phospho-resistant Twf1 mutant (Twf1 Y309F) showed reduced capping protein binding and a lower F/G-actin ratio. Twf1Y309F mice exhibited cognitive deficits, reduced spine density, smaller spine head size, and a decreased F/G-actin ratio in synaptosomes. These findings highlight Twf1 phosphorylation as a key component of reelin signaling involved in actin remodeling and spine development.

">Biomechanical simplification of the motor control of whisking</a></h4>

              
                Animal nervous systems must coordinate the sequence and timing of numerous muscles - a challenging control problem. The challenge is particularly acute for highly mobile sensing structures with many degrees of freedom, such as eyes, pinnae, hands, forepaws, and whiskers, because these low-mass, distal sensors require complex muscle coordination. This work examines how the geometry of the rat whisker array simplifies coordination required for "whisking" behavior [1-3]. During whisking, 33 intrinsic ("sling") muscles are the primary drivers [4-12] of the rapid, rhythmic protractions of the large mystacial vibrissae (whiskers), which vary more than sixfold in length and threefold in base diameter [13-16]. Although whisking is a rhythmic, centrally-patterned behavior [17-24], rodents can change the position, shape, and size of the whisker array, indicating considerable voluntary control [25-34]. To begin quantifying how the array's biomechanics contribute to whisking movements, we used three-dimensional anatomical reconstructions of follicle and sling muscle geometry to simulate the movement resulting from a "uniform motor command," defined as equal firing rates across all sling muscle motor neurons. This simulation provides a baseline profile of protraction under anatomically realistic but uniformly driven conditions. It does not isolate neural from biomechanical contributions but helps identify deviations that suggest active control. Simulations reveal that all follicles rotate through approximately equal angles, regardless of size. The angular fanning of the whiskers at their bases increases monotonically throughout protraction, while maximum distance between whisker tips occurs at approximately 90% of resting muscle length, after which whisker tips converge and sensing resolution increases monotonically.

">Cholinergic modulation of dopamine release drives effortful behavior</a></h4>

              
                Effort is costly: given a choice, we tend to avoid it. But in many cases, effort adds value to the ensuing rewards. From ants to humans, individuals prefer rewards that had been harder to achieve. This counterintuitive process may promote reward-seeking even in resource-poor environments, thus enhancing evolutionary fitness. Despite its ubiquity, the neural mechanisms supporting this behavioral effect are poorly understood. Here we show that effort amplifies the dopamine response to an otherwise identical reward, and this amplification depends on local modulation of dopamine axons by acetylcholine. High-effort rewards evoke rapid acetylcholine release from local interneurons in the nucleus accumbens. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on dopamine axon terminals to augment dopamine release when reward is delivered. Blocking the cholinergic modulation blunts dopamine release selectively in high-effort contexts, impairing effortful behavior while leaving low-effort reward consumption intact. These results reconcile in vitro studies, which have long demonstrated that acetylcholine can trigger dopamine release directly through dopamine axons; with in vivo studies that failed to observe such modulation, but did not examine high-effort contexts. Our findings uncover a mechanism that drives effortful behavior through context-dependent local interactions between acetylcholine and dopamine axons.

">Preserved cerebellar functions despite structural degeneration in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Aging is frequently perceived negatively due to its association with the decline of various brain and bodily functions. While it is evident that motor abilities deteriorate with age, it is incorrect to assume that all aspects of movement execution are equally affected. The cerebellum, a brain region that is closely involved in motor control among other functions, undergoes clear structural changes with aging. While several studies suggest that cerebellar degeneration causes age related motor control deficits, other studies suggest that the cerebellum might act as a motor reserve and compensate for its structural degeneration, leaving cerebellar motor function intact despite cerebellar degeneration. The present study aims at thoroughly investigating the impact of age on cerebellar function across an array of tasks and domains. We investigated cerebellar motor and cognitive functions across the lifespan by examining 50 young adults (20 to 35 years), 80 older adults (55 to 70 years), and 30 older old adults (over 80 years). Participants completed a test battery comprising seven motor control tasks and one cognitive task, each designed to probe cerebellar function through different paradigms. This multi task approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of performance patterns, providing a balanced perspective on cerebellar function across the different age groups. In addition, we analyzed outcomes from the same tasks that, while related to movement, were not specifically linked to cerebellar function. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was also conducted to assess whether cerebellar atrophy was present in the older and older old groups compared to the young. Our results revealed that, despite age-related cerebellar degeneration, cerebellar functions in older adults remained intact compared to young adults, even in adults above 80 years old. In contrast, the sensorimotor measures that were not directly linked to cerebellar function exhibited a clear pattern of decline in older adults, and were further deteriorated in the older-old adults compared to the older adults. These findings indicate that cerebellar motor control functions remain largely preserved with age, providing compelling evidence that the cerebellum possesses a remarkable degree of functional resilience and redundancy. This suggests that cerebellar circuits may be uniquely equipped to preserve function despite structural degeneration.

">MRI-Based Structural Development of the Human Newborn Hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Background: Preclinical evidence suggests that intrauterine exposures can impact hypothalamic structure at birth and future disease risk, yet early human data are limited. Methods: Hypothalamic volumes were measured from 699 T1-weighted MRI scans from 631 newborns (54% female; 27-45 weeks postmenstrual age/PMA) in the Developing Human Connectome Project. Linear mixed-effects models tested associations with prenatal exposures: gestational age (GA) at birth, PMA at scan, sex, maternal body mass index (BMI), and smoking. Findings were partially replicated in the Adolescent Brain and Child Development (ABCD) Study (release 5.1) data (16,934 observations from 11,207 participants). Results: Absolute hypothalamus volume increased with PMA (+5.5%/week, t=39.9, p<10^-10), but not after adjusting for brain volume (t=1.2, p=0.24). Males showed larger absolute (+3.3%, t=3.2, p=0.002) but smaller relative hypothalamus volume (t=-2.8, p=0.005). Lower GA was linked to larger relative hypothalamus volume (t=-6.5, p<10^- 9), with evidence for sex moderation (t=-2.4, p=0.019). Smoking during pregnancy was associated with smaller hypothalamus volume in newborns (t=-2.05, p=0.04; dose dependence: t=-2.9, p<0.01). Smoking remained associated with reduced hypothalamus volume in adolescents (t=-2.8, p=0.005). Conclusions: The findings suggest that the hypothalamus is a crucial and underexplored target of perinatal influences for understanding the origins of long-term health and disease.

">The Topological Architecture of Brain Identity</a></h4>

              
                Accurately identifying individuals from brain activity --functional fingerprinting-- is a powerful tool for understanding individual variability and detecting brain disorders. Most current approaches rely on functional connectivity (FC), which measures pairwise correlations between brain regions. However, FC is limited in capturing the higher-order, multiscale structure of brain organization. Here, we propose a novel fingerprinting method based on homological scaffolds, a topological representation derived from persistent homology of resting-state fMRI data. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (n= 100), we show that scaffold-based fingerprints achieve near-perfect identification accuracy ([~] 100%), outperforming FC-based methods (90%), and remain robust across preprocessing pipelines, atlas choices, and even with drastically shortened scan durations. Unlike FC, in which fingerprinting features localize within networks, scaffolds derive their discriminative power from inter-network connections, revealing the existence of individual mesoscale organizational signatures. Finally, we show that scaffolds act as bridges between redundancy and synergy, by balancing redundancy along high-FC border edges with high synergy across the topological voids that the cycles define. These findings establish topological scaffolds as a powerful tool for capturing individual variability, revealing that unique signatures of brain organization are encoded in the interplay between mesoscale network integration and information dynamics.

                Dopamine signalling in the motor cortex is crucial for motor skill learning. Here we resolve the spatiotemporal dopamine dynamics and the activity of local dopaminoceptive circuits during the formation and execution of motor skills. We trained head-fixed mice to perform skilled forelimb movements with a joystick to collect water rewards, while simultaneously monitoring dopamine release and calcium dynamics in the forelimb area of motor cortex. We found that dopamine release events and calcium transients were temporally linked to joystick movements and reward consumption. Dopamine dynamics and population level activity of dopamine-receptive neurons scaled with the vigor of forelimb movements and tracked the relationship between actions and their consequences. Optogenetic photoinhibition of cortical dopaminoceptive circuits reduced the number of rewarded joystick movements. Our findings show how phasic dopamine signals in the motor cortex facilitate reinforcement motor learning of skilled behavior.

">Neuromorphic hierarchical modular reservoirs</a></h4>

              
                Modularity is a fundamental principle of brain organization, reflected in the presence of segregated sub-networks that enable specialized information processing. These small, densely connected modules are often nested within larger, higher-order modules, giving rise to a hierarchical modular architecture. This structure is posited to balance information segregation in specialized neuronal communities and global integration via intermodular communication. Yet, how hierarchical modularity shapes network function remains unclear. Here we introduce a simple blockmodeling framework for generating and comparing multi-level hierarchical modular networks and implement them as recurrent neural network reservoirs to evaluate their computational capacity. We show that hierarchical modular networks enhance memory capacity, support multitasking, and give rise to a broader range of temporal dynamics compared to strictly modular and random networks. These functional advantages can be traced to topological features enriched in hierarchical modular networks, which include reciprocal and cyclic network motifs. To test whether the computational advantages of hierarchical modularity subsist in empirical human brain structural connectivity patterns, we develop a novel hierarchical modularity-preserving network null model, allowing us to isolate the positive effect of empirical hierarchical modularity patterns on memory capacity. To evaluate the biomimetic validity of connectome-informed reservoir dynamics, we compare reservoir timescales to empirical brain timescales derived from MEG data and find that hierarchical modularity contributes to shaping brain-like neural timescales. Altogether, across multiple benchmarks, these results show that hierarchical modularity endows networks with computationally advantageous properties, providing insight into the relationship between neural network structure and function with potential applications for the design of neuromorphic computing architectures.

">Combining Machine Learning and Multiplexed, In Situ Profiling to Engineer Cell Type and Behavioral Specificity</a></h4>

              
                A promising strategy for the precise control of neural circuits is to use cis-regulatory enhancers to drive transgene expression in specific cells. However, enhancer discovery faces key challenges: low in vivo success rates, species-specific differences in activity, challenges with multiplexing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), and the lack of spatial detail from single-cell sequencing. In order to accelerate enhancer discovery for the dorsal spinal cord, a region critical for pain and itch processing, we developed an end-to-end platform, ESCargoT (Engineered Specificity of Cargo Transcription), combining machine learning (ML) guided enhancer prioritization, modular AAV assembly, and multiplexed, in situ screening. Using cross-species chromatin accessibility data, we trained ML models to predict enhancer activity in oligodendrocytes and in 15 dorsal horn neuronal subtypes. We first demonstrated that an initial enhancer, Excit-1, targeted excitatory dorsal horn neurons and drove reversal of mechanical allodynia in an inflammatory pain model. To enable parallel profiling of a 27-enhancer-AAV library delivered intraspinally in mice, we developed a Spatial Parallel Reporter Assay (SPRA) by integrating a novel Golden-Gate assembly pipeline with multiplexed, in situ screening. Regression adjustment for spatial confounding enabled specificity comparisons between enhancers, demonstrating the ability to screen enhancers targeting diverse cell types (oligodendrocytes, motoneurons, dorsal neuron subtypes) in one experiment. We then validated two candidates, targeting Exc-LMO3 and Exc-SKOR2 neurons, respectively. In a companion paper by Noh et al, our colleagues show that the functional specificity of the Exc-SKOR2-targeting enhancer, unlike Excit-1, is capable of blocking the sensation of chemical itch in mice. These enhancers were derived from the macaque genome but displayed functional sensitivity in mice. This platform enables spatially resolved, multiplexed in vivo enhancer profiling to accelerate discovery of cell-targeting tools and gene therapy development.

">Neural activity flows through cortical subnetworks during speech production</a></h4>

              
                Speech production entails several processing steps that encode linguistic and articulatory structure, but whether these computations correspond to spatiotemporally discrete patterns of neural activity is unclear. To address this issue, we used electrocorticography to directly measure the brains of neurosurgical participants performing an interactive speech paradigm. We observed a broad range of cortical modulation profiles, and subsequent clustering analyses established that responses comprised distinct classes associated with sensory perception, planning, motor execution, and task-related suppression. These activity classes were also localized to separate neural substrates, indicating their status as specialized networks. We then parsed dynamics in the planning and motor networks using unsupervised dimensionality reduction, which revealed subnetworks that were sequentially active throughout preparation and articulation. These results therefore support and extend a localizationist model of speech production where cortical activity flows within and across discrete pathways during language use.

">Ultrastructural analysis of synapses after induction of spike-timing-dependent plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Repeated sequential activation of connected neurons causes lasting changes in synaptic strength, a process known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Recently, sequential spike patterns have been induced without electrodes, using two spectrally separated channelrhodopsins. However, due to the difficulty of labeling and localizing the few connecting synapses between the stimulated pre and postsynaptic neurons (~1-5 per neuron pair), ultrastructural analysis after STDP has not been reported. Here, we optogenetically induce STDP at CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses and identify stimulated boutons and spines in CA1 using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Presynaptic CA3 neurons express vesicle-targeted horseradish peroxidase, cre recombinase and cre-dependent ChrimsonR, a red light activatable channelrhodopsin. Postsynaptic neurons express violet light activatable CheRiff and dAPEX2, an enhanced ascorbate peroxidase. In transmission electron microscopy, presynaptic boutons and postsynaptic spines are readily identifiable with well-preserved ultrastructural features. Our labeling strategy allows ultrastructural analysis of optogenetically manipulated neurons and their synapses.

">Volume Control for a Cortical Network</a></h4>

              
                Excitability is a fundamental property of cortical networks, shaping their responses to input. Here, we use ionic direct current (iDC) to modulate excitability with sub-10-ms temporal resolution and submillimeter spatial precision across the cortical surface, greatly surpassing the capabilities of pharmacological tools. In anesthetized rats, we recorded laminar neural responses in the S1HL cortex to spontaneous delta oscillations and to foot stimulation with and without iDC delivered to the cortical surface. Cathodic iDC suppressed, and anodic iDC enhanced, evoked responses across recording sites. iDC shifted the spatiotemporal excitability pattern in a graded manner, paralleling the effects of weaker or stronger foot stimuli. A computational model reproduced these effects and implicated dendritic summation at the axon initial segment (AIS) as a key mechanism for bidirectional modulation. This approach enables precise, causal manipulation of cortical responsiveness in vivo and offers a platform for dissecting functional circuits and developing targeted neurotherapeutic interventions.

">Cortical sculpting of a rhythmic motor program</a></h4>

              
                Motor cortex is the principal driver of discrete, voluntary movements like reaching. Correspondingly, current theories describe muscle activity as a function of cortical dynamics. Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating. Together, these results reveal a regime in which motor cortex does not fully specify muscle activity, but must sculpt an ongoing, spinally-generated program to flexibly control behavior in a complex and changing environment.

">Tracking visual rhythms: a concert of sensory and motor simulation</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations have been proposed to model external temporal structure by phase-coupling to environmental rhythms, thereby supporting adaptive perception. However, there is little evidence supporting these theories, particularly in the visual domain, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using MEG and a new empirical approach we addressed this issue. Participants attended 1.3 and 2 Hz visual displays of rotating Gabors and judged either the timing or content of these events. We show behaviourally-relevant rate-specific phase-coupling in motor structures to - and beyond - the visual rhythm specifically when judging temporal features of the display. We subsequently devised a rate-specific decoding measure to show that visual structures track anticipated, temporally-precise content regardless of task. This sensory simulation predicted the temporal tracking in motor structures. We consequently propose a mechanism by which automatic, temporally-specific sensory simulation yields an information envelope read out by motor areas when estimating temporal characteristics in our environment.

">A Single-Cell Atlas of DNA Methylation in Autism Spectrum Disorder Reveals Distinct Regulatory and Aging Signatures</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common, genetically and clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition. Despite this diversity, studies of postmortem brain tissue have revealed convergent molecular changes across the cortex, including reduced synaptic function in subsets of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and increased glial reactivity. Whether these features are reflected in cell type specific epigenetic signatures remains unknown. Here, we present the first single-cell analysis of DNA methylation (DNAm) coupled with transcriptomics in ASD. Using snmCTseq, we profiled DNAm and gene expression from over 60,000 nuclei across 49 donors. We identified thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in ASD, enriched in promoters and regulatory elements active during both prenatal development and in adult cortex. ASD related methylation changes were spatially localized but uncorrelated with gene expression, and were small in magnitude compared to robust age associated effects. Age DMRs were concentrated in excitatory neurons, enriched in known cognitive aging pathways, and revealed distinct roles for CG and non CG methylation in the aging brain. Finally, we explored age by diagnosis interactions, identifying a reduction in inhibitory neuron abundance with age in ASD relative to controls, highlighting this area as a promising direction for future research.

">Horizontally Tiled Network of Cortico-Basal Ganglia Modules Performs Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex and basal ganglia nuclei are connected along regions that share the same topography and are arranged side-by-side. Inspired by the anatomical characteristics of the cerebrum, we developed a network in which the modules of the neocortex-basal ganglia unit were arranged in a horizontally tiled manner. By applying this network to reinforcement learning tasks, we demonstrated that reinforcement learning can be achieved through horizontal signals passing between modules. Each module not only performs its calculation but also provides signals to adjacent modules. This lateral transmission takes advantage of the differences in the projection ranges of the three basal ganglia pathways, the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways, which have been examined in physiologic studies. We found that these differences enabled temporal-difference-error computations. This study proposes a novel strategy for information processing based on neocortical-basal ganglia circuits, highlighting the computational significance of their anatomically and physiologically clarified features.

Growing evidence suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying such decisions may vary according to interpersonal relationship types. However, the specific modulatory effects of romantic love on vicarious risk assessment and outcome evaluation during dynamic decision-making remain unclear. Against this background, we employed a computerized gambling task combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neurophysiological correlates of romantic love's influence on vicarious decision processes in romantically involved young adults (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 40) while also investigating comparative effects of maternal love. Our results showed relationship-specific risk cues and outcome processing patterns during vicarious decision-making. In detail, we found enhanced N100 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for romantic partner at the cue phase but increased P300 amplitudes to wins and attenuated LPP amplitudes to losses for mother at the feedback phase. Additionally, oscillatory analysis revealed reduced alpha band oscillation for self versus strangers and attenuated theta band oscillation for partners relative to mothers during low-risk conditions. Together, these findings demonstrate that vicarious risk and outcome processing are fundamentally shaped by interpersonal relationships, with romantic partners and mothers eliciting qualitatively distinct neural response patterns in romantically involved individuals.</span>

                <p>Dmrta2 (also designated Dmrt5) is a transcriptional regulator expressed in cortical progenitors in a caudomedial<sup>high</sup>/rostrolateral<sup>low</sup> gradient with important roles at different steps of cortical development. Dmrta2 has been suggested to act in cortex development mainly by differential suppression of <I>Pax6</I> and other homeobox transcription factors such as the ventral telencephalic regulator <I>Gsx2</I>, which remains to be fully demonstrated. Here we have addressed the epistatic relation between Pax6 and Dmrta2 by comparing phenotypes in mutant embryos or embryos overexpressing both genes in various allelic combinations. We show that Dmrta2 cooperates with Pax6 in the maintenance of cortical identity in dorsal telencephalic progenitors and that it acts as a transcriptional repressor of <I>Pax6</I> to control cortical patterning. Mechanistically, we show that in P19 cells, Dmrta2 acts as a DNA binding-dependent repressor on the <I>Pax6 E60</I> enhancer and that a point mutation that affects its DNA binding properties identified in a consanguineous family leads to agenesis of the corpus callosum, pachygyria, and the absence of the cingulate gyrus. Finally, we provide evidence that Dmrta2 binds components of the NuRD repressor complex and interacts with zinc finger proteins such as Zfp423. Together, our results highlight the importance and conserved function of Dmrta2 in cortical development and provide novel insights into its mechanism of action.</p>

                Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common oral cancers with a high mortality rate. The biodiversity source in Indonesia makes areca nut a potential antioxidant in treating disease. Objective The study aimed to evaluate the effect of areca nut extract on 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO)-tumor-induced rats. Methods Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 served as the control group, group 2 was 4NQO-induced rats without treatment, and groups 3 and 4 were given 4NQO-tumor inducer with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract, respectively. The rats in groups 2,3, and 4 received 30 ppm of 4NQO tumor inducer in drinking water for 12 weeks. In the end, all rats were euthanized, and the tongue was removed. The body, liver, kidney, heart, and lung weights were measured. Tongue tumor volume and dysplasia lesions were analyzed. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor and stromal areas were scored semi-quantitatively associating the infiltrate grade (0-3) and analyzed histologically. Results There were significant differences in body weight loss between the initial and final phases in groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The areca nut at 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW significantly reduced the tumor size compared with groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The incidence of OSCC in rats with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract after 22 weeks was 0%, but the dysplasia lesions were observed at 28.57% and 85.71%, respectively. The highest mean of stromal TILs was in group 3 and there were significant differences in stromal TILs between groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Conclusion Areca nut extract induced infiltrating lymphocytes in the stromal tumor area on the OSCC lesion of the tongue in 4NQO-induced rats.

This study aims to investigate the association between risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19 with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Methods This was an online study conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, during the first wave of COVID-19. Participants were provided written informed consent prior to agreeing or declining to voluntarily participate in the questionnaire-based study. A total of 1,153 respondents were selected. The dependent variable was consistent mask-wearing outside the home, while the independent variables were risk perception regarding COVID-19, sociodemographic factors (location, age, gender, education, occupation, family income, family members, social health scheme), and knowledge of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results The risk perception of COVID-19 as a viral disease that can cause death (aOR: 2.502; 95% CI: 1.601-3.912) was positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Regarding sociodemographic factor, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years (aOR: 0.486; 95% CI: 0.254-0.932) were 49% less likely to consistently use masks. Knowledge of the need to change cloth masks every 4-6 hours (aOR: 1.697; 95% CI: 1.118-2.576); the transmission (aOR: 1.974; 95%CI: 1.040-3.746), knowledge of severe symptoms of COVID-19 (aOR: 1.981; 95%CI: 1.175-3.342); and awareness of the confirmed diagnosis by PCR (aOR: 2.238; 95%CI: 1.215-4.120) were positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Conclusions The risk perception of COVID-19 as potentially fatal and knowledge regarding proper mask-changing intervals, the transmission, severe symptoms, and PCR-based diagnosis were positively associated with mask-wearing outside the home. However, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years were less likely to wear mask consistently. These findings underscore the importance of targeted public health interventions that address risk perception and enhance knowledge to promote mask use as effective COVID-19 prevention measures.

                <p>by Ryan J. Rowekamp, Tatyana O. Sharpee</p>

Biological visual systems are celebrated for their ability to reliably and precisely recognize objects. However, the specific neural mechanisms responsible for this capability remain largely elusive. In this study, we investigate neural responses in the visual areas V1, V2, and V4 of the brain to natural stimuli using a framework that includes quadratic computations in order to capture local recurrent interactions, both excitatory and suppressive. We find that these quadratic computations and specific coordination between their elements strongly increase both the predictive power of the model and the neural selectivity to natural stimuli. Particularly important were (i) coordination between excitatory and suppressive features to represent mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding incoming stimuli, such as orthogonal orientations or opposing motion directions in area V4, (ii) balance in the contribution of excitatory and suppressive components and its maintenance at similar levels across stages of processing, and (iii) refinement of feature selectivity between stages, with earlier stages representing broader category of inputs. Overall, this work describes how the brain could use multiple nonlinear mechanisms to increase selectivity of neural responses to natural stimuli.

                <p>by Danai Koftori, Charandeep Kaur, Laura Mora Bitria, Yan Zhang, Linda Hadcocks, Ada W. C. Yan, Piotr F. Burzyński, Kristin Ladell, Daniel E. Speiser, Katrina M. Pollock, Derek Macallan, Becca Asquith</p>

T stem cell-like memory cells (T<sub>SCM</sub> cells) are considered to be essential for the maintenance of immune memory. The T<sub>SCM</sub> population has been shown to have the key properties of a stem cell population: multipotency, self-renewal and clonal longevity. Here we show that no single population has all these stem cell properties, instead the properties are distributed. We show that the human T<sub>SCM</sub> population consists of two distinct cell subpopulations which can be distinguished by the level of their CD95 expression (CD95int and CD95hi). Crucially, using long-term <i>in vivo</i> labelling of human volunteers, we establish that these are distinct populations rather than transient states of the same population. These two subpopulations have different functional profiles <i>ex vivo</i>, different transcriptional patterns, and different tissue distributions. They also have significantly different TREC content indicating different division histories and we find that the frequency of CD95hi T<sub>SCM</sub> increases with age. Most importantly, CD95hi and CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub> cells also have very different dynamics <i>in vivo</i> with CD95hi cells showing considerably higher proliferation but significantly reduced clonal longevity compared with CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub>. While both T<sub>SCM</sub> subpopulations exhibit considerable multipotency, no single population of T<sub>SCM</sub> cells has both the properties of self-renewal and clonal longevity. Instead, the “stemness” of the T<sub>SCM</sub> population is generated by the complementary dynamic properties of the two subpopulations: CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub> which have the property of clonal longevity and CD95hi T<sub>SCM</sub> which have the properties of expansion and self-renewal. We suggest that together, these two populations function as a stem cell population.

                Background The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a pressing need for exploring new natural compounds with innovative mechanisms to replace existing antibiotics. Bacteriocins offer promising alternatives for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies in livestock, aquaculture, and human health. Specifically, those produced by LAB are recognized as GRAS and QPS. This study aims to develop a deep learning model specifically designed to classify bacteriocins by their LAB origin, using interpretable k-mer features and embedding vectors to enable applications in antimicrobial discover. Methods We developed a deep learning neural network for binary classification of bacteriocin amino acid sequences (BacLAB vs. Non-BacLAB). Features were extracted using k-mers (k=3,5,7,15,20) and vector embeddings (EV). Ten feature combinations were tested (e.g., EV, EV+5-mers+7-mers). Sequences were filtered by length (50–2000 AA) to ensure uniformity, and class balance was maintained (24,964 BacLAB vs. 25,000 Non-BacLAB). The model was trained on Google Colab, demonstrating computational accessibility without specialized hardware. Results The ‘5-mers+7-mers+EV’ group achieved the best performance, with k-fold cross-validation (k=30) showing: 9.90% loss, 90.14% accuracy, 90.30% precision, 90.10% recall and F1 score. Folder 22 stood out with 8.50% loss, 91.47% accuracy, and 91.00% precision, recall, and F1 score. Five sets of 100 LAB-specific k-mers were identified, revealing conserved motifs. Despite high accuracy, sequence length variation (50–2000 AA) may bias k-mer representation, favoring longer sequences. Additionally, experimental validation is required to confirm the biological activity of predicted bacteriocins. These aspects highlight directions for future research. Conclusions The model developed in this study achieved consistent results with those seen in the reviewed literature. It outperformed some studies by 3-10%. Its implementation in resource-limited settings is feasible via cloud platforms like Google Colab. The identified k-mers could guide the design of synthetic antimicrobials, pending further in vitro validation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the clinical features that identify patients with suspected rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) who will develop RPD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with suspected RPD were enrolled and followed at Mayo Clinic (Jacksonville, FL; January 2020 to October 2023) and Washington University (Saint Louis, MO; June 2016 to December 2019). Two dementia specialists independently reviewed clinical data and assigned diagnoses. Patients were diagnosed with RPD if they developed dementia within 1 year or incapacitation within 2 years of symptom onset. The associations between clinical features and causes and outcomes were explored via univariate and multivariate comparisons.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 248 patients with suspected RPD, 185 (74.6%) met criteria for RPD. Patients with RPD were older (62.6 ± 14.5 vs 55.2 ± 18.1 years; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.40, 7.31) or Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.38, 15.75). Visual agnosia (15/183; 8.2%), substantial brain atrophy (27/182; 14.8%), and periodic epileptiform discharges (11/151; 7.3%) were exclusively detected in patients with RPD. After controlling for age, intensive care unit admission (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.61, 14.12), lack of seizures (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.15, 5.31), abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (OR 2.01, 95% CI 0.997, 4.05), and cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count ≤5 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.60, 6.82) were also independently associated with RPD. Patients with RPD were more likely to die or develop severe dementia (mean time to outcome, 36.1 months; 95% CI 31.2–41.0).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Selected clinical features may identify patients with suspected RPD who are likely to continue to decline. Early recognition of these features may improve diagnostic accuracy and inform prognosis. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                There is a recognised need to further understand potential harms from the use of e-cigarettes and other non-tobacco oral nicotine products (ONPs), particularly among children and young people. This protocol describes a programme of work that aims to continually identify and classify the evolving international evidence base on the effects of these products on human health, trends in their use, and related interventions. In terms of its methods, we will produce and maintain a living evidence map, available in an online interactive format, and updated continually over the planned duration of the project (~5 years from registration). A wide range of electronic databases will be searched, with eligible articles including a focus on the use of e-cigarettes or ONPs in humans. Should satisfactory levels of machine performance be reached (by reference to human performance benchmarks), we intend to automate the bulk screening of articles for inclusion using Large Language Model (LLM) decisions. A similar approach will be applied to the automated coding of a range of characteristics of included articles, including their type of research, and the nature of harms and products being examined. In conjunction with the production of the living evidence map, we will produce regular descriptive surveillance reports (research digests) that will summarise the current contents of the map. Ongoing production and maintenance of this living evidence map and linked outputs will enable potential users – including across research, policy, and charitable sectors – to more efficiently establish an overview of the landscape of relevant research and surveil key developments.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prognostication in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs) remains challenging because of heterogeneous etiologies, pathophysiologies and, consequently, highly variable electroencephalograms (EEGs). Here, we use EEG patterns that are well-characterizable to create a latent map that positions novel EEGs along a continuum. We asses this map as a generalizable tool to extract prognostically valuable information from long-term EEG, by predicting outcome post-cardiac arrest as a first use case.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Categorizable EEGs across the health-disease continuum (wake [W], sleep [rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM (N1, N2, N3)], ictal-interictal-continuum [lateralized and generalized periodic discharges (LPD, GPD) and lateralized and generalized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA, GRDA)], seizures [SZ], burst suppression [BS]; 20,043 patients, 288,986 EEG segments) are arranged meaningfully in a low-dimensional space via a deep neural network, resulting in a universal map of EEG (UM-EEG). We assess prognostication after cardiac arrest (576 patients, recovery or death) based on long-term EEGs represented as trajectories in this continuous embedding space.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Classification of out-of-sample EEG match state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms while extending it to the currently largest set of classes across the health-disease continuum (mean area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUROCs] 1-vs-all classification: W, 0.94; REM, 0.92; N1, 0.85; N2, 0.91; N3, 0.98; GRDA, 0.97; LRDA, 0.97; SZ, 0.87; GPD, 0.99; LPD, 0.97; BS, 0.94). UM-EEG enables outcome prediction after cardiac arrest with an AUROC of 0.86 and identifies interpretable factors governing prognosis such as the distance to healthy states over time.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>UM-EEG presents a novel and physiologically meaningful representation to characterize brain states along the health-disease continuum. It offers new opportunities for personalized, long-term monitoring and prognostication. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Biomarkers of disease pathogenesis are critically needed for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to facilitate diagnosis and patient stratification into appropriate therapeutic trials. Proteomic studies offer significant potential to advance this, but reproducibility across laboratories is a key component toward identifying protein changes that can be translated into clinical applications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A combined analysis of 25 proteomic studies in human ALS biospecimens was performed to identify proteins consistently altered in ALS postmortem tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, or blood, as well as across primary regions of ALS pathology and peripheral biofluids. We consolidated these datasets into a user-friendly database “FindMND Biomarker,” which is an accessible search tool that allows users to quickly determine how often, and in which biospecimen types, their proteins of interest are dysregulated in patients with ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our combined analysis identified 1,458 altered proteins in ALS, and revealed consistent dysregulation in mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and RNA binding proteins in primary and later affected regions of ALS pathology. Remarkable consistency in the direction and dysregulation of chitinases and gelsolin proteins were observed across ALS biofluids. Comparisons of postmortem tissue and biofluids reinforce several known protein changes, and highlighted novel proteins of interest that may drive disease pathogenesis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The biospecimen type in which protein dysregulation is most consistently identified provides important insight into disease, and whether these represent potential measures of disease pathogenesis or systemic changes. By streamlining proteins by reproducibility and biospecimen type, FindMNDBiomarker is a useful resource that provides new mechanistic insights, and facilitates the prioritization of ALS-associated proteins for further validation and investigation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the timing of change of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) from six different assay platforms, alongside established AD biomarkers, using amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET)-based AD progression timelines.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 784 individuals with longitudinal amyloid PET and 359 with longitudinal tau PET, were analyzed to estimate the age at amyloid and tau PET positivity, respectively. Longitudinal plasma biomarker measurements were available from 190 individuals with an estimated amyloid PET positivity age and from 70 individuals with an estimated tau PET positivity age. In a subset of 17 clinical progressors, age at tau PET positivity strongly predicted symptom onset, allowing for estimation of symptom onset age. Biomarker trajectories based on time from amyloid or tau PET positivity or symptom onset were modelled using Generalized Additive Mixed models. Time intervals of significant biomarker change and the earliest timepoints at which biomarkers exceeded predefined abnormality thresholds were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All plasma biomarkers except NfL became abnormal prior to established thresholds for amyloid and tau PET positivity. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 became abnormal very early in both amyloid PET and tau PET timelines, while plasma GFAP became abnormal early in the tau PET timeline. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels plateaued, whereas plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL levels increased throughout the modeled disease progression. Some variations in the timing of these changes were observed across different biomarker assays.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 may be useful in identifying individuals with very low levels of amyloid pathology, whereas p-tau, GFAP, and NfL may be useful in staging disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective was to evaluate the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in an international cohort of patients with <i>VPS16</i>-related dystonia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational study collected preoperative and postoperative demographic, clinical, stimulation, genetic, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological data of medically refractory DYT-<i>VPS16</i> patients with implanted DBS in 10 international centers. Motor symptoms and disability outcomes were assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale Motor (BFMDRS-M) and Disability (BFMDRS-D) scales. A cut-off threshold for considering response to DBS was set at 25% of BFMDRS-M improvement at the last follow-up (FU) compared to baseline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cohort consisted of 26 participants (17 men, 65.4%). Age at dystonia onset and surgery was 17.8 ± 10.9 and 35.3 ± 14.8 years, respectively. At the last FU, 102.5 ± 57.3 months (range, 2–216), the mean BFMDRS-M improvement was 41.6 ± 37.3% (26/26 patients) and 34.8 ± 42.6% for the BFMDRS-D (23/26 patients). Most patients (19/26, 73%) were considered responders. Higher motor improvement was associated with stimulation of the ventroposterior portion of the internal globus pallidus. A significant inverse relationship was observed between improvement in BFMDRS-M at last FU, and the presence of spasticity (<i>p</i> = 0.027) and fixed skeletal deformities (<i>p</i> = 0.001) before surgery. Non-responders had a younger age at disease onset and at implantation, shorter disease duration at DBS surgery, and higher baseline BFMDRS scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DBS was an effective treatment for three-quarters of patients with pathogenic <i>VPS16</i> variants in our cohort. Mean motor improvement was most pronounced at the 1-year FU, but persisted at the last FU despite disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Long-read RNA sequencing technologies can produce complete or near-complete transcript sequences. Recently introduced methods for direct RNA and cDNA sequencing can provide a high-throughput strategy for the discovery of novel and rare gene isoforms. However, the high error rates in ONT sequences limit the ability to exactly pinpoint splice site boundaries when aligning reads to the genome. Methods In this paper, we present a novel tool called NIFFLR (Novel IsoForm Finder using Long Reads) that identifies and quantifies both known and novel isoforms using long-read RNA sequencing data. NIFFLR recovers known transcripts and assembles novel transcripts present in the data by aligning exons from a reference annotation to the long reads. Results NIFFLR effectively recovers correct transcripts from simulated reads based on known transcript annotations, achieving higher sensitivity and precision compared to several previously-published tools. On real data, NIFFLR shows the high accuracy as measured by concordance of isoform counts to the counts computed from Illumina data for the same sample. We applied NIFFLR to a set of 92 GTEx long-read samples and produced transcript counts for both novel and known isoforms. In total, we identified and quantified 121,155 isoforms present in the RefSeq annotation of GRCh38 and 106,667 high-confidence novel isoforms across 32,875 genes present in two or more samples in these data, more than previous studies identified in this data set. Conclusions NIFFLR is an effective tool aimed at assembly and quantification of transcripts present in the long high error transcriptome reads. NIFFLR is released under an open-source license (GPL 3.0) and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/alguoo314/NIFFLR/releases.

                Background Long Covid is defined as conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection more than 3 months. This study aimed to analyze the point prevalence and predictors of long Covid in the Omicron variant dominant epidemic at 3 and 6 months in Thailand. Methods Prospective cohort study on the COVID-19 cohort at Thammasat University Hospital (TUH) and Thammasat Field Hospital (TFH) during the Omicron variant dominant epidemic was performed. The phone interview for long Covid symptoms was performed among 1,388 patients at 3 months and 917 patients at 6 months after the infection. Clinical characteristics of all participants were retrieved from the database of the hospital. Results The point prevalence of long Covid was 52.59% at 3 months and 28.57% at 6 months. The most prevalent symptom group at both time points was fatigue and weakness, affecting 31.70% of patients at 3 months and 15.81% at 6 months. Three significant predictors of long Covid were identified at both 3 and 6 months: severe-to-critical illness during the acute phase, female sex, and healthcare worker occupation. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for severe-to-critical illness were 4.50 [95% CI, 1.59–12.75] at 3 months and 9.15 [95% CI, 1.35–62.10] at 6 months. Female sex was associated with aORs of 2.04 [95% CI, 1.61–2.58] at 3 months and 2.41 [95% CI, 1.71–3.34] at 6 months. Healthcare workers had aORs of 1.96 [95% CI, 1.39–2.78] at 3 months and 3.12 [95% CI, 1.85–5.27] at 6 months. Obesity was a significant predictor of long Covid only at 3 months. Conclusions The prevalence of long Covid remains substantial following the Omicron variant-dominant epidemic. Key predictors of long Covid at both 3 and 6 months include severe-to-critical illness during the acute phase, female sex, and healthcare worker occupation.

                Background DataSHIELD is a mature, R-based federated learning platform that enables multi-site analysis without sharing individual participant data. While DataSHIELD includes many packages for data analysis, it lacks user-friendly data manipulation tools. Methods To address this gap, we developed dsTidyverse, an implementation of selected functions from the popular Tidyverse package within the DataSHIELD client-server architecture. Disclosure checks were implemented to prevent individual-level data leakage. Results This package provides functionality for selecting, renaming, and creating columns; conditional recoding; combining data frames by rows or columns; filtering and arranging rows; grouping and ungrouping data; and converting data frames to tibbles. Through examples, we demonstrate how dsTidyverse simplifies common data manipulation tasks within DataSHIELD. Conclusions By providing additional data manipulation functionality, dsTidyverse improves the user experience and analytical efficiency within DataSHIELD. The package is open-source and freely available on CRAN and GitHub, and welcomes further development: https://github.com/molgenis/ds-tidyverse.

                Background Sleep disturbances frequently occur in concomitance with chronic pain, exacerbating its detrimental effects and diminishing patients’ quality of life. Although various studies have explored the relationship between chronic pain and sleep disturbances, comprehensive evidence on detailed assessment methods and their bidirectional interactions remains limited. This scoping review aimed to examine the characteristics and prevalence of assessment methods for sleep and pain-related outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. Methods A comprehensive search of nine databases identified observational and interventional studies examining the relationship between sleep disturbances/disorders and chronic pain in adults. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) as well as gray literature sources, Open Grey. In addition, the following trial registries were searched for ongoing or unpublished trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Results This review included 81 of 3,513 studies. Approximately 90.1% of studies relied on self-report sleep assessments, whereas only 9.9% incorporated objective measures. Additionally, 7.4% of studies used a combination of self-report and objective sleep assessments. The visual analog and numeric rating scales were the most frequently used methods for assessing pain-related outcomes (58.0%). Despite extensive research on sleep and chronic pain, critical gaps persist, particularly in the integration of multidimensional assessment tools. Conclusions This scoping review discovered imbalances in the content of both sleep and pain assessments. Future studies should integrate both objective and self-report assessment tools to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this interaction.

                Background Malnutrition impairs immune function and vaccine responses, particularly in low-income settings. This can lead to reduced seroconversion rates and compromised herd immunity in children. Nutritional interventions have been proposed to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, yet evidence remains scattered and context specific. Objective This systematic review assesses the impact of nutritional interventions—especially vitamin A, zinc supplementation, and protein-energy rehabilitation—on serological responses to routine childhood vaccines among malnourished children in low- and middle-income countries. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Health Library for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews reporting on nutritional supplementation and vaccine seroconversion outcomes in malnourished children. Results From 3,245 records, 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A supplementation improved measles vaccine seroconversion by 35%, especially among deficient children. Zinc enhanced responses to oral vaccines by 20%. Protein-energy rehabilitation significantly increased seroconversion rates for BCG and measles vaccines, particularly in children recovering from severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion Nutritional interventions improve vaccine immunogenicity among malnourished children. Integrated strategies combining immunization and nutrition services should be prioritized to address immunity gaps in vulnerable populations.

                Background The discovery spurred further exploration, leading to the expansion of opal mining into neighboring districts. Numerous cooperative groups, composed of small-scale miners, traditionally explore, develop, and extract significant amounts of rough opal gemstones. This study tries to investigate the challenges and economic impacts of traditional opal mining practice in wollo province of Ethiopia. Methods The study used in this study is primary data collected from rural households, which are living in five districts of north wollo zone, in Amhara regional state. The data was collected using field observation, focus grouped discussion, interview, and questionnaire from sampled households. The study uses both descriptive and econometric methods of data analysis to achieve its objective. Results Among the challenges of traditional opal mining, primitive way of exploring and extraction, limited access to market and low institutional support in terms of training and finance are identified. The probit model reveals that, increased education, access to training, and access to credit positively influence the likelihood of engaging in opal mining. The ESR model shows that, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) indicates that participating in opal mining increases monthly income by 31,380 ETB, while the average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU) shows a potential income increase of 31,625 ETB for non-miners if they engaged in mining. Conclusion The study identifies three main categories of challenges faced by traditional opal miners: exploration and extraction issues, market limitations, and regulatory and institutional shortcomings. Exploration and extraction challenges include the lack of modern mining tools and knowledge, as well as difficult terrain, leading to inefficient and hazardous mining practices. Market-related challenges involve limited access to broader markets and lack of value addition, resulting in miners selling raw opals at significantly lower prices compared to polished ones.

                Background In computer vision and image processing, face recognition is increasingly popular field of research that identifies similar faces in a picture and assigns a suitable label. It is one of the desired detection techniques employed in forensics for criminal identification. Methods This study explores face recognition system for monozygotic twins utilizing three widely recognized feature descriptor algorithms: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)—with region-specific facial landmarks. These landmarks were extracted from 468 points detected through the MediaPipe framework, which enables simultaneous recognition of multiple faces. Quantitative similarity metrics t served as inputs for four classification methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM), and Nearest Centroid (NC). The effectiveness of these algorithms was tested and validated using challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets, the most difficult data sets for 2D and 3D face recognition research at Notre Dame University. Results Testing with Notre Dame University’s challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets revealed significant performance differences. Results demonstrated that 2D facial images achieved notably higher recognition accuracy than 3D images. The 2D images produced accuracy of 88% (SVM), 83% (LGBM), 83% (XGBoost), and 79% (NC). In contrast, the 3D TEC dataset yielded a lower accuracy r of 74%, 72%, 72%, and 70%, with the same classifiers. Conclusion The hybrid feature extraction approach proved most effective, with maximum accuracy rates reaching 88% for 2D facial images and 74% for 3D facial images. This work contributes significantly to forensic science by enhancing the reliability of facial recognition systems when confronted with indistinguishable facial characteristics of monozygotic twins.

                Two co-resident temperate archaeal viruses, SNJ1 and SNJ2, and their shared host establish a mutualistic relationship, where SNJ2-encoded type IV pilins assemble into T4P filaments important for host biofilm formation and motility and are used by SNJ1 as a primary receptor. Reciprocally, SNJ1 strongly enhances SNJ2 replication efficiency.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102550">Mapping HIV-1 RNA structure, homodimers, long-range interactions and persistent domains by HiCapR</a></h4>

              
                Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome organization remains a critical knowledge gap in understanding its replication cycle. To address this, we developed HiCapR, a psoralen crosslinking-based RNA proximity ligation method coupled with post-library hybridization, enabling high-resolution mapping of RNA-RNA interactions across the HIV-1 genome. This approach confirmed canonical structural motifs, including stem-loop architectures in the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) and Rev Response Element (RRE), as well as dimerization sites within the 5’-UTR critical for viral packaging. Notably, HiCapR identified novel homodimerization events distributed along the genome, suggesting an expanded regulatory role of RNA multimerization in splicing regulation and selective encapsidation. Intriguingly, while infected cells exhibited extensive long-range RNA interactions—particularly within the 5’-UTR—virion-packaged genomes displayed a marked reduction in such interactions, indicative of a structural transition from a loosely organized state to a condensed conformation. This spatial reorganization coincided with the preservation of stable genomic domains essential for dimerization, which persisted throughout virion assembly. These domains, enriched at homodimer interfaces, likely serve as structural scaffolds ensuring fidelity during genome packaging. This work establishes HiCapR as a robust tool for probing RNA interactomes and provides mechanistic insights into how HIV-1 exploits RNA topological heterogeneity to regulate its life cycle. The identification of conserved structural domains and transient interaction networks opens avenues for targeting RNA conformation in antiviral strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93191">Evidence from pupillometry, fMRI, and RNN modelling shows that gain neuromodulation mediates task-relevant perceptual switches</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual updating has been hypothesised to rely on a network reset modulated by bursts of ascending neuromodulatory neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline, abruptly altering the brain’s susceptibility to changing sensory activity. To test this hypothesis at a large-scale, we analysed an ambiguous figures task using pupillometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behaviourally, qualitative shifts in the perceptual interpretation of an ambiguous image were associated with peaks in pupil diameter, an indirect readout of phasic bursts in neuromodulatory tone. We further hypothesised that stimulus ambiguity drives neuromodulatory tone, leading to heightened neural gain, hastening perceptual switches. To explore this hypothesis computationally, we trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) on an analogous perceptual categorisation task, allowing gain to change dynamically with classification uncertainty. As predicted, higher gain accelerated perceptual switching by transiently destabilising the network’s dynamical regime in periods of maximal uncertainty. We leveraged a low-dimensional readout of the RNN dynamics to develop two novel macroscale predictions: perceptual switches should occur with peaks in low-dimensional brain state velocity and with a flattened egocentric energy landscape. Using fMRI, we confirmed these predictions, highlighting the role of the neuromodulatory system in the large-scale network reconfigurations mediating adaptive perceptual updates.

                Background This study examined the effect of thermocycling on the flexural strength properties of four CAD/CAM ceramic materials at different thicknesses. Methods Four CAD/CAM ceramics of different types: advanced lithium disilicate (ALD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) lithium disilicate (LD), and leucite reinforced (LE), and at three varying thicknesses 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were examined. After subjecting all specimens to 5000 thermomechanical cycles, flexural strength was determined using a universal testing apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for analysis. Two factorial ANOVA models assessed the association of different factors (ceramic type and thickness) with flexural strength and elastic modulus. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted means were computed. A p-value < 0.05 was designated significant. Results ZLS exhibited the highest flexural strength at 1.5 mm thickness, while LD showed the highest Young’s modulus of elasticity. The lowest flexural strength was observed in the 0.5 mm thickness group of all tested groups. There were notable variations in flexural strength across all ceramic materials, with the highest adjusted mean strength in the ZLS group, ALD, LD, and LE, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were noted in ceramic thickness, with 1.5 mm thickness showing the highest strength and 0.5 mm thickness the lowest. Conclusions Ceramic material thickness significantly impacts flexural strength, with 1.5 mm thickness deemed suitable for posterior restorations. Ceramic materials with zirconia fillers or matrix demonstrated higher flexural strength than other ceramics.

                Abstract: Fetal transverse lie with neglected shoulder presentation is a rare but extremely risky complication in labor. It could severely compromise maternal and fetal outcome. Herein, we report the case of a 32-year-old multiparous patient, consulting in labor with a fetal hand prolapsed through the vaginal opening and a transverse presentation that was not known previously. An emergency cesarean section was performed. It allowed the extraction of a living, healthy newborn without further complications. This case report emphasizes the importance of prenatal follow-up, in particular, the screening of abnormal fetal positioning in term pregnancy. It also highlights that a prompt and swift transfer to a well-equipped medical facility is imperative for optimal maternal and fetal management and to ensure a positive outcome.

                Introduction Sexual dysfunctions are common yet underreported side effects of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, affecting 30-80% of treated individuals. These side effects can severely impact social interactions and treatment adherence for individuals with schizophrenia, but comprehensive comparative evidence assessing the risk profiles of different antipsychotics is lacking. This study aims to address this gap using network meta-analysis that integrates data from both randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS). Protocol This systematic review will include both RCTs and NRS focusing on participants with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses, without restrictions on symptoms, gender, ethnicity, age, or setting. For interventions, all second-generation antipsychotics will be included. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of at least one sexual adverse event of any kind. Secondary outcomes will be the occurrence of any sexual adverse event evaluated in men and women separately, and any adverse event related to the three phases of sexual response cycle separately: desire (e.g. libido, sexual thoughts), arousal (e.g. erection, lubrication) and orgasm (e.g. ejaculation, anorgasmia), and any adverse effect related to breast dysfunction and menstruation irregularities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 1 and ROBINS-I will be employed to evaluate the risk of bias for RCTs and NRS, respectively. Single-arm meta-analysis of proportions will synthesize the average frequency of sexual adverse events in treated participants. Pairwise and network meta-analysis of RCTs and NRS will be used to evaluate comparative tolerability. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will explore possible heterogeneity in results and validate the findings’ robustness. The quality of the evidence will be evaluated using GRADE. Discussion This study will provide vital insights into the sexual side effects of antipsychotics by combining evidence from clinical trials and real-world practice, facilitating better decision-making in choosing the optimal antipsychotic for individuals.

                Background Industrial wastewater significantly affects the microbiome and resistome of aquatic ecosystems, posing environmental and public health risks through the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Methods This study systematically reviewed the influence of industrial effluents on microbial community structure and ARG prevalence in receiving water bodies. Results Our findings revealed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominate polluted environments, with beta-lactamases, macrolides, and sulfonamide resistance genes that are frequently detected. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including integrons and plasmids, are critical drivers of ARG horizontal gene transfer. The limited efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in removing ARGs highlights the urgent need for advanced treatment technologies. Comparisons with the existing literature reinforce the role of industrial activities in exacerbating ARG risks and disrupting microbial diversity. Mitigation strategies including stringent regulatory frameworks, advanced filtration methods, and a one-health approach are recommended to address these challenges. Conclusion This study emphasizes the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration and targeted interventions to safeguard environmental and public health from the impacts of industrial wastewater pollution.

[version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent condition. Recent research highlights the role of kinetic chain and core muscle involvement in disease progression, yet evidence for structured core activation protocols such as CARE-KOA© remains limited.This study addresses this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of CARE-KOA©, which specifically targets proximal stability and biomechanical deficits in KOA, aiming to enhance pain, function, and core endurance beyond conventional approaches. Methods This prospective single-group pre-post study assessed the effect of a Participants underwent a 4-week CARE-KOA© regimen (12 supervised sessions, each including a 10-minute warm-up and core-focused exercises). Pre- and post-intervention assessments included pain (Visual Analog Scale, VAS), patient-reported outcomes (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS), physical function tests (30-second sit-to-stand, 40-meter fast-paced walk, stair climb, timed up-and-go), and knee muscle strength and core endurance. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests in JAMOVI. Results Significant improvements were observed in pain at rest (mean change: 1.13 cm, p = 0.0006, d = 1.07) and during activity (mean change: 2.46 cm, p = 0.000001, d = 1.76), patient-reported outcomes (KOOS Pain: p = 0.00003, d = -0.83; KOOS ADL: p = 0.0000009, d = -1.19), and core endurance (p = 0.027, d = 0.21). Physical function tests also improved (stair climb: p = 0.031, d = 0.34; timed up-and-go: p = 0.006, d = 0.13). Muscle strength gains were significant in flexors of the unaffected knee and extensors of the affected knee (p < 0.05), while other muscle groups showed no significant change. Conclusion The CARE-KOA© program led to clinically meaningful improvements in pain, function, and core endurance, highlighting the value of core activation strategies in KOA management. Future research with larger samples and longer follow-up is warranted to confirm these benefits and optimize exercise protocols.

                Background Anorectal hemorrhoids are a common condition that frequently needs surgery in more challenging situations. Both stapled hemorrhoidectomy and conventional hemorrhoidectomy are standard surgical procedures, each one with various advantages and disadvantages as well. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of these two operations concerning patient satisfaction, complications, recovery time and postoperative pain. Method This retrospective cohort analysis was conducted in Karbala, Iraq, at AL-Kafeel Hospital and AL-Safeer Hospital. Information has been collected from patients who had stapled hemorrhoidectomy in 2023–2024 and those who had conventional hemorrhoidectomy from 2015–2018. To account for baseline variations, especially those related to the kind of anesthetic and extent of hemorrhoids, propensity score matching (caliper = 0.05) was employed. SPSS version 29.0 was used for statistical analysis, and comparisons were made by using t-tests, chi-square tests, and correlation analyses. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value of less than 0.05. Results Out of 114 patients (50 conventional, 64 stapled), the stapled group had a higher percentage of fourth-degree hemorrhoids, postoperative pain and bleeding were significantly lower in the stapled group (p < 0.001), and only the conventional group had wound infections and anal stenosis (p < 0.05). The stapled group also showed better postoperative outcomes. Conclusion Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is linked to less pain, fewer complications, and faster recovery than conventional hemorrhoidectomy, but the risk of recurrent hemorrhoidectomy is still a concern. These findings support that surgical decision-making in hemorrhoid management can be optimized.

                Objectives This study aimed to examine health security (HeS) patterns across European Union (EU) member states to address intra-regional disparities in health security, align with EU-wide policy objectives, and propose evidence-based recommendations for harmonizing preparedness measures while respecting national sovereignty Methods This research employed a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making framework, combining the Entropy Weight Method and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo), to assess and rank EU countries, drawing on six Global Health Security Index indicators. K-means clustering classified countries into three performance tiers: High, Intermediate, and Dangerous. Data from the GHSI (2019, 2021) and the aggregated 2017–2021 period were analyzed to track temporal trends and cross-regional performance disparities. A comparative analysis of HeS priorities with the African and Eastern Mediterranean (EMR) Regions further contextualized the EU's HeS landscape. Results Detection and Reporting, and Rapid Response emerged as the most critical dimensions influencing performance, while Risk Environment and Compliance with Norms showed minimal differentiation. High-performing countries, such as Finland and Germany, demonstrated resilience in surveillance and rapid response, while lower-tier nations, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, and Romania, exhibited systemic vulnerabilities in biosecurity and emergency planning. Post-2019, health system resilience gained prominence, while compliance and risk environment remained neglected. The temporal analysis highlighted post-pandemic shifts in health system disparities. Cross-regional comparisons underscoring context-specific challenges. Conclusion This study highlights the need for targeted investments in surveillance systems, laboratory infrastructure, and crisis preparedness to address specific gaps in different clusters. A metrics-driven framework can reduce regional disparities, promoting equity in preparedness. Policymakers should adopt a collaborative approach to mitigate crises, using high-performing clusters as benchmarks.

                In the anterior area of the mouth, the interdental papilla is important for dental hygiene and appearance. When it disappears, unpleasant “black triangles” form, which affects patients’ self-confidence in their smiles and makes oral hygiene more difficult. The loss of interdental papilla is caused by several variables such as tooth shape, periodontal disease, and aging. Although surgical treatments have been utilized to restore or retain missing papilla, their predictability remains unknown. In response, researchers have investigated non-invasive procedures, such as the use of fillers such as hyaluronic acid (HA). Owing to its capacity to increase tissue volume and bind water, HA, a naturally occurring polysaccharide with special rheological qualities, has become a popular choice for use as a dermal filler. It shows promise when used to cure interdental papilla loss; the effects usually last for six–12 months. This review article explores the development and history of papilla rebuilding methods, emphasizing hyaluronic acid as a cutting-edge and successful method for regaining both periodontal health and aesthetics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-332/v2?src=rss">Are Narrative CVs contributing towards shifting research culture? Workshop Report from the 2023 Recognition and Rewards Festival [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Over the past decade, calls for research assessment reform have grown, led by initiatives such as the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the Leiden Manifesto, and, more recently, the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA). A key element being discussed as part of research assessment reform is a shift towards more qualitative assessments, focussed on the content of research and the broad skills and competencies of researchers, and the array of contributions they make to knowledge creation and innovation. Narrative CV formats have emerged as a good practice example for enabling qualitative assessments of research projects and researchers, and are becoming more widely piloted and implemented. Methods As part of the 2023 Dutch Recognition and Rewards Festival, the authors hosted a workshop to gather perspectives on Narrative CVs, including whether and how they may contribute to shifts in research culture that are needed to support research assessment reform. Results Participants, representing research organisations and the research community, discussed both beneficial and critical aspects of narrative-style CV implementations from their experiences. The effects observed since narrative CVs have been implemented were discussed, with perspectives provided on career prospects and the empowerment of the research community to direct change. Finally, the discussion turned to expectations for the future, with workshop participants calling for focus on the roles that narrative-style CVs can play in improving research careers, recognition of collaborative work, and equality, diversity, and inclusion. A short informal survey exploring levels of implementation of narrative CVs across different research organisations was run prior to the workshop, the results of which are also presented as part of this report. Discussion The authors intend to expand this discussion to other scientific and policy conferences, and this report serves as a basis for a wider and deeper dialogue in the community.

                Science is justly admired as a cumulative process (“standing on the shoulders of giants”), yet scientific knowledge is typically built on a patchwork of research contributions without much coordination. This lack of efficiency has specifically been addressed in clinical research by recommendations against avoidable research waste and for living systematic reviews and prospective meta-analysis. We propose to further those recommendations with ALL-IN meta-analysis: Anytime Live and Leading INterim meta-analysis. ALL-IN provides meta-analysis based on e-values and anytime-valid confidence intervals that can be updated at any time—reanalyzing after each new observation while retaining type-I error and coverage guarantees, live—no need to prespecify the looks, and leading—in the decisions on whether individual studies should be initiated, stopped or expanded, the meta-analysis can be the leading source of information without losing validity to accumulation bias. The analysis design requires no information about the trial sample sizes or the number of trials eventually included. So ALL-IN meta-analysis can be applied retrospectively as well as prospectively, to evaluate the evidence once or sequentially. Because the intention of the analysis does not change the validity of the results, the results of the analysis can change the intentions (‘optional stopping’ and ‘optional continuation’ based on the results so far). On the one hand: any analysis can be turned into a living one, or even become prospective and real-time by updating with new trial data and including interim data from trials that are still ongoing — without any changes in the cut-offs for testing or the method for interval estimation. On the other hand: no stopping rule needs to be enforced for the analysis to remain valid, so participating in a prospective meta-analysis does not require outside control over data collection. Hence ALL-IN meta-analysis breathes life into living systematic reviews, and offers better and simpler statistics, efficiency, collaboration and communication.

                <p>by Yan Miao, Xuan Tang, Chunyu Wang, Zhenyuan Sun, Guohua Wang, Shan Huang</p>

Circular RNA, a class of RNA molecules gaining widespread attentions, has been widely recognized as a potential biomarker for many diseases. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of the associations between circRNA and diseases. However, traditional experimental methods are often inefficient and costly, making computational models an effective alternative. Nevertheless, existing computational methods still face challenges such as data sparsity and the difficulty of confirming negative samples, which limits the accuracy of predictions. To address these challenges, a novel computational method, namely MVHGCN, is proposed based on multi-view and graph convolutional networks to predict potential associations between circRNA and diseases. MVHGCN first constructs a heterogeneous graph and generates feature descriptors by integrating multiple databases. Then it extracts different connection views of circRNA and diseases through meta-paths, maximizing the utilization of known association information, and aggregates deep feature information through graph convolutional networks. Finally, a MLP is used to predict the association scores. The experimental results show that MVHGCN significantly outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets by 5-fold cross-validation. This research provides an effective new approach to studying the associations between circRNAs and diseases, capable of alleviating the problem of data sparsity and accurately identifying potential associations.

                <p>by Nicholas A. Rondoni, Fan Lu, Daniel B. Turner-Evans, Marcella Gomez</p>

Calcium imaging techniques, such as two-photon imaging, have become a powerful tool to explore the functions of neurons and the connectivity of their circuitry. Frequently, fluorescent calcium indicators are taken as a direct measure of neuronal activity. These indicators, however, are slow relative to behavior, obscuring functional relationships between an animal’s movements and the true neuronal activity. As a consequence, the firing rate of a neuron is a more meaningful metric. Converting calcium imaging data to the firing of a neuron is nontrivial. Most state-of-the-art methods depend largely on non-mechanistic modeling frameworks such as neural networks, which do not illuminate the underlying chemical exchanges within the neuron, require significant data to be trained on, and cannot be implemented in real-time. Leveraging modeling frameworks from chemical reaction networks (CRN) coupled with a control theoretic approach, a new algorithm is presented leveraging a fully deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. This framework utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to challenge state-of-the-art correlation scores while retaining interpretability. Furthermore, these computations can be done in real time, thus, enabling online experimentation informed by neuronal firing rates. To demonstrate the use cases of this architecture, it is tested on ground truth datasets courtesy of the <i>spikefinder</i> challenge. Finally, we propose potential applications of the model for guiding experimental design.

<br/>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, yet it often remains opaque to clinicians, scientists, and patients alike. This review, part 1 of a 3-part series, provides neurologists and neuroscientists with a foundational understanding of AI's key concepts, terminology, and applications. We begin by tracing AI's origins in mathematics, human logic, and brain-inspired neural networks to establish a context for its development. The review highlights AI's growing role in neurological diagnostics and treatment, emphasizing machine learning applications, such as computer vision, brain-machine interfaces, and precision care. By mapping the evolution of AI tools and linking them to neuroscience and human reasoning, we illustrate how AI is reshaping neurological practice and research. We end the review with an overview of model selection in AI and a case scenario illustrating how AI may drive precision neurological care. Part 1 sets the stage for part 2, which will focus on practical applications of AI in real-world scenarios where humans and AI collaborate as joint cognitive systems. Part 3 will examine AI's integration with extensive healthcare and neurology networks, innovative clinical trials, and massive datasets, expanding our vision of AI's global impact on neurology, healthcare systems, and society.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion (LVO) often require transfer from primary stroke centers (PSCs) to thrombectomy-capable centers. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) initiated before inter-hospital transfer.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 2 prospective cohorts of patients with anterior circulation LVO transferred for thrombectomy from a PSC, regardless of whether thrombectomy was eventually attempted at the endovascular-capable center, were analyzed. Efficacy outcomes included good 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] = 0–2), excellent functional outcome (mRS = 0–1), and arterial recanalization during transfer. Safety outcomes included any intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and symptomatic ICH (sICH) at 24 hours. Propensity score with overlap weighting balanced the covariates between patients treated with IVT versus those without.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 521 patients, 260 (50%) received IVT before transfer. IVT was withheld mainly due to being outside the 4.5-hour window (58%) or anticoagulant use (21%). Median age was 72 years, 55% were men, and median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 15. After propensity score with overlap weighting, patients receiving IVT more frequently had good functional outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.43–3.30, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), excellent functional outcome (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.21–3.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and inter-facility recanalization (OR = 5.64, 95% CI = 2.92–10.89, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) compared with patients not treated with IVT. Any ICH (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.76–1.70) and sICH (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.36–1.51) rates were similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IVT before transfer was associated with improved recanalization and functional outcomes without increasing safety risks but is used in only 50% of patients. Expanding IVT criteria, including treatment beyond 4.5 hours and in anticoagulated patients, should be explored. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Schneiderova et al. demonstrate an association between EBV reactivation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and host interleukin 1 genetics in individuals with long COVID. Anti-VCA IgA serum levels, a strong marker of recent EBV reactivation, are associated with a high latent EBV load in blood and objective long-term pulmonary dysfunction in long COVID.

                Ravera et al. show that mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccination elicits robust immune responses in immune checkpoint inhibitor recipients but not rituximab-treated patients, who exhibit impaired interferon and humoral responses compared to cancer-free volunteers, as revealed by integrated transcriptomic, serological, and interferon-γ release assays.
