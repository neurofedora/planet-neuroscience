                For over a century, stability of spatial context across related episodes has been considered a source of memory interference, impairing memory retrieval. However, contemporary memory integration theory generates a diametrically opposite prediction. Here, we aimed to resolve this discrepancy by manipulating local context similarity across temporally disparate but related episodes...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are a commonly used tool in neuroscience to efficiently label, trace, and/or manipulate neuronal populations. Highly specific targeting can be achieved through recombinase-dependent AAVs in combination with transgenic rodent lines that express Cre-recombinase in specific cell types. Visualization of viral expression is typically achieved through fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g., GFP or mCherry) packaged within the AAV genome. Although nonamplified fluorescence is usually sufficient to observe viral expression, immunohistochemical amplification of the fluorescent reporter is routinely used to improve viral visualization. In the present study, Cre-dependent AAVs were injected into the neocortex of wild-type C57BL/6J mice. While we observed weak but consistent nonamplified off-target double inverted open reading frame (DIO) expression in C57BL/6J mice, antibody amplification of the GFP or mCherry reporter revealed notable Cre-independent viral expression. Off-target expression of DIO constructs in wild-type C57BL/6J mice occurred independent of vendor, AAV serotype, or promoter. We also evaluated whether Cre-independent expression had functional effects via designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADD agonist C21 (compound 21) had no effect on contextual fear conditioning or c-Fos expression in DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells of C57BL/6J mice. Together, our results indicate that DIO constructs have off-target expression in wild-type subjects. Our findings are particularly important for the design of experiments featuring sensitive systems and/or quantitative measurements that could be negatively impacted by off-target expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deletion of Stim1 in Hypothalamic Arcuate Nucleus Kiss1 Neurons Potentiates Synchronous GCaMP Activity and Protects against Diet-Induced Obesity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are essential for reproduction, but their role in the control of energy balance and other homeostatic functions remains unclear. High-frequency firing of hypothalamic arcuate Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons releases kisspeptin into the median eminence, and neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin onto neighboring Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to generate a slow EPSP mediated by TRPC5 channels that entrains intermittent, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. High-frequency optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also releases glutamate to excite the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and inhibit the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons via metabotropic glutamate receptors. At the molecular level, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is critically involved in the regulation of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and neuronal excitability through its interaction with plasma membrane (PM) calcium (e.g., TRPC) channels. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons would increase neuronal excitability and their synchronous firing, which ultimately would affect energy homeostasis. Using optogenetics in combination with whole-cell recording and GCaMP6 imaging in slices, we discovered that deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1 neurons significantly increased the amplitude and duration of the slow EPSP and augmented synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i oscillations in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons amplified the actions of NKB and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD). Therefore, STIM1 appears to play a critical role in regulating synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, which ultimately affects the coordination between energy homeostasis and reproduction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are essential for stimulating the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and maintaining fertility. However, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons appear to be a key player in coordinating energy balance with reproduction. The regulation of calcium channels and hence calcium signaling is critically dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) calcium channels. We have conditionally deleted <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and found that it significantly increased the excitability of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tonic GABAA Receptor-Mediated Currents of Human Cortical GABAergic Interneurons Vary Amongst Cell Types</a></h4>

              
                <p>Persistent anion conductances through GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are important modulators of neuronal excitability. However, it is currently unknown how the amplitudes of these currents vary among different cell types in the human neocortex, particularly among diverse GABAergic interneurons. We have recorded 101 interneurons in and near layer 1 from cortical tissue surgically resected from both male and female patients, visualized 84 of them and measured tonic GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R currents in 48 cells with an intracellular [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>] of 65 m<scp>m</scp> and in the presence of 5 &mu;<scp>m</scp> GABA. We compare these tonic currents among five groups of interneurons divided by firing properties and four types of interneuron defined by axonal distributions; rosehip, neurogliaform, stalked-bouton, layer 2&ndash;3 innervating and a pool of other cells. Interestingly, the rosehip cell, a type of interneuron only described thus far in human tissue, and layer 2&ndash;3 innervating cells exhibit larger tonic currents than other layer 1 interneurons, such as neurogliaform and stalked-bouton cells; the latter two groups showing no difference. The positive allosteric modulators of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs allopregnanolone and DS2 also induced larger current shifts in the rosehip and layer 2&ndash;3 innervating cells, consistent with higher expression of the  subunit of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R in these neurons. We have also examined how patient parameters, such as age, seizures, type of cancer and anticonvulsant treatment may alter tonic inhibitory currents in human neurons. The cell type-specific differences in tonic inhibitory currents could potentially be used to selectively modulate cortical circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tonic currents through GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are a potential therapeutic target for a number of neurologic and psychiatric conditions. Here, we show that these currents in human cerebral cortical GABAergic neurons display cell type-specific differences in their amplitudes which implies differential modulation of their excitability. Additionally, we examine whether the amplitudes of the tonic currents measured in our study show any differences between patient populations, finding some evidence that age, seizures, type of cancer, and anticonvulsant treatment may alter tonic inhibition in human tissue. These results advance our understanding of how pathology affects neuronal excitability and could potentially be used to selectively modulate cortical circuitry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Extent of Task Specificity for Visual and Tactile Sequences in the Auditory Cortex of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing</a></h4>

              
                <p>It has been proposed that the auditory cortex in the deaf humans might undergo task-specific reorganization. However, evidence remains scarce as previous experiments used only two very specific tasks (temporal processing and face perception) in visual modality. Here, congenitally deaf/hard of hearing and hearing women and men were enrolled in an fMRI experiment as we sought to fill this evidence gap in two ways. First, we compared activation evoked by a temporal processing task performed in two different modalities, visual and tactile. Second, we contrasted this task with a perceptually similar task that focuses on the spatial dimension. Additional control conditions consisted of passive stimulus observation. In line with the task specificity hypothesis, the auditory cortex in the deaf was activated by temporal processing in both visual and tactile modalities. This effect was selective for temporal processing relative to spatial discrimination. However, spatial processing also led to significant auditory cortex recruitment which, unlike temporal processing, occurred even during passive stimulus observation. We conclude that auditory cortex recruitment in the deaf and hard of hearing might involve interplay between task-selective and pluripotential mechanisms of cross-modal reorganization. Our results open several avenues for the investigation of the full complexity of the cross-modal plasticity phenomenon.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies suggested that the auditory cortex in the deaf may change input modality (sound to vision) while keeping its function (e.g., rhythm processing). We investigated this hypothesis by asking deaf or hard of hearing and hearing adults to discriminate between temporally and spatially complex sequences in visual and tactile modalities. The results show that such function-specific brain reorganization, as has previously been demonstrated in the visual modality, also occurs for tactile processing. On the other hand, they also show that for some stimuli (spatial) the auditory cortex activates automatically, which is suggestive of a take-over by a different kind of cognitive function. The observed differences in processing of sequences might thus result from an interplay of task-specific and pluripotent plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Sexually Dimorphic Olfactory Neuron Mediates Fixed Action Transition during Courtship Ritual in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals perform a series of actions in a fixed order during ritualistic innate behaviors. Although command neurons and sensory pathways responding to external stimuli that trigger these behaviors have been identified, how each action is induced in a fixed order in response to multimodal sensory stimuli remains unclear. Here, the sexually dimorphic lateral antennal lobe tract projection neuron 4 (lPN4) in male <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> mediates the expression of a fixed behavioral action pattern at the beginning of the courtship ritual, in which a male taps a female body and then extends a wing unilaterally to produce a courtship song. We found that blocking the synaptic output of lPN4 caused an increase in the ratio of male flies that extended a wing unilaterally without tapping the female body, whereas excitation of lPN4 suppressed the transition from the tapping phase to the unilateral wing extension phase. Real-time calcium imaging showed that lPN4 is activated by a volatile pheromone, palmitoleic acid, whose responses were inhibited by simultaneous gustatory stimulation with female cuticular hydrocarbons, showing the existence of an "AND-gate" for multimodal sensory inputs during male courtship behaviors. These results suggest that the function of lPN4 is to suppress unilateral wing extension while responding to a female smell, which is released by appropriate contact chemosensory inputs received when tapping a female. As the female smell also promotes male courtship behaviors, the olfactory system is ready to simultaneously promote and suppress the progress of courtship actions while responding to a female smell.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although it has been 80 years since Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen introduced how multiple acts comprising separate innate behaviors are released in a fixed order according to external stimuli, the neural circuits responsible for such fixed action patterns remain largely unknown. The male courtship behavior of <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> is a good model to investigate how such a fixed behavioral sequence is determined in the brain. Here, we show that lateral antennal lobe tract projection neuron 4 (lPN4) in <I>D. melanogaster</I> functions as an "AND-gate" for volatile and contact chemosensory inputs, mediating the expression of tapping behaviors before unilateral wing extension during male courtship rituals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perigenual and Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Afferents Converge on Common Pyramidal Cells in Amygdala Subregions of the Macaque</a></h4>

              
                <p>The subgenual (sgACC) and perigenual (pgACC) anterior cingulate are important afferents of the amygdala, with different cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and function. The sgACC is associated with arousal mechanisms linked to salient cues, whereas the pgACC is engaged in conflict decision-making, including in social contexts. After placing same-size, small volume tracer injections into sgACC and pgACC of the same hemisphere in male macaques, we examined anterogradely labeled fiber distribution to understand how these different functional systems communicate in the main amygdala nuclei at both mesocopic and cellular levels. The sgACC has broad-based termination patterns. In contrast, the pgACC has a more restricted pattern, which was always nested in sgACC terminals. Terminal overlap occurred in subregions of the accessory basal and basal nuclei, which we termed "hotspots." In triple-labeling confocal studies, the majority of randomly selected CaMKII&alpha;-positive cells (putative amygdala glutamatergic neurons) in hotspots received dual contacts from the sgACC and pgACC. The ratio of dual contacts occurred over a surprisingly narrow range, suggesting a consistent, tight balance of afferent contacts on postsynaptic neurons. Large boutons, which are associated with greater synaptic strength, were ~3 times more frequent on sgACC versus pgACC axon terminals in hotspots, consistent with a fast "driver" function. Together, the results reveal a nested interaction in which pgACC ("conflict/social monitoring") terminals converge with the broader sgACC ("salience") terminals at both the mesoscopic and cellular level. The presynaptic organization in hotspots suggests that shifts in arousal states can rapidly and flexibly influence decision-making functions in the amygdala.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subgenual (sgACC) and perigenual cingulate (pgACC) have distinct structural and functional characteristics and are important afferent modulators of the amygdala. The sgACC is critical for arousal, whereas the pgACC mediates conflict-monitoring, including in social contexts. Using dual tracer injections in the same monkey, we found that sgACC inputs broadly project in the main amygdala nuclei, whereas pgACC inputs were more restricted and nested in zones containing sgACC terminals (hotspots). The majority of CaMKII&alpha; + (excitatory) amygdala neurons in hotspots received converging contacts, which were tightly balanced. pgACC and sgACC afferent streams are therefore highly interdependent in these specific amygdala subregions, permitting "internal arousal" states to rapidly shape responses of amygdala neurons involved in conflict and social monitoring networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Global Configuration of Visual Stimuli Alters Co-Fluctuations of Cross-Hemispheric Human Brain Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>We tested how a stimulus gestalt, defined by the neuronal interaction between local and global features of a stimulus, is represented within human primary visual cortex (V1). We used high-resolution fMRI, which serves as a surrogate of neuronal activation, to measure co-fluctuations within subregions of V1 as (male and female) subjects were presented with peripheral stimuli, each with different global configurations. We found stronger cross-hemisphere correlations when fine-scale V1 cortical subregions represented parts of the same object compared with different objects. This result was consistent with the vertical bias in global processing and, critically, was independent of the task and local discontinuities within objects. Thus, despite the relatively small receptive fields of neurons within V1, global stimulus configuration affects neuronal processing via correlated fluctuations between regions that represent different sectors of the visual field.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We provide the first evidence for the impact of global stimulus configuration on cross-hemispheric fMRI fluctuations, measured in human primary visual cortex. Our results are consistent with changes in the level of -band synchrony, which has been shown to be affected by global stimulus configuration, being reflected in the level fMRI co-fluctuations. These data help narrow the gap between knowledge of global stimulus configuration encoding at the single-neuron level versus at the behavioral level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distal CA1 Maintains a More Coherent Spatial Representation than Proximal CA1 When Local and Global Cues Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>Entorhinal cortical projections show segregation along the transverse axis of CA1, with the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) sending denser projections to proximal CA1 (pCA1) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) sending denser projections to distal CA1 (dCA1). Previous studies have reported functional segregation along the transverse axis of CA1 correlated with the functional differences in MEC and LEC. pCA1 shows higher spatial selectivity than dCA1 in these studies. We employ a double rotation protocol, which creates an explicit conflict between the local and the global cues, to understand the differential contributions of these reference frames to the spatial code in pCA1 and dCA1 in male Long&ndash;Evans rats. We show that pCA1 and dCA1 respond differently to this local-global cue conflict. pCA1 representation splits as predicted from the strong conflicting inputs it receives from MEC and dCA3. In contrast, dCA1 rotates more in concert with the global cues. In addition, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable levels of spatial selectivity in this study. This finding differs from the previous studies, perhaps because of richer sensory information available in our behavior arena. Together, these observations indicate that the functional segregation along proximodistal axis of CA1 is not of the amount of spatial selectivity but that of the nature of the different inputs used to create and anchor spatial representations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Subregions of the hippocampus are thought to play different roles in spatial navigation and episodic memory. It was previously thought that the distal part of area CA1 of the hippocampus carries lesser information about space than proximal CA1 (pCA1). We report that distal CA1 (dCA1) spatial representation moves more in concert with the global cues than pCA1 when the local and the global cues conflict. We also show that spatial selectivity is comparable along the proximodistal axis in this experimental protocol. Thus, different parts of the brain receiving differential outputs from pCA1 and dCA1 receive spatial information in different spatial reference frames encoded using different sets of inputs, rather than different amounts of spatial information as thought earlier.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">MIF versus SIF Motoneurons, What Are Their Respective Contribution in the Oculomotor Medial Rectus Pool?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multiply-innervated muscle fibers (MIFs) are peculiar to the extraocular muscles as they are non-twitch but produce a slow build up in tension on repetitive stimulation. The motoneurons innervating MIFs establish en grappe terminals along the entire length of the fiber, instead of the typical en plaque terminals that singly-innervated muscle fibers (SIFs) motoneurons establish around the muscle belly. MIF motoneurons have been proposed to participate only in gaze holding and slow eye movements. We aimed to discern the function of MIF motoneurons by recording medial rectus motoneurons of the oculomotor nucleus. Single-unit recordings in awake cats demonstrated that electrophysiologically-identified medial rectus MIF motoneurons participated in different types of eye movements, including fixations, rapid eye movements or saccades, convergences, and the slow and fast phases of the vestibulo-ocular nystagmus, the same as SIF motoneurons did. However, MIF medial rectus motoneurons presented lower firing frequencies, were recruited earlier and showed lower eye position (EP) and eye velocity (EV) sensitivities than SIF motoneurons. MIF medial rectus motoneurons were also smaller, had longer antidromic latencies and a lower synaptic coverage than SIF motoneurons. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) revealed that electrical stimulation to the myotendinous junction, where palisade endings are located, did not recurrently affect the firing probability of medial rectus motoneurons. Therefore, we conclude there is no division of labor between MIF and SIF motoneurons based on the type of eye movement they subserve.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In addition to the common singly-innervated muscle fiber (SIF), extraocular muscles also contain multiply-innervated muscle fibers (MIFs), which are non-twitch and slow in contraction. MIF motoneurons have been proposed to participate only in gaze holding and slow eye movements. In the present work, by single-unit extracellular recordings in awake cats, we demonstrate, however, that both SIF and MIF motoneurons, electrophysiologically-identified, participate in the different types of eye movements. However, MIF motoneurons showed lower firing rates (FRs), recruitment thresholds, and eye-related sensitivities, and could thus contribute to the fine adjustment of eye movements. Electrical stimulation of the myotendinous junction activates antidromically MIF motoneurons but neither MIF nor SIF motoneurons receive a synaptic reafferentation that modifies their discharge probability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brainstem Mechanisms of Pain Modulation: A within-Subjects 7T fMRI Study of Placebo Analgesic and Nocebo Hyperalgesic Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain perception can be powerfully influenced by an individual's expectations and beliefs. Although the cortical circuitry responsible for pain modulation has been thoroughly investigated, the brainstem pathways involved in the modulatory phenomena of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia remain to be directly addressed. This study used ultra-high-field 7 tesla functional MRI (fMRI) to accurately resolve differences in brainstem circuitry present during the generation of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia in healthy human participants (<I>N</I> = 25, 12 male). Over 2 successive days, through blinded application of altered thermal stimuli, participants were deceptively conditioned to believe that two inert creams labeled lidocaine (placebo) and capsaicin (nocebo) were acting to modulate their pain relative to a third Vaseline (control) cream. In a subsequent test phase, fMRI image sets were collected while participants were given identical noxious stimuli to all three cream sites. Pain intensity ratings were collected and placebo and nocebo responses determined. Brainstem-specific fMRI analysis revealed altered activity in key pain modulatory nuclei, including a disparate recruitment of the periaqueductal gray (PAG)&ndash;rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) pathway when both greater placebo and nocebo effects were observed. Additionally, we found that placebo and nocebo responses differentially activated the parabrachial nucleus but overlapped in engagement of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. These data reveal that placebo and nocebo effects are generated through differential engagement of the PAG&ndash;RVM pathway, which in concert with other brainstem sites likely influences the experience of pain by modulating activity at the level of the dorsal horn.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms would support development of effective clinical treatment strategies for both acute and chronic pain. Specific brainstem nuclei have long been known to play a central role in nociceptive modulation; however, because of the small size and complex organization of the nuclei, previous neuroimaging efforts have been limited in directly identifying how these subcortical networks interact during the development of antinociceptive and pro-nociceptive effects. We used ultra-high-field fMRI to resolve brainstem structures and measure signal change during placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. We define overlapping and disparate brainstem circuitry responsible for altering pain perception. These findings extend our understanding of the detailed organization and function of discrete brainstem nuclei involved in pain processing and modulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatially Adjacent Regions in Posterior Cingulate Cortex Represent Familiar Faces at Different Levels of Complexity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Extensive research has shown that perceptual information of faces is processed in a network of hierarchically-organized areas within ventral temporal cortex. For familiar and famous faces, perceptual processing of faces is normally accompanied by extraction of semantic knowledge about the social status of persons. Semantic processing of familiar faces could entail progressive stages of information abstraction. However, the cortical mechanisms supporting multistage processing of familiar faces have not been characterized. Here, using an event-related fMRI experiment, familiar faces from four celebrity groups (actors, singers, politicians, and football players) and unfamiliar faces were presented to the human subjects (both males and females) while they were engaged in a face categorization task. We systematically explored the cortical representations for faces, familiar faces, subcategories of familiar faces, and familiar face identities using whole-brain univariate analysis, searchlight-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and functional connectivity analysis. Convergent evidence from all these analyses revealed a set of overlapping regions within posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) that contained decodable fMRI responses for representing different levels of semantic knowledge about familiar faces. Our results suggest a multistage pathway in PCC for processing semantic information of faces, analogous to the multistage pathway in ventral temporal cortex for processing perceptual information of faces.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recognizing familiar faces is an important component of social communications. Previous research has shown that a distributed network of brain areas is involved in processing the semantic information of familiar faces. However, it is not clear how different levels of semantic information are represented in the brain. Here, we evaluated the multivariate response patterns across the entire cortex to discover the areas that contain information for familiar faces, subcategories of familiar faces, and identities of familiar faces. The searchlight maps revealed that different levels of semantic information are represented in topographically adjacent areas within posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The results suggest that semantic processing of faces is mediated through progressive stages of information abstraction in PCC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in Protein Kinase A Signaling of the Latent Postoperative Pain Sensitization That Is Masked by Kappa Opioid Receptors in the Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <p>Latent sensitization (LS) of pain engages pronociceptive signaling pathways in the dorsal horn that include NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-&gt;adenylyl cyclase-1 (AC1)-&gt;protein kinase A (PKA), and exchange proteins directly activated by cyclic AMP (Epacs). To determine whether these pathways operate similarly between males and females or are under the inhibitory control of spinal  opioid receptors (KOR), we allowed hyperalgesia to resolve after plantar incision and then blocked KOR with intrathecal administration of LY2456302, which reinstated hyperalgesia and facilitated touch-evoked immunoreactivity of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in neurons (NeuN) but not astrocytes (GFAPs) nor microglia (Iba1). LY2456302 reinstated hyperalgesia even when administered 13 months later, indicating that chronic postoperative pain vulnerability persists for over a year in a latent state of remission. In both sexes, intrathecal MK-801 (an NMDAR competitive antagonist) prevented LY2456302-evoked reinstatement of hyperalgesia as did AC1 gene deletion or the AC1 inhibitor NB001. NB001 also prevented stimulus-evoked pERK. In both sexes, the Epac inhibitor ESI-09 prevented reinstatement, whereas the Epac activator 8-CPT reinstated hyperalgesia. By contrast, the PKA inhibitor H89 prevented reinstatement only in male mice, whereas the PKA activator 6-bnz-cAMP itself evoked reinstatement at all doses tested (3&ndash;30 nmol, i.t.). In neither sex did incision change gene expression of KOR, GluN1, PKA, or Epac1 in dorsal horn. We conclude that sustained KOR signaling inhibits spinal PKA-dependent mechanisms that drive postoperative LS in a sex-dependent manner. Our findings support the development of AC1, PKA, and Epac inhibitors toward a new pharmacotherapy for chronic postoperative pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Because of neural mechanisms that are not well understood, men and women respond differently to treatments for chronic pain. We report that surgical incision recruits a pronociceptive latent pain sensitization that persisted for over a year and was kept in check by the sustained analgesic activity of  opioid receptors. NMDAR-&gt;AC1-&gt;cAMP-&gt;Epac signaling pathways in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord maintain latent sensitization in both males and females; however, only males recruit a PKA-dependent mechanism. This work presents a novel male-specific mechanism for the promotion of chronic postoperative pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subthalamic-Cortical Network Reorganization during Parkinson's Tremor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tremor, a common and often primary symptom of Parkinson's disease, has been modeled with distinct onset and maintenance dynamics. To identify the neurophysiologic correlates of each state, we acquired intraoperative cortical and subthalamic nucleus recordings from 10 patients (9 male, 1 female) performing a naturalistic visual&ndash;motor task. From this task, we isolated short epochs of tremor onset and sustained tremor. Comparing these epochs, we found that the subthalamic nucleus was central to tremor onset, as it drove both motor cortical activity and tremor output. Once tremor became sustained, control of tremor shifted to cortex. At the same time, changes in directed functional connectivity across sensorimotor cortex further distinguished the sustained tremor state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tremor is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). While tremor pathophysiology is thought to involve both basal ganglia and cerebello&ndash;thalamic&ndash;cortical circuits, it is unknown how these structures functionally interact to produce tremor. In this article, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the subthalamic nucleus and sensorimotor cortex in patients with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Using an intraoperative task, we examined tremor in two separate dynamic contexts: when tremor first emerged, and when tremor was sustained. We believe that these findings reconcile several models of Parkinson's tremor, while describing the short-timescale dynamics of subcortical&ndash;cortical interactions during tremor for the first time. These findings may describe a framework for developing proactive and responsive neurostimulation models for specifically treating tremor.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparing the first and second waves of COVID-19 in a tertiary university hospital in Barcelona [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hospitals have constituted the limiting resource of the healthcare systems for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic progressed, knowledge of the disease improved, and healthcare systems were expected to be more adapted to provide a more efficient response. The objective of this research was to compare the flow of COVID-19 patients in emergency rooms and hospital wards, between the pandemic's first and second waves at the University Hospital of Vall d’Hebron (Barcelona, Spain), and to compare the profiles, severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients between the two waves. Methods: A retrospective observational analysis of COVID-19 patients attending the hospital from February 24 to April 26, 2020 (first wave) and from July 24, 2020, to May 18, 2021 (second wave) was carried out. We analysed the data of the electronic medical records on patient demographics, comorbidity, severity, and mortality. Results: The daily number of COVID-19 patients entering the emergency rooms (ER) dropped by 65% during the second wave compared to the first wave. During the second wave, patients entering the ER were significantly younger (61 against 63 years old p<0.001) and less severely affected (39% against 48% with a triage level of resuscitation or emergency; p<0.001). ER mortality declined during the second wave (1% against 2%; p<0.000). The daily number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients dropped by 75% during the second wave. Those hospitalised during the second wave were more severely affected (20% against 10%; p<0.001) and were referred to the intensive care unit (ICU) more frequently (21% against 15%; p<0.001). Inpatient mortality showed no significant difference between the two waves. Conclusions: Changes in the flow, severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients entering this tertiary hospital during the two waves may reflect a better adaptation of the health care system and the improvement of knowledge on the disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methods, models, mechanisms and metadata: Introducing the Nanotoxicology collection at F1000Research [version 1; peer review: not peer reviewed]</a></h4>

              
                Nanotoxicology is a relatively new field of research concerning the study and application of nanomaterials to evaluate the potential for harmful effects in parallel with the development of applications. Nanotoxicology as a field spans materials synthesis and characterisation, assessment of fate and behaviour, exposure science, toxicology / ecotoxicology, molecular biology and toxicogenomics, epidemiology, safe and sustainable by design approaches, and chemoinformatics and nanoinformatics, thus requiring scientists to work collaboratively, often outside their core expertise area. This interdisciplinarity can lead to challenges in terms of interpretation and reporting, and calls for a platform for sharing of best-practice in nanotoxicology research. The F1000Research Nanotoxicology collection, introduced via this editorial, will provide a place to share accumulated best practice, via original research reports including no-effects studies, protocols and methods papers, software reports and living systematic reviews, which can be updated as new knowledge emerges or as the domain of applicability of the method, model or software is expanded. This editorial introduces the Nanotoxicology Collection in F1000Research. The aim of the collection is to provide an open access platform for nanotoxicology researchers, to support an improved culture of data sharing and documentation of evolving protocols, biological and computational models, software tools and datasets, that can be applied and built upon to develop predictive models and move towards in silico nanotoxicology and nanoinformatics. Submissions will be assessed for fit to the collection and subjected to the F1000Research open peer review process.

                Background: Sapovirus has emerged as a viral cause of acute gastroenteritis. However, there is limited data on sapovirus in Egypt. . The present study aimed to evaluate the presence of sapovirus in children with acute gastroenteritis <5 years in Mansoura, Egypt from January 2019 to February 2020 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: The cross-sectional study enrolled a 100 children <5 years who presented with acute gastroenteritis at an outpatient clinic in Mansoura, Egypt between January 2019 and February 2020. Clinical data, demographic data and a stool sample was collected from each child. Stools were screened by microscopy for parasites and culture methods for bacteria and excluded from the study if positive for either. Specimens were also screened for rotavirus by enzyme immune assays (EIA) and sapovirus by reverse transcription PCR. Results: The most frequently detected virus was rotavirus by ELISA 25% (25/100). RT-PCR detected sapovirus in 7% (7/100) of the stool samples. The children with sapovirus were all from rural regions and presented mainly during the winter season in Egypt 42.9% (3/7). The main presenting symptoms were fever 71.4% (5/7) and vomiting 57.1% (4/7). None of the children with sapovirus had dehydration. Rotavirus was significantly associated with sapovirus infections in  five samples (5/7) , 71.4%, P=0.01. Conclusion: The present study highlights the emergence of sapovirus as a frequent pathogen associated with acute gastroenteritis in children. There is a need for a national survey program for the study of sapovirus among other pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis for better management of such infection.

                Background: Bleeding from esophageal varices is a life-threatening complication in cirrhosis. Screening endoscopy is recommended in cirrhotic patients to identify patients at risk of variceal hemorrhage, but this is an invasive procedure and has limitations. Therefore, thrombocytopenia has been proposed to predict the existence and grade of esophageal varices. The aim of the current study was to determine a correlation between platelet count and grades of esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the POF Hospital, Wah Cantt from 1st October, 2017 to 30th May, 2018. Newly diagnosed cases of cirrhosis having varices of any grade on endoscopy were included. Endoscopic findings of patients were standardized using Paquet grading system. On the basis of platelet count, patients were divided into four subgroups. Platelet count groups were correlated with grading of esophageal varices using Spearman rank correlations. Chi Square test was used to see association between the platelet count and grade of esophageal varices. Results: 110 patients were included in the study, 55.5% (n=61) were male. Mean age of the patients was 59.89±9.01 years. Platelet count was <50,000/uL in 35.5% patients, 50,000-99,000/uL in 26.4%, 100,000-150000 in 12.7%, and >150,000/uL in 25.5% patients. Grade I esophageal varices were found in 23.6% of patients, whereas grade II, III and IV were found in 24.5%, 33.6% and 18.2% of patients, respectively. Mean platelet count was 213884.62/mm3 in patients with grade I varices, whereas it was 119518.52/mm3, 58386.49/mm3 and 21600.00/mm3 in patients with grade II, III and IV varices, respectively (p=<0.0001). A significant negative correlation between platelet count and grades of esophageal varices was found (p<0.001). Conclusion: Platelet count can predict the grade of esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients. There is significant negative correlation between platelet count and grades of esophageal varices.

                This article utilizes the analytical concept of acedia as the fundamental theoretical framework and applies a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed materials and documents on spiritual sloth, spiritual dryness, Catholic clerical celibacy, social bonding and communal spirituality. This article explores how the Catholic parish clergy’s mandatory celibacy intensifies loneliness and facilitates the spiritual sloth of parish clergy or what is theologically known as acedia. Unlike religious priests who live in religious communities, parish clerics fundamentally live, work, and pray alone in the parish, without strong communal support from fellow priests, bishops, and lay parishioners; thus, making them prone to loneliness, a main component of acedia. This article argues that mandatory celibacy further deprives parish clerics of the social and spiritual support necessary to enhance diocesan clerical spirituality and strengthen spiritual resistance against acedia. It recommends a structural adjustment in the social and spiritual life of parish priests, creating small communities of priests situated in similar territory or districts to allow them to live and work as a team with strong social and spiritual support in the spirit of “living baptismally” to overcome priestly acedia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An Atlas of Plant Transposable Elements [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Advances in genomic sequencing have recently offered vast opportunities for biological exploration, unraveling the evolution and improving our understanding of Earth biodiversity. Due to distinct plant species characteristics in terms of genome size, ploidy and heterozygosity, transposable elements (TEs) are common characteristics of many genomes. TEs are ubiquitous and dispersed repetitive DNA sequences that frequently impact the evolution and composition of the genome, mainly due to their redundancy and rearrangements. For this study, we provided an atlas of TE data by employing an easy-to-use portal (APTE website). To our knowledge, this is the most extensive and standardized analysis of TEs in plant genomes. We evaluated 67 plant genomes assembled at chromosome scale, recovering a total of 49,802,023 TE records, representing a total of 47,992,091,043 (~47,62%) base pairs (bp) of the total genomic space. We observed that new types of TEs were identified and annotated compared to other data repositories. By establishing a standardized catalog of TE annotation on 67 genomes, new hypotheses, exploration of TE data and their influences on the genomes may allow a better understanding of their function and processes. All original code and an example of how we developed the TE annotation strategy is available on GitHub (Extended data).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-driven multi-scale mathematical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals heterogeneity among COVID-19 patients</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shun Wang, Mengqian Hao, Zishu Pan, Jinzhi Lei, Xiufen Zou</p>

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often exhibit diverse disease progressions associated with various infectious ability, symptoms, and clinical treatments. To systematically and thoroughly understand the heterogeneous progression of COVID-19, we developed a multi-scale computational model to quantitatively understand the heterogeneous progression of COVID-19 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The model consists of intracellular viral dynamics, multicellular infection process, and immune responses, and was formulated using a combination of differential equations and stochastic modeling. By integrating multi-source clinical data with model analysis, we quantified individual heterogeneity using two indexes, i.e., the ratio of infected cells and incubation period. Specifically, our simulations revealed that increasing the host antiviral state or virus induced type I interferon (IFN) production rate can prolong the incubation period and postpone the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic outcomes. We further identified the threshold dynamics of T cell exhaustion in the transition between mild-moderate and severe symptoms, and that patients with severe symptoms exhibited a lack of naïve T cells at a late stage. In addition, we quantified the efficacy of treating COVID-19 patients and investigated the effects of various therapeutic strategies. Simulations results suggested that single antiviral therapy is sufficient for moderate patients, while combination therapies and prevention of T cell exhaustion are needed for severe patients. These results highlight the critical roles of IFN and T cell responses in regulating the stage transition during COVID-19 progression. Our study reveals a quantitative relationship underpinning the heterogeneity of transition stage during COVID-19 progression and can provide a potential guidance for personalized therapy in COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deciphering conformational selectivity in the A2A adenosine G protein-coupled receptor by free energy simulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Willem Jespers, Laura H. Heitman, Adriaan P. IJzerman, Eddy Sotelo, Gerard J. P. van Westen, Johan Åqvist, Hugo Gutiérrez-de-Terán</p>

Transmembranal G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) transduce extracellular chemical signals to the cell, via conformational change from a resting (inactive) to an active (canonically bound to a G-protein) conformation. Receptor activation is normally modulated by extracellular ligand binding, but mutations in the receptor can also shift this equilibrium by stabilizing different conformational states. In this work, we built structure-energetic relationships of receptor activation based on original thermodynamic cycles that represent the conformational equilibrium of the prototypical A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor (AR). These cycles were solved with efficient free energy perturbation (FEP) protocols, allowing to distinguish the pharmacological profile of different series of A<sub>2A</sub>AR agonists with different efficacies. The modulatory effects of point mutations on the basal activity of the receptor or on ligand efficacies could also be detected. This methodology can guide GPCR ligand design with tailored pharmacological properties, or allow the identification of mutations that modulate receptor activation with potential clinical implications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">It takes two to tango: Concerted protein translation and degradation necessary for synaptic scaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ana Luisa Carvalho, Dominique Fernandes</p>

Synaptic scaling allows neurons to adjust synaptic strength in response to chronic alterations in neuronal activity. A new study in PLOS Biology identifies a pathway that synergizes protein synthesis and degradation with remodeling of the microRNA (miRNA)-induced silencing complex (miRISC) to mediate synaptic scaling.

This Primer explores the implications of a new study in PLOS Biology which reveals how homeostatic synaptic plasticity requires coordinated and inter-dependent protein synthesis and degradation, as well as remodeling of the miRNA-induced silencing complex.

                Adequate adoption of evidence-based practice is deeply rooted in accessing methodological quality and completeness of systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting. Nonetheless, this assumption might be flawed if the methodological quality assessment has not been properly conducted. Taking the former statement into consideration, this correspondence article encourages the improvement of future tertiary manuscripts, especially in the field of restorative dentistry. Thus, this article addresses an overview of reviews in restorative dentistry by Sarkis-Onofre et al. in the May 2019 issue of the Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry as an example of evaluating tertiary evidence for increasing the awareness of reviewers, authors, and readers.

                Background: Cannabis use remains a major public health concern, and its use typically begins in adolescence. Chronic administration of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, during adolescence can produce deficits in adult learning and memory, stress reactivity and anxiety. One possible mechanism behind the disruptions in adulthood from adolescent exposure to THC includes changes in social behaviours, such as social play, which has been shown to be critical to socio-cognitive development. Methods: Here, using an established animal model of adolescent THC exposure in male and female Long–Evans rats, we explored the effects of THC on play behaviour during the chronic administration period. Following puberty onset, as indicated by external changes to the genitalia, THC (5mg/kg) was administered for 14 days. Play behaviour was assessed seven days following the onset of the injection period at approximately 1 hour post treatment. The frequency of nape attacks, the likelihood and tactics of defensive behaviour, and pins were scored and analyzed. Results: THC exposure decreased playfulness in adolescent rats including the number of attacks, likelihood of defense and pins compared to control and vehicle treated rats. Conclusion: This suggests that THC suppresses both the attack and defense components of social play. This is an important finding because there is evidence that attack and defense may be mediated by different mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of THC exposure decreasing playfulness occurred similarly in males and females.

                Background: This paper focuses on advances in crowd control study with an emphasis on high-density crowds, particularly Hajj crowds. Video analysis and visual surveillance have been of increasing importance in order to enhance the safety and security of pilgrimages in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Hajj is considered to be a particularly distinctive event, with hundreds of thousands of people gathering in a small space, which does not allow a precise analysis of video footage using advanced video and computer vision algorithms. This paper aims to propose an algorithm based on a Convolutional Neural Networks model specifically for Hajj applications. Additionally, the work introduces a system for counting and then estimating the crowd density. Methods: The model adopts an architecture which detects each person in the crowd, spots head location with a bounding box and does the counting in our own novel dataset (HAJJ-Crowd). Results: Our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art method, and attains a remarkable Mean Absolute Error result of 200 (average of 82.0 improvement) and Mean Square Error of 240 (average of 135.54 improvement). Conclusions: In our new HAJJ-Crowd dataset for evaluation and testing, we have a density map and prediction results of some standard methods.

                Many patients with COVID-19 experience a range of debilitating symptoms months after being infected, a syndrome termed long-haul COVID. A 68-year-old male presented with lung opacity, fatigue, physical and cognitive weaknesses, loss of smell and lymphocytopenia. After rounds of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), the patient returned to normal activities and work. Mechanistically in the patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), markers of inflammatory macrophages diminished and markers of lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic CD8 T-cells, increased. Circulating inflammatory proteins diminished, while positive regulators of tissue repair increased. This case study suggests that TPE has the capacity to treat long-haul COVID.

Here we reveal that neurons can also communicate through the force generated by the enlargement of dendritic spines. This force is comparable to that of muscle contraction and might underlie learning and memory, suggesting that brain function is more mechanical than was previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct dendritic Ca2+ spike forms produce opposing input-output transformations in rat CA3 pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                Proper integration of different inputs targeting the dendritic tree of CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs) is critical for associative learning and recall. Dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been proposed to perform associative computations in other PC types by detecting conjunctive activation of different afferent input pathways, initiating afterdepolarization (ADP), and triggering burst firing. Implementation of such operations fundamentally depends on the actual biophysical properties of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes; yet little is known about these properties in dendrites of CA3PCs. Using dendritic patch-clamp recordings and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in acute slices from male rats, we report that, unlike CA1PCs, distal apical trunk dendrites of CA3PCs exhibit distinct forms of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Besides ADP-type global Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, a majority of dendrites expresses a novel, fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike type that is initiated locally without bAPs, can recruit additional Na<sup>+</sup> currents, and is compartmentalized to the activated dendritic subtree. Occurrence of the different Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike types correlates with dendritic structure, indicating morpho-functional heterogeneity among CA3PCs. Importantly, ADPs and dendritically initiated spikes produce opposing somatic output: bursts versus strictly single-action potentials, respectively. The uncovered variability of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes may underlie heterogeneous input-output transformation and bursting properties of CA3PCs, and might specifically contribute to key associative and non-associative computations performed by the CA3 network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beamforming seizures from the temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Background: Surgical treatment of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) depends on proper identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ), and differentiation of mesial, temporolimbic seizure onsets from temporal neocortical seizure onsets. Non-invasive source imaging using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) can provide accurate information on interictal spike localization; however, EEG and MEG have low sensitivity for epileptiform activity restricted to deep temporolimbic structures. Moreover, in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), interictal spikes frequently arise in neocortical foci distant from the SOZ, rendering interictal spike localization potentially misleading for presurgical planning. Methods: In this study, we used two different beamformer techniques applied to the MEG signal of ictal events acquired during EEG-MEG recordings in six patients with TLE (three neocortical, three MTLE). The ictal source localization results were compared to the patients' ground truth SOZ localizations determined from intracranial EEG and/or clinical, neuroimaging and postsurgical outcome evidence. Results: Beamformer analysis proved to be highly accurate in all cases and able to reliably identify focal seizure onsets localized to mesial, temporolimbic structures. In three patients, interictal spikes were either absent, too complex for inverse dipole modeling, or localized to anterolateral temporal neocortex distant to a mesial temporal SOZ. Conclusions: This report demonstrates the suitability of MEG beamformer analysis of ictal events in TLE, which can supersede or complement the traditional analysis of interictal spikes. The method outlined is applicable to any type of epileptiform event, greatly expanding the information value of MEG and broadening its utility for presurgical recording in epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Three heads are better than one: Cooperative learning brains wire together when a consensus is reached</a></h4>

              
                Theories of human learning converge on the view that individuals working together learn better than do those working alone. Little is known, however, about the neural mechanisms of learning through cooperation. We addressed this research gap by leveraging functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record the brain activity of triad members in a group simultaneously. Triads were instructed to analyze an ancient Chinese poem either cooperatively or independently. Four main findings emerged. First, we observed significant within-group neural synchronization (GNS) in the left superior temporal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus during cooperative learning compared to independent learning. Second, the enhancement of GNS in triads was amplified when a consensus was reached (vs. elaboration or argument) during cooperative learning. Third, GNS was predictive of learning outcome at an early stage (156-170 s after learning was initiated). Fourth, social factors such as social closeness (e.g., how much learners liked one other) were reflected in GNS and co-varied with learning engagement. These results provide neurophysiological support for Piaget's theory of cognitive development and favor the notion that successful learning through cooperation involves dynamic consensus building, which is captured in neural patterns shared across learners in a group.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired astrocytic Ca2+ signalling in awake Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                Increased astrocytic Ca2+ signaling related to amyloid plaques has been shown in Alzheimer's disease mouse models, but to date no reports have characterized behaviorally induced astrocytic Ca2+ signalling in such mice without the confounding effects of anesthesia. Here, we employ an event-based algorithm to assess astrocytic Ca2+ signals in the neocortex of awake-behaving tg-ArcSwe mice and non-transgenic wildtype littermates while monitoring pupil responses and behavior. We demonstrate an attenuated astrocytic Ca2+ response to locomotion and an uncoupling of pupil responses and astrocytic Ca2+ signalling in 15-months old plaque-bearing mice. This points to a potential decoupling of neuromodulatory activation and astrocytic Ca2+ activity, which may account for some of the cognitive dysfunctions observed in Alzheimers disease.

                The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a small brainstem nucleus that promotes arousal and attention. Recent studies have examined the microstructural properties of the LC using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and found unexpected age-related differences in fractional anisotropy - a measure of white matter integrity. Here, we used three datasets (Berlin Aging Study-II, N = 301, the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions, N = 220, and Stockholm Sleepy Brain, N = 49), to replicate published findings and expand them by investigating diffusivity in the LC's ascending noradrenergic bundle. In younger adults, LC fractional anisotropy was significantly lower, compared to older adults. However, in the LC's ascending noradrenergic bundle, we observed significantly higher fractional anisotropy in younger adults, relative to older adults. These findings indicate that diffusivity in the LC versus the ascending noradrenergic bundle are both susceptible to microstructural changes in aging that have opposing effects on fractional anisotropy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional expression changes during compensatory plasticity in the prothoracic ganglion of the adult cricket Gryllus bimaculatus</a></h4>

              
                Most adult organisms are limited in their capacity to recover from neurological damage. The auditory system of the Mediterranean field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, presents a compelling model for investigating neuroplasticity due to its unusual capabilities for structural reorganization into adulthood.  Specifically, the dendrites of the central auditory neurons of the prothoracic ganglion sprout in response to the loss of auditory afferents. Deafferented auditory dendrites grow across the midline, a boundary they normally respect, and form functional synapses with the contralateral auditory afferents, restoring tuning-curve specificity. The molecular pathways underlying these changes are entirely unknown. Here, we used a multiple k-mer approach to re-assemble a previously reported prothoracic ganglion transcriptome that included ganglia collected one, three, and seven days after unilateral deafferentation in adult, male animals. We used EdgeR and DESeq2 to perform differential expression analysis and we examined Gene Ontologies to further understand the potential molecular basis of this compensatory anatomical plasticity. Enriched GO terms included those related to protein translation and degradation, enzymatic activity, and Toll signaling. Extracellular space GO terms were also enriched and included the upregulation of several protein yellow family members one day after deafferentation. Investigation of these regulated GO terms help to provide a broader understanding of the types of pathways that might be involved in this compensatory growth and can be used to design hypotheses around identified molecular mechanisms that may be involved in this unique example of adult structural plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Progressive axonopathy when oligodendrocytes lack the myelin protein CMTM5</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes facilitate rapid impulse propagation along the axons they myelinate and support their long-term integrity. However, the functional relevance of many myelin proteins has remained unknown. Here we find that expression of the tetraspan-transmembrane protein CMTM5 (Chemokine-like factor-like MARVEL-transmembrane domain containing protein 5) is highly enriched in oligodendrocytes and CNS myelin. Genetic disruption of the Cmtm5-gene in oligodendrocytes of mice does not impair the development or ultrastructure of CNS myelin. However, oligodendroglial Cmtm5-deficiency causes an early-onset progressive axonopathy, which we also observe in global and in tamoxifen-induced oligodendroglial Cmtm5-mutants. Presence of the Wlds mutation ameliorates the axonopathy, implying a Wallerian degeneration-like pathomechanism. These results indicate that CMTM5 is involved in the function of oligodendrocytes to maintain axonal integrity rather than myelin biogenesis.

                Genetic mutations that cause Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a progressively lethal motor neuron disease, are commonly found in ubiquitously expressed genes. In addition to direct defects within motor neurons, growing evidence suggests that dysfunction of non-neuronal cells is also an important driver of disease. Previously, we demonstrated that mutations in DNA/RNA binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) induce neurotoxic phenotypes in astrocytes in vitro, via activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway and release of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF. Here, we developed an intraspinal cord injection model to test whether astrocyte-specific expression of ALS-causative FUSR521G variant (mtFUS) causes neuronal damage in vivo. We show that mtFUS expression causes TNF upregulation, motor function deficits, and spinal motor neuron loss. We further demonstrate a lack of phenotype in TNF knockout animals expressing mtFUS, and prevention of neurodegeneration in mtFUS-transduced animals through administration of TNF neutralizing antibodies. Together, these studies strengthen evidence that astrocytes contribute to disease in ALS, establish that FUS-ALS astrocytes induce pathogenic changes to motor neurons in vivo, and provide insights identifying FUS-ALS specific potential therapeutic targets.

	<p>We describe a novel system for online prediction of lead seizures from long-term intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings for canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. This study adopts new specification of lead seizures, reflecting strong clustering of seizures in observed data. This clustering results in fewer lead seizures (~7 lead seizures per dog), and hence new challenges for online seizure prediction, that are addressed in the proposed system. In particular, the machine learning part of the system is implemented using the group learning method suitable for modeling sparse and noisy seizure data. In addition, several modifications for the proposed system are introduced to cope with the non-stationarity of a noisy iEEG signal. They include: (1) periodic retraining of the SVM classifier using most recent training data; (2) removing samples with noisy labels from training data; and (3) introducing a new adaptive post-processing technique for combining many predictions made for 20 s windows into a single prediction for a 4 h segment. Application of the proposed system requires only two lead seizures for training the initial model, and results in high prediction performance for all four dogs (with mean 0.84 sensitivity, 0.27 time-in-warning, and 0.78 false-positive rate per day). The proposed system achieves accurate prediction of lead seizures during long-term test periods, 3&amp;amp;ndash;16 lead seizures during a 169&amp;amp;ndash;364 day test period, whereas earlier studies did not differentiate between lead vs. non-lead seizures and used much shorter test periods (~few days long).</p>

	<p>Background: Advanced Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (APD) has been recently defined as a stage in which certain symptoms and complications are present, with a detrimental influence on the overall patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s health conditions and with a poor response to conventional treatments. However, historically, the term APD has been controversial, thus consequently, APD prevalence has not been previously studied. Objectives: The main objective was to determine the prevalence of APD in patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD in hospitals of the Spanish National Healthcare System. Secondary objectives were the prevalence and incidence of PD and the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and quality of life of patients with APD or non-APD. Methods: This was a non-interventional, cross-sectional, multicenter, national study in the hospital setting. Results: The study population included 929 patients with PD (mean age 71.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.1 years; 53.8% male) and a mean time since diagnosis of 6.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.4 years. At the time of diagnosis, 613 patients (66.06%) reported having had premotor symptoms. The Hoehn and Yahr stage was 1 in 15.7% of the patients, 2 in 42.8%, 3 in 30.1%, 4 in 9.9%, and 5 in 1.4%; 46.9% of the patients had comorbidities (mean age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index 3.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7; median 10-year survival 77%) and the mean 8-item Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was 27.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 20.5. We found an APD prevalence of 38.21% (95%CI: 35.08%&amp;amp;ndash;41.42%), a PD prevalence of 118.4 (95%CI: 117.3&amp;amp;ndash;119.6), and a PD incidence of 9.4 (95%CI: 5.42&amp;amp;ndash;13.4) all per 100,000 population. Among the APD population, a 15.2% were receiving some form of therapy for advanced stages of the disease (deep brain stimulation, levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel, or apomorphine subcutaneous infusion). Conclusions: The percentage of patients with APD in the hospitals of the Spanish National Healthcare System was 38.2%.</p>

	<p>The inference of neuronal connectome from large-scale neuronal activity recordings, such as two-photon Calcium imaging, represents an active area of research in computational neuroscience. In this work, we developed FARCI (Fast and Robust Connectome Inference), a MATLAB package for neuronal connectome inference from high-dimensional two-photon Calcium fluorescence data. We employed partial correlations as a measure of the functional association strength between pairs of neurons to reconstruct a neuronal connectome. We demonstrated using in silico datasets from the Neural Connectomics Challenge (NCC) and those generated using the state-of-the-art simulator of Neural Anatomy and Optimal Microscopy (NAOMi) that FARCI provides an accurate connectome and its performance is robust to network sizes, missing neurons, and noise levels. Moreover, FARCI is computationally efficient and highly scalable to large networks. In comparison with the best performing connectome inference algorithm in the NCC, Generalized Transfer Entropy (GTE), and Fluorescence Single Neuron and Network Analysis Package (FluoroSNNAP), FARCI produces more accurate networks over different network sizes, while providing significantly better computational speed and scaling.</p>

	<p>The high level of heterogeneity in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the lack of systematic measurements complicate predicting outcomes of early intervention and the identification of better-tailored treatment programs. Computational phenotyping may assist therapists in monitoring child behavior through quantitative measures and personalizing the intervention based on individual characteristics; still, real-world behavioral analysis is an ongoing challenge. For this purpose, we designed EYE-C, a system based on OpenPose and Gaze360 for fine-grained analysis of eye-contact episodes in unconstrained therapist-child interactions via a single video camera. The model was validated on video data varying in resolution and setting, achieving promising performance. We further tested EYE-C on a clinical sample of 62 preschoolers with ASD for spectrum stratification based on eye-contact features and age. By unsupervised clustering, three distinct sub-groups were identified, differentiated by eye-contact dynamics and a specific clinical phenotype. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Artificial Intelligence in categorizing atypical behavior and providing translational solutions that might assist clinical practice.</p>

	<p>The last decades have seen a proliferation of music and brain studies, with a major focus on plastic changes as the outcome of continuous and prolonged engagement with music. Thanks to the advent of neuroaesthetics, research on music cognition has broadened its scope by considering the multifarious phenomenon of listening in all its forms, including incidental listening up to the skillful attentive listening of experts, and all its possible effects. These latter range from objective and sensorial effects directly linked to the acoustic features of the music to the subjectively affective and even transformational effects for the listener. Of special importance is the finding that neural activity in the reward circuit of the brain is a key component of a conscious listening experience. We propose that the connection between music and the reward system makes music listening a gate towards not only hedonia but also eudaimonia, namely a life well lived, full of meaning that aims at realizing one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own &amp;amp;ldquo;daimon&amp;amp;rdquo; or true nature. It is argued, further, that music listening, even when conceptualized in this aesthetic and eudaimonic framework, remains a learnable skill that changes the way brain structures respond to sounds and how they interact with each other.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sickle cell segmentation and classification for thalassemia aid diagnosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disease in which abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) carry insufficient oxygen throughout the body. Conventional methods of thalassemia detection through a complete blood count (CBC) test and peripheral blood smear image still possess a lot of weaknesses. Methods: This paper proposes a hybrid segmentation method to segment the RBCs. It incorporates adaptive thresholding and canny edge method to segment the RBCs. Morphological operations are performed to clean the leftovers. Shape and texture features are extracted using the segmented masks and the gray level co-occurrence matrix. Data imbalance treatment is used for solving the imbalance cell type class in distribution. In the data resampling layer, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN), and random over sampling (ROS) are performed and evaluated using the decision tree and logistic regression. In the classification layer, the decision tree, random forest classifier and support vector machine (SVM) are assessed and compared for the best performance in classification. Results:The proposed method outperforms the other methods in the image segmentation layer with the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 89.88%. In the data resampling layer, ADASYN is employed as it is more accurate than the SMOTE and ROS. The random forest classifier is chosen at the classification layer as it is more accurate than the decision tree and support vector machine (SVM). Conclusions:The proposed method is tested on the latest dataset of erythrocyteIDB3 and it solves the issues of imbalanced data due to the insufficient cell classes.

                Background: To compare the predictors In-hospital mortality of patients with septic Acute Kidney Injury (S-AKI) and non-septic AKI (NS-AKI). Methods: a cohort study of critically ill patients with AKI admitted to the emergency room at a tertiary hospital from January to June 2019. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Results: There were 116 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Compared with NS-AKI, patients with S-AKI had significantly lower mean MAP, median eGFR, and urine output. (UO). S-AKI had higher mortality and vasopressor requirements and had a lower renal recovery than NS-AKI (63.2% vs 31.4%, p=0.001; 30.8% vs 13.7%, p=0.031, and 36.9% vs 60.8%, p=0.011, respectively). AKI stage 3 and vasopressor requirements were dependent risk factors for both S-AKI and NS-AKI mortality. Meanwhile, SOFA score > 7 and the need for dialysis are dependent and independent risk factors for mortality in S-AKI. Worsening and/or persistence in UO, serum urea and creatinine levels at 48 h after admission were predictors of mortality in S-AKI and NS-AKI. Improvement in UO in surviving patients was more pronounced in S-AKI than in NS-AKI (50% vs 17.1%, p=0.007). The surviving S-AKI patients had a longer hospital stay than surviving NS-AKI [8 (6-14.5) vs 5 (4 – 8), p=0.004]. S-AKI have higher mortality and vasopressor requirements and have lower renal recovery than NS-AKI. Conclusion: S-AKI have higher mortality and vasopressor requirements and a lower renal recovery than NS-AKI. Independent predictors of mortality in S-AKI were high SOFA scores and the need for dialysis.

                Background: Business actors need to take strategic steps to maintain and improve business performance. Studying and deepening the strategies used by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to maintain their performance conditions are needed as a barometer of crisis resistance in the macroeconomic sector, especially those used by MSMEs in Medan, Indonesia. Thus, this research provides a real picture in the field of variables and indicators that affect the business strategy of MSMEs through the perspective of a lean approach. Methods: The population in this region was 466 business actors of MSMEs in Medan. A random stratified sampling strategy is used, and 169 businesses in the MSMEs production sector were obtained as samples, which has exceeded the standard achievement of 80 percent in detecting an R2 value of at least 0.10 (with a 5 percent probability of error). The research variables used consisted of one endogenous variable (use of a lean strategy), two exogenous variables (external lean practice and internal lean practice), and one mediating variable (financial performance). Seven hypotheses (inner models) were tested using structural equation modelling–partial least squares, nonparametric statistical data analysis techniques with mediation effects, assisted by Smart PLS 3.0. Results: Based on the path coefficient, internal lean practice predominantly influences the financial performance of MSMEs in Medan compared to external lean practice. Internal lean practice is the primary signal for identifying the degree of lean strategy practice in the MSMEs production sector in Medan city. Conclusion: These findings can be a map for practitioners, academics, and the government to improve the financial performance of MSMEs and assist them in their business strategies through internal business practices. Moreover, this study's impact can lead to an understanding of business strategies in operations that directly or indirectly affect the environment toward global warming and various environmental problems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CStone: A de novo transcriptome assembler for short-read data that identifies non-chimeric contigs based on underlying graph structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Raquel Linheiro, John Archer</p>

With the exponential growth of sequence information stored over the last decade, including that of <i>de novo</i> assembled contigs from RNA-Seq experiments, quantification of chimeric sequences has become essential when assembling read data. In transcriptomics, <i>de novo</i> assembled chimeras can closely resemble underlying transcripts, but patterns such as those seen between co-evolving sites, or mapped read counts, become obscured. We have created a de Bruijn based <i>de novo</i> assembler for RNA-Seq data that utilizes a classification system to describe the complexity of underlying graphs from which contigs are created. Each contig is labelled with one of three levels, indicating whether or not ambiguous paths exist. A by-product of this is information on the range of complexity of the underlying gene families present. As a demonstration of CStones ability to assemble high-quality contigs, and to label them in this manner, both simulated and real data were used. For simulated data, ten million read pairs were generated from cDNA libraries representing four species, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, <i>Panthera pardus</i>, <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> and <i>Serinus canaria</i>. These were assembled using CStone, Trinity and rnaSPAdes; the latter two being high-quality, well established, <i>de novo</i> assembers. For real data, two RNA-Seq datasets, each consisting of ≈30 million read pairs, representing two adult <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i> whole-body samples were used. The contigs that CStone produced were comparable in quality to those of Trinity and rnaSPAdes in terms of length, sequence identity of aligned regions and the range of cDNA transcripts represented, whilst providing additional information on chimerism. Here we describe the details of CStones assembly and classification process, and propose that similar classification systems can be incorporated into other <i>de novo</i> assembly tools. Within a related side study, we explore the effects that chimera’s within reference sets have on the identification of differentially expression genes. CStone is available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/cstone/.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elastic energy savings and active energy cost in a simple model of running</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryan T. Schroeder, Arthur D. Kuo</p>

The energetic economy of running benefits from tendon and other tissues that store and return elastic energy, thus saving muscles from costly mechanical work. The classic “Spring-mass” computational model successfully explains the forces, displacements and mechanical power of running, as the outcome of dynamical interactions between the body center of mass and a purely elastic spring for the leg. However, the Spring-mass model does not include active muscles and cannot explain the metabolic energy cost of running, whether on level ground or on a slope. Here we add explicit actuation and dissipation to the Spring-mass model, and show how they explain substantial active (and thus costly) work during human running, and much of the associated energetic cost. Dissipation is modeled as modest energy losses (5% of total mechanical energy for running at 3 m s<sup>-1</sup>) from hysteresis and foot-ground collisions, that must be restored by active work each step. Even with substantial elastic energy return (59% of positive work, comparable to empirical observations), the active work could account for most of the metabolic cost of human running (about 68%, assuming human-like muscle efficiency). We also introduce a previously unappreciated energetic cost for rapid production of force, that helps explain the relatively smooth ground reaction forces of running, and why muscles might also actively perform negative work. With both work and rapid force costs, the model reproduces the energetics of human running at a range of speeds on level ground and on slopes. Although elastic return is key to energy savings, there are still losses that require restorative muscle work, which can cost substantial energy during running.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Homeostatic scaling is driven by a translation-dependent degradation axis that recruits miRISC remodeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Balakumar Srinivasan, Sarbani Samaddar, Sivaram V. S. Mylavarapu, James P. Clement, Sourav Banerjee</p>

Homeostatic scaling in neurons has been attributed to the individual contribution of either translation or degradation; however, there remains limited insight toward understanding how the interplay between the two processes effectuates synaptic homeostasis. Here, we report that a codependence between protein synthesis and degradation mechanisms drives synaptic homeostasis, whereas abrogation of either prevents it. Coordination between the two processes is achieved through the formation of a tripartite complex between translation regulators, the 26S proteasome, and the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) components such as Argonaute, MOV10, and Trim32 on actively translating transcripts or polysomes. The components of this ternary complex directly interact with each other in an RNA-dependent manner. Disruption of polysomes abolishes this ternary interaction, suggesting that translating RNAs facilitate the combinatorial action of the proteasome and the translational apparatus. We identify that synaptic downscaling involves miRISC remodeling, which entails the mTORC1-dependent translation of Trim32, an E3 ligase, and the subsequent degradation of its target, MOV10 <i>via</i> the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase. We find that the E3 ligase Trim32 specifically polyubiquitinates MOV10 for its degradation during synaptic downscaling. MOV10 degradation alone is sufficient to invoke downscaling by enhancing Arc translation through its 3′ UTR and causing the subsequent removal of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Synaptic scaling was occluded when we depleted Trim32 and overexpressed MOV10 in neurons, suggesting that the Trim32-MOV10 axis is necessary for synaptic downscaling. We propose a mechanism that exploits a translation-driven protein degradation paradigm to invoke miRISC remodeling and induce homeostatic scaling during chronic network activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A survey of biomedical journals to detect editorial bias and nepotistic behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexandre Scanff, Florian Naudet, Ioana A. Cristea, David Moher, Dorothy V. M. Bishop, Clara Locher</p>

Alongside the growing concerns regarding predatory journal growth, other questionable editorial practices have gained visibility recently. Among them, we explored the usefulness of the Percentage of Papers by the Most Prolific author (PPMP) and the Gini index (level of inequality in the distribution of authorship among authors) as tools to identify journals that may show favoritism in accepting articles by specific authors. We examined whether the PPMP, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using all articles in a sample of 5,468 biomedical journals indexed in the National Library of Medicine. For articles published between 2015 and 2019, the median PPMP was 2.9%, and 5% of journal exhibited a PPMP of 10.6% or more. Among the journals with the highest PPMP or Gini index values, where a few authors were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications, a random sample was manually examined, revealing that the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61%). The papers by the most prolific authors were more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their submission. Results of analysis on a subset of articles, excluding nonresearch articles, were consistent with those of the principal analysis. In most journals, publications are distributed across a large number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be transparent about their editorial and peer review practices.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Metabolic response against traffic congestion-induced stress [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traffic congestion is a common problem in large cities, which can induce stress in participants in vehicles as well as pedestrians. In such conditions, several stress hormones, such as catecholamines and cortisol are secreted by the adrenal glands resulting in metabolic responses. Prolonged metabolic changes can lead to metabolic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to examine the metabolic responses induced by traffic congestion in young adults. Methods: We enrolled 71 undergraduate students aged 20-30 years from the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Islam Bandung, who regularly go to campus on foot, by public transportation, motorcycles, and cars. Medical history was screened by questionnaires before the testing day. Blood samples were drawn soon after participants arrived on campus. We used bioimpedance analysis to measure fasting blood glucose, lipid profiles, and nutrient body status. Results: Most participants rode motorcycles (46.48%), and the most common travel time was short (<15 min, 54.9%.). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were significantly lower in participants using vehicles - either private or public transportation - compared with pedestrians (p<0.05 and p<0.02, respectively). Participants with a short travel duration had significantly higher total cholesterol and LDL levels than those with longer ones (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively). Conclusions: Based on the above results, metabolic responses to traffic congestion such as changes to total cholesterol and LDL levels depended the type of transportation and travel duration.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are key players in the development and maintenance of the vascular tree, the establishment of the blood brain barrier and control of blood flow. Disruption in ECs is an early and active component of vascular pathogenesis. However, our ability to selectively target ECs in the CNS for identification and manipulation is limited. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we utilized a recently developed AAV-BR1 system to identify distinct classes of ECs along the vascular tree using a GFP reporter. We then developed an inducible EC-specific ectopic Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression system using AAV-BR1-CAG-DIO-Cx43-P2A-DsRed2 in combination with a mouse line carrying inducible CreERT2 in ECs. We targeted Cx43 because its loss has been implicated in microvascular impairment in numerous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular edema. GFP-labeled ECs were numerous, evenly distributed along the vascular tree and their morphology was polarized with respect to the direction of blood flow. After tamoxifen induction, ectopic Cx43 was specifically expressed in ECs. Similarly to endogenous Cx43, ectopic Cx43 was localized at the membrane contacts of ECs and it did not affect tight junction proteins. The ability to enhance gap junctions in ECs provides a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, an early pathology in numerous diseases.</p>

     alt="Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation is disinhibited following traumatic brain injury in leukemia inhibitory factor heterozygous mice"/>
<p>Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) haplodeficiency alters forebrain development and proliferative responses to closed head injury. Injury increases overall proliferation and increases the number of multipotential progenitors in the subventricular zone at 48 hr post-injury that is more dramatic in LIF Het mice. Oligodendrocyte lineage cells are most sensitive to decreased levels in LIF, and more specifically, early oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) proliferation increases in LIF Het injured mice. The addition of LIF decreases overall proliferation and decreases the number of proliferating late OPCs, suggesting that LIF pushes the cells into a more mature state.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant problem that affects over 800,000 children each year. As cell proliferation is disturbed by injury and required for normal brain development, we investigated how a pediatric closed head injury (CHI) would affect the progenitors of the subventricular zone (SVZ). Additionally, we evaluated the contribution of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) using germline LIF heterozygous mice (LIF Het), as LIF is an injury-induced cytokine, known to influence neurogenesis and gliogenesis. CHIs were performed on P20 LIF Het and wild-type (WT) mice. Ki-67 immunostaining and stereology revealed that cell proliferation increased ~250% in injured LIF Het mice compared to the 30% increase observed in injured WT mice at 48-hr post-CHI. OLIG2+ cell proliferation increased in the SVZ and white matter of LIF Het injured mice at 48-hr recovery. Using an 8-color flow cytometry panel, the proliferation of three distinct multipotential progenitors and early oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation was significantly increased in LIF Het injured mice compared to WT injured mice. Supporting its cytostatic function, LIF decreased neurosphere progenitor and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation compared to controls. In highly enriched mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cell cultures, LIF increased phospho-protein kinase B after 20 min and increased phospho-S6 ribosomal protein at 20 and 40 min of exposure, which are downstream targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Altogether, our data provide new insights into the regulatory role of LIF in suppressing neural progenitor cell proliferation and, in particular, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation after a mild TBI.</p>

                Hattori et al. showed that highly persistent value coding emerges in the mouse retrosplenial cortex and artificial recurrent neural network in a learning- and context-dependent manner. Persistency ensures untangled value representations in neural population dynamics and facilitates distributed value coding across the brain, highlighting the benefits of persistent coding.

                Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy are able to self-renew and differentiate to mature blood cells. Young et al. report that an HSC self-control mechanism established by ARID4B ensures HSC differentiation. ARID4B-deficient HSCs produce KITLG to stimulate KIT, leading to blockage of HSC differentiation and eventual hematopoietic failure.

                Wang et al. report an immune priming therapy based on a single dose of anti-tumor antibodies, IL-2, and anti-PD-1, which engages natural killer cells and macrophages, promotes lymphocyte recruitment and activation, and elicits vascular normalization. This priming strategy allows subsequent immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to eradicate large, established tumors.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Glucose metabolism and pyruvate carboxylase enhance glutathione synthesis and restrict oxidative stress in pancreatic islets</a></h4>

              
                Fu et al. identify a pyruvate carboxylase (PC)-dependent mode of enhancing GSH biosynthesis via augmented glucose metabolism. The PC-GSH antioxidant axis protects pancreatic islets from diabetes-associated inflammation and oxidative stress.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Reprogramming of H3K9bhb at regulatory elements is a key feature of fasting in the small intestine</a></h4>

              
                Terranova et al. demonstrate that fasting induces production of HMGCS2 and β-hydroxybutyrate in small intestine (SI) crypt cells. This causes enrichment of H3K9bhb within regulatory regions of critical metabolic genes in crypt epithelial cells. Loss of intestinal Hmgcs2 impairs H3K9bhb enrichment and affects expression of H3K9bhb-associated metabolic gene programs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Interspecies variation in hominid gut microbiota controls host gene regulation</a></h4>

              
                Muehlbauer et al. investigate how variation between different hominid microbiomes drives host gene expression in colonic epithelial cell cultures. They find that host genes that respond only to microbiomes from a specific hominid species are linked to gastrointestinal diseases, suggesting implications for understanding how the microbiome can impact human health.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies elicited by COVID-19mRNA vaccine exhibit a unique glycosylation pattern</a></h4>

              
                The Fc structures of IgGs produced during infection and vaccination have important roles in shaping the immune response. Farkash et al. show that vaccine- and infection-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs differ in their Fc regions and in engagement of complement and Fc receptors, implying distinct effector functions and immunity.

                Jiang et al. show that a candidate vaccine, comprising the N and SFLmut proteins adjuvanted with KF and cGAMP, induces strong systemic and mucosal immune responses and protects hACE2 transgenic mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge with robust viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract compared with a reference inactivated vaccine.
