              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The locus coeruleus directs sensory-motor reflex amplitude across environmental contexts</a></h4>

              
                Animals possess a remarkable ability to quickly and accurately respond to challenges to their balance and posture. Postural corrections are the implementation of a motor act by the nervous system that counteracts a perturbation and returns the body to a stable state. These corrections must respect both the current position of the limbs and trunk, as well as the external environment. However, how motor circuits integrate multiple streams of information regarding both these internal and external factors, and adjust motor actions accordingly, are poorly understood. Here we show that the lateral vestibular nucleus in the brainstem generates motor corrections following perturbation, and that this reflex can be altered by manipulating the surrounding environment. The strength of the motor correction is influenced by noradrenergic signalling from the locus coeruleus, suggesting a potential link between forebrain structures which convey sensory information about the environment, and brainstem circuits that generate motor corrections.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cone-Driven Retinal Responses Are Shaped by Rod But Not Cone HCN1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Signal integration of converging neural circuits is poorly understood. One example is in the retina where the integration of rod and cone signaling is responsible for the large dynamic range of vision. The relative contribution of rods versus cones is dictated by a complex function involving background light intensity and stimulus temporal frequency. One understudied mechanism involved in coordinating rod and cone signaling onto the shared retinal circuit is the hyperpolarization activated current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>) mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels expressed in rods and cones. <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> opposes membrane hyperpolarization driven by activation of the phototransduction cascade and modulates the strength and kinetics of the photoreceptor voltage response. We examined conditional knock-out (KO) of HCN1 from mouse rods using electroretinography (ERG). In the absence of HCN1, rod responses are prolonged in dim light which altered the response to slow modulation of light intensity both at the level of retinal signaling and behavior. Under brighter intensities, cone-driven signaling was suppressed. To our surprise, conditional KO of HCN1 from mouse cones had no effect on cone-mediated signaling. We propose that <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> is dispensable in cones because of the high level of temporal control of cone phototransduction. Thus, HCN1 is required for cone-driven retinal signaling only indirectly by modulating the voltage response of rods to limit their output.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hyperpolarization gated hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels carry a feedback current that helps to reset light-activated photoreceptors. Using conditional HCN1 knock-out (KO) mice we show that ablating HCN1 from rods allows rods to signal in bright light when they are normally shut down. Instead of enhancing vision this results in suppressing cone signaling. Conversely, ablating HCN1 from cones was of no consequence. This work provides novel insights into the integration of rod and cone signaling in the retina and challenges our assumptions about the role of HCN1 in cones.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">ASD/OCD-Linked Protocadherin-10 Regulates Synapse, But Not Axon, Development in the Amygdala and Contributes to Fear- and Anxiety-Related Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>The <I>Protocadherin-10</I> (<I>PCDH10</I>) gene is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depression (MD). The PCDH10 protein is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that belongs to the 2-protocadherin family. PCDH10 is highly expressed in the developing brain, especially in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, the role of PCDH10 <I>in vivo</I> has been debatable: one paper reported that a <I>Pcdh10</I> mutant mouse line showed changes in axonal projections; however, another <I>Pcdh10</I> mutant mouse line was reported to have failed to detect axonal phenotypes. Therefore, the actual roles of PCDH10 in the brain remain to be elucidated. We established a new <I>Pcdh10</I> KO mouse line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, without inserting gene cassettes to avoid nonspecific effects, examined the roles of PCDH10 in the brain, and studied the behavioral consequences of <I>Pcdh10</I> inactivation. Here, we show that <I>Pcdh10</I> KO mice do not show defects in axonal development. Instead, we find that <I>Pcdh10</I> KO mice exhibit impaired development of excitatory synapses in the dorsal BLA. We further demonstrate that male <I>Pcdh10</I> KO mice exhibit reduced anxiety-related behaviors, impaired fear conditioning, decreased stress-coping responses, and mildly impaired social recognition and communication. These results indicate that PCDH10 plays a critical role in excitatory synapse development, but not axon development, in the dorsal BLA and that PCDH10 regulates anxiety-related, fear-related, and stress-related behaviors. Our results reveal the roles of PCDH10 in the brain and its relationship to relevant psychiatric disorders such as ASD, OCD, and MD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>Protocadherin-10</I> (<I>PCDH10</I>) encodes a cell adhesion molecule and is implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depression (MD). PCDH10 is highly expressed in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, the phenotypes of previously published <I>Pcdh10</I> mutant mice are debatable, and some are possibly because of the nonspecific effects of the <I>LacZ/Neo</I> cassette inserted in the mice. We have generated a new <I>Pcdh10</I> mutant mouse line without the <I>LacZ/Neo</I> cassette. Using our new mouse line, we reveal the roles of PCDH10 for excitatory synapse development in the BLA. The mutant mice exhibit anxiety-related, fear-related, and stress-related behaviors, which are relevant to ASD, OCD, and MD, suggesting a possible treatment strategy for such psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurons in the Dorsomedial Hypothalamus Promote, Prolong, and Deepen Torpor in the Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Torpor is a naturally occurring, hypometabolic, hypothermic state engaged by a wide range of animals in response to imbalance between the supply and demand for nutrients. Recent work has identified some of the key neuronal populations involved in daily torpor induction in mice, in particular, projections from the preoptic area of the hypothalamus to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). The DMH plays a role in thermoregulation, control of energy expenditure, and circadian rhythms, making it well positioned to contribute to the expression of torpor. We used activity-dependent genetic TRAPing techniques to target DMH neurons that were active during natural torpor bouts in female mice. Chemogenetic reactivation of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons in calorie-restricted mice promoted torpor, resulting in longer and deeper torpor bouts. Chemogenetic inhibition of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons did not block torpor entry, suggesting a modulatory role for the DMH in the control of torpor. This work adds to the evidence that the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and the DMH form part of a circuit within the mouse hypothalamus that controls entry into daily torpor.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Daily heterotherms, such as mice, use torpor to cope with environments in which the supply of metabolic fuel is not sufficient for the maintenance of normothermia. Daily torpor involves reductions in body temperature, as well as active suppression of heart rate and metabolism. How the CNS controls this profound deviation from normal homeostasis is not known, but a projection from the preoptic area to the dorsomedial hypothalamus has recently been implicated. We demonstrate that the dorsomedial hypothalamus contains neurons that are active during torpor. Activity in these neurons promotes torpor entry and maintenance, but their activation alone does not appear to be sufficient for torpor entry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Coupling of Mouse Olfactory Bulb Projection Neurons to Fluctuating Odor Pulses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Odors are transported by turbulent air currents, creating complex temporal fluctuations in odor concentration that provide a potentially informative stimulus dimension. We have shown that mice are able to discriminate odor stimuli based on their temporal structure, indicating that information contained in the temporal structure of odor plumes can be extracted by the mouse olfactory system. Here, using <I>in vivo</I> extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological recordings, we show that mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) of the male C57BL/6 mouse olfactory bulb can encode the dominant temporal frequencies present in odor stimuli up to at least 20 Hz. A substantial population of cell-odor pairs showed significant coupling of their subthreshold membrane potential with the odor stimulus at both 2 Hz (29/70) and the suprasniff frequency 20 Hz (24/70). Furthermore, mitral/tufted cells (M/TCs) show differential coupling of their membrane potential to odor concentration fluctuations with tufted cells coupling more strongly for the 20 Hz stimulation. Frequency coupling was always observed to be invariant to odor identity, and M/TCs that coupled well to a mixture also coupled to at least one of the components of the mixture. Interestingly, pharmacological blocking of the inhibitory circuitry strongly modulated frequency coupling of cell-odor pairs at both 2 Hz (10/15) and 20 Hz (9/15). These results provide insight into how both cellular and circuit properties contribute to the encoding of temporal odor features in the mouse olfactory bulb.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Odors in the natural environment have a strong temporal structure that can be extracted and used by mice in their behavior. Here, using <I>in vivo</I> extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological techniques, we show that the projection neurons in the olfactory bulb can encode and couple to the dominant frequency present in an odor stimulus. Furthermore, frequency coupling was observed to be differential between mitral and tufted cells and was odor invariant but strongly modulated by local inhibitory circuits. In summary, this study provides insight into how both cellular and circuit properties modulate encoding of odor temporal features in the mouse olfactory bulb.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pairing-Dependent Plasticity in a Dissected Fly Brain Is Input-Specific and Requires Synaptic CaMKII Enrichment and Nighttime Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>In <I>Drosophila</I>, <I>in vivo</I> functional imaging studies revealed that associative memory formation is coupled to a cascade of neural plasticity events in distinct compartments of the mushroom body (MB). In-depth investigation of the circuit dynamics, however, will require an <I>ex vivo</I> model that faithfully mirrors these events to allow direct manipulations of circuit elements that are inaccessible in the intact fly. The current <I>ex vivo</I> models have been able to reproduce the fundamental plasticity of aversive short-term memory, a potentiation of the MB intrinsic neuron (Kenyon cells [KCs]) responses after artificial learning <I>ex vivo</I>. However, this potentiation showed different localization and encoding properties from those reported <I>in vivo</I> and failed to generate the previously reported suppression plasticity in the MB output neurons (MBONs). Here, we develop an <I>ex vivo</I> model using the female <I>Drosophila</I> brain that recapitulates behaviorally evoked plasticity in the KCs and MBONs. We demonstrate that this plasticity accurately localizes to the MB &alpha;'3 compartment and is encoded by a coincidence between KC activation and dopaminergic input. The formed plasticity is input-specific, requiring pairing of the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus pathways; hence, we name it pairing-dependent plasticity. Pairing-dependent plasticity formation requires an intact <I>CaMKII</I> gene and is blocked by previous-night sleep deprivation but is rescued by rebound sleep. In conclusion, we show that our <I>ex vivo</I> preparation recapitulates behavioral and imaging results from intact animals and can provide new insights into mechanisms of memory formation at the level of molecules, circuits, and brain state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian <I>ex vivo</I> LTP model enabled in-depth investigation of the hippocampal memory circuit. We develop a parallel model to study the <I>Drosophila</I> mushroom body (MB) memory circuit. Pairing activation of the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus pathways in dissected brains induces a potentiation pairing-dependent plasticity (PDP) in the axons of &alpha;'&beta;' Kenyon cells and a suppression PDP in the dendrites of their postsynaptic MB output neurons, localized in the MB &alpha;'3 compartment. This PDP is input-specific and requires the 3' untranslated region of <I>CaMKII</I>. Interestingly, <I>ex vivo</I> PDP carries information about the animal's experience before dissection; brains from sleep-deprived animals fail to form PDP, whereas those from animals who recovered 2 h of their lost sleep form PDP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Distortion of Orientation Representation after Learning in the Mouse Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learning is an essential cognitive mechanism allowing behavioral adaptation through adjustments in neuronal processing. It is associated with changes in the activity of sensory cortical neurons evoked by task-relevant stimuli. However, the exact nature of those modifications and the computational advantages they may confer are still debated. Here, we investigated how learning an orientation discrimination task alters the neuronal representations of the cues orientations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of male and female mice. When comparing the activity evoked by the task stimuli in naive mice and the mice performing the task, we found that the representations of the orientation of the rewarded and nonrewarded cues were more accurate and stable in trained mice. This better cue representation in trained mice was associated with a distortion of the orientation representation space such that stimuli flanking the task-relevant orientations were represented as the task stimuli themselves, suggesting that those stimuli were generalized as the task cues. This distortion was context dependent as it was absent in trained mice passively viewing the task cues and enhanced in the behavioral sessions where mice performed best. Those modifications of the V1 population orientation representation in performing mice were supported by a suppression of the activity of neurons tuned for orientations neighboring the orientations of the task cues. Thus, visual processing in V1 is dynamically adapted to enhance the reliability of the representation of the learned cues and favor generalization in the task-relevant computational space.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Performance improvement in a task often requires facilitating the extraction of the information necessary to its execution. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a suppression mechanism that improves the representation of the orientations of the task stimuli in the V1 of mice performing an orientation discrimination task. We also show that this mechanism distorts the V1 orientation representation space, leading stimuli flanking the task stimuli orientations to be generalized as the task stimuli themselves.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Direct Comparison of Theta Power and Frequency to Speed and Acceleration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decades of hippocampal neurophysiology research have linked the hippocampal theta rhythm to voluntary movement. A consistent observation has been a robust correlation between the amplitude (or power) and frequency of hippocampal theta and running speed. Recently, however, it has been suggested that acceleration, not running speed, is the dominating influence on theta frequency. There is an inherent interdependence among these two variables, as acceleration is the rate of change in velocity. Therefore, we investigated theta frequency and amplitude of the local-field potential recorded from the stratum pyramidale, stratum radiatum, and stratum lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 subregion, considering both speed and acceleration in tandem as animals traversed a circular task or performed continuous alternation. In male and female rats volitionally controlling their own running characteristics, we found that running speed carries nearly all of the variability in theta frequency and power, with a minute contribution from acceleration. These results contradicted a recent publication using a speed-clamping task, where acceleration and movement are compelled through the use of a bottomless car (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B26">Kropff et al., 2021a</cross-ref>). Therefore, we reanalyzed the speed-clamping data replicating a transient increase in theta frequency during acceleration. Compared with track running rats, the speed-clamped animals exhibited lower velocities and acceleration values but still showed a stronger influence of speed on theta frequency relative to acceleration. As navigation is the integration of many sensory inputs that are not necessarily linearly related, we offer caution in making absolute claims regarding hippocampal physiology from correlates garnered from a single behavioral repertoire.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A long-standing, replicable observation has been the increase of hippocampal theta power and frequency with increasing running speed. Recently, however, an experimental approach that clamps the running speed of an animal has suggested that acceleration is the dominant influence. Therefore, we analyzed data from freely behaving rats as well as data from the speed-clamping experiment. In unrestrained behavior, speed remains the dominant behavioral correlate to theta amplitude and frequency. Positive acceleration in the speed-clamp experiment induced a transient increase in theta frequency and power. However, speed retained the dominant influence over theta frequency, changing with velocity in both acceleration and deceleration conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anterior Cingulate Cortex Signals the Need to Control Intrusive Thoughts during Motivated Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do people limit awareness of unwanted memories? When such memories intrude, a control process engages the right DLPFC (rDLPFC) to inhibit hippocampal activity and stop retrieval. It remains unknown how the need for control is detected, and whether control operates proactively to prevent unwelcome memories from being retrieved, or responds reactively, to counteract intrusions. We hypothesized that dorsal ACC (dACC) detects the emergence of an unwanted trace in awareness and transmits the need for inhibitory control to rDLPFC. During a memory suppression task, we measured in humans (both sexes) trial-by-trial variations in the theta power and N2 amplitude of dACC, two EEG markers that are thought to reflect the need for control. With simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings, we tracked interactions among dACC, rDLPFC, and hippocampus during suppression. We found a clear role of dACC in detecting the need for memory control and upregulating prefrontal inhibition. Importantly, we identified distinct early (300&ndash;450 ms) and late (500&ndash;700 ms) dACC contributions, suggesting both proactive control before recollection and reactive control in response to intrusions. Stronger early activity was associated with reduced hippocampal activity and diminished BOLD signal in dACC and rDLPFC, suggesting that preempting retrieval reduced overall control demands. In the later window, dACC activity was larger, and effective connectivity analyses revealed robust communication from dACC to rDLPFC and from rDLPFC to hippocampus, which are tied to successful forgetting. Together, our findings support a model in which dACC detects the emergence of unwanted content, triggering top-down inhibitory control, and in which rDLPFC countermands intruding thoughts that penetrate awareness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Preventing unwanted memories from coming to mind is an adaptive ability of humans. This ability relies on inhibitory control processes in the prefrontal cortex to modulate hippocampal retrieval processes. How and when reminders to unwelcome memories come to trigger prefrontal control mechanisms remains unknown. Here we acquired neuroimaging data with both high spatial and temporal resolution as participants suppressed specific memories. We found that the anterior cingulate cortex detects the need for memory control, responding both proactively to early warning signals about unwelcome content and reactively to intrusive thoughts themselves. When unwanted traces emerge in awareness, anterior cingulate communicates with prefrontal cortex and triggers top-down inhibitory control over the hippocampus through specific neural oscillatory networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prediction Error Determines Whether NMDA Receptors in the Basolateral Amygdala Complex Are Involved in Pavlovian Fear Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is widely accepted that activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) is necessary for the formation of fear memories in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). This acceptance is based on findings that blockade of NMDAR in the BLA disrupts Pavlovian fear conditioning in rodents when initially innocuous stimuli are paired with aversive and unexpected events (surprising foot shock). The present study challenges this acceptance by showing that the involvement of NMDAR in Pavlovian fear conditioning is determined by prediction errors in relation to aversive events. In the initial experiments, male rats received a BLA infusion of the NMDAR antagonist, D-AP5 and were then exposed to pairings of a novel target stimulus and foot shock. This infusion disrupted acquisition of fear to the target when the shock was surprising (experiments 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b) but spared fear to the target when the shock was expected based on the context, time and other stimuli that were present (experiments 1a and 1b). Under the latter circumstances, fear to the target required activation of calcium-permeable AMPAR (CP-AMPA; experiments 4a, 4b, and 4c), which, using electrophysiology, were shown to regulate the activity of interneurons in the BLA (experiment 5). Thus, NMDAR activation is not required for fear conditioning when danger occurs as expected given the context, time and stimuli present, but is required for fear conditioning when danger occurs unexpectedly. These findings are related to current theories of NMDAR function and ways that prediction errors might influence the substrates of fear memory formation in the BLA.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is widely accepted that NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) are activated by pairings of a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an aversive unconditioned (US) stimulus, leading to the synaptic changes that underlie formation of a CS-US association. The present findings are significant in showing that this theory is incomplete. When the aversive US is unexpected, animals encode all features of the situation (context, time and stimuli present) as a new fear/threat memory, which is regulated by NMDAR in the BLA. However, when the US is expected based on the context, time and stimuli present, the new fear memory is assimilated into networks that represent those features, which occurs independently of NMDAR activation in the BLA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Signals from Single-Opponent Cortical Cells in the Human cVEP</a></h4>

              
                <p>We used the chromatic visual evoked potential (cVEP) to study responses in human visual cortex evoked by equiluminant color stimuli for 6 male and 11 female observers. Large-area, colored squares were used to stimulate Single-Opponent cells preferentially, and fine color-checkerboard stimuli were used to activate Double-Opponent responses preferentially. Stimuli were modulated along the following two directions in color space: (1) the cardinal direction, L-M or M-L of DKL (Derrington, Krauskopf, and Lennie) space; and (2) the line from the white point to the color of the Red LED in the display screen, which was approximately intermediate between the L-M and -S directions in DKL space in cone-contrast coordinates. The amplitudes of cVEPs to large squares were smaller than those to checkerboards, and the latency of the cVEP response to squares was significantly less than the checkerboard latency. The latency of cVEP responses to the squares varied little with cone-contrast unlike the steep reduction of latency with cone-contrast observed in responses to color checkerboard patterns. The dynamic differences between cVEPs to squares and checkerboards support the hypothesis that a distinct neuronal mechanism responded to squares: Single-Opponent cells. Response amplitude, latency, and transientness&mdash;and their dependence on cone-contrast&mdash;were similar in the responses in the L-M and Red color directions. The similarity supports the hypothesis that the Single-Opponent signals in the cVEP come from a distinct population of cells that receives subtractive inputs from L and M cones, either L-M or M-L.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This article is about characterizing the visual behavior of a distinct population of neurons in the human visual cortex, the Single-Opponent color cells. Based on single-cell results in the visual cortex of macaque monkeys, we used large uniformly colored stimuli to isolate the responses of Single-Opponent cells in the chromatic visual evoked potential (cVEP) recorded on the scalp of human observers. VEP signals recorded under conditions believed to reveal Single-Opponent responses are small and transient. Their time course is relatively unaffected by cone-contrast, and they are relatively insensitive to stimulus modulation of short wavelength-sensitive S cones. Because Single-Opponent cells convey signals that can be used to judge the color of scene illumination, knowing their visual properties is important for understanding color vision.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dopaminergic Modulation of Dynamic Emotion Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emotion recognition abilities are fundamental to our everyday social interaction. A large number of clinical populations show impairments in this domain, with emotion recognition atypicalities being particularly prevalent among disorders exhibiting a dopamine system disruption (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Although this suggests a role for dopamine in emotion recognition, studies employing dopamine manipulation in healthy volunteers have exhibited mixed neural findings and no behavioral modulation. Interestingly, while a dependence of dopaminergic drug effects on individual baseline dopamine function has been well established in other cognitive domains, the emotion recognition literature so far has failed to account for these possible interindividual differences. The present within-subjects study therefore tested the effects of the dopamine D2 antagonist haloperidol on emotion recognition from dynamic, whole-body stimuli while accounting for interindividual differences in baseline dopamine. A total of 33 healthy male and female adults rated emotional point-light walkers (PLWs) once after ingestion of 2.5 mg haloperidol and once after placebo. To evaluate potential mechanistic pathways of the dopaminergic modulation of emotion recognition, participants also performed motoric and counting-based indices of temporal processing. Confirming our hypotheses, effects of haloperidol on emotion recognition depended on baseline dopamine function, where individuals with low baseline dopamine showed enhanced, and those with high baseline dopamine decreased emotion recognition. Drug effects on emotion recognition were related to drug effects on movement-based and explicit timing mechanisms, indicating possible mediating effects of temporal processing. Results highlight the need for future studies to account for baseline dopamine and suggest putative mechanisms underlying the dopaminergic modulation of emotion recognition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A high prevalence of emotion recognition difficulties among clinical conditions where the dopamine system is affected suggests an involvement of dopamine in emotion recognition processes. However, previous psychopharmacological studies seeking to confirm this role in healthy volunteers thus far have failed to establish whether dopamine affects emotion recognition and lack mechanistic insights. The present study uncovered effects of dopamine on emotion recognition in healthy individuals by controlling for interindividual differences in baseline dopamine function and investigated potential mechanistic pathways via which dopamine may modulate emotion recognition. Our findings suggest that dopamine may influence emotion recognition via its effects on temporal processing, providing new directions for future research on typical and atypical emotion recognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brain Network Allostasis after Chronic Alcohol Drinking Is Characterized by Functional Dedifferentiation and Narrowing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) causes complex alterations in the brain that are poorly understood. The heterogeneity of drinking patterns and the high incidence of comorbid factors compromise mechanistic investigations in AUD patients. Here we used male Marchigian Sardinian alcohol-preferring (msP) rats, a well established animal model of chronic alcohol drinking, and a combination of longitudinal resting-state fMRI and manganese-enhanced MRI to provide objective measurements of brain connectivity and activity, respectively. We found that 1 month of chronic alcohol drinking changed the correlation between resting-state networks. The change was not homogeneous, resulting in the reorganization of pairwise interactions and a shift in the equilibrium of functional connections. We identified two fundamentally different forms of network reorganization. First is functional dedifferentiation, which is defined as a regional increase in neuronal activity and overall correlation, with a concomitant decrease in preferential connectivity between specific networks. Through this mechanism, occipital cortical areas lost their specific interaction with sensory-insular cortex, striatal, and sensorimotor networks. Second is functional narrowing, which is defined as an increase in neuronal activity and preferential connectivity between specific brain networks. Functional narrowing strengthened the interaction between striatal and prefrontocortical networks, involving the anterior insular, cingulate, orbitofrontal, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices. Importantly, these two types of alterations persisted after alcohol discontinuation, suggesting that dedifferentiation and functional narrowing rendered persistent network states. Our results support the idea that chronic alcohol drinking, albeit at moderate intoxicating levels, induces an allostatic change in the brain functional connectivity that propagates into early abstinence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excessive consumption of alcohol is positioned among the top five risk factors for disease and disability. Despite this priority, the transformations that the nervous system undergoes from an alcohol-naive state to a pathologic alcohol drinking are not well understood. In our study, we use an animal model with proven translational validity to study this transformation longitudinally. The results show that shortly after chronic alcohol consumption there is an increase in redundant activity shared by brain structures, and the specific communication shrinks to a set of pathways. This functional dedifferentiation and narrowing are not reversed immediately after alcohol withdrawal but persist during early abstinence. We causally link chronic alcohol drinking with an early and abstinence-persistent retuning of the functional equilibrium of the brain.</p>

                Background: Understanding the causes of patient safety incidents is essential for improving patient safety; therefore, reporting and analysis of these incidents is a key imperative. Despite its implemention more than 15 years ago, the institutionalization of incident reporting in Indonesian hospitals is far from satisfactory. The aim of this study was to analyze the factors responsible for under-reporting of patient safety incidents in Indonesian public hospitals from the perspectives of leaders of hospitals, government departments, and independent institutions. Methods: A qualitative research methodology was adopted for this study using semi-structured interviews of key informants. 25 participants working at nine organizations (government departments, independent institutions, and public hospitals) were interviewed. The interview transcripts were analyzed using a deductive analytic approach. Nvivo 10 was used to for data processing prior to thematic analysis. Results: The key factors contributing to the under-reporting of patient safety incidents were categorized as hospital related and nonhospital related (government or independent agency). The hospital-related factors were: lack of understanding, knowledge, and responsibility for reporting; lack of leadership and institutional culture of reporting incidents; perception of reporting as an additional burden. The nonhospital-related factors were: lack of feedback and training; lack of confidentiality mechanisms in the system; absence of policy safeguards to prevent any punitive measures against the reporting hospital; lack of leadership. Conclusion: Our study identified factors contributing to the under-reporting of patient safety incidents in Indonesia. The lack of government support and absence of political will to improve patient safety incident reporting appear to be the root causes of under-reporting. Our findings call for concerted efforts involving government, independent agencies, hospitals, and other stakeholders for instituting reforms in the patient safety incident reporting system.

                Background: Young people in their teens and twenties don’t seek treatment immediately for mental health issues. This is due to the perceived stigma linked to mental health, pragmatic inconveniences to reach clinical settings, and the tediousness to seek help or engage with adults in traditional ways. Alternative approaches aside from drugs administration are needed. Method: We conducted an internet-delivered pilot randomized controlled trial directed to Hikikomori and Futōkō experienced subjects. This study aimed to understand the difference in efficacy for an intervention using a fictional story vs factual scientific information (self-aid texts), as well as the feasibility of an internet delivered program .. Evaluation of emotional transportation and mental health related measures were administered at base line before the program and at one week after the completion of the program. Results: 40 participants were enrolled. A post-intervention (T2) Independent T-student showed that Emotional Transportation was significantly lower for the intervention group than for the control group at T2. Relaxation was significantly higher for the intervention group than for the control group at T2. For the other outcome variables, the difference was not statistically significant.  An ANCOVA showed that there was a significant effect of groups on emotional transportation (lower in the intervention group). There was a significant effect of groups on empathy (lower in the intervention group); for the other variables the effects of groups were not detected. Conclusions: The results showed a significant diminishment in emotional transportation and empathy for the interventional group contradicting the hypothesis that an enhancement of emotional transportation mediates the positive mental health effects. A marginal improvement in relaxation in the intervention group (T-test) was found. In the posthoc analysis, the positive effects on the relaxation of pre-intervention (habitual) high emotional status of participants were confirmed. This trial is registered with UMIN, ID UMIN000044204.

                Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an uncommon microangiopathic disease and sometimes is associated with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). However, this probable causal relationship has not been completely proven. The diagnostic differentiation of both diseases is difficult in the first instance because they share similar characteristics that may overlap. We present a case of a 32-year-old woman with antecedents of epileptic seizures since she was 12 years old. The patient was admitted to the emergency room with a clinical picture of headaches, fever, paleness in the skin and mucosa, confused state, paresthesia, and transient spasticity of the extremities. The laboratory results revealed direct Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, significant elevation of lactate dehydrogenase, and presence of schistocytes ++ in the peripheral film. In addition, positive antinuclear antibodies and positive anti-native DNA in titers of 1/320 and 1/160, respectively, were found. Urinalysis showed that serum creatinine was in normal range. Because of limited hospital resources, ADAMTS13 was not evaluated. However, based on clinical, hematological, and biochemical findings, we concluded that it was a case of TTP associated with SLE and indicated treatment with plasmapheresis and methylprednisolone pulses, obtaining a satisfactory response (normalization of biomarker levels, health condition) after the second session of plasmapheresis. Diagnosis of both SLE and TTP is often difficult to achieve; however, adequate correlation of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests, along with the help of partial therapeutic interventions, may lead to good clinical response.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study of bypassing Microsoft Windows Security using the MITRE CALDERA Framework [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microsoft Windows Security is a recently implemented safeguard for the Windows operating systems, including the latest versions of Windows10 and 11. However, there is a major shortcoming in this system to stop Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). These are government-financed groups that are funded to attack other government entities. Following the initial security breach, the hacked Windows device is used to access the rest of the network devices in order to transfer data to external storage (Exfiltration). Methods: In this work, we have tested the Microsoft Windows Security system using MITRE CALDERA and ATT&CK frameworks and explain how APT groups are able to bypass Windows Security. Results: In this study we used "54ndc47" agent through GoLang feature in MITRE CALDERA platform to test and bypass Microsoft Windows Security systems (MS Windows 10). Through it, we were able to bypass the Windows Security system and display entire files in the victim's device. Conclusions: In this paper, we have provided recommendations to Microsoft to improve their Windows Security tool through the use of Artificial intelligence (AI).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Anatomy of the first six months of COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolò Gozzi, Matteo Chinazzi, Jessica T. Davis, Kunpeng Mu, Ana Pastore y Piontti, Marco Ajelli, Nicola Perra, Alessandro Vespignani</p>

We analyze the effectiveness of the first six months of vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 in Italy by using a computational epidemic model which takes into account demographic, mobility, vaccines data, as well as estimates of the introduction and spreading of the more transmissible Alpha variant. We consider six sub-national regions and study the effect of vaccines in terms of number of averted deaths, infections, and reduction in the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) with respect to counterfactual scenarios with the actual non-pharmaceuticals interventions but no vaccine administration. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness in counterfactual scenarios with different vaccines allocation strategies and vaccination rates. Our results show that, as of 2021/07/05, vaccines averted 29, 350 (<i>IQR</i>: [16, 454–42, 826]) deaths and 4, 256, 332 (<i>IQR</i>: [1, 675, 564–6, 980, 070]) infections and a new pandemic wave in the country. During the same period, they achieved a −22.2% (<i>IQR</i>: [−31.4%; −13.9%]) IFR reduction. We show that a campaign that would have strictly prioritized age groups at higher risk of dying from COVID-19, besides frontline workers and the fragile population, would have implied additional benefits both in terms of avoided fatalities and reduction in the IFR. Strategies targeting the most active age groups would have prevented a higher number of infections but would have been associated with more deaths. Finally, we study the effects of different vaccination intake scenarios by rescaling the number of available doses in the time period under study to those administered in other countries of reference. The modeling framework can be applied to other countries to provide a mechanistic characterization of vaccination campaigns worldwide.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The catalytic mechanism of the mitochondrial methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (MTHFD2)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Li Na Zhao, Philipp Kaldis</p>

Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (MTHFD2) is a new drug target that is expressed in cancer cells but not in normal adult cells, which provides an Achilles heel to selectively kill cancer cells. Despite the availability of crystal structures of MTHFD2 in the inhibitor- and cofactor-bound forms, key information is missing due to technical limitations, including (a) the location of absolutely required Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, and (b) the substrate-bound form of MTHFD2. Using computational modeling and simulations, we propose that two magnesium ions are present at the active site whereby (i) Arg233, Asp225, and two water molecules coordinate MgA2+, while MgA2+ together with Arg233 stabilize the inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>); (ii) Asp168 and three water molecules coordinate MgB2+, and MgB2+ further stabilizes P<sub>i</sub> by forming a hydrogen bond with two oxygens of P<sub>i</sub>; (iii) Arg201 directly coordinates the P<sub>i</sub>; and (iv) through three water-mediated interactions, Asp168 contributes to the positioning and stabilization of MgA2+, MgB2+ and P<sub>i</sub>. Our computational study at the empirical valence bond level allowed us also to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanisms. We found that the dehydrogenase activity features a proton-coupled electron transfer with charge redistribution connected to the reorganization of the surrounding water molecules which further facilitates the subsequent cyclohydrolase activity. The cyclohydrolase activity then drives the hydration of the imidazoline ring and the ring opening in a concerted way. Furthermore, we have uncovered that two key residues, Ser197/Arg233, are important factors in determining the cofactor (NADP<sup>+</sup>/NAD<sup>+</sup>) preference of the dehydrogenase activity. Our work sheds new light on the structural and kinetic framework of MTHFD2, which will be helpful to design small molecule inhibitors that can be used for cancer treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Brain stimulation competes with ongoing oscillations for control of spike timing in the primate brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew R. Krause, Pedro G. Vieira, Jean-Philippe Thivierge, Christopher C. Pack</p>

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a popular method for modulating brain activity noninvasively. In particular, tACS is often used as a targeted intervention that enhances a neural oscillation at a specific frequency to affect a particular behavior. However, these interventions often yield highly variable results. Here, we provide a potential explanation for this variability: tACS competes with the brain’s ongoing oscillations. Using neural recordings from alert nonhuman primates, we find that when neural firing is independent of ongoing brain oscillations, tACS readily entrains spiking activity, but when neurons are strongly entrained to ongoing oscillations, tACS often causes a decrease in entrainment instead. Consequently, tACS can yield categorically different results on neural activity, even when the stimulation protocol is fixed. Mathematical analysis suggests that this competition is likely to occur under many experimental conditions. Attempting to impose an external rhythm on the brain may therefore often yield precisely the opposite effect.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Distinct neuronal types contribute to hybrid temporal encoding strategies in primate auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiao-Ping Liu, Xiaoqin Wang</p>

Studies of the encoding of sensory stimuli by the brain often consider recorded neurons as a pool of identical units. Here, we report divergence in stimulus-encoding properties between subpopulations of cortical neurons that are classified based on spike timing and waveform features. Neurons in auditory cortex of the awake marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) encode temporal information with either stimulus-synchronized or nonsynchronized responses. When we classified single-unit recordings using either a criteria-based or an unsupervised classification method into regular-spiking, fast-spiking, and bursting units, a subset of intrinsically bursting neurons formed the most highly synchronized group, with strong phase-locking to sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) that extended well above 20 Hz. In contrast with other unit types, these bursting neurons fired primarily on the rising phase of SAM or the onset of unmodulated stimuli, and preferred rapid stimulus onset rates. Such differentiating behavior has been previously reported in bursting neuron models and may reflect specializations for detection of acoustic edges. These units responded to natural stimuli (vocalizations) with brief and precise spiking at particular time points that could be decoded with high temporal stringency. Regular-spiking units better reflected the shape of slow modulations and responded more selectively to vocalizations with overall firing rate increases. Population decoding using time-binned neural activity found that decoding behavior differed substantially between regular-spiking and bursting units. A relatively small pool of bursting units was sufficient to identify the stimulus with high accuracy in a manner that relied on the temporal pattern of responses. These unit type differences may contribute to parallel and complementary neural codes.

                Unsupervised learning, and more specifically clustering, suffers from the need for expertise in the field to be of use. Researchers must make careful and informed decisions on which algorithm to use with which set of hyperparameters for a given dataset. Additionally, researchers may need to determine the number of clusters in the dataset, which is unfortunately itself an input to most clustering algorithms; all of this before embarking on their actual subject matter work. After quantifying the impact of algorithm and hyperparameter selection, we propose an ensemble clustering framework which can be leveraged with minimal input. It can be used to determine both the number of clusters in the dataset and a suitable choice of algorithm to use for a given dataset. A code library is included in the Conclusions for ease of integration.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison between the effects of older versus newer generations of antiepileptic drugs on bone metabolism in adult Iraqi patients: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabolic bone disorder is a significant endocrine system disorder that encompasses any disorder that alters the natural skeleton's mineralization process. Epilepsy is a prevalent central nervous system disorder that can cause biochemical abnormalities involving bone metabolism in the epileptic patients. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic use of older compared to the newer generations of antiepileptic drugs on bone metabolism-related biomarkers. Methods: The study included fifty-one epileptic outpatients who attended the Consultation Clinic of Baghdad Teaching Hospital at the Medical City Complex from October/2021 to December/2021. The selected patients were on antiepileptic drugs for more than 2 years, hence were grouped according to their antiepileptic therapy into: Group-1: 24 epileptic patients on old antiepileptic drugs (Carbamazepine or Valproate). Group-2: 27 epileptic patients on new antiepileptic drugs (Levetiracetam), compared with Group-3: 28 healthy control subjects. Serum was obtained from their blood specimens to measure: calcium and inorganic phosphate by colorimetric assays, parathyroid hormone, and level of bone alkaline phosphatase activity. Results: Data analysis revealed that the median value of serum parathyroid hormone levels was significantly elevated in the epileptic patients' groups compared to the healthy control group. However, group-2 (new generation antiepileptic drugs) presented higher values. Whereas serum calcium and inorganic phosphate levels showed non-significant variation for all the studied groups. Furthermore, serum bone alkaline phosphatase activity exhibited significantly higher values in the patients compared to the healthy subjects group, with more significant elevation among those on old generation antiepileptic drugs (Carbamazepine or Valproate). Conclusion: Epileptic individuals who had been on AEDs for more than two years had increased parathyroid hormone levels, which were boosted by the newer antiepileptic drug Levetiracetam. Furthermore, BAP serum levels were considerably greater in epileptic patients than in healthy control participants, with larger values generated by older antiepileptic medications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does the autism phenotype differ when selecting groups by neurodevelopmental versus genetic diagnosis? An observational study comparing autism and sex chromosome trisomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism is diagnosed on the basis of social and non-social behavioural features that are assumed to cluster together, and assumed to be distinct from other aspects of development, such as language ability. It is unclear, however, if these assumptions are valid. This study presents a novel approach to answering this question by investigating whether correlations between autism features are similar for groups selected on behavioural versus genetic diagnosis. Methods: The autism phenotype was assessed by diagnostic interview in young people aged 7 to 14 diagnosed with autism (N=61) or sex chromosome trisomy (SCT; N=49). Data were analysed by confirmatory factor analysis and MANOVA. Results: Autism features showed a similar factor structure and were distinct from language ability in both groups. However, the SCT group was more likely to show clinically-significant difficulties in just some aspects of autism and a lower level of non-social autism features for their social-communication disabilities. Conclusions: We suggest the group differences emerged because autism diagnostic criteria do not map exactly on the autism phenotype as it manifests “naturally”. Conventional diagnostic criteria for autism miss those with uneven profiles of difficulty and those with relatively low levels of restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests.

                Background: Some firms with good growth opportunities and additional funds could have difficulties accessing external finance. One possible way to enhance their financial inclusion could be an exciting approach to planning the money reserve collected on a firm’s account. Methods: This article aims to disclose the introduction of financial logistics as the new theoretical field of management science. The authors present, in this paper, the key findings on the development of logistical models of an optimum money reserve calculation taking into account digital transformation and industry 4.0 technologies and optimization methods. Results: The monetary reserve models are analogies of models of storekeeping in supply chains. The specific area of the theoretical research of logistics is shown in this paper, which could be disclosed as the subject of financial logistics as a science. The authors consider the term “Financial Logistics” based on logistics theory and money demand. Conclusions: Authors suggest the methodology of studying the nature of both financial and material flows of resources by comparing the relevant formulas. From the researchers’ points of view, financial logistics could be defined as the theory of managing the cash flows based on the logistical models for calculating a corporation’s cash reserve. The authors find it interesting to expand the conditions for calculating financial flows since the uncertainty of external market conditions always influences actual commercial activity.

                Background: Amiodarone and beta-blockers are widely used as prophylaxis for postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). The current recommendations from society guidelines are inconclusive, leading to differing practices among physicians. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of both agents in preventing postoperative AF after cardiac surgery. Methods: We explored online medical databases, such as CINAHL, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amiodarone and beta-blocker for prevention of AF after cardiac surgery. Outcomes analysed in this study were AF number of events and duration, hospital stay, and mean ventricular rate. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test, and publication bias was analysed using Egger’s test.  Results: In total, eight RCTs comprising 1370 patients met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed that patients in both groups had no significant difference in both AF episodes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.04, p=0.10) and AF duration (SMD 0.46, 95% CI -1.14 to 2.05, p=0.57). Furthermore, secondary outcome analysis on mean ventricular rate and mean hospital length of stay in both groups showed no significant difference (MD -4.48, 95% CI -14.36 to 5.39, p=0.37 and MD 0.29, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.63, p=0.11, respectively).  Conclusions: Amiodarone and beta-blockers are equally effective in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, with no difference in AF episode and duration, mean ventricular rate, and hospital length of stay.

                Background: The closure of universities due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may alter the behaviour of students. This study aimed to determine the effect of the pandemic on physical activity and sitting time in French students prior to confinement and during confinement. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on data collected via an online questionnaire for university students during the second confinement in France (between October and December 2020). Participants (N= 2873) completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, which assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and contained questions about modes of transport, and perception of uninterrupted sitting time and screen time prior to confinement and during confinement. Multiple regression models assessed how active transportation, uninterrupted sitting time, and screen time studying increased or reduced confinement effects on physical activity and sitting time. Results: The regression models showed that physical activity decreased during confinement for students who engaged in more prolonged periods of active transportation prior to confinement. Moreover, the perception of long, uninterrupted sitting time and high screen time prior to confinement significantly increased sitting time during confinement. Students who adopted the most active transport time prior to confinement were the least likely to increase their screen time during confinement. Conclusions: Confinement reduced physical activity levels and increased sitting time, mainly among students who adopted active transport and accumulated longer uninterrupted sitting time. Students who combined-long periods of uninterrupted sitting time with high screen use could be a riskier profile for health. Analysis of physical activity time and sitting position should include its accumulation patterns.

                As of 2022, myocardial injury associated with COVID-19 has been one of the most discussed topics in literature. Though variety of cardiac manifestations have been reported and described in scientific literature, case of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has not been well reported and described. We present a case of DCM post-COVID-19 without any co-morbidities who was admitted several times for cardiac symptoms post-COVID-19. As it was a new finding associated with COVID-19, it has been worth understanding the variations in which cardiac conditions manifest in COVID-19.

                Background: To determine the prevalence and associated factors of adolescent pregnancy in Peru, 2015-2019. Methods: A population-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using pooled data from the Demographic and Family Health Surveys of Peru 2015-2019. A total weighted sample of 6892 adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 years with a history of sexual intercourse were included. Finally, the adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported to determine the factors that were significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy. Results: The prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in Peru was 30.1% (95%CI: 28.4–31.8%). In the multivariable analysis; being 17-19 years (aPR: 1.38; 95%CI :1.22–1.56), having a partner (aPR: 4.08; 95%CI: 3.46–4.81) and belonging to the Quechua ethnicity group (aPR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.09–1.32), were associated with a higher prevalence. Whereas, having an occupation (aPR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.75–0.88), currently studying (aPR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.36–0.49), belonging to the second (aPR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.84–0.98), third (aPR: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.72–0.89), fourth (aPR: 0.76; 95%CI: 0.64–0.89) and fifth (aPR: 0.55; 95%CI: 0.41–0.73) wealth quintile, initiating sexual relations between 17-19 years (aPR: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.46–0.59), perceiving a future pregnancy as a problem (aPR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.70–0.83) and knowledge of the moment in the cycle when she could become pregnant (aPR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76–0.93), were associated with a lower prevalence of pregnancy. Conclusions: About three in 10 adolescents who initiated their sexual life presented with at least one pregnancy. Age, marital status, employment, education, wealth, ethnicity, age at first intercourse, knowledge of when in the cycle she may become pregnant, and perception of future pregnancy were associated with adolescent pregnancy. It is necessary to increase national policies on family planning and sex education among adolescents to reduce the prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in Peru.

                Dobosh et al. recapitulate infection by SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent inflammation by blood monocytes entering the lung in a human small airway model. Lung-recruited monocytes acquire SARS-CoV-2 from the infected epithelium, but are unable to propagate virus. The immunomodulatory drug baricitinib promotes antiviral signaling in monocytes, which enhances clearance of SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MAF1, a repressor of RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription, regulates bone mass</a></h4>

              
                MAF1, a key repressor of RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription, has been shown to promote mesoderm formation <i>in vitro</i>. Here, we show that MAF1 plays a critical role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone mass. A high bone mass phenotype was noted in mice with a global deletion of <i>Maf1</i> (<i>Maf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice). However, osteoblasts isolated from <i>Maf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice showed reduced osteoblastogenesis <i>ex vivo.</i> Therefore, we determined the effect of MAF1 overexpression specifically in cells from the mesenchymal lineage (<i>Prx1</i>-Cre;LSL-<i>MAF1</i> mice). These mice showed increased bone mass.<i> Ex vivo, </i>cells from <i>Prx1</i>-Cre;LSL-<i>MAF1</i> mice showed enhanced osteoblastogenesis concordant with their high bone mass phenotype. Thus, the high bone mass phenotype in <i>Maf1<sup>-/-</sup></i><sup> </sup>mice is likely due to the confounding effects of the global absence of Maf1 in <i>Maf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. MAF1 overexpression promoted osteoblast differentiation and shRNA-mediated Maf1 downregulation inhibited differentiation of ST2 cells, overall indicating MAF1 enhances osteoblast formation. We also found that, in contrast to MAF1 overexpression, other perturbations that repress RNA pol III transcription, including Brf1 knockdown and chemical inhibition of RNA pol III by ML-60218, inhibited osteoblast differentiation. All perturbations that decrease RNA pol III transcription, however, enhanced adipogenesis in ST2 cell cultures. RNA-seq was used to determine the basis for these opposing actions on osteoblast differentiation. The modalities used to perturb RNA pol III transcription resulted in distinct gene expression changes, indicating that this transcription process is highly sensitive and triggers diverse gene expression programs and phenotypic outcomes. Specifically, MAF1 induced genes in ST2 cells known to promote osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, genes that are induced during osteoblast differentiation displayed codon bias. Together, these results reveal a novel role for MAF1 and RNA pol III-mediated transcription in osteoblast fate determination and differentiation and bone mass regulation.

                Gustatory sensory neurons detect caloric and harmful compounds in potential food and convey this information to the brain to inform feeding decisions. To examine the signals that gustatory neurons transmit and receive, we reconstructed gustatory axons and their synaptic sites in the adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> brain, utilizing a whole-brain electron microscopy volume. We reconstructed 87 gustatory projections from the proboscis labellum in the right hemisphere and 57 from the left, representing the majority of labellar gustatory axons. Gustatory neurons contain a nearly equal number of interspersed pre-and post-synaptic sites, with extensive synaptic connectivity among gustatory axons. Morphology- and connectivity-based clustering revealed six distinct groups, likely representing neurons recognizing different taste modalities. The vast majority of synaptic connections are between neurons of the same group. This study resolves the anatomy of labellar gustatory projections, reveals that gustatory projections are segregated based on taste modality, and uncovers synaptic connections that may alter the transmission of gustatory signals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perception of an object’s global shape is best described by a model of skeletal structure in human infants</a></h4>

              
                Categorization of everyday objects requires that humans form representations of shape that are tolerant to variations among exemplars. Yet, how such invariant shape representations develop remains poorly understood. By comparing human infants (6–12 months; N=82) to computational models of vision using comparable procedures, we shed light on the origins and mechanisms underlying object perception. Following habituation to a never-before-seen object, infants classified other novel objects across variations in their component parts. Comparisons to several computational models of vision, including models of high-level and low-level vision, revealed that infants’ performance was best described by a model of shape based on the skeletal structure. Interestingly, infants outperformed a range of artificial neural network models, selected for their massive object experience and biological plausibility, under the same conditions. Altogether, these findings suggest that robust representations of shape can be formed with little language or object experience by relying on the perceptually invariant skeletal structure.

                Light touch sensation begins with activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) endings in the skin and propagation of their signals to the spinal cord and brainstem. We found that the clustered protocadherin gamma (Pcdhg) gene locus, which encodes 22 cell-surface homophilic binding proteins, is required in somatosensory neurons for normal behavioral reactivity to a range of tactile stimuli. Developmentally, distinct Pcdhg isoforms mediate LTMR synapse formation through neuron-neuron interactions and peripheral axonal branching through neuron-glia interactions. The Pcdhgc3 isoform mediates homophilic interactions between sensory axons and spinal cord neurons to promote synapse formation in vivo, and is sufficient to induce postsynaptic specializations in vitro. Moreover, loss of Pcdhgs and somatosensory synaptic inputs to the dorsal horn lead to fewer corticospinal synapses onto dorsal horn neurons. These findings reveal essential roles for Pcdhg isoform diversity in somatosensory neuron synapse formation, peripheral axonal branching, and step-wise assembly of central mechanosensory circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Handedness is associated with less common input to spinal motor neurons innervating different hand muscles</a></h4>

              
                Whether the neural control of manual behaviours differs between the dominant and non-dominant hand is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether the level of common synaptic input to motor neurons innervating the same or different muscles differs between the dominant and the non-dominant hand. Seventeen participants performed two motor tasks with distinct mechanical requirements: an isometric pinch and an isometric rotation of a pinched dial. Each task was performed at 30% of maximum effort and was repeated with the dominant and non-dominant hand. Motor units were identified from two intrinsic (flexor digitorum interosseous and thenar) and one extrinsic muscle (flexor digitorum superficialis) from high-density surface electromyography recordings. Two complementary approaches were used to estimate common synaptic inputs. First, we calculated the coherence between groups of motor neurons from the same and from different muscles. Then, we estimated the common input for all pairs of motor neurons by correlating the low-frequency oscillations of their discharge rate. Both analyses led to the same conclusion, indicating less common synaptic input between motor neurons innervating different muscles in the dominant hand than in the non-dominant hand, which was only observed during the isometric rotation task. No differences in common input were observed between motor neurons of the same muscle. This lower level of common input could confer higher flexibility in the recruitment of motor units, and therefore, in mechanical outputs. Whether this difference between the dominant and non-dominant arm is the cause or the consequence of handedness remains to be determined.

                The excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis posits that an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to autism symptomatology. Whether this is due to altered GABAergic or glutamatergic functioning, or both, remains largely unknown. We integrated genetic, brain structure and brain chemistry data to investigate the relationship between E/I genetic variation and expression, glutamate concentrations and cortical thickness (CT). Participants (60 autism and 104 neurotypical controls, aged 8-13 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy for glutamate quantification in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left dorsal striatum. Genetic involvement in these regional glutamate concentration levels was investigated using competitive gene-set association and polygenic scores (PGS). Further, glutamate as well as GABA gene-set expression profiles were investigated in relation to CT. Aggregated genetic variation in the glutamate gene-set was associated with ACC but not striatal glutamate concentrations. PGS analysis, however, showed a genome-wide PGS for autism to be predictive of striatal but not ACC glutamate levels. Expression profiles of GABAergic- but not glutamatergic genes were associated with differences in cortical thickness between groups. This study showed differential involvement of aggregated glutamatergic and GABAergic genetic variation in brain structure and chemistry in autism, which suggests regional variability in E/I imbalance.

                Placing a patient in a state of anaesthesia is crucial for modern surgical practice. However, the mechanisms by which anaesthetic drugs, such as propofol, impart their effects on consciousness remain poorly understood. Propofol potentiates GABAergic transmission, which purportedly has direct actions on cortex as well as indirect actions via ascending neuromodulatory systems. Functional imaging studies to date have been limited in their ability to unravel how these effects on neurotransmission impact system-level dynamics of the brain. Here, we leveraged advances in multi-modal imaging, Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT), to investigate how different levels of propofol-induced sedation alters neurotransmission-related functional connectivity (FC), both at rest and when individuals are exposed to naturalistic auditory stimulation. Propofol increased GABA-A- and noradrenaline transporter-enriched FC within occipital and somatosensory regions respectively. Additionally, during auditory stimulation, the network related to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter showed reduced FC within the right superior temporal gyrus, regardless of level of anaesthesia, and a spatial configuration correlating with a broad range of meta-analytic measures of audition- and emotion-related cognition. In bringing together these micro- and macro-scale systems, we provide support for both direct GABAergic and indirect noradrenergic-related network changes under anaesthesia and describe a cognition-related reconfiguration of the cholinergic network, highlighting the utility of REACT to explore the molecular substrates consciousness and cognition.

                Lipofuscin is an autofluorescent (AF) pigment formed by lipids and misfolded proteins that accumulates in post-mitotic cells with advanced age. Here we immunophenotyped microglia in the brain of old C57BL/6 mice (>18 months-old) and demonstrate that in comparison to young mice, one third of old microglia are AF, characterized by profound changes in lipid and iron content, phagocytic activity, and oxidative stress. Pharmacological depletion of microglia in old mice eliminated the AF microglia following repopulation and reversed microglial dysfunction. Age-related neurological deficits and neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury (TBI) were attenuated in old mice lacking AF microglia. Furthermore, hyperphagocytic activity and lipid accumulation in microglia persisted for up to one year after TBI, were modified by Apoe4 genotype, and chronically driven by phagocyte-mediated oxidative stress. Thus, AF may reflect a pathological state in aging microglia associated with hyperphagocytosis and inflammatory neurodegeneration that can be further accelerated by TBI.

                To improve bench-to-bedside translation, it is integral that knowledge flow bidirectionally from - animal models to humans, and vice versa. This will be facilitated by the application of common analytical frameworks, as well as open software and data sharing practices. To these ends, we share a new pipeline (and test dataset) for the preprocessing of wide-field optical fluorescence imaging data - an emerging mode applicable in animal models - as well as results from a functional connectivity and graph theory analysis of these data that is inspired by recent work in the human neuroimaging field. The approach is demonstrated using a dataset comprised of two test-cases: (1) data from animals imaged during awake and anesthetized conditions with excitatory neurons labeled, and (2) data from awake animals with different genetically encoded fluorescent labels that target either excitatory neurons or inhibitory interneuron subtypes. Both seed-based connectivity and graph theory measures (global efficiency, transitivity, modularity, and characteristic path-length) are shown to be useful in quantifying differences between consciousness states and cell populations. The graph theory measures are shown to be capable of characterizing the dependence on canonical network and frequency band (infra-slow versus delta). Both consciousness state and cell population show widespread effects on canonical network connectivity with variable frequency band dependence. Effects of anesthesia are also revealed across graph theory measures (particularly in the delta band). Differences between excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons are observed, with somatostatin expressing inhibitory interneurons emerge as notably dissimilar from parvalbumin and vasoactive polypeptide expressing cells. We recommend this pipeline as a step in harmonization between preclinical and human research enabling comparison of results across both scales and species.

                Inhibitory interneurons regulate excitability, information flow, and plasticity in neural circuits. Inhibitory synapses are also plastic and can be modified by changes in experience or activity, often together with changes to excitatory synapses. However, given the diversity of inhibitory cell types within the cerebral cortex, it is unclear if plasticity is similar for various inhibitory inputs or what the functional significance of inhibitory plasticity might be. Here we examined spike-timing-dependent plasticity of inhibitory synapses from four major subtypes of GABAergic cells onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in mouse auditory cortex. The likelihood of inhibitory potentiation varied across cell types, with somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneuron inputs exhibiting the most potentiation on average. A network simulation of perceptual decision-making revealed that plasticity of SST+-like inputs provided robustness from higher input noise levels to maintain decision accuracy. Differential plasticity at specific inhibitory inputs therefore may be important for network function and sensory perception.

                Conscious perception of limb movements depends on proprioceptive neural responses in the somatosensory cortex. In contrast to tactile sensations, proprioceptive cortical coding is barely studied in the mammalian brain and practically non-existent in rodent research. To understand the cortical representation of this important sensory modality we developed a passive forelimb displacement paradigm in behaving mice. We imaged the responses of layer 2/3 neurons with two-photon microscopy and tracked the 3D position of limb joints. In addition, mice were trained to perceptually discriminate proprioceptive stimuli allowing us to delineate the mouse proprioceptive cortex with optogenetic silencing experiments. Our results reveal that passive forelimb movements are preferentially encoded as a spatial direction vector that interfaces movements with behaviorally relevant targets. This neural representation of proprioception appears not to be limited to the somatosensory cortex.

                Research on Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) is increasing at a rapid pace; therefore, it is crucial to maintain rigor in characterizing EVs from a new model system. Neuronal derived EVs have been well described in the central nervous system; however, studies in the peripheral nervous system have largely focused on EVs derived from supporting cell types such as endothelial cells or glia. Additionally, EVs are heterogeneous in size, shape, cargo and biogenic origin and therefore a multimodal approach to characterization must be used. Here we conduct a thorough description of EVs derived from sympathetic neurons using immunoblot assays, nanoparticle tracking analysis and cryo-electron microscopy. We show that primary sympathetic cultures secrete EVs in a density-dependent manner and that their sizing aligns with those reported in the literature. Lastly, using a compartmentalized culture system we show that EVs secreted by the somatodendritic domain of neurons contain cargo that originated at their distal axon. This work establishes foundational protocols to explore the biogenesis and function of EVs in the peripheral nervous system.

                Foraging animals must use decision-making strategies that dynamically account for uncertainty in the world. To cope with this uncertainty, animals have developed strikingly convergent strategies that use information about multiple past choices and reward to learn representations of the current state of the world. However, the underlying learning rules that drive the required learning have remained unclear. Here, working in the relatively simple nervous system of Drosophila, we combine behavioral measurements, mathematical modeling, and neural circuit perturbations to show that dynamic foraging depends on a learning rule incorporating reward expectation. Using a novel olfactory dynamic foraging task, we characterize the behavioral strategies used by individual flies when faced with unpredictable rewards and show, for the first time, that they perform operant matching. We build on past theoretical work and demonstrate that this strategy requires the existence of a covariance-based learning rule in the mushroom body - a hub for learning in the fly. In particular, the behavioral consequences of optogenetic perturbation experiments suggest that this learning rule incorporates reward expectation. Our results identify a key element of the algorithm underlying dynamic foraging in flies and suggest a comprehensive mechanism that could be fundamental to these behaviors across species.

                Cortical events of correlated neuronal firing are thought to underlie sensorimotor and associative functions. In the dominant theory, events are attractors of cortical dynamics, pulled by strong mutual connections between recurrently active - core - neurons. Here, we exhaustively measured core connectivity, using a unique dataset with co-registered two-photon calcium imaging and electron microscopy of the same cortical tissue. We report that cores make fewer, weaker, mutual connections compared to other neurons. Instead, they are central to the flow of the many pathways they belong to. We present a model where cores arise from a simple distance-dependent connectivity rule, without imposed connectivity biases. Our integrated analysis shows that the link between cortical dynamics and structure is not consistent with attractors but rather with confluent connectivity pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A local activity-dependent learning rule shapes dendritic morphologies and synaptic organization</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic branching and synaptic organization shape single neuron and network computations. How they emerge simultaneously during brain development as neurons become integrated into functional networks is still not mechanistically understood. Here, we propose a computational model in which dendrite growth and the organization of synapses arise from the interaction of local activity-dependent plasticity and activity-independent cues from potential synaptic partners. Consistent with experiments, three phases of dendritic growth -- overshoot, pruning, and stabilization -- emerge naturally in the model. The model generates biologically-realistic dendritic morphologies under normal and perturbed learning rules, and synapses cluster spatially according to the correlated activity they experience. We demonstrate that activity-dependent and -independent factors influence dendritic growth throughout development, suggesting that early developmental variability can affect mature morphology. Our model generates dendrites with approximately optimal wiring length consistent with experimental measurements. Therefore, a single mechanistic model generates realistic dendritic development and accounts for synaptic organization from correlated inputs. Our work suggests concrete mechanistic components underlying dendritic growth and synaptic formation and removal in function and dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of I-wave generating pathways with repetitive paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation: A TMS-EEG study</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Repetitive paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTMS) at indirect (I) wave intervals increases motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by TMS to primary motor cortex (M1). However, the effects of iTMS at early and late intervals on the plasticity of specific I-wave circuits remains unclear. The current study therefore aimed to assess how the timing of iTMS influences intracortical excitability within early and late I-wave circuits. To investigate the cortical effects of iTMS more directly, changes due to the intervention were also assessed using combined TMS-electroencephalography (EEG). Material and Methods: Eighteen young adults (24.6 {+/-} 4.2 years) participated in four sessions in which iTMS targeting early (1.5 ms interval; iTMS1.5) or late (4.0 ms interval; iTMS4.0) I-waves was applied over M1. Neuroplasticity was assessed using both posterior-to-anterior (PA) and anterior-to-posterior (AP) stimulus directions to record MEPs and TEPs before and after iTMS. SICF at inter-stimulus intervals of 1.5 and 4.0 ms was also used to index I-wave activity. Results: MEP amplitude was increased after iTMS (P < 0.01) and this was greater for PA responses (P < 0.01), but not different between iTMS intervals (P = 0.9). Irrespective of iTMS interval and coil current, SICF was facilitated after the intervention (P < 0.01). While the N45 produced by AP stimulation was reduced by iTMS1.5 (P = 0.04), no other changes in TEP amplitude were observed. Conclusion: The timing of iTMS failed to influence which I-wave circuits were potentiated by the intervention. In contrast, reductions in the N45 suggest that the neuroplastic effects of iTMS may include disinhibition of intracortical inhibitory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nitric oxide is not responsible for the initial sensory-induced neurovascular coupling response in mouse cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling ensures that changes in neural activity are accompanied by localised changes in cerebral blood flow. While much is known about the involvement of excitatory neurons in neurovascular coupling, the role of inhibitory interneurons is unresolved. While nNOS-expressing interneurons have been shown to be capable of eliciting vasodilation, the role of nitric oxide in functional hyperemia remains a matter of debate. Therefore in the present study we applied a combination of optogenetic and pharmacological approaches, 2-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy, and electrophysiology to investigate the role of nitric oxide in neurovascular coupling responses evoked by nNOS-expressing interneurons and whisker stimulation in mouse sensory cortex. The haemodynamic response evoked by nNOS-expressing interneurons was significantly altered in the presence of the NOS inhibitor LNAME, revealing a large initial 20-HETE-dependent vasoconstriction. In contrast, the haemodynamic response induced by sensory stimulation was largely unchanged by LNAME. Our results suggest that while nitric oxide plays a key role in neurovascular responses evoked by nNOS-expressing interneurons it does not mediate the initial sensory-induced neurovascular coupling response in mouse cortex. Thus, our results call into question the involvement of nNOS-expressing interneurons and nitric oxide in sensory-evoked functional hyperemia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural signatures of auditory hypersensitivity following acoustic trauma</a></h4>

              
                Throughout the brain, neurons exhibit a remarkable capacity to maintain stable firing rates despite large perturbations in afferent activity levels. As an exception, homeostatic regulation of neural activity often fails in the adult auditory system after hearing loss. Cochlear deafferentation caused by aging or noise exposure triggers widespread neural hyperactivity, particularly in the auditory cortex (ACtx), which underlies perceptual disorders including tinnitus and hyperacusis. Here, we show that mice with noise-induced damage of the high-frequency cochlear base were behaviorally hypersensitive to spared mid-frequency tones and to direct optogenetic stimulation of auditory thalamocortical neurons. Chronic 2-photon calcium imaging from ACtx pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) revealed an initial stage of diffuse hyperactivity, hypercorrelation, and hyperresponsivity that consolidated around deafferented map regions three or more days after acoustic trauma. Deafferented PyrN ensembles displayed hypersensitive decoding of spared mid-frequency tones, mirroring behavioral hypersensitivity. At the level of individual PyrNs, some exhibited stable, homeostatic gain control after acoustic trauma, while others showed non-homeostatic excess gain. Interestingly, factors such as baseline spontaneous activity levels and sound level encoding could account for 40% of the variability in PyrN gain regulation after acoustic trauma. These findings suggest that non-homeostatic regulation of cortical sound intensity coding following sensorineural loss may underlie the well-established clinical phenomenon of loudness hypersensitivity. Further, while cortical gain changes are triggered by reduced bottom-up afferent input, their subsequent stabilization is also shaped by their local circuit milieu, where baseline response features can identify neurons with the greatest propensity for developing pathological hyperactivity following sensorineural hearing loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual similarity judgments do not predict the distribution of errors in working memory</a></h4>

              
                Population coding models provide a quantitative account of visual working memory (VWM) retrieval errors with a plausible link to the response characteristics of sensory neurons. Recent work has provided an important new perspective linking population coding to variables of signal detection, including d-prime, and put forward a new hypothesis: that the distribution of recall errors on, e.g., a color wheel, is a consequence of the psychological similarity between points in that stimulus space, such that the exponential-like psychophysical distance scaling function can fulfil the role of population tuning and obviate the need to fit a tuning width parameter to recall data. Using four different visual feature spaces, we measured psychophysical similarity and memory errors in the same participants. Our results revealed strong evidence for a common source of variability affecting similarity judgments and recall estimates, but did not support any consistent relationship between psychophysical similarity functions and VWM errors. At the group level, the responsiveness functions obtained from the psychophysical similarity task diverged strongly from those that provided the best fit to working memory errors. At the individual level, we found convincing evidence against an association between observed and best-fitting similarity functions. Finally, our results show that the newly proposed exponential-like responsiveness function has in general no advantage over the canonical von Mises (circular normal) function assumed by previous population coding models.

                The amygdala is an important hub for the regulation of emotions, which is crucial for elucidating cellular and molecular mechanisms of many mental diseases. In the central nervous system, the endocannabinoid system plays a key role in the regulation of emotions and mainly functions through the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R), which is encoded by the Cnr1 gene. Although CB1R is highly expressed in the amygdala of non-human primates, little is known about its function. Here, we investigated the function of CB1R by knocking out the CB1R in the amygdala of adult marmosets through regional delivery of AAV-SaCas9-gRNA. We found that CB1R knockout in the amygdala of marmosets induced anxiety-like behaviors, including disrupted night sleep, agitated psychomotor activity in new environments, and reduced social desire, but had no effect on hedonic state and fear response. Moreover, CB1Rknockout marmosets exhibited up-regulated plasma cortisol levels, suggesting increased stress. These results showed that knockout of CB1R in the amygdala induced anxiety-like phenotypes in marmosets and shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of anxiety by CB1R in the amygdala of non-human primates.

                This paper presents the first publicly available bimodal electroencephalography (EEG) / functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset and an open source benchmark for inner speech decoding. Decoding inner speech or thought (expressed through a voice without actual speaking); is a challenge with typical results close to chance level. The dataset comprises 1280 trials (4 subjects, 8 stimuli = 2 categories * 4 words, and 40 trials per stimuli) in each modality. The pilot study reports for the binary classification, a mean accuracy of 71.72% when combining the two modalities (EEG and fMRI), compared to 62.81% and 56.17% when using EEG, resp. fMRI alone. The same improvement in performance for word classification (8 classes) can be observed (30.29% with combination, 22.19%, and 17.50% without). As such, this paper demonstrates that combining EEG with fMRI is a promising direction for inner speech decoding.

                Withdrawal from chronic opioid use often causes hypodopaminergic states and negative affect, which drives relapse. Direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs) in the striatal patch compartment contain high levels of mu-opioid receptors (MORs). It remains unclear how chronic opioid exposure affects these MOR-expressing dMSNs and their striatopallidal and striatonigral outputs to induce negative emotions and relapse. Here, we report that MOR activation acutely suppressed GABAergic striatopallidal transmission in habenula-projecting globus pallidus neurons. Notably, repeated administrations of a MOR agonist (morphine or fentanyl) potentiated this GABAergic transmission. We also discovered that intravenous self-administration of fentanyl enhanced GABAergic striatonigral transmission and reduced the firing activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, fentanyl withdrawal caused depression-like behaviors and promoted the reinstatement of fentanyl-seeking behaviors. These data suggest that chronic opioid use triggers GABAergic striatopallidal and striatonigral plasticity to induce a hypodopaminergic state, promoting negative emotions and leading to relapse.

                The dopamine (DA) system, particularly D1-like DA receptors (D1DR), declines across the adult life. The functional consequences of reduced D1DR has been hypothesized to vary across life periods, but the precise timing of these periods is unknown. To examine distinct phases in age-related D1DR reductions, we studied 180 healthy adults (90 females, 20-80 years), who underwent D1DR PET assessment using [11C]SCH23390. A bi-phasic pattern of age-related D1DR differences was revealed, with an inflection point at approximately 40 years of age. Notably, D1DR levels before and after the inflection showed opposing relations to neurocognitive functions, in concordance with distinct consequences of D1DR differences during development and in old age. Furthermore, D1DR reductions in later life were linked to age-related cerebrovascular consequences. These results support a distinction between D1DR reductions in early adulthood from those later in life, and suggest less dramatic and more malleable DA losses in aging than previously suggested.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-fidelity restoration of visual signals by electrical stimulation in the central primate retina</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with electronic implants provides rudimentary artificial vision to people blinded by retinal degeneration, but cannot reproduce the neural code of the retina. Recent work has demonstrated more precise activation of RGCs using focal electrical stimulation in the peripheral macaque retina, but high-resolution vision requires the central retina. This work probes the effectiveness of focal epiretinal stimulation in the central macaque retina, using large-scale recording and stimulation ex vivo. The functional organization of the major RGC types was similar between the peripheral and central retina, and these cell types could be distinguished by their electrical properties. Electrical stimulation revealed similar RGC activation thresholds and reduced axon bundle activation in the central retina, but diminished stimulation selectivity. However, a novel stimulation algorithm revealed higher expected acuity in the central retina. These results support the possibility of reproducing high-acuity vision in the central retina with an epiretinal implant.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anterior insular cortex firing links initial and sustained encoding during aversion-resistant alcohol consumption</a></h4>

              
                Compulsive-like alcohol drinking (CLAD), where intake persists despite adverse consequences, is often a core facet of alcohol use disorder. Recent work sheds light on underlying mechanisms, but much remains unknown about CLAD etiology. Previously, we showed that projections from anterior insula (aINS), a central mediator of emotion, motivation, and interoception, promote CLAD in rodents, and heavy human drinkers exhibit similar insula-circuit recruitment under compulsion-like conditions. However, global aINS inhibition also reduces alcohol-only drinking (AOD), and one major obstacle is the lack of information on aINS firing patterns that could promote different aspects of intake. Here, we recorded single-unit activity in right aINS from 15 rats during AOD or CLAD (10mg/L or 60mg/L quinine in alcohol). Neurons with a sustained-increase or sustained-decrease phenotype (SIP, SDP) showed no firing differences across drinking conditions. In contrast, aINS neurons with a phenotype of strong firing increase at initiation of responding (IRP) showed significantly greater activity across the rest of licking during CLAD versus AOD, concurring with our previous behavioral findings suggesting quick evaluation and response strategy adjustment under CLAD. There were also no condition-related differences in firing-phenotype abundance. Further, total responding only correlated with abundance of SDP cells, but SDP firing returned to baseline during pauses in licking, while IRP and SIP sustained responding through pauses in licking. Thus, only aINS cells with a particular strong firing at licking onset showd greater sustained responding under compulsion-like conditions, while other cells likely promoted drinking more generally, providing critical new information about how aINS activity could promote alcohol consumption under different drinking conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accurate angular integration with only a handful of neurons</a></h4>

              
                To flexibly navigate, many animals rely on internal spatial representations that persist when the animal is standing still in darkness, and update accurately by integrating the animal's movements in the absence of localizing sensory cues. Theories of mammalian head direction cells have proposed that these dynamics can be realized in a special class of networks that maintain a localized bump of activity via structured recurrent connectivity, and that shift this bump of activity via angular velocity input. Although there are many different variants of these so-called ring attractor networks, they all rely on large numbers of neurons to generate representations that persist in the absence of input and accurately integrate angular velocity input. Surprisingly, in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a head direction representation is maintained by a much smaller number of neurons whose dynamics and connectivity resemble those of a ring attractor network. These findings challenge our understanding of ring attractors and their putative implementation in neural circuits. Here, we analyzed failures of angular velocity integration that emerge in small attractor networks with only a few computational units. Motivated by the peak performance of the fly head direction system in darkness, we mathematically derived conditions under which small networks, even with as few as 4 neurons, achieve the performance of much larger networks. The resulting description reveals that by appropriately tuning the network connectivity, the network can maintain persistent representations over the continuum of head directions, and it can accurately integrate angular velocity inputs. We then analytically determined how performance degrades as the connectivity deviates from this optimally-tuned setting, and we find a trade-off between network size and the tuning precision needed to achieve persistence and accurate integration. This work shows how even small networks can accurately track an animal's movements to guide navigation, and it informs our understanding of the functional capabilities of discrete systems more broadly.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Episodic memory formation in naturalistic viewing</a></h4>

              
                The brain systems of episodic memory and oculomotor control are tightly linked, suggesting a crucial role of eye movements in memory. But little is known about the neural mechanisms of memory formation across eye movements in naturalistic viewing behavior. Here, we leverage simultaneous recording and analysis of eye movements and EEG to examine the formation of episodic memory in free viewing. We designed a stimulus screen with multiple elements that together comprised an event. Participants were asked to memorize several of these events while their EEG and eye movements were concurrently recorded. A subsequent cued-recall test assessed participants' memory for the element associations that specified each event. We overcame the problem of overlapping EEG responses to sequential saccades in free viewing using a deconvolution approach. We segmented EEG relative to the fixation onsets and examined EEG power in the theta and alpha frequency bands, the putative oscillatory correlates of episodic encoding mechanisms. We found that high subsequent memory performance was predicted by three modulations of fixation-related EEG: 1) theta synchronization at fixations after saccades relevant to event integration, 2) theta synchronization at fixations after within-element scrutinizing saccades, 3) alpha desynchronization at fixations after saccades between elements that were incidental to the task. Thus, event encoding with unrestricted viewing behavior was characterized by three neural mechanisms, manifested in fixation-locked theta and alpha EEG activity that rapidly turned on and off during the unfolding eye movement sequences. These three distinct neural mechanisms may be the essential building blocks that subserve the buildup of coherent episodic memories during naturalistic viewing behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A kinase-independent function of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 promotes outer radial glia expansion and neocortical folding</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex, the center for higher brain function, first emerged in mammals and has become massively expanded and folded in humans, constituting almost half the volume of the human brain. Primary microcephaly, a developmental disorder in which the brain is smaller than normal at birth, mainly results from the number of neurons in the neocortex being reduced because of defects in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Outer radial glia (oRGs), NPCs that are abundant in gyrencephalic species but rare in lisencephalic species, are thought to play key roles in the expansion and folding of the neocortex. However, how oRGs expand, whether they are necessary for neocortical folding, and whether defects in oRGs cause microcephaly remain important questions in the study of brain development, evolution, and disease. Here, we show that oRG expansion in mice, ferrets, and human cerebral organoids requires cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), the mutation of which causes primary microcephaly via an unknown mechanism. In a mouse model in which increased Hedgehog signaling expands oRGs and intermediate progenitor cells and induces neocortical folding, CDK6 loss selectively decreased oRGs and abolished neocortical folding. Remarkably, this function of CDK6 in oRG expansion did not require its kinase activity, was not shared by the highly similar CDK4 and CDK2, and was disrupted by the mutation causing microcephaly. Therefore, our results indicate that CDK6 is conserved to promote oRG expansion; that oRGs are necessary for neocortical folding; and that defects in oRG expansion may cause primary microcephaly.

	<p>Neurodegenerative disorders have become a serious healthcare problem worldwide and there is no efficacious cure. However, regulating the fate of stem cells is an effective way to treat these neurological diseases. In previous work, stemazole was reported to maintain the survival of human neural stem cells in the absence of growth factors and to have therapeutic effects on neurodegenerative diseases. However, although it is a promising small molecule, the molecular mechanisms against apoptosis are ambiguous. In this study, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics were performed to obtain whole protein expression profiles of human neural stem cells in different groups under extreme conditions. Bioinformatics analysis based on protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction (PPI) network construction, gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were adopted to explore crucial proteins and possible pharmacological mechanisms. A total of 77 differentially expressed proteins were identified, comprising 38 upregulated proteins and 39 downregulated proteins. Combined with a diseases database of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), caspase-2 (CASP2), PKA C-alpha (PRKACA), fibronectin (FN1), large neutral amino acid transporter small subunit 1 (SLC7A5), which are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, this was further validated by enzyme activity assay and molecular docking, and regarded as putative targets regulated by stemazole. The present results give an insight into this small molecule and a better understanding for further elucidating the underlying mechanisms in the treatment of stem cells and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: The selection of the maintenance of general anesthesia may affect the development of postoperative delirium (POD), notably for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients, due to their lower cognitive reserve. The present study was designed to compare the potential impact of propofol vs. sevoflurane based general anesthesia maintenance methods on the development of POD in PD patients following deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Methods: A total of 125 PD patients who were scheduled to undergo DBS surgery were randomly divided into the propofol (n = 63) and the sevoflurane groups (n = 62). The patients in the two groups randomly received propofol- or sevoflurane-based general anesthesia. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was employed by an investigator who was blinded to the anesthesia regimen and was administered twice per day from postoperative day 1 until discharge. Results: The incidence of POD was 22.22% (14/63) with propofol anesthesia and 20.97% (13/62) with sevoflurane anesthesia (p = 0.865). In addition, no difference was noted in the duration and severity of delirium between the propofol and sevoflurane groups. Conclusions: In the present study, propofol- and sevoflurane-based general anesthesia exhibited comparable results with regard to the POD incidence in PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery.</p>

	<p>There are no official recommendations regarding physiotherapy for encephalitis patients. However, such patients, depending on their condition, have to undergo rehabilitation preceded by a detailed functional examination. The paper describes the physiotherapy treatment of a 28-year-old female after acute encephalitis. She suffered three-limb palsy with preserved movement in the right ankle joint. The patient was admitted to a clinic that offers respiratory therapy, where she underwent a comprehensive rehabilitation process. The initial and final functional assessment was conducted based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The therapy aimed to enable social contacts by learning to communicate with the environment, taking advantage of learned motor skills and adapting the body to maintain a sitting position. The goals were implemented with gradual upright standing, electrostimulation of paralyzed muscles, orofacial therapy, methods of respiratory acceleration and the use of communication technologies. As a result of the physiotherapy, the patient can communicate with the environment more efficiently and showed a more assertive attitude towards the disease and greater motivation to exercise and socialize. This paper supports the importance of a rehabilitation program adapted to the needs of a patient with severe disabilities and encourages more studies in this area.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Responses to Song Playback Differ in Sleeping versus Anesthetized Songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Vocal learning in songbirds is mediated by a highly localized system of interconnected forebrain regions, including recurrent loops that traverse the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. This brain-behavior system provides a powerful model for elucidating mechanisms of vocal learning, with implications for learning speech in human infants, as well as for advancing our understanding of skill learning in general. A long history of experiments in this area has tested neural responses to playback of different song stimuli in anesthetized birds at different stages of vocal development. These studies have demonstrated selectivity for different song types that provide neural signatures of learning. In contrast to the ease of obtaining responses to song playback in anesthetized birds, song-evoked responses in awake birds are greatly reduced or absent, indicating that behavioral state is an important determinant of neural responsivity. Song-evoked responses can be elicited during sleep as well as anesthesia, and the selectivity of responses to song playback in adult birds is highly similar between anesthetized and sleeping states, encouraging the idea that anesthesia and sleep are similar. In contrast to that idea, we report evidence that cortical responses to song playback in juvenile zebra finches (<I>Taeniopygia guttata</I>) differ greatly between sleep and urethane anesthesia. This finding indicates that behavioral states differ in sleep versus anesthesia and raises questions about relationships between developmental changes in sleep activity, selectivity for different song types, and the neural substrate for vocal learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Alternate Monocular Deprivation Does Not Affect Binocular Balance and Correlation in Human Adults</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent studies show that the human adult visual system exhibits neural plasticity. For instance, short-term monocular deprivation shifts the eye dominance in favor of the deprived eye. This phenomenon is believed to occur in the primary visual cortex by reinstating neural plasticity. However, it is unknown whether the changes in eye dominance after monocularly depriving the visual input can also be induced by alternately depriving both eyes. In this study, we found no changes in binocular balance and interocular correlation sensitivity after a rapid (7 Hz), alternate, and monocular deprivation for 1 h in adults. Therefore, the effect of short-term monocular deprivation cannot seem to be emulated by alternately and rapidly depriving both eyes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Early rhythmicity in the fetal suprachiasmatic nuclei in response to maternal signals detected by omics approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Philipp Greiner, Pavel Houdek, Martin Sládek, Alena Sumová</p>

The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus harbor the central clock of the circadian system, which gradually matures during the perinatal period. In this study, time-resolved transcriptomic and proteomic approaches were used to describe fetal SCN tissue-level rhythms before rhythms in clock gene expression develop. Pregnant rats were maintained in constant darkness and had intact SCN, or their SCN were lesioned and behavioral rhythm was imposed by temporal restriction of food availability. Model-selecting tools dryR and CompareRhythms identified sets of genes in the fetal SCN that were rhythmic in the absence of the fetal canonical clock. Subsets of rhythmically expressed genes were assigned to groups of fetuses from mothers with either intact or lesioned SCN, or both groups. Enrichment analysis for GO terms and signaling pathways revealed that neurodevelopment and cell-to-cell signaling were significantly enriched within the subsets of genes that were rhythmic in response to distinct maternal signals. The findings discovered a previously unexpected breadth of rhythmicity in the fetal SCN at a developmental stage when the canonical clock has not yet developed at the tissue level and thus likely represents responses to rhythmic maternal signals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Transcriptome-wide mapping reveals a diverse dihydrouridine landscape including mRNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Austin S. Draycott, Cassandra Schaening-Burgos, Maria F. Rojas-Duran, Loren Wilson, Leonard Schärfen, Karla M. Neugebauer, Sigrid Nachtergaele, Wendy V. Gilbert</p>

Dihydrouridine is a modified nucleotide universally present in tRNAs, but the complete dihydrouridine landscape is unknown in any organism. We introduce dihydrouridine sequencing (D-seq) for transcriptome-wide mapping of D with single-nucleotide resolution and use it to uncover novel classes of dihydrouridine-containing RNA in yeast which include mRNA and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). The novel D sites are concentrated in conserved stem-loop regions consistent with a role for D in folding many functional RNA structures. We demonstrate dihydrouridine synthase (DUS)-dependent changes in splicing of a D-containing pre-mRNA in cells and show that D-modified mRNAs can be efficiently translated by eukaryotic ribosomes in vitro. This work establishes D as a new functional component of the mRNA epitranscriptome and paves the way for identifying the RNA targets of multiple DUS enzymes that are dysregulated in human disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Endomitosis controls tissue-specific gene expression during development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lotte M. van Rijnberk, Ramon Barrull-Mascaró, Reinier L. van der Palen, Erik S. Schild, Hendrik C. Korswagen, Matilde Galli</p>

Polyploid cells contain more than 2 copies of the genome and are found in many plant and animal tissues. Different types of polyploidy exist, in which the genome is confined to either 1 nucleus (mononucleation) or 2 or more nuclei (multinucleation). Despite the widespread occurrence of polyploidy, the functional significance of different types of polyploidy is largely unknown. Here, we assess the function of multinucleation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> intestinal cells through specific inhibition of binucleation without altering genome ploidy. Through single-worm RNA sequencing, we find that binucleation is important for tissue-specific gene expression, most prominently for genes that show a rapid up-regulation at the transition from larval development to adulthood. Regulated genes include vitellogenins, which encode yolk proteins that facilitate nutrient transport to the germline. We find that reduced expression of vitellogenins in mononucleated intestinal cells leads to progeny with developmental delays and reduced fitness. Together, our results show that binucleation facilitates rapid up-regulation of intestine-specific gene expression during development, independently of genome ploidy, underscoring the importance of spatial genome organization for polyploid cell function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Cif proteins from Wolbachia prophage WO modify sperm genome integrity to establish cytoplasmic incompatibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rupinder Kaur, Brittany A. Leigh, Isabella T. Ritchie, Seth R. Bordenstein</p>

Inherited microorganisms can selfishly manipulate host reproduction to drive through populations. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, germline expression of the native <i>Wolbachia</i> prophage WO proteins CifA and CifB cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in which embryos from infected males and uninfected females suffer catastrophic mitotic defects and lethality; however, in infected females, CifA expression rescues the embryonic lethality and thus imparts a fitness advantage to the maternally transmitted <i>Wolbachia</i>. Despite widespread relevance to sex determination, evolution, and vector control, the mechanisms underlying when and how CI impairs male reproduction remain unknown and a topic of debate. Here, we use cytochemical, microscopic, and transgenic assays in <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i> to demonstrate that CifA and CifB proteins of <i>w</i>Mel localize to nuclear DNA throughout the process of spermatogenesis. Cif proteins cause abnormal histone retention in elongating spermatids and protamine deficiency in mature sperms that travel to the female reproductive tract with Cif proteins. Notably, protamine gene knockouts enhance wild-type CI. In ovaries, CifA localizes to germ cell nuclei and cytoplasm of early-stage egg chambers; however, Cifs are absent in late-stage oocytes and subsequently in fertilized embryos. Finally, CI and rescue are contingent upon a newly annotated CifA bipartite nuclear localization sequence. Together, our results strongly support the Host modification model of CI in which Cifs initially modify the paternal and maternal gametes to bestow CI-defining embryonic lethality and rescue.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">No evidence of fetal defects or anti-syncytin-1 antibody induction following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alice Lu-Culligan, Alexandra Tabachnikova, Eddy Pérez-Then, Maria Tokuyama, Hannah J. Lee, Carolina Lucas, Valter Silva Monteiro, Marija Miric, Vivian Brache, Leila Cochon, M.

Ko, Saad B. Omer, Akiko Iwasaki</p>

The impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccination on pregnancy and fertility has become a major topic of public interest. We investigated 2 of the most widely propagated claims to determine (1) whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccination of mice during early pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of birth defects or growth abnormalities; and (2) whether COVID-19 mRNA-vaccinated human volunteers exhibit elevated levels of antibodies to the human placental protein syncytin-1. Using a mouse model, we found that intramuscular COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during early pregnancy at gestational age E7.5 did not lead to differences in fetal size by crown-rump length or weight at term, nor did we observe any gross birth defects. In contrast, injection of the TLR3 agonist and double-stranded RNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, or poly(I:C), impacted growth in utero leading to reduced fetal size. No overt maternal illness following either vaccination or poly(I:C) exposure was observed. We also found that term fetuses from these murine pregnancies vaccinated prior to the formation of the definitive placenta exhibit high circulating levels of anti-spike and anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consistent with maternal antibody status, indicating transplacental transfer in the later stages of pregnancy after early immunization. Finally, we did not detect increased levels of circulating anti-syncytin-1 antibodies in a cohort of COVID-19 vaccinated adults compared to unvaccinated adults by ELISA. Our findings contradict popular claims associating COVID-19 mRNA vaccination with infertility and adverse neonatal outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantitative image analysis in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a cohort observational study. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury commonly associated with pneumonia, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The resultant effect can be persistent lung damage, but its extent is not known. We used quantitative high resolution computed tomography (QHR-CT) lung scans to radiographically characterize the lung damage in COVID-19 ARDS (CARDS) survivors. Methods Patients with CARDS (N=20) underwent QHR-CT lung scans 60 to 90 days after initial diagnosis, while hospitalized at a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). QHR-CT assessed for mixed disease (QMD), ground glass opacities (QGGO), consolidation (QCON) and normal lung tissue (QNL). QMD was correlated with respiratory support on admission, tracheostomy decannulation and supplementary oxygen need on discharge. Results Sixteen patients arrived with tracheostomy requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Four patients arrived on nasal oxygen support. Of the patients included in this study 10 had the tracheostomy cannula removed, four remained on invasive ventilation, and two died. QHR-CT showed 45% QMD, 28.1% QGGO, 3.0% QCON and QNL=23.9%. Patients with mandatory mechanical ventilation had the highest proportion of QMD when compared to no mechanical ventilation. There was no correlation between QMD and tracheostomy decannulation or need for supplementary oxygen at discharge. Conclusions Our data shows severe ongoing lung injury in patients with CARDS, beyond what is usually expected in ARDS. In this severely ill population, the extent of mixed disease correlates with mechanical ventilation, signaling formation of interstitial lung disease. QHR-CT analysis can be useful in the post-acute setting to evaluate for interstitial changes in ARDS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessing the role of vascular risk factors in dementia: Mendelian randomization meta-analysis and comparison with observational estimates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Although observational studies demonstrate that higher levels of vascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of dementia, these associations might be explained by confounding or other biases. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic instruments to test causal relationships in observational data. We sought to determine if genetically predicted modifiable risk factors (type 2 diabetes mellitus, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and circulating glucose) are associated with dementia by meta-analysing published MR studies. Secondary objectives were to identify heterogeneity in effect estimates across primary MR studies and to compare meta-analysis results with observational studies. Methods: MR studies were identified by systematic search of Web of Science, OVID and Scopus. We selected primary MR studies investigating the modifiable risk factors of interest. Only one study from each cohort per risk factor was included. A quality assessment tool was developed to primarily assess the three assumptions of MR for each MR study. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure and outcome, effect estimates per unit increase, and measures of variation. Effect estimates were pooled to generate an overall estimate, I2 and Cochrane Q values using fixed-effect model. Results: We screened 5211 studies and included 12 primary MR studies after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Higher genetically predicted body mass index was associated with a higher odds of dementia (OR 1.03 [1.01, 1.05] per 5 kg/m2 increase, one study, p=0.00285). Fewer hypothesized vascular risk factors were supported by estimates from MR studies than estimates from meta-analyses of observational studies.   Conclusion: Genetically predicted body mass index was associated with an increase in risk of dementia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Productivity of mother pigs is lower in countries that still confine them in gestation crates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For decades, pig farmers have used gestation crates — small metal enclosures about two feet wide — to confine pregnant sows (female breeding pigs). Gestation crates physically restrain sows for most of their life, preventing them from walking or even turning around. Millions of females are still housed in these systems. Growing societal concern about animal welfare has been pressuring the industry for change, with recent legislation in the European Union and California restricting the use of crates. Still, the notion that gestation crates negatively affect sow welfare has been challenged by producers in regions where crates are widely used, who argue that, by facilitating health monitoring and preventing aggression, crates lead to lower sow mortality and higher piglet outputs per sow. We address these claims by comparing sow mortality and performance across countries with different housing systems. Methods: To this end, we use publicly available data from InterPig, a network of pig production economists in 17 countries that provides internationally harmonized methods for meaningful comparisons of national production data. Results: The results show that sow mortality is significantly higher, and annual pig production per sow significantly lower, in those countries where gestation crates are still the norm compared to countries in the European Union, where use of gestation crates is restricted to up to four weeks after insemination. Conclusions: Claims of higher mortality and reduced productivity per sow in crate-free systems are not substantiated by this data. This evidence should be considered in policies affecting the welfare of breeding pigs.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Connectivity changes after spinal cord injury (SCI) appear as dynamic post-injury procedures. The present study aimed to investigate the alterations in the functional connectivity (FC) in different injury duration in complete SCI using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A total of 30 healthy controls (HCs) and 27 complete SCI patients were recruited in this study. A seed-based connectivity analysis compared FC differences between HCs and SCI and among SCI subgroups (SCI patients with post-injury within 6 months (early stage, <i>n</i> = 13) vs. those with post-injury beyond 6 months (late stage, <i>n</i> = 14)). Compared to HCs, SCI patients showed an increase in FC between sensorimotor cortex and cognitive, visual, and auditory cortices. The FC between motor cortex and cognitive cortex increased over time after injury. The FC between sensory cortex and visual cortex increased within 6 months after SCI, while FC between the sensory cortex and auditory cortex increased beyond 6 months after injury. The FC between sensorimotor cortex and cognitive, visual, auditory regions increased in complete SCI patients. The brain FC changed dynamically, and rehabilitation might be adapted over time after SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Increasing brain gamma activity improves episodic memory and restores cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation at gamma-frequency (γ-tACS) applied over the precuneus can improve episodic memory and modulate cholinergic transmission by modulating cerebral rhythms in early Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, crossover study, 60 AD patients underwent a clinical and neurophysiological evaluation including assessment of episodic memory and cholinergic transmission pre- and post- 60 minutes treatment with γ-tACS targeting the precuneus or sham tACS. In a subset of 10 patients, EEG analysis and individualized modelling of electric field distribution were carried out. Predictors to γ-tACS efficacy were evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant improvement in the Rey auditory verbal learning (RAVL) test immediate recall (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and delayed recall scores (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) after γ-tACS but not after sham tACS. Face-name associations scores improved with γ-tACS (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) but not after sham tACS. Short latency afferent inhibition, an indirect measure of cholinergic transmission, increased only after γ-tACS (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001). <i>ApoE</i> genotype and baseline cognitive impairment were the best predictors of response to γ-tACS. Clinical improvement correlated with the increase in gamma frequencies in posterior regions and with the amount of predicted electric field distribution in the precuneus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Precuneus γ-tACS, able to increase γ-power activity on the posterior brain regions, showed a significant improvement of episodic memory performances, along with restoration of intracortical excitability measures of cholinergic transmission. Response to γ-tACS was dependent on genetic factors and disease stage.</p>

                TH17 cells display a spectrum of pathogenic states depending on environmental and intrinsic cues. Damasceno et al. demonstrate that STING activation induces a non-pathogenic TH17 profile. Mechanistically, STING impairs Rorγt-mediated Il17a transcription, thereby reducing IL-17A production. Besides that, STING activation promotes IL-10 expression through AhR signaling pathway.

                Cells have to regulate their metabolism in response to oxygen levels. Zhang et al. find that oxygen regulates hydroxylation of translation factor eIF5A in yeast. Hydroxylation promotes translation of the N termini of many proteins essential for cell survival in the presence of oxygen in a proline-independent manner.
