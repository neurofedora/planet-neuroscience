              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ageism in medication use: a policy brief [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Ageism in medication use decreases older persons' well-being and quality of life and increases health care utilization and costs. This policy brief outlines several strategies that may be considered to combat ageism in medication use and its widespread negative consequences. The strategies are the following: 1) Establish a global action plan (designate an international organization to take a leading and coordinating role; involve all stakeholders; take a multidisciplinary, intersectoral, and systems approach; ensure affordability, accessibility, and availability of care and medications; address the needs of older adults facing multiple forms of discrimination; tailor strategies to the local contexts; designate coordinators at the national and organizational levels); 2) Enhance integration and coordination between health and social care and across different levels of health care (deliver team-based, multidisciplinary, integrated, and coordinated care; ensure interoperability of electronic health records); 3) Implement a quality and safety perspective (integrate and implement patient safety in all policies and programmes; establish a safety culture; establish open reporting culture; take an active and proactive approach; use international indicators); 4) Empower and engage older patients (involve patients in shared decision-making; provide health and medication-related information; provide decision aids and question prompt lists; launch campaigns to raise awareness about ageism in medication use and medication safety, and to promote a life-course perspective, a healthy lifestyle, and the benefits of non-pharmacological strategies); and 5) Improve education and training of care professionals (develop comprehensive curricula; implement interprofessional and intergenerational education and training; develop and revise clinical guidelines to meet older persons' needs and preferences; translate clinical guidelines into computerized clinical decision support systems, prescribing algorithms and alerts). By tackling ageism in medication use, policies, strategies, and actions can enhance the lives of older people and, in turn, their contribution to society.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The hierarchical organization of autocatalytic reaction networks and its relevance to the origin of life</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhen Peng, Jeff Linderoth, David A. Baum</p>

Prior work on abiogenesis, the emergence of life from non-life, suggests that it requires chemical reaction networks that contain self-amplifying motifs, namely, autocatalytic cores. However, little is known about how the presence of multiple autocatalytic cores might allow for the gradual accretion of complexity on the path to life. To explore this problem, we develop the concept of a seed-dependent autocatalytic system (SDAS), which is a subnetwork that can autocatalytically self-maintain given a flux of food, but cannot be initiated by food alone. Rather, initiation of SDASs requires the transient introduction of chemical âseedsâ. We show that, depending on the topological relationship of SDASs in a chemical reaction network, a food-driven system can accrete complexity in a historically contingent manner, governed by rare seeding events. We develop new algorithms for detecting and analyzing SDASs in chemical reaction databases and describe parallels between multi-SDAS networks and biological ecosystems. Applying our algorithms to both an abiotic reaction network and a biochemical one, each driven by a set of simple food chemicals, we detect SDASs that are organized as trophic tiers, of which the higher tier can be seeded by relatively simple chemicals if the lower tier is already activated. This indicates that sequential activation of trophically organized SDASs by seed chemicals that are not much more complex than what already exist could be a mechanism of gradual complexification from relatively simple abiotic reactions to more complex life-like systems. Interestingly, in both reaction networks, higher-tier SDASs include chemicals that might alter emergent features of chemical systems and could serve as early targets of selection. Our analysis provides computational tools for analyzing very large chemical/biochemical reaction networks and suggests new approaches to studying abiogenesis in the lab.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ceRNAR: An R package for identification and analysis of ceRNA-miRNA triplets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi-Wen Hsiao, Lin Wang, Tzu-Pin Lu</p>

Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) represents a novel mechanism of gene regulation that controls several biological and pathological processes. Recently, an increasing number of <i>in silico</i> methods have been developed to accelerate the identification of such regulatory events. However, there is still a need for a tool supporting the hypothesis that ceRNA regulatory events only occur at specific miRNA expression levels. To this end, we present an R package, ceRNAR, which allows identification and analysis of ceRNA-miRNA triplets via integration of miRNA and RNA expression data. The ceRNAR package integrates three main steps: (i) identification of ceRNA pairs based on a rank-based correlation between pairs that considers the impact of miRNA and a running sum correlation statistic, (ii) sample clustering based on gene-gene correlation by circular binary segmentation, and (iii) peak merging to identify the most relevant sample patterns. In addition, ceRNAR also provides downstream analyses of identified ceRNA-miRNA triplets, including network analysis, functional annotation, survival analysis, external validation, and integration of different tools. The performance of our proposed approach was validated through simulation studies of different scenarios. Compared with several published tools, ceRNAR was able to identify true ceRNA triplets with high sensitivity, low false-positive rates, and acceptable running time. In real data applications, the ceRNAs common to two lung cancer datasets were identified in both datasets. The bridging miRNA for one of these, the ceRNA for <i>MAP4K3</i>, was identified by ceRNAR as hsa-let-7c-5p. Since similar cancer subtypes do share some biological patterns, these results demonstrated that our proposed algorithm was able to identify potential ceRNA targets in real patients. In summary, ceRNAR offers a novel algorithm and a comprehensive pipeline to identify and analyze ceRNA regulation. The package is implemented in R and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ywhsiao/ceRNAR).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Species abundance correlations carry limited information about microbial network interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susanne Pinto, Elisa BenincÃ , Egbert H. van Nes, Marten Scheffer, Johannes A. Bogaards</p>

Unraveling the network of interactions in ecological communities is a daunting task. Common methods to infer interspecific interactions from cross-sectional data are based on co-occurrence measures. For instance, interactions in the human microbiome are often inferred from correlations between the abundance of bacterial phylogenetic groups across subjects. We tested whether such correlation-based methods are indeed reliable for inferring interaction networks. For this purpose, we simulated bacterial communities by means of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model, with variation in model parameters representing variability among hosts. Our results show that correlations can be indicative for presence of bacterial interactions, but only when measurement noise is low relative to the variation in interaction strengths between hosts. Indication of interaction was affected by type of interaction network, process noise and sampling under non-equilibrium conditions. The sign of a correlation mostly coincided with the nature of the strongest pairwise interaction, but this is not necessarily the case. For instance, under rare conditions of identical interaction strength, we found that competitive and exploitative interactions can result in positive as well as negative correlations. Thus, cross-sectional abundance data carry limited information on specific interaction types. Correlations in abundance may hint at interactions but require independent validation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Patterns of asymmetry and energy cost generated from predictive simulations of hemiparetic gait</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Russell T. Johnson, Nicholas A. Bianco, James M. Finley</p>

Hemiparesis, defined as unilateral muscle weakness, often occurs in people post-stroke or people with cerebral palsy, however it is difficult to understand how this hemiparesis affects movement patterns as it often presents alongside a variety of other neuromuscular impairments. Predictive musculoskeletal modeling presents an opportunity to investigate how impairments affect gait performance assuming a particular cost function. Here, we use predictive simulation to quantify the spatiotemporal asymmetries and changes to metabolic cost that emerge when muscle strength is unilaterally reduced and how reducing spatiotemporal symmetry affects metabolic cost. We modified a 2-D musculoskeletal model by uniformly reducing the peak isometric muscle force unilaterally. We then solved optimal control simulations of walking across a range of speeds by minimizing the sum of the cubed muscle excitations. Lastly, we ran additional optimizations to test if reducing spatiotemporal asymmetry would result in an increase in metabolic cost. Our results showed that the magnitude and direction of effort-optimal spatiotemporal asymmetries depends on both the gait speed and level of weakness. Also, the optimal speed was 1.25 m/s for the symmetrical and 20% weakness models but slower (1.00 m/s) for the 40% and 60% weakness models, suggesting that hemiparesis can account for a portion of the slower gait speed seen in people with hemiparesis. Modifying the cost function to minimize spatiotemporal asymmetry resulted in small increases (~4%) in metabolic cost. Overall, our results indicate that spatiotemporal asymmetry may be optimal for people with hemiparesis. Additionally, the effect of speed and the level of weakness on spatiotemporal asymmetry may help explain the well-known heterogenous distribution of spatiotemporal asymmetries observed in the clinic. Future work could extend our results by testing the effects of other neuromuscular impairments on optimal gait strategies, and therefore build a more comprehensive understanding of the gait patterns observed in clinical populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Utility of constraints reflecting system stability on analyses for biological models</a></h4>

Simulating complex biological models consisting of multiple ordinary differential equations can aid in the prediction of the pharmacological/biological responses; however, they are often hampered by the availability of reliable kinetic parameters. In the present study, we aimed to discover the properties of behaviors without determining an optimal combination of kinetic parameter values (parameter set). The key idea was to collect as many parameter sets as possible. Given that many systems are biologically stable and resilient (BSR), we focused on the dynamics around the steady state and formulated objective functions for BSR by partial linear approximation of the focused region. Using the objective functions and modified global cluster Newton method, we developed an algorithm for a thorough exploration of the allowable parameter space for biological systems (TEAPS). We first applied TEAPS to the NF-ÎºB signaling model. This system shows a damped oscillation after stimulation and seems to fit the BSR constraint. By applying TEAPS, we found several directions in parameter space which stringently determines the BSR property. In such directions, the experimentally fitted parameter values were included in the range of the obtained parameter sets. The arachidonic acid metabolic pathway model was used as a model related to pharmacological responses. The pharmacological effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were simulated using the parameter sets obtained by TEAPS. The structural properties of the system were partly extracted by analyzing the distribution of the obtained parameter sets. In addition, the simulations showed inter-drug differences in prostacyclin to thromboxane A2 ratio such that aspirin treatment tends to increase the ratio, while rofecoxib treatment tends to decrease it. These trends are comparable to the clinical observations. These results on real biological models suggest that the parameter sets satisfying the BSR condition can help in finding biologically plausible parameter sets and understanding the properties of biological systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ambiguity drives higher-order Pavlovian learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomislav D. Zbozinek, Omar D. Perez, Toby Wise, Michael Fanselow, Dean Mobbs</p>

In the natural world, stimulus-outcome associations are often ambiguous, and most associations are highly complex and situation-dependent. Learning to disambiguate these complex associations to identify which specific outcomes will occur in which situations is critical for survival. Pavlovian occasion setters are stimuli that determine whether other stimuli will result in a specific outcome. Occasion setting is a well-established phenomenon, but very little investigation has been conducted on how occasion setters are disambiguated when they themselves are ambiguous (i.e., when they do not consistently signal whether another stimulus will be reinforced). In two preregistered studies, we investigated the role of higher-order Pavlovian occasion setting in humans. We developed and tested the first computational model predicting direct associative learning, traditional occasion setting (i.e., 1<sup>st</sup>-order occasion setting), and 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting. This model operationalizes stimulus ambiguity as a mechanism to engage in higher-order Pavlovian learning. Both behavioral and computational modeling results suggest that 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting was learned, as evidenced by lack and presence of transfer of occasion setting properties when expected and the superior fit of our 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting model compared to the 1<sup>st</sup>-order occasion setting or direct associations models. These results provide a controlled investigation into highly complex associative learning and may ultimately lead to improvements in the treatment of Pavlovian-based mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, substance use).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A transcriptional cycling model recapitulates chromatin-dependent features of noisy inducible transcription</a></h4>

              
                <p>by M. Elise Bullock, Nataly Moreno-Martinez, Kathryn Miller-Jensen</p>

Activation of gene expression in response to environmental cues results in substantial phenotypic heterogeneity between cells that can impact a wide range of outcomes including differentiation, viral activation, and drug resistance. An important source of gene expression noise is transcriptional bursting, or the process by which transcripts are produced during infrequent bursts of promoter activity. Chromatin accessibility impacts transcriptional bursting by regulating the assembly of transcription factor and polymerase complexes on promoters, suggesting that the effect of an activating signal on transcriptional noise will depend on the initial chromatin state at the promoter. To explore this possibility, we simulated transcriptional activation using a transcriptional cycling model with three promoter states that represent chromatin remodeling, polymerase binding and pause release. We initiated this model over a large parameter range representing target genes with different chromatin environments, and found that, upon increasing the polymerase pause release rate to activate transcription, changes in gene expression noise varied significantly across initial promoter states. This model captured phenotypic differences in activation of latent HIV viruses integrated at different chromatin locations and mediated by the transcription factor NF-ÎºB. Activating transcription in the model via increasing one or more of the transcript production rates, as occurs following NF-ÎºB activation, reproduced experimentally measured transcript distributions for four different latent HIV viruses, as well as the bimodal pattern of HIV protein expression that leads to a subset of reactivated virus. Importantly, the parameter âactivation pathâ differentially affected gene expression noise, and ultimately viral activation, in line with experimental observations. This work demonstrates how upstream signaling pathways can be connected to biological processes that underlie transcriptional bursting, resulting in target gene-specific noise profiles following stimulation of a single upstream pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantitative prediction of ensemble dynamics, shapes and contact propensities of intrinsically disordered proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Yu, Rafael BrÃ¼schweiler</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly dynamic systems that play an important role in cell signaling processes and their misfunction often causes human disease. Proper understanding of IDP function not only requires the realistic characterization of their three-dimensional conformational ensembles at atomic-level resolution but also of the time scales of interconversion between their conformational substates. Large sets of experimental data are often used in combination with molecular modeling to restrain or bias models to improve agreement with experiment. It is shown here for the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (p53TAD) and Pup, which are two IDPs that fold upon binding to their targets, how the latest advancements in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations methodology produces native conformational ensembles by combining replica exchange with series of microsecond MD simulations. They closely reproduce experimental data at the global conformational ensemble level, in terms of the distribution properties of the radius of gyration tensor, and at the local level, in terms of NMR properties including <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation, without the need for reweighting. Further inspection revealed that 10â20% of the individual MD trajectories display the formation of secondary structures not observed in the experimental NMR data. The IDP ensembles were analyzed by graph theory to identify dominant inter-residue contact clusters and characteristic amino-acid contact propensities. These findings indicate that modern MD force fields with residue-specific backbone potentials can produce highly realistic IDP ensembles sampling a hierarchy of nano- and picosecond time scales providing new insights into their biological function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence, causes and impacts of human trafficking in Asian countries: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Asian countries, human trafficking is often encountered as forced labor, forced marriage, sex trafficking, men, women, and children exploitation. This review points out how human trafficking activities are prevalent in Asian countries and also reveals different causes that are the basis of increasingly human trafficking in Asian countries such as poverty, unemployment, political uncertainty, war, natural disaster, corruption and weak policies. Human trafficking also creates huge health, physical, psychological and social implications on individuals and the overall society. Methods: The purpose of this study is to collect evidence on human trafficking in Asian countries. A scoping review methodology was used to systematically search online databases including Sage Journals Online, Wiley Online, Hein Online, Taylor & Francis Online, Web of Science, and Scopus literature to amalgamate information on this issue. For the purposes of this article, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria after searching and screening a total number of 1,278 studies. Results: The findings of this study were classified under three categories: prevalence of human trafficking in Asia, causes of human trafficking in Asia (poverty and unemployment, environmental and manmade disaster, weak policies and corruption), and impacts of human trafficking including social, health, physical, psychological impacts. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the prevalence and impacts of human trafficking, the author also recommends some meaningful and practical steps for policymakers and researchers to effectively tackle human trafficking in Asian countries.

                Background: Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is a highly transmissible disease representing a significant global public health burden. The provision of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) has contributed to the reduction of malaria across endemic countries. However, the detection of insecticide resistance in many mosquito vector species potentially threatens the long-term effectiveness of ITNs. A novel method to reduce the impact of insecticide resistance is to treat mosquito nets with multiple active ingredients. Methods and analysis: This review will comprehensively search the literature (both published and unpublished) for any studies investigating the effectiveness of mosquito nets treated with multiple active ingredients, known henceforth as dual-active-ingredient (DAI) ITNs. The DAI ITNs of interest include those treated with a pyrethroid and non-pyrethroid insecticide (review question 1) or with a pyrethroid and an insect growth regulator (review question 2).Â  Studies will be screened to meet the inclusion criteria by a minimum of two authors, followed by assessment of risk of bias (using appropriate risk of bias tools for randomised and non-randomised studies) and extraction of relevant information using structured forms by two independent authors. Meta-analyses will be carried out where possible for epidemiological outcomes and subgrouping will be considered. Certainty in the evidence will be established with GRADE assessments. Ethics and dissemination: A full review report will be submitted to the Vector Control and Insecticide Resistance Unit, Global Malaria Program, WHO. A version of this report will be submitted for publication in an open access peer-reviewed journal. The report will inform the development of WHO recommendations regarding the use of DAI ITNs for the prevention of malaria. This systematic review does not require ethics approval as it is a review of primary studies. Registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42022333044

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">How critical is brain criticality?</a></h4>

              
                Criticality is the singular state of complex systems poised at the brink of a phase transition between order and randomness. Such systems display remarkable information-processing capabilities, evoking the compelling hypothesis that the brain may itself be critical. This foundational idea is now drawing renewed interest thanks to high-density data and converging cross-disciplinary knowledge. Together, these lines of inquiry have shed light on the intimate link between criticality, computation, and cognition.

                Feedforward and feedback pathway interactions are widespread, yet poorly understood. Rindner etÂ al. show that subpopulations of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the PPC integrate sensory and frontal afferents with distinct nonlinear synaptic dynamics that arise from an interaction of ionic mechanisms and cell-type-specific feedforward inhibition.

                LSD is the prototypical psychedelic drug that profoundly alters human sensation, perception, and mood. Cao etÂ al. determined the high-resolution cryo-EM structures of LSD-bound HTR2B in transducer-free, G-protein-coupled, and Î²-arrestin-1-coupled states, which reveal the molecular bases underlying the differential engagement of downstream signaling transducers for LSD.

                Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) is an adaptive physiological process that regulates neurotransmission, contributing to nervous system resilience. Orr and colleagues harness both mice and Drosophila to define a presynaptic protein assembly that drives the initiation and expression of PHP, creating a dynamic model for the adaptive control synaptic transmission.

                How do forces activate mechanical nociceptors? Gong and Chen etÂ al. find that poking a Drosophila larva elicits shear stress to activate nociceptors through select TrpA1 isoforms. Single-channel recordings further demonstrate TrpA1 as a conserved mechanosensitive channel that is specifically activated by shear stress but not stretch.

                The oncogenic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) is a key transducer of the hedgehog (HH) morphogen, which plays an essential role in the patterning of epithelial structures. Here, we examine how HH controls SMO subcellular localization and activity in a polarized epithelium using the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc as a model. We provide evidence that HH promotes the stabilization of SMO by switching its fate after endocytosis toward recycling. This effect involves the sequential and additive action of protein kinase A, casein kinase I, and the Fused (FU) kinase. Moreover, in the presence of very high levels of HH, the second effect of FU leads to the local enrichment of SMO in the most basal domain of the cell membrane. Together, these results link the morphogenetic effects of HH to the apico-basal distribution of SMO and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of a GPCR.

                Redox reactions are central to biochemistry and are both controlled by and induce protein structural changes. Here, we describe structural rearrangements and crosstalk within the <i>Bacillus cereus</i> ribonucleotide reductase R2bâNrdI complex, a di-metal carboxylate-flavoprotein system, as part of the mechanism generating the essential catalytic free radical of the enzyme. Femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free electron laser was utilized to obtain structures at room temperature in defined redox states without suffering photoreduction. Together with density functional theory calculations, we show that the flavin is under steric strain in the R2bâNrdI protein complex, likely tuning its redox properties to promote superoxide generation. Moreover, a binding site in close vicinity to the expected flavin O<sub>2</sub> interaction site is observed to be controlled by the redox state of the flavin and linked to the channel proposed to funnel the produced superoxide species from NrdI to the di-manganese site in protein R2b. These specific features are coupled to further structural changes around the R2bâNrdI interaction surface. The mechanistic implications for the control of reactive oxygen species and radical generation in protein R2b are discussed.

                Human esophageal cancer has a global impact on human health due to its high incidence and mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat or prevent the prominent pathological subtype of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Based upon a screening of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, we discovered that Arbidol could effectively inhibit the proliferation of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma <i>in vitro</i>. Next, we conducted a series of cell-based assays and found that Arbidol treatment inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of ESCC cells and promoted G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Phospho-proteomics experiments, <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays and pull-down assays were subsequently performed in order to identify the underlying growth inhibitory mechanism. We verified Arbidol is a potential ATR inhibitor via binding to ATR kinase to reduce the phosphorylation and activation of MCM2 at Ser108. Finally, we demonstrated Arbidol had the inhibitory effect of ESCC <i>in vivo</i> by a PDX model. All together, Arbidol inhibits the proliferation of ESCC <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> through the DNA replication pathway and is associated with the cell cycle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Automatically tracking feeding behavior in populations of foraging C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> feeds on bacteria and other small microorganisms which it ingests using its pharynx, a neuromuscular pump. Currently, measuring feeding behavior requires tracking a single animal, indirectly estimating food intake from population-level metrics, or using restrained animals. To enable large throughput feeding measurements of unrestrained, crawling worms on agarose plates at a single worm resolution, we developed an imaging protocol and a complementary image analysis tool called PharaGlow. We image up to 50 unrestrained crawling worms simultaneously and extract locomotion and feeding behaviors. We demonstrate the toolâs robustness and high-throughput capabilities by measuring feeding in different use-case scenarios, such as through development, with genetic and chemical perturbations that result in faster and slower pumping, and in the presence or absence of food. Finally, we demonstrate that our tool is capable of long-term imaging by showing behavioral dynamics of mating animals and worms with different genetic backgrounds. The low-resolution fluorescence microscopes required are readily available in <i>C. elegans</i> laboratories, and in combination with our python-based analysis workflow makes this methodology easily accessible. PharaGlow therefore enables the observation and analysis of the temporal dynamics of feeding and locomotory behaviors with high-throughput and precision in a user-friendly system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Foveal vision anticipates defining features of eye movement targets</a></h4>

              
                High-acuity foveal processing is vital for human vision. Nonetheless, little is known about how the preparation of large-scale rapid eye movements (saccades) affects visual sensitivity in the center of gaze. Based on findings from passive fixation tasks, we hypothesized that during saccade preparation, foveal processing anticipates soon-to-be fixated visual features. Using a dynamic large-field noise paradigm, we indeed demonstrate that defining features of an eye movement target are enhanced in the pre-saccadic center of gaze. Enhancement manifested as higher Hit Rates for foveal probes with target-congruent orientation and a sensitization to incidental, target-like orientation information in foveally presented noise. Enhancement was spatially confined to the center of gaze and its immediate vicinity, even after parafoveal task performance had been raised to a foveal level. Moreover, foveal enhancement during saccade preparation was more pronounced and developed faster than enhancement during passive fixation. Based on these findings, we suggest a crucial contribution of foveal processing to trans-saccadic visual continuity: Foveal processing of saccade targets commences before the movement is executed and thereby enables a seamless transition once the center of gaze reaches the target.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">GENESPACE tracks regions of interest and gene copy number variation across multiple genomes</a></h4>

              
                The development of multiple chromosome-scale reference genome sequences in many taxonomic groups has yielded a high-resolution view of the patterns and processes of molecular evolution. Nonetheless, leveraging information across multiple genomes remains a significant challenge in nearly all eukaryotic systems. These challenges range from studying the evolution of chromosome structure, to finding candidate genes for quantitative trait loci, to testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. Here, we present GENESPACE, which addresses these challenges by integrating conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. We demonstrate this utility by dissecting presenceâabsence, copy-number, and structural variation at three levels of biological organization: spanning 300 million years of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic orthology in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes.

                Background: Soluble Resistance Related Calcium Binding Protein (sorcin) is a calcium (Ca2+) binding protein which has been shown to play a role in maintaining intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and lowering ER stress. Recently, our lab has demonstrated that sorcin expression was downregulated in the islets of Langerhans of mice fed a high-fat diet or in human islets incubated with the saturated fatty acid palmitate. We also showed that overexpression of sorcin under control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP7) in C57BL/6J mice, or whole body sorcin deletion in 129S1/SvImJ mice, improves or impairs insulin secretion and pancreatic {beta}-cell function respectively. The mechanisms behind this beneficial role of sorcin in the pancreatic {beta}-cell might depend on protection against lipotoxic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through improved ER Ca2+ dynamics and activation of the Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Whether sorcin is also implicated in hypothalamic ER stress during the progression of obesity is unknown. This could potentially contribute to the diminished satiety typically observed in overweight individuals. Aim: To investigate a potential role of sorcin in hypothalamic ER stress, leptin resistance, hyperphagia and obesity. Methods: Whole-body sorcin null mice, backcrossed onto the C57BL/6J genetic background, were used. Body weight, food intake and EchoMRI body composition were measured in vivo whereas qRT-PCR analysis of sorcin and ER stress markers expression were performed on the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Leptin signalling through STAT3 phosphorylation was measured by Western blots on sorcin-null HEK293 cells, engineered by CRISPR/Cas9, and transfected with leptin receptor (LepRb). Results: Sorcin expression was not influenced in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus by diet-induced obesity. Whole-body sorcin ablation did not cause ARC ER stress nor changes in body weight, body composition or food intake in C57BL/6 male mice exposed to a high-fat, high-sugar diet. STAT3 phosphorylation (Y705) in response to leptin was not impaired in sorcin-null HEK293 cells. Conclusion: In our model, whole body sorcin ablation did not increase hypothalamic ER stress nor influenced food intake or body weight.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of persistent functional brain impairment and results in a robust, but poorly understood, neuroinflammatory response that contributes to the long-term pathology. Here, we used single-nuclei RNA-sequencing to study transcriptomic changes in different cell populations from human brain tissue obtained acutely after severe, life-threatening TBI. We found a unique transcriptional response in several cell types, including the activation of an interferon response in oligodendrocytes coupled with the transcriptional activation of MHC-class I and class II related genes. Thus, oligodendrocytes undergo a transformation to an immune-like cell state immediately after TBI, indicating an important role for these cells in the initiation of neuroinflammation. Notably, the activation of immune-related genes correlated with the expression of endogenous retroviruses in oligodendrocytes, linking these ancient viral sequences to neuroinflammation. In summary, this work provides a unique insight into the initiating events of the neuroinflammatory response in TBI, which has new therapeutic implications.

                Although thermal body signals provide crucial information about the state of an organism, and changes in body temperature may be a sign of affective states (e.g., stress, pain, sexual arousal), research on thermal awareness is limited. Here we developed a task measuring awareness of changes in peripheral body temperature (thermal interoception) and compared it to the classical heartbeat counting task (cardiac interoception). With an infrared lightbulb we delivered stimuli of different temperature intensities to the right hand of 31 healthy participants. Thermal interoceptive accuracy, i.e., the difference between participants' real and perceived change in hand temperature, showed good inter-individual variability. We found that thermal interoception did not correlate with (and was generally higher than) cardiac interoception, suggesting that different interceptive channels provide separate contributions to awareness of bodily states. Moreover, the results hint at the great salience of thermal signals and the need for thermoregulation in day-to-day life. Finally, thermal interoceptive accuracy was associated with self-reported awareness of body temperature changes, and with the ability to regulate distress by focusing on body sensations. Our task has the potential to significantly increase current knowledge about the role of interoception in cognition and behavior, particularly in social and emotional contexts.

                The spinal cord has poor ability to regenerate after injury, which may be due to cell loss, cyst formation, inflammation, and scarring. A promising approach to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) is the use of biomaterials. We have developed a novel hydrogel scaffold fabricated from oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) as a 0.08 mm thick sheet containing polymer ridges and a cell-attractive surface chemistry on the other side. When the cells are cultured on OPF with the chemical patterning, the cells attach, align, and deposit ECM along the direction of the pattern. Animals implanted with the rolled scaffold sheets had greater hindlimb recovery compared to the multichannel scaffold control, likely due to the greater number of axons growing across. Inflammation, scarring, and ECM deposits were equal across conditions. Overall, the results suggest that the scaffold sheets promote axon outgrowth that can be guided across the scaffold, thereby promoting hindlimb recovery.

                As the demand for prosthetic limbs with reliable and multi-functional control increases, recent advances in myoelectric pattern recognition and implanted sensors have proven considerably advantageous. Additionally, sensory feedback from the prosthesis can be achieved via stimulation of the residual nerves, enabling closed-loop control over the prosthesis. However, this stimulation can cause interfering artifacts in the electromyographic (EMG) signals which deteriorate the reliability and function of the prosthesis. Here, we implement two real-time stimulation artifact removal algorithms, Template Subtraction and {varepsilon}-Normalized Least Mean Squares, and investigate their performance in offline and real-time myoelectric pattern recognition in two transhumeral amputees implanted with nerve cuff and EMG electrodes. We show that both algorithms are capable of significantly improving signal-to-noise ratio and offline pattern recognition accuracy of artifact-corrupted EMG signals. Furthermore, both algorithms improved real-time decoding of motor intention during active neurostimulation. Although these outcomes are dependent on the user-specific sensor locations and neurostimulation settings, they nonetheless represent progress towards bi-directional neuromusculoskeletal prostheses capable of multifunction control and simultaneous sensory feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolution of predictive memory in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The brain organizes experiences into memories that can be used to guide future behavior. Hippocampal CA1 population activity may reflect the retrieval of predictive models that contain information about future events, but little is known about how these kinds of memories develop with experience. We trained mice on a series of tone discrimination problems with or without a common statistical structure to observe how memories are formed and updated during learning. Mice that learned structured problems integrated their experiences into a predictive model that contained the solutions to upcoming novel problems. Retrieving the model during learning improved discrimination accuracy and facilitated learning by decreasing the amount of new information that needed to be acquired. Using calcium imaging to track the activity of thousands of CA1 neurons during learning on this task, we observed the emergence of a persistent hippocampal ensemble at the same time that mice formed a predictive model of their environment. This ensemble was reactivated during training and incorporated new neuronal activity patterns from each training problem. Interestingly, the degree to which mice reactivated the ensemble was related to how well their model predicted the content of the current problem, ensuring that the model was only updated with congruent information. In contrast, mice trained on unstructured problems did not form a predictive model or engage a persistent ensemble. These results show how hippocampal activity supports building predictive models by organizing newly learned information according to its congruence with existing memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semantic-Specific and Domain-General Mechanisms for Integration and Update of Contextual Information</a></h4>

              
                Recent research has highlighted the importance of domain-general processes and brain regions for language and semantic cognition. Yet, this has been mainly observed in executively demanding tasks, leaving open the question of the contribution of domain-general processes to natural language and semantic cognition. Using fMRI, we investigated whether neural processes reflecting context integration and context update - two key aspects of naturalistic language and semantic processing - are domain-specific versus domain-general. Thus, we compared neural responses during integration of contextual information across semantic and non-semantic tasks. Whole-brain results revealed both shared (left posterior-dorsal inferior frontal gyrus, left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, and left dorsal angular gyrus/intraparietal sulcus) and distinct (left anterior-ventral inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior ventral angular gyrus, left posterior middle temporal gyrus for semantic control only) regions involved in context integration and update. Furthermore, data-driven functional connectivity analysis clustered domain-specific versus domain-general brain regions into distinct but interacting functional neural networks. These results provide a first characterisation of the neural processes required for context-dependent integration during language processing along the domain-specificity dimension, and at the same time, they bring new insights on the role of left posterior lateral temporal cortex and left angular gyrus for semantic cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysregulation of The Chromatin Environment Leads to Differential Alternative Splicing as A Mechanism Of Disease In a Human Model of Autism Spectrum Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 44 children. Chromatin regulatory proteins are overrepresented among genes that contain high risk variants in ASD. Disruption of the chromatin environment leads to widespread dysregulation of gene expression, which is traditionally thought as a mechanism of disease pathogenesis associated with ASD. Alternatively, alterations in chromatin dynamics could also lead to dysregulation of alternative splicing, which is understudied as a mechanism of ASD pathogenesis. The anticonvulsant valproic acid (VPA) is a well-known environmental risk factor for ASD that acts as a class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying defects in human neuronal development associated with exposure to VPA are understudied. To dissect how VPA exposure and subsequent chromatin hyperacetylation influence molecular signatures involved in ASD pathogenesis, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in human cortical neurons that were treated with VPA. We observed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched for mRNA splicing, mRNA processing, histone modification, and metabolism related gene sets. Furthermore, we observed widespread increase in the number and the type of alternative splicing events. Analysis of differential transcript usage (DTU) showed that exposure to VPA induces extensive alterations in transcript isoform usage across neurodevelopmentally important genes. Finally, we find that DEGs and genes that display DTU overlap with known ASD-risk genes. Together, these findings suggest that, in addition to differential gene expression, changes in alternative splicing correlated with alterations in the chromatin environment could act as an additional mechanism of disease in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">When Abstract Becomes Concrete: Naturalistic Encoding of Concepts in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Humans learn and process language in complex and dynamic contexts, involving simultaneous processing of connected speech, faces, bodies, objects and including, at times, touch, odor, and taste. How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real world processing is unclear. We investigated the representational structure of conceptual encoding in a naturalistic setting and asked to what extent brain responses dynamically depend on context. Across different contexts, we find evidence that concrete and abstract concepts encode experience-based information in roughly differential sets of brain regions. However, these differences reduce when contextual variance is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract concepts becomes more concrete-like when they are processed in context highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when context is unrelated to a given concrete concept, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. Our results suggest that while concepts encode habitual experiences on average, the underlying neurobiological organization is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information at the time of processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive Encoding Speed in Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Humans can adapt when complex patterns unfold at a faster or slower pace, for instance when remembering a grocery list that is dictated at an increasingly fast pace. Integrating information over such timescales crucially depends on working memory, but although state-of-the-art theories assume that working memory capacity can be flexibly adapted, these theories assume that encoding speed cannot. In a series of experiments, we found that humans encoded at a faster rate when they were adapted to overall and recent rate of incoming information. Interestingly, our participants were unable to use explicit cues to speed up encoding, even though these cues were more informative than statistical information. Our findings suggest that adaptive tuning of encoding speed in working memory is a fundamental but largely implicit mechanism underlying our ability to keep up with the pace of our surroundings.

	<p>The technology for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has significantly changed over the years, with important improvements in the signal generators, the coils, the positioning systems, and the software for modeling, optimization, and therapy planning. In this systematic literature review (SLR), the evolution of each component of TMS technology is presented and analyzed to assess the limitations to overcome. This SLR was carried out following the PRISMA 2020 statement. Published articles of TMS were searched for in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, IEEE). Conference papers and other reviews were excluded. Records were filtered using terms about TMS technology with a semi-automatic software; articles that did not present new technology developments were excluded manually. After this screening, 101 records were included, with 19 articles proposing new stimulator designs (18.8%), 46 presenting or adapting coils (45.5%), 18 proposing systems for coil placement (17.8%), and 43 implementing algorithms for coil optimization (42.6%). The articles were blindly classified by the authors to reduce the risk of bias. However, our results could have been influenced by our research interests, which would affect conclusions for applications in psychiatric and neurological diseases. Our analysis indicates that more emphasis should be placed on optimizing the current technology with a special focus on the experimental validation of models. With this review, we expect to establish the base for future TMS technological developments.</p>

	<p>Background and Aims. Most research on Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) focuses on describing symptoms and movement characteristics. Studies rarely focus on the early detection of PD and the search for suitable markers of a prodromal stage. Early detection is important, so treatments that may potentially change the course of the disease can be attempted early on. While gait disturbances are less pronounced in the early stages of the disease, the prevalence, and severity increase with disease progression. Therefore, postural instability and gait difficulties could be identified as sensitive biomarkers. The aim was to evaluate the discriminatory power of the Trail-Walking Test (TWT; Schott, 2015) as a potential diagnostic instrument to improve the predictive power of the clinical evaluation concerning the severity of the disease and record the different aspects of walking. Methods. A total of 20 older healthy (M = 72.4 years, SD = 5.53) adults and 43 older adults with PD and the motor phenotypes postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD; M = 69.7 years, SD = 8.68) and tremor dominant (TD; M = 68.2 years, SD = 8.94) participated in the study. The participants performed a motor-cognitive dual task (DT) of increasing cognitive difficulty in which they had to walk a given path (condition 1), walk to numbers in ascending order (condition 2), and walk to numbers and letters alternately and in ascending order (condition 3). Results. With an increase in the cognitive load, the time to complete the tasks (seconds) became longer in all groups, F(1.23, 73.5) = 121, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;#627;2p = 0.670. PIGD showed the longest times in all conditions of the TWT, F(2, 60) = 8.15, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;#627;2p = 0.214. Mutual interferences in the cognitive and motor domain can be observed. However, clear group-specific patterns cannot be identified. A differentiation between the motor phenotypes of PD is especially feasible with the purely motor condition (TWT-M; AUC = 0.685, p = 0.44). Conclusions. PD patients with PIGD must be identified by valid, well-evaluated clinical tests that allow for a precise assessment of the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s individual fall risk, the severity of the disease, and the prognosis of progression. The TWT covers various aspects of mobility, examines the relationship between cognitive functions and walking, and enables differentiation of the motor phenotypes of PD.</p>

	<p>Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the only etiological technique for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Whilst there is a consensus MVD is likely effective regardless of age, the elderly population is thought to be more prone to have a higher rate of surgical complication, morbidity, and mortality. The main objective of our single-center, retrospective study was to analyze the surgical and clinical outcomes of MVD in TN elderly patients. From a surgical series of patients with TN who had undergone MVD from April 2018 to April 2022, 76 patients who matched the inclusion criteria were divided into two groups: twenty-five (32.9%) patients were older than 65 years and included in the elderly group, while the remaining fifty-one (61.1%) patients were below 65 years included in the non-elderly one. There were no differences between the groups in terms of acute pain relief (APR), Barrow Neurological Index (BNI) at follow-up, complications, and recurrence rate. In multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression analysis) the presence of an offending artery with nerve root distortion/indentation emerged as the only independent prognostic factor for pain-free survival (p = 0.0001). Our data endorse MVD as a safe and effective surgical procedure also for elderly patients with TN.</p>

	<p>The current study investigated the bottom-up experiential emotion regulation in comparison to the cognitiveve top down-approach of cognitive defusion. Rooted in an experiential- and client-centered psychotherapeutic approach, experiential emotion regulation involves an active, non-intervening, accepting, open and welcoming approach towards the bodily felt affective experience in a welcoming, compassionate way, expressed in &amp;amp;lsquo;experiential awareness&amp;amp;rsquo; in a first phase, and its verbalization or &amp;amp;lsquo;experiential expression&amp;amp;rsquo; in a second phase. Defusion refers to the ability to observe one&amp;amp;rsquo;s thoughts and feelings in a detached manner. Nineteen healthy participants completed an emotion regulation task during fMRI scanning by processing highly arousing negative events by images. Both experiential emotion regulation and cognitive defusion resulted in higher negative emotion compared to a &amp;amp;lsquo;watch&amp;amp;rsquo; control condition. On the neurophysiological level, experiential emotion regulation recruited brain areas that regulate attention towards affective- and somatosensorial experience such as the anterior cingulate cortex, the paracingulate gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the prefrontal pole, areas underlying multisensory information integration (e.g., angular gyrus), and linking body states to emotion recognition and awareness (e.g., postcentral gyrus). Experiential emotion regulation, relative to the control condition, also resulted in a higher interaction between the anterior insular cortex and left amygdala while participants experienced less negative emotion. Cognitive defusion decreased activation in the subcortical areas such as the brainstem, the thalamus, the amygdala, and the hippocampus. In contrast to cognitive defusion, experiential emotion regulation relative to demonstrated greater activation in the left angular gyrus, indicating more multisensory information integration. These findings provide insight into different and specific neural networks underlying psychotherapy-based experiential emotion regulation and cognitive defusion.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study was designed to gain insights regarding patterns of social representations (values, ideas, beliefs) of tinnitus and their relation to demographic and clinical factors. Method: A cross-sectional survey design was used including 399 adults seeking help and reporting interest in internet-based cognitive behavior therapy for tinnitus. Data were collected using a free association task and analysis used qualitative (content analysis) and quantitative (cluster analysis and chi-square analysis) using the Iramuteq software. Results: The social representations identified the negative impact of tinnitus and included the way it sounded (descriptions of the way tinnitus sounds (18%), annoyance (13.5%), and persistence (8%)). Four clusters were identified representing four levels of tinnitus severity, namely debilitating tinnitus (24%), distressing tinnitus (10%), annoying tinnitus (46%), and accepting tinnitus (20%). Cluster identity was associated with demographic and clinical variables. Discussion: The identified clusters represented tinnitus severity experience in four stages, ranging from debilitating tinnitus to acceptance of tinnitus. These findings are important for clinical practice where tinnitus descriptions can indicate the stage of the tinnitus experience and which intervention pathway may be most appropriate.</p>

	<p>Several harmonization techniques have recently been proposed for connectomics/networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) acquired at multiple sites. These techniques have the objective of mitigating site-specific biases that complicate its subsequent analysis and, therefore, compromise the quality of the results when these images are analyzed together. Thus, harmonization is indispensable when large cohorts are required in which the data obtained must be independent of the particular condition of each resonator, its make and model, its calibration, and other features or artifacts that may affect the significance of the acquisition. To date, no assessment of the actual efficacy of these harmonization techniques has been proposed. In this work, we apply recently introduced Information Theory tools to analyze the effectiveness of these techniques, developing a methodology that allows us to compare different harmonization models. We demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology by applying it to some of the most widespread harmonization frameworks and datasets. As a result, we are able to show that some of these techniques are indeed ineffective since the acquisition site can still be determined from the fMRI data after the processing.</p>

	<p>Background: It is well-established that environmental noise can disrupt sleep, and cause a mismatch between subjective and objective sleep, which is known as &amp;amp;ldquo;sleep misperception&amp;amp;rdquo;. Naturalistic studies indicate that pre-sleep cognitive arousal and sleep misperception are associated in the context of noise. However, it is not known if this is the case when ecologically valid noises are specifically played during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which is susceptible to noise-related disruption. The present study evaluated if pre-sleep cognitive arousal was associated with sleep misperception in healthy normal sleepers, when unexpected ecologically valid common nocturnal noises were played during NREM sleep. Methods: Eighteen healthy sleepers (Mage = 23.37 years, SDage = 3.21 years) participated. Sleep was measured objectively on three consecutive nights using polysomnography, in a sleep laboratory environment, and subjectively, through participant estimates of total sleep time (TST). Night 1 was a baseline night where no noises were played. On Night 2, noises, which were chosen to be representative of habitual nocturnal noises heard in home environments, were played to participants via in-ear headphones after 5 min of objective sleep. Results: Unexpectedly, habitual pre-sleep cognitive arousal was not associated with subjective&amp;amp;ndash;objective TST discrepancy on Night 2. Conclusions: These results suggest that in healthy sleepers, when ecologically valid noises are played unexpectedly during NREM sleep in an unfamiliar sleep laboratory environment the subjective experience of sleep is not associated with pre-sleep cognitive arousal, or negatively impacted by noise exposure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Lateralization of Autonomic Output in Response to Limb-Specific Threat</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In times of stress or danger, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) signals the fight or flight response. A canonical function of ANS activity is to globally mobilize metabolic resources, preparing the organism to respond to threat. Yet a body of research has demonstrated that, rather than displaying a homogenous pattern across the body, autonomic responses to arousing events, as measured through changes in electrodermal activity (EDA), can differ between right and left body locations. Surprisingly, an attempt to identify a function of ANS asymmetry consistent with its metabolic role has not been investigated. In the current study, we investigated whether asymmetric autonomic responses could be induced through limb-specific aversive stimulation. Participants were given mild electric stimulation to either the left or right arm while EDA was monitored bilaterally. In a group-level analyses, an ipsilateral EDA response bias was observed, with increased EDA response in the hand adjacent to the stimulation. This effect was observable in ~50% of individual participants. These results demonstrate that autonomic output is more complex than canonical interpretations suggest. We suggest that, in stressful situations, autonomic outputs can prepare either the whole-body fight or flight response, or a simply a limb-localized flick, which can effectively neutralize the threat while minimizing global resource consumption. These findings are consistent with recent theories proposing evolutionary leveraging of neural structures organized to mediate sensory responses for processing of cognitive emotional cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hierarchical Individual Naturalistic Functional Brain Networks with Group Consistency Uncovered by a Two-Stage NAS-Volumetric Sparse DBN Framework</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The functional magnetic resonance imaging under naturalistic paradigm (NfMRI) showed great advantages in identifying complex and interactive functional brain networks (FBNs) because of its dynamics and multimodal information. In recent years, various deep learning models, such as deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE), deep belief network (DBN), and volumetric sparse DBN (vsDBN), can obtain hierarchical FBNs and temporal features from fMRI data. Among them, the vsDBN model revealed a good capability in identifying hierarchical FBNs by modeling fMRI volume images. However, because of the high dimensionality of fMRI volumes and the diverse training parameters of deep learning methods, especially the network architecture that is the most critical parameter for uncovering the hierarchical organization of human brain function, researchers still face challenges in designing an appropriate deep learning framework with automatic network architecture optimization to model volumetric NfMRI. In addition, most of the existing deep learning models ignore the group-wise consistency and intersubject variation properties embedded in NfMRI volumes. To solve these problems, we proposed a two-stage neural architecture search (NAS) and vsDBN model (two-stage NAS-vsDBN model) to identify the hierarchical human brain spatiotemporal features possessing both group consistency and individual uniqueness under naturalistic condition. Moreover, our model defined reliable network structure for modeling volumetric NfMRI data via NAS framework, and the group-level and individual-level FBNs and associated temporal features exhibited great consistency. In general, our method well identified the hierarchical temporal and spatial features of the brain function and revealed the crucial properties of neural processes under natural viewing condition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Barriers to participation in research as perceived by undergraduate medical students: A cross-sectional study from Qassim. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Medical students` engagement in research activities continues to be below the expectation. In this study we aimed to investigate students` views about research, and to identify the barriers preventing them from participation in research projects. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Qassim University. A total of 230 students were included. The perceptions of students were assessed using a 16-item questionnaire. The mean scores were compared between students using Mann-Whitney test .Factors associated with students` perception of research barriers were analyzed using four separate logistic regression models. Results: The overall response rate was 89.4%. The results indicate that the students generally possess a moderately positive attitude towards research with a mean score of 14.8Â±2.7 (range: 5-25). A substantial number of participants reported their willingness to take part in any research-related task (77.0%). However, the participants highly agreed that lack of time (70.4%), lack of supervision and guidance (72.6%), lack of research training and support (73.9%), and lack of research exposure and opportunities (75.2%) were major barriers to their participation in research .We found that students having lower CGPA ranks are almost three times more likely to indicate lack of time as a challenge (AOR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.09,7.94; p.value=0.033). Overall, female students were more likely to report concerns about research training and availability of research opportunities, while male students were more likely to indicate lack of time and lack of supervision as research barriers. Conclusions: The barriers addressed in the current study âboth discretely and cumulativelyâare highly demotivating for students, and negatively affect their participation in research. Efforts should be invested to shift the focus from providing superficial research exposure to incorporating more in-depth and effective research training for undergraduate students

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genetics and functional significance of the understudied methamphetamine sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The last 50 years have witnessed extraordinary discoveries in the field of circadian rhythms. However, there are still several mysteries that remain. One of these chronobiological mysteries is the circadian rhythm that is revealed by administration of stimulant drugs to rodents. Herein we describe the discovery of this circadian rhythm and its underlying oscillator, which is frequently called the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator, or MASCO. This oscillator is distinct from canonical circadian oscillators because it controls robust activity rhythms independently of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and canonical circadian genes are not essential for its timekeeping. We discuss these fundamental properties of MASCO and synthesize studies of strain, sex, and circadian gene mutations on MASCO. The anatomical loci of MASCO are not known, so it has not been possible thus far to discover its novel molecular timekeeping mechanism or its functional significance. However, studies in mutant mice suggest that genetic approaches can be used to identify the neural network involved in the rhythm generation of MASCO. We also discuss parallels between human and rodent studies that support our working hypothesis that a function of MASCO may be to regulate sleep-wake cycles.

                Background: Dictyostelium discoideum is a ~10 Âµm diameter unicellular eukaryote that lives on soil surfaces. When starved, D. discoideum cells aggregate into streams of cells in a process called chemotaxis. In this report, we studied D. discoideum cells during chemotaxis using 3D - mass spectrometry imaging (3D-MSI). Methods: The 3D-MSI consisted of the sequential generation of 2D molecular maps using burst alignment coupled to delayed extraction time-of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) combined with a soft sputtering beam to access the different layers. Results: Molecular maps with sub-cellular high spatial resolution (~300 nm) indicated the presence of ions at m/z = 221 and 236 at the front and sides, but reduced levels at the back, of cells moving toward of aggregation streams. The 3D-MSI also detected an ion at m/z = 240 at the edges and back, but reduced levels at the front, of aggregating cells. Other ions showed an even distribution across the cells. Conclusions: Together, these results demonstrate the utility of sub-micron MSI to study eukaryotic chemotaxis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Malaria prevalence in Commune 5 in Tumaco (NariÃ±o, Colombia) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Antecedentes La malaria urbana es un problema de salud pÃºblica en Colombia y aÃºn existe desconocimiento sobre sus caracterÃ­sticas epidemiolÃ³gicas, las cuales son clave para la implementaciÃ³n de medidas de control. La presencia de casos de malaria urbana y el diagnÃ³stico de la enfermedad son algunos de los desafÃ­os que enfrentan los programas de eliminaciÃ³n de la malaria. El objetivo de esta investigaciÃ³n fue estimar la prevalencia de malaria, explorar factores asociados y detectar genes pfhrp 2/3 , en la zona urbana de Tumaco entre julio y diciembre de 2019. MÃ©todos Se realizÃ³ un estudio de prevalencia utilizando un muestreo probabilÃ­stico aleatorio estratificado. Se administraron encuestas estructuradas y se tomaron muestras de sangre y se examinaron mediante microscopÃ­a Ã³ptica, pruebas de diagnÃ³stico rÃ¡pido (RDT) y reacciÃ³n en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR). Se utilizÃ³ un modelo de regresiÃ³n logÃ­stica para explorar los factores asociados. Resultados Se encuestÃ³ a 1.504 personas que vivÃ­an en 526 hogares. La prevalencia global fue del 2,97% (IC 95%: 2,1 - 4,3%). Fue mayor en varones, en el grupo de edad de 10 a 19 aÃ±os y en casos asintomÃ¡ticos. La prevalencia de la amplificaciÃ³n de pfhrp2 fue del 2,16 % (IC del 95 %: 1,6 - 2,9 %). Los hogares con tres o mÃ¡s personas tenÃ­an un mayor riesgo de infecciÃ³n por paludismo (odds ratio ajustado [ORa] 4,05; intervalo de confianza [IC] del 95%: 1,57-10,43). Todos los casos se debieron a P. falciparum. Conclusiones La prevalencia de malaria urbana fue baja. Las estrategias para eliminar la malaria en Ã¡reas urbanas deben ajustarse considerando el acceso al diagnÃ³stico temprano, la infecciÃ³n asintomÃ¡tica y las PDR utilizadas para detectar la presencia del gen pfhrp2 .

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stability criteria for the consumption and exchange of essential resources</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Theo Gibbs, Yifan Zhang, Zachary R. Miller, James P. OâDwyer</p>

Models of consumer effects on a shared resource environment have helped clarify how the interplay of consumer traits and resource supply impact stable coexistence. Recent models generalize this picture to include the exchange of resources alongside resource competition. These models exemplify the fact that although consumers shape the resource environment, the outcome of consumer interactions is context-dependent: such models can have either stable or unstable equilibria, depending on the resource supply. However, these recent models focus on a simplified version of microbial metabolism where the depletion of resources always leads to consumer growth. Here, we model an arbitrarily large system of consumers governed by Liebigâs law, where species require and deplete multiple resources, but each consumerâs growth rate is only limited by a single one of these resources. Resources that are taken up but not incorporated into new biomass are leaked back into the environment, possibly transformed by intracellular reactions, thereby tying the mismatch between depletion and growth to cross-feeding. For this set of dynamics, we show that feasible equilibria can be either stable or unstable, again depending on the resource environment. We identify special consumption and production networks which protect the community from instability when resources are scarce. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the qualitative stability patterns derived analytically apply to a broader class of network structures and resource inflow profiles, including cases where multiple species coexist on only one externally supplied resource. Our stability criteria bear some resemblance to classic stability results for pairwise interactions, but also demonstrate how environmental context can shape coexistence patterns when resource limitation and exchange are modeled directly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Investigating differential abundance methods in microbiome data: A benchmark study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marco Cappellato, Giacomo Baruzzo, Barbara Di Camillo</p>

The development of increasingly efficient and cost-effective high throughput DNA sequencing techniques has enhanced the possibility of studying complex microbial systems. Recently, researchers have shown great interest in studying the microorganisms that characterise different ecological niches. Differential abundance analysis aims to find the differences in the abundance of each taxa between two classes of subjects or samples, assigning a significance value to each comparison. Several bioinformatic methods have been specifically developed, taking into account the challenges of microbiome data, such as sparsity, the different sequencing depth constraint between samples and compositionality. Differential abundance analysis has led to important conclusions in different fields, from health to the environment. However, the lack of a known biological truth makes it difficult to validate the results obtained. In this work we exploit metaSPARSim, a microbial sequencing count data simulator, to simulate data with differential abundance features between experimental groups. We perform a complete comparison of recently developed and established methods on a common benchmark with great effort to the reliability of both the simulated scenarios and the evaluation metrics. The performance overview includes the investigation of numerous scenarios, studying the effect on methodsâ results on the main covariates such as sample size, percentage of differentially abundant features, sequencing depth, feature variability, normalisation approach and ecological niches. Mainly, we find that methods show a good control of the type I error and, generally, also of the false discovery rate at high sample size, while recall seem to depend on the dataset and sample size.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constructing functional models from biophysically-detailed neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Duggins, Chris Eliasmith</p>

Improving biological plausibility and functional capacity are two important goals for brain models that connect low-level neural details to high-level behavioral phenomena. We develop a method called âoracle-supervised Neural Engineering Frameworkâ (osNEF) to train biologically-detailed spiking neural networks that realize a variety of cognitively-relevant dynamical systems. Specifically, we train networks to perform computations that are commonly found in cognitive systems (communication, multiplication, harmonic oscillation, and gated working memory) using four distinct neuron models (leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, Izhikevich neurons, 4-dimensional nonlinear point neurons, and 4-compartment, 6-ion-channel layer-V pyramidal cell reconstructions) connected with various synaptic models (current-based synapses, conductance-based synapses, and voltage-gated synapses). We show that osNEF networks exhibit the target dynamics by accounting for nonlinearities present within the neuron models: performance is comparable across all four systems and all four neuron models, with variance proportional to task and neuron model complexity. We also apply osNEF to build a model of working memory that performs a delayed response task using a combination of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons connected with NMDA and GABA synapses. The baseline performance and forgetting rate of the model are consistent with animal data from delayed match-to-sample tasks (DMTST): we observe a baseline performance of 95% and exponential forgetting with time constant <i>Ï</i> = 8.5s, while a recent meta-analysis of DMTST performance across species observed baseline performances of 58 â 99% and exponential forgetting with time constants of <i>Ï</i> = 2.4 â 71s. These results demonstrate that osNEF can train functional brain models using biologically-detailed components and open new avenues for investigating the relationship between biophysical mechanisms and functional capabilities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Architect: A tool for aiding the reconstruction of high-quality metabolic models through improved enzyme annotation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nirvana Nursimulu, Alan M. Moses, John Parkinson</p>

Constraint-based modeling is a powerful framework for studying cellular metabolism, with applications ranging from predicting growth rates and optimizing production of high value metabolites to identifying enzymes in pathogens that may be targeted for therapeutic interventions. Results from modeling experiments can be affected at least in part by the quality of the metabolic models used. Reconstructing a metabolic network manually can produce a high-quality metabolic model but is a time-consuming task. At the same time, current methods for automating the process typically transfer metabolic function based on sequence similarity, a process known to produce many false positives. We created Architect, a pipeline for automatic metabolic model reconstruction from protein sequences. First, it performs enzyme annotation through an ensemble approach, whereby a likelihood score is computed for an EC prediction based on predictions from existing tools; for this step, our method shows both increased precision and recall compared to individual tools. Next, Architect uses these annotations to construct a high-quality metabolic network which is then gap-filled based on likelihood scores from the ensemble approach. The resulting metabolic model is output in SBML format, suitable for constraints-based analyses. Through comparisons of enzyme annotations and curated metabolic models, we demonstrate improved performance of Architect over other state-of-the-art tools, notably with higher precision and recall on the eukaryote <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> and when compared to UniProt annotations in two bacterial species. Code for Architect is available at https://github.com/ParkinsonLab/Architect. For ease-of-use, Architect can be readily set up and utilized using its Docker image, maintained on Docker Hub.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparing and linking machine learning and semi-mechanistic models for the predictability of endemic measles dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Max S. Y. Lau, Alex Becker, Wyatt Madden, Lance A. Waller, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Bryan T. Grenfell</p>

Measles is one the best-documented and most-mechanistically-studied non-linear infectious disease dynamical systems. However, systematic investigation into the comparative performance of traditional mechanistic models and machine learning approaches in forecasting the transmission dynamics of this pathogen are still rare. Here, we compare one of the most widely used semi-mechanistic models for measles (TSIR) with a commonly used machine learning approach (LASSO), comparing performance and limits in predicting short to long term outbreak trajectories and seasonality for both regular and less regular measles outbreaks in England and Wales (E&W) and the United States. First, our results indicate that the proposed LASSO model can efficiently use data from multiple major cities and achieve similar short-to-medium term forecasting performance to semi-mechanistic models for E&W epidemics. Second, interestingly, the LASSO model also captures annual to biennial bifurcation of measles epidemics in E&W caused by susceptible response to the late 1940s baby boom. LASSO may also outperform TSIR for predicting less-regular dynamics such as those observed in major cities in US between 1932â45. Although both approaches capture short-term forecasts, accuracy suffers for both methods as we attempt longer-term predictions in highly irregular, post-vaccination outbreaks in E&W. Finally, we illustrate that the LASSO model can both qualitatively and quantitatively reconstruct mechanistic assumptions, notably susceptible dynamics, in the TSIR model. Our results characterize the limits of predictability of infectious disease dynamics for strongly immunizing pathogens with both mechanistic and machine learning models, and identify connections between these two approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Connectivity concepts in neuronal network modeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Johanna Senk, Birgit Kriener, Mikael Djurfeldt, Nicole Voges, Han-Jia Jiang, Lisa SchÃ¼ttler, Gabriele Gramelsberger, Markus Diesmann, Hans E. Plesser, Sacha J. van Albada</p>

Sustainable research on computational models of neuronal networks requires published models to be understandable, reproducible, and extendable. Missing details or ambiguities about mathematical concepts and assumptions, algorithmic implementations, or parameterizations hinder progress. Such flaws are unfortunately frequent and one reason is a lack of readily applicable standards and tools for model description. Our work aims to advance complete and concise descriptions of network connectivity but also to guide the implementation of connection routines in simulation software and neuromorphic hardware systems. We first review models made available by the computational neuroscience community in the repositories ModelDB and Open Source Brain, and investigate the corresponding connectivity structures and their descriptions in both manuscript and code. The review comprises the connectivity of networks with diverse levels of neuroanatomical detail and exposes how connectivity is abstracted in existing description languages and simulator interfaces. We find that a substantial proportion of the published descriptions of connectivity is ambiguous. Based on this review, we derive a set of connectivity concepts for deterministically and probabilistically connected networks and also address networks embedded in metric space. Beside these mathematical and textual guidelines, we propose a unified graphical notation for network diagrams to facilitate an intuitive understanding of network properties. Examples of representative network models demonstrate the practical use of the ideas. We hope that the proposed standardizations will contribute to unambiguous descriptions and reproducible implementations of neuronal network connectivity in computational neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Impact of gender on the formation and outcome of formal mentoring relationships in the life sciences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leah P. Schwartz, Jean F. LiÃ©nard, Stephen V. David</p>

Despite increasing representation in graduate training programs, a disproportionate number of women leave academic research without obtaining an independent position that enables them to train the next generation of academic researchers. To understand factors underlying this trend, we analyzed formal PhD and postdoctoral mentoring relationships in the life sciences during the years 2000 to 2020. Student and mentor gender are both associated with differences in rates of studentâs continuation to positions that allow formal academic mentorship. Although trainees of women mentors are less likely to take on positions as academic mentors than trainees of men mentors, this effect is reduced substantially after controlling for several measurements of mentor status. Thus, the effect of mentor gender can be explained at least partially by gender disparities in social and financial resources available to mentors. Because trainees and mentors tend to be of the same gender, this association between mentor gender and academic continuation disproportionately impacts women trainees. On average, gender homophily in graduate training is unrelated to mentor status. A notable exception to this trend is the special case of scientists having been granted an outstanding distinction, evidenced by membership in the National Academy of Sciences, being a grantee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, or having been awarded the Nobel Prize. This group of mentors trains men graduate students at higher rates than their most successful colleagues. These results suggest that, in addition to other factors that limit career choices for women trainees, gender inequities in mentorsâ access to resources and prestige contribute to womenâs attrition from independent research positions.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Injury programs shape glioblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer in adults and is almost universally fatal due to its stark therapeutic resistance. During the past decade, although survival has not substantially improved, major advances have been made in our understanding of the underlying biology. It has become clear that these devastating tumors recapitulate features of neurodevelopmental hierarchies which are influenced by the microenvironment. Emerging evidence also highlights a prominent role for injury responses in steering cellular phenotypes and contributing to tumor heterogeneity.

                The medial entorhinal cortex supports not only the encoding of the position one occupies in space, but also that of object location in a given environment. Caputi etÂ al. highlight the role of commissural input to the medial entorhinal cortex in the episodic memory retrieval of object location.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Low and high frequency intracranial neural signals match in the human associative cortex</a></h4>

              
                In vivo intracranial recordings of neural activity offer a unique opportunity to understand human brain function. Intracranial electrophysiological (iEEG) activity related to sensory, cognitive or motor events manifests mostly in two types of signals: event-related local field potentials in lower frequency bands (&lt;30 Hz, LF) and broadband activity in the higher end of the frequency spectrum (&gt;30 Hz, High frequency, HF). While most current studies rely exclusively on HF, thought to be more focal and closely related to spiking activity, the relationship between HF and LF signals is unclear, especially in human associative cortex. Here, we provide a large-scale in-depth investigation of the spatial and functional relationship between these 2 signals based on intracranial recordings from 121 individual brains (8000 recording sites). We measure category-selective responses to complex ecologically salient visual stimuli â human faces â across a wide cortical territory in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC), with a frequency-tagging method providing high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the same objective quantification of signal and noise for the two frequency ranges. While LF face-selective activity has higher SNR across the VOTC, leading to a larger number of significant electrode contacts especially in the anterior temporal lobe, LF and HF display highly similar spatial, functional, and timing properties. Specifically, and contrary to a widespread assumption, our results point to nearly identical spatial distribution and local spatial extent of LF and HF activity at equal SNR. These observations go a long way towards clarifying the relationship between the two main iEEG signals and reestablish the informative value of LF iEEG to understand human brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of pulmonary surfactant by the adhesion GPCR GPR116/ADGRF5 requires a tethered agonist-mediated activation mechanism</a></h4>

              
                The mechanistic details of the tethered agonist mode of activation for the adhesion GPCR ADGRF5/GPR116 has not been completely deciphered. We set out to investigate the physiologic importance of autocatalytic cleavage upstream of the agonistic peptide sequence, an event necessary for NTF displacement and subsequent receptor activation. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized tethered agonist-mediated activation of GPR116 <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. A knock-in mouse expressing a non-cleavable GPR116 mutant phenocopies the pulmonary phenotype of GPR116 knock-out mice, demonstrating that tethered agonist-mediated receptor activation is indispensable for function <i>in vivo</i>. Using site-directed mutagenesis and species swapping approaches we identified key conserved amino acids for GPR116 activation in the tethered agonist sequence and in extracellular loops 2/3 (ECL2/3). We further highlight residues in transmembrane7 (TM7) that mediate stronger signaling in mouse versus human GPR116 and recapitulate these findings in a model supporting tethered agonist:ECL2 interactions for GPR116 activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct regions of H. pylori's bactofilin CcmA regulate protein-protein interactions to control helical cell shape</a></h4>

              
                The helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells promotes robust stomach colonization, however, how the helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells is determined is unresolved. Previous work identified helical-cell-shape-promoting protein complexes containing a peptidoglycan-hydrolase (Csd1), a peptidoglycan precursor synthesis enzyme (MurF), a non-enzymatic homologue of Csd1 (Csd2), non-enzymatic transmembrane proteins (Csd5 and Csd7), and a bactofilin (CcmA). Bactofilins are highly conserved, spontaneously polymerizing cytoskeletal bacterial proteins. We sought to understand CcmA's function in generating the helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells. Using CcmA deletion analysis, <i>in vitro</i> polymerization, and <i>in vivo</i> co-immunoprecipitation experiments we identified that the bactofilin domain and N-terminal region of CcmA are required for helical cell shape and the bactofilin domain of CcmA is sufficient for polymerization and interactions with Csd5 and Csd7. We also found that CcmA's N-terminal region inhibits interaction with Csd7. Deleting the N-terminal region of CcmA increases CcmA-Csd7 interactions and destabilizes the peptidoglycan-hydrolase Csd1. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that Csd5 recruits CcmA to the cell envelope and promotes CcmA enrichment at the major helical axis. Thus, CcmA helps organize cell-shape-determining proteins and peptidoglycan synthesis machinery to coordinate cell wall modification and synthesis, promoting the curvature required to build a helical cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cancer genome and tumor microenvironment: Reciprocal crosstalk shapes lung cancer plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Lung cancer classification and treatment has been revolutionized by improving our understanding of driver mutations and the introduction of tumor microenvironment (TME)-associated immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite the significant improvement of lung cancer patient survival in response to either oncogene-targeted therapy or anticancer immunotherapy, many patients show initial or acquired resistance to these new therapies. Recent advances in genome sequencing reveal that specific driver mutations favor the development of an immunosuppressive TME phenotype, which may result in unfavorable outcomes in lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapies. Clinical studies with follow-up after immunotherapy, assessing oncogenic driver mutations and the TME immune profile, not only reveal the underlying potential molecular mechanisms in the resistant lung cancer patients but also hold the key to better treatment choices and the future of personalized medicine. In this review, we discuss the crosstalk between cancer cell genomic features and the TME to reveal the impact of genetic alterations on the TME phenotype. We also provide insights into the regulatory role of cellular TME components in defining the genetic landscape of cancer cells during tumor development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evidence accumulation, not âself-controlâ, explains dorsolateral prefrontal activation during normative choice</a></h4>

              
                What role do regions like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) play in normative behavior (e.g., generosity, healthy eating)? Some models suggest that dlPFC activation during normative choice reflects controlled inhibition or modulation of default hedonistic preferences. Here, we develop an alternative account, showing that evidence accumulation models predict trial-by-trial variation in dlPFC response across three fMRI paradigms and two self-control contexts (altruistic sacrifice and healthy eating). Using these models to simulate a variety of self-control dilemmas generated a novel prediction: although dlPFC activity might <i>typically</i> increase for norm-consistent choices, deliberate self-regulation focused on normative goals should <i>decrease</i> or even <i>reverse</i> this pattern (i.e., greater dlPFC response for hedonistic, self-interested choices). We confirmed these predictions in both altruistic and dietary choice contexts. Our results suggest that dlPFC response during normative choice may depend more on value-based evidence accumulation than inhibition of our baser instincts.

                Pleiotropy and genetic correlation are widespread features in GWAS, but they are often difficult to interpret at the molecular level. Here, we perform GWAS of 16 metabolites clustered at the intersection of amino acid catabolism, glycolysis, and ketone body metabolism in a subset of UK Biobank. We utilize the well-documented biochemistry jointly impacting these metabolites to analyze pleiotropic effects in the context of their pathways. Among the 213 lead GWAS hits, we find a strong enrichment for genes encoding pathway-relevant enzymes and transporters. We demonstrate that the effect directions of variants acting on biology between metabolite pairs often contrast with those of upstream or downstream variants as well as the polygenic background. Thus, we find that these outlier variants often reflect biology local to the traits. Finally, we explore the implications for interpreting disease GWAS, underscoring the potential of unifying biochemistry with dense metabolomics data to understand the molecular basis of pleiotropy in complex traits and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Injury-induced pulmonary tuft cells are heterogenous, arise independent of key Type 2 cytokines, and are dispensable for dysplastic repair</a></h4>

              
                While the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling. The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5<sup>+ </sup>dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4ra signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. In addition, tuft cell expansion occurred independently of type I or type III interferon signalling. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5<sup>+</sup> dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5<sup>+</sup> cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for murine lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fip1 is a multivalent interaction scaffold for processing factors in human mRNA 3' end biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                3' end formation of most eukaryotic mRNAs is dependent on the assembly of a ~1.5 megadalton multiprotein complex, that catalyzes the coupled reaction of pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. In mammals, the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) constitutes the core of the 3' end processing machinery onto which the remaining factors, including cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) and poly(A) polymerase (PAP), assemble. These interactions are mediated by Fip1, a CPSF subunit characterized by high degree of intrinsic disorder. Here, we report two crystal structures revealing the interactions of human Fip1 (hFip1) with CPSF30 and CstF77. We demonstrate that CPSF contains two copies of hFip1, each binding to the zinc finger (ZF) domains 4 and 5 of CPSF30. Using polyadenylation assays we show that the two hFip1 copies are functionally redundant in recruiting one copy of PAP, thereby increasing the processivity of RNA polyadenylation. We further show that the interaction between hFip1 and CstF77 is mediated via a short motif in the N-terminal 'acidic' region of hFip1. In turn, CstF77 competitively inhibits CPSF-dependent PAP recruitment and 3' polyadenylation. Taken together, these results provide a structural basis for the multivalent scaffolding and regulatory functions of hFip1 in 3' end processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Postpartum estrogen withdrawal induces deficits in affective behaviors and increases ÎFosB in D1 and D2 neurons in the nucleus accumbens core in mice</a></h4>

              
                In placental mammals, estradiol levels are chronically elevated during pregnancy, but quickly drop to prepartum levels following birth. This may produce an estrogen withdrawal state that has been linked to changes in affective states in humans and rodents during the postpartum period. The neural mechanisms underlying these affective changes, however, are understudied. We used a hormone-simulated pseudopregnancy (HSP), a model of postpartum estrogen withdrawal, in adult female C57BL/6 mice to test the impact of postpartum estrogen withdrawal on several behavioral measures of anxiety and motivation. We found that estrogen withdrawal following HSP increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, but not in the open field or marble burying tests. Although hormone treatment during HSP consistently increased sucrose consumption, sucrose preference was generally not impacted by hormone treatment or subsequent estrogen withdrawal. In the social motivation test, estrogen withdrawal decreased the amount of time spent in proximity to a social stimulus animal. These behavioral changes were accompanied by changes in the expression of {Delta}FosB, a transcription factor correlated with stable long-term plasticity, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Specifically, estrogen-withdrawn females had higher {Delta}FosB expression in the nucleus accumbens core. Using transgenic reporter mice, we found that this increase in {Delta}FosB occurred in both D1- and D2-expressing cells in the NAc core. Together, these results suggest that postpartum estrogen withdrawal impacts anxiety and motivation and increases {Delta}FosB in the NAc core.

                Spectrins are highly conserved molecules that form a distinct membrane associated periodic scaffold within axons thought to provide mechanical resilience. In C. elegans, UNC-70/{beta}-Spectrin also functions outside the nervous system, within the epidermis, to maintain the integrity of sensory neurons. The precise molecular organization and cellular mechanisms that mediate this protection are unknown. Here, using 3D-structured illumination microscopy, we show that within the epidermis spectrins form a crescent-shaped scaffold with a periodicity of ~ 200 nm that embraces adjacent axons. This epidermal spectrin scaffold is induced by developing axons and reformed during axonal regeneration, and creates a molecular imprint of the adjacent nervous system. Disruption of this epidermal scaffold causes widespread axonal damage in sensory and motor neurons. These findings reveal the existence of a distinct and periodic spectrin framework within the epidermis that is molded by the developing nervous system and is necessary to protect it from mechanical damage.

                Visceral pain is among the most prevalent and bothersome forms of chronic pain, but their transmission in the spinal cord is still poorly understood. Here we used a focal colorectal distention (fCRD) method to drive visceromotor responses (VMRs) plus affective pain-indicative aversive learning. We first found that spinal CCK neurons were necessary for noxious fCRD to drive both VMRs and aversion. We next showed that spinal VGLUT3 neurons mediate affective visceral allodynia, whose ablation caused loss of aversion evoked by low-intensity fCRD in mice with gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation or spinal circuit disinhibition. Importantly, these neurons are dispensable for driving VMRs. Anatomically, VGLUT3 neurons send projection to the parabrachial nuclei, whose photoactivation sufficiently generated aversion in mice with GI inflammation. Our studies suggest the presence of different spinal substrates that transmit nociceptive versus affective dimensions of visceral sensory information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Statistical Learning of Distractor Suppression Down-regulates Pre-Stimulus Neural Excitability in Early Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual attention is highly influenced by past experiences. Recent behavioral research has shown that expectations about the spatial location of distractors within a search array are implicitly learned, with expected distractors becoming less interfering. Little is known about the neural mechanism supporting this form of statistical learning. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure human brain activity to test whether proactive mechanisms are involved in the statistical learning of distractor locations. Specifically, we used a new technique called rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT) to assess neural excitability in early visual cortex during statistical learning of distractor suppression, while concurrently investigating the modulation of posterior alpha-band activity (8-12 Hz). Male and female human participants performed a visual search task in which a target was occasionally presented alongside a color-singleton distractor. Unbeknown to the participants, the distracting stimuli were presented with different probabilities across the two hemifields. RIFT analysis showed that early visual cortex exhibited reduced neural excitability in the pre-stimulus interval at retinotopic locations associated with higher distractor probabilities. In contrast, we did not find any evidence of expectation-driven distractor suppression in alpha-band activity. These findings indicate that proactive mechanisms of attention are involved in predictive distractor suppression and that these mechanisms are associated with altered neural excitability in early visual cortex. Moreover, our findings indicate that RIFT and alpha-band activity might subtend different and possibly independent attentional mechanisms.

                Critical period-like plasticity (iPlasticity) can be reinstated in the adult brain by several interventions, including drugs and optogenetic modifications. We have demonstrated that a combination of iPlasticity with optimal training improves behaviors related to neuropsychiatric disorders. In this context, the activation of TrkB, a receptor for BDNF, in Parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons has a pivotal role in cortical network changes. However, it is unknown if the activation of TrkB in PV+ interneurons is important for other plasticity-related behaviors, especially for learning and memory. Here, using mice with heterozygous conditional TrkB deletion in PV+ interneurons (PV-TrkB hCKO) in Intellicage and fear erasure paradigms, we show that chronic treatment with fluoxetine, a widely prescribed antidepressant drug that is known to promote the activation of TrkB, enhances behavioral flexibility in spatial and fear memory, largely depending on the expression of the TrkB receptor in PV+ interneurons. In addition, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced by chronic treatment with fluoxetine in wild-type mice, but not in PV-TrkB hCKO mice. Transcriptomic analysis of PV+ interneurons after fluoxetine treatment indicated intrinsic changes in synaptic formation and downregulation of enzymes involved in perineuronal net (PNN) formation. Consistently, immunohistochemistry has shown that the fluoxetine treatment alters PV expression and reduces PNNs in PV+ interneurons, and here we show that TrkB expression in PV+ interneurons is required for these effects. Together, our results provide molecular and network mechanisms for the induction of critical period-like plasticity in adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the performance of multi-compartment relaxometry for myelin water imaging - Intra-subject and inter-protocol reproducibility</a></h4>

              
                We evaluate the test-retest repeatability and study the tissue properties of multicompartment relaxometry-based myelin water imaging (MCR-MWI) derived from different gradient echo (GRE) acquisition settings. Additionally, the variable flip angle acquisition scheme is optimised based on numerical simulations to reduce the acquisition time of MCR-MWI in a clinically practical range without using advanced image acquisition methods. For the test-retest analysis, in vivo imaging was performed to collect data from three healthy volunteers in two identical sessions. Three GRE sequence settings with different echo times and repetition times imitating various scanner setups were evaluated. The in vivo data was also used to validate the optimal variable flip angle combination derived from simulations. Bundle-specific profiles of MCR-MWI derived microstructural parameters were investigated, as well as the cross-correlations of those parameters. Good cross-session repeatability is observed for MCR-MWI. While good correlations can also be found in myelin water fraction (MWF) across protocols, systematic differences, particularly for protocols with different repetition times, are observed. Numerical simulations indicate that MCR-MWI can be performed with a minimum of three flip angles covering a wide range of T1 weighting without adding significant measurement bias and the result is supported by the in vivo experiment allowing whole brain 1.5mm isotropic MWF maps to be acquired in 9 minutes. Bundles-specific MWF analysis reveals that certain white matter bundles are similar in all three participants. We also found that microstructure relaxation parameters have low correlations with MWF. MCR-MWI is a reproducible measure of myelin. However, attention should be paid to considering the protocol related MWF differences for comparison studies, especially when different repetition times are used as this can introduce biases up to 0.5% of MWF in our tested protocols. The optimised flip angle acquisition scheme can reduce the total scan time to 40% of the original implementation without significant quality degradation.

                Regulation of microtubule cytoskeleton is fundamental for the development and maintenance of neuronal architecture. Recent studies have shown that regulated RNA processing is also critical for the establishment and maintenance of neural circuits. In a genetic screen using mechanosensory neurons of C. elegans, we identified a mutation in muscleblind-1 as a suppressor of loss of kinesin-13 family microtubule destabilizing factor klp-7. Muscleblind-1(MBL-1) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the splicing, localization, and stability of RNA. We found that mbl-1 is required cell-autonomously for axon growth and synapse formation in the posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) neuron. Loss of mbl-1 affects stability and plus-end-out organization of microtubules in the anterior process of PLM. These defects are also accompanied by abnormal axonal transport of the synaptic protein RAB-3 and loss of gentle touch sensation in mbl-1 mutant. Our data showed that mbl-1 is genetically epistatic to mec-7 ({beta}-tubulin) and mec-12 (-tubulin) for axon growth. The immunoprecipitation of MBL-1 pulls down the mec-7, mec-12, and sad-1 mRNAs. Additionally, the mbl-1 mutants show a reduction in the level and stability of mec-7 and mec-12 transcripts. Independently, mbl-1 is epistatic to sad-1 for synapse formation. Our work elucidated a previously unknown link between RNA binding protein and cytoskeletal machinery for the development and maintenance of the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theoretical limits on the speed of learning inverse models explain the rate of adaptation in arm reaching tasks</a></h4>

              
                An essential aspect of human motor learning is the formation of inverse models, which map desired actions to motor commands. Inverse models can be learned by adjusting parameters in neural circuits to minimize errors in the performance of motor tasks through gradient descent. However, the theory of gradient descent establishes an upper limit on the learning speed, above which learning becomes unstable. Specifically, the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the error surface around a minimum determine the maximum speed of learning in a given task.  Here, we use this theoretical framework to analyze the speed of learning in different inverse model learning architectures in a set of isometric arm-reaching tasks. We show theoretically that, for these isometric tasks, the error surface and, thus the speed of learning, are determined by the shapes of 1) the force manipulability ellipsoid of the arm and 2) the distribution of targets in the task. In particular, rounder manipulability ellipsoids generate a rounder error surface, allowing for faster learning of the inverse model. Rounder target distributions have a similar effect. We tested these predictions experimentally in a virtual quasi-isometric reaching task with a visuomotor transformation. The experimental results were consistent with our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, our analysis accounts for the speed of learning in previous experiments with incompatible and compatible virtual surgery tasks, and in visuomotor rotation tasks with different numbers of targets. By identifying aspects of a task that influence the speed of learning, our results provide theoretical principles for the design of motor tasks that allow for faster learning.

                Functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) can be used to investigate neurometabolic responses to external stimuli in-vivo, but findings to date are inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on 49 human fMRS studies that measured levels of the primary neurotransmitters Glutamate (Glu), Glx (Glutamate + Glutamine), and GABA. Data were extracted, grouped by metabolite, stimulus domain, and brain region, and then analysed by determining standardised effect sizes. The quality of individual studies (such as the choice of acquisition parameters and reporting quality) was rated with a standardised check list. When results were analysed by metabolite type across all studies, small to moderate effect sizes of 0.29-0.47 (p < 0.05) were observed for changes in Glu and Glx regardless of stimulus domain and brain region, but no significant effects were observed for GABA. Further analysis suggests that Glu, Glx and GABA responses differ by stimulus domain or task and vary depending on the time course of stimulation and data acquisition technique. In summary, we establish effect sizes and directionality of GABA, Glu and Glx response in all currently available fMRS studies. This work provides normative ground to improve consensus and reproducibility of fMRS research and highlights the importance of standardised reporting and minimal best practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Natural statistics of head roll: implications for Bayesian inference in spatial orientation</a></h4>

              
                We previously proposed a Bayesian model of multisensory integration in spatial orientation (1). Using a Gaussian prior, centered on an upright head orientation, this model could explain various perceptual observations in roll-tilted participants, such as the subjective visual vertical, the subjective body tilt (1), the rod-and-frame effect (2), as well as their clinical (3) and age-related deficits (4). Because it is generally assumed that the prior reflects an accumulated history of previous head orientations, and recent work on natural head motion suggests non-Gaussian statistics, we examined how the model would perform with a non-Gaussian prior. In the present study, we first experimentally generalized the previous observations in showing that also the natural statistics of head orientation are characterized by long tails, best quantified as a t-location-scale distribution. Next, we compared the performance of the Bayesian model and various model variants using such a t-distributed prior to the original model with the Gaussian prior on their accounts of previously published data of the subjective visual vertical and subjective body tilt tasks. All of these variants performed substantially worse than the original model, suggesting a special value of the Gaussian prior. We provide computational and neurophysiological reasons for the implementation of such a prior, in terms of its associated precision-accuracy trade-off in vertical perception across the tilt range.

                Objective. Neurostimulation is emerging as treatment for several diseases of the brain and peripheral organs. Due to variability arising from placement of stimulation devices, underlying neuroanatomy and physiological responses to stimulation, it is essential that neurostimulation protocols are personalized to maximize efficacy and safety. Building such personalized protocols would benefit from accumulated information in increasingly large datasets of other individuals' responses. Approach. To address that need, we propose a meta-learning family of algorithms to conduct few-shot optimization of key fitting parameters of physiological responses in new individuals. While our method is agnostic to neurostimulation modality, here we demonstrate its effectiveness on the problem of physiological modeling of fiber recruitment during vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Using data from acute VNS experiments, the mapping between amplitudes of stimulus-evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs) and physiological responses, such as heart rate and breathing interval modulation, is inferred. Main results. Using additional synthetic data sets to complement experimental results, we demonstrate that our meta-learning framework is capable of directly modeling the physiology-eCAP relationship for individual subjects with much fewer individually queried data points than standard methods. Significance. Our meta-learning framework is general and can be adapted to any input-response neurostimulation mapping problem. Moreover, this method leverages information from growing data sets of past patients, as a treatment is deployed. It can also be combined with several model types, including regression, Gaussian processes with Bayesian optimization, and beyond.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic status differentially regulates neurofilaments in dendritic spines</a></h4>

              
                Neurofilaments are one of the main cytoskeletal components in neurons and they can be found in the form of oligomers at pre- and postsynapses. How their presence is regulated at the postsynapse remains widely unclear. Here we systematically quantified by immunolabeling the occurrence of the neurofilament isoform triplet neurofilament light (NFL), medium (NFM), and heavy (NFH) at the postsynapse with STED nanoscopy together with markers of synaptic strength and activity. Our data shows that within dendritic spines neurofilament isoforms rarely colocalize with each other and that they are present to different extents, with NFL being the most abundant isoform. The amount of the three isoforms correlates with markers of postsynaptic strength and presynaptic activity to varying degrees: while NFL shows moderate correlation to both synaptic traits suggesting its involvement in synaptic response, NFM and NFH were only correlated on a low level. By quantifying the presence of neurofilaments at the postsynapse within the context of the synaptic status, this work sheds new light on the regulation of synaptic neurofilaments and their possible contribution to psychiatric disorders.

                Background: Traumatic brachial plexus injury (TBPI) causes a sensorimotor deficit in upper limb (UL) movements. Objective: Our aim was to investigate the arm-forearm coordination of both the injured and uninjured UL of TBPI subjects. Methods: TBPI participants (n=13) and controls (n=10) matched in age, gender, and anthropometric characteristics were recruited. Kinematics from the shoulder, elbow, wrist and index finger markers were collected while upstanding participants transported a cup to mouth and returned the UL to a starting position. The UL coordination was measured through the relative phase (RP) between arm and forearm phase angles and analyzed as a function of the hand kinematics. Results: For all participants, the hand transport had a shorter time to peak velocity (p<0.01) compared to the return. Also, for the control and the uninjured TBPI UL, the RP showed a coordination pattern that favored forearm movements in the peak velocity of the transport phase (p<0.001). TBPI participants' injured UL showed a longer movement duration in comparison to controls (p<0.05), but no differences in peak velocity, time to peak velocity and trajectory length, indicating preserved hand kinematics. The RP of the injured UL revealed altered coordination in favor of arm movements compared to controls and to the uninjured UL (p<0.001). Finally, TBPI participants' uninjured UL showed altered control of arm and forearm phase angles during the deceleration of hand movements compared to controls (p<0.05). Conclusion: These results suggest that UL coordination is reorganized after a TBPI so as to preserve hand kinematics.

                The mechanism or microcircuitry behind orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1), and the means by which it develops without supervision or visual input, both remain unresolved questions. Work on the developmental question has assumed the prevalent spatial convergence model of orientation selectivity as the target mechanism. Encouraged by growing evidence challenging both the completeness of this model and its developmental viability, we investigated an alternative scheme. Accordingly, we demonstrate computationally how a scheme in which orientation selectivity originates from the orientation biases already in the retina and lateral geniculate nucelus (LGN) can answer both the mechanistic and developmental questions. In this scheme, the divergence of outputs from the retina allows retinal spontaneous activity to create correlations within the LGN. These correlations in turn allow a Hebbian plasticity mechanism to strengthen those LGN inputs to V1 which carry similar orientation biases and thus provide an orientation tuned excitatory input.

                Subanesthetic ketamine rapidly and robustly reduces depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression. While it is commonly classified as an N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, our picture of ketamine's mechanistic underpinnings is incomplete. Recent clinical evidence has indicated, controversially, that a component of the efficacy of ketamine in depression may be opioid dependent. Using pharmacological functional ultrasound imaging in rats, we found that blocking opioid receptors suppressed neurophysiologic changes evoked by ketamine, but not by a more selective NMDAR antagonist, in regions implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and in reward processing. Importantly, this opioid-dependent response was strongly sex dependent, as it was not evident in female subjects and was fully reversed by surgical removal of the male gonads. We observed similar opioid-mediated sex-dependent effects in ketamine-evoked structural plasticity and behavioral sensitization. Together, these results underscore the potential for ketamine to induce its affective responses via opioid signaling, and indicate that this opioid dependence may be strongly influenced by subject sex. These factors should be more directly assessed in future clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Head and Neck Cancer-derived small extracellular vesicles sensitize TRPV1+ neurons to mediate cancer pain</a></h4>

              
                Severe pain is often experienced by patients with head and neck cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite its frequency and severity, current treatments fail to adequately control cancer-associated pain, because of our lack of mechanistic understanding. Cancer-derived small extracellular vesicles (Cancer-sEVs) are well-positioned to function as mediators of communication between cancer cells and neurons. Inhibition of Cancer-sEV release attenuated pain in tumor-bearing mice. Injection of purified Cancer-sEVs is sufficient to induce pain hypersensitivity in naive mice. Cancer-sEVs triggered calcium influx in nociceptors and inhibition or ablation of nociceptors protect against cancer pain. Interrogation of published sequencing data of human sensory neurons exposed to human Cancer-sEVs suggested a stimulation of protein translation in neurons. Induction of translation by Cancer-sEVs was validated in our mouse model and its inhibition alleviated cancer pain in mice. These findings define a role of Cancer-sEVs in cancer pain and identify several druggable targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Global remapping in granule cells and mossy cells of the mouse dentate gyrus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells exhibit spatially modulated firing, or place fields, which can remap to encode changes in the environment or other variables. Unique among hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) has two excitatory populations of place cells, granule cells and mossy cells, which are among the least and most active spatially modulated cells in the hippocampus, respectively. Previous studies of remapping in the DG have drawn different conclusions about whether granule cells exhibit global remapping and contribute to the encoding of context specificity. By recording granule cells and mossy cells as mice foraged in different environments, we found that by most measures, both granule cells and mossy cells remapped robustly but through different mechanisms that are consistent with firing properties of each cell type. Our results resolve the ambiguity surrounding remapping in the DG and suggest that most spatially modulated granule cells contribute to orthogonal representations of distinct spatial contexts.

                Reactive astrocytes are both neurotoxic and pro-regenerative. Their reparative roles after injury have been demonstrated, but how they play a contributing role to regeneration remains question. Here, we investigate the use of astrocytic extracellular vesicles from primary astrocytes cultured in reactive conditions in promoting repair after ischemic stroke. Our studies show that extracellular vesicles derived from reactive astrocytes that co-express a significant number of inflammatory genes (155 upregulated including log2 of 9.61 for Lcn2) and axonal outgrowth genes (59 upregulated including log2 of 3.49 Ntn1) are necessary for improved regenerative outcomes, including axonal infiltration, vascularization, and improved behavioral recovery. Proteomic analysis of the extracellular vesicles show that astrocytes enrich pro-reparative proteins in extracellular vesicles with only 30 proteins relating to inflammatory or complement pathways loaded out of a total of 1073 proteins. Further, we show that the use of a biomaterial scaffold is necessary for the improved regeneration observed from reactive astrocyte extracellular vesicles. These studies show that reactive astrocytes use extracellular vesicles enriched with pro-repair proteins to promote recovery after injury.

                The object-responsive cortex of the visual system has a highly systematic topography, with a macro-scale organization related to animacy and the real-world size of objects, and embedded meso-scale regions with strong selectivity for a handful of object categories. Here, we use self-organizing principles to learn a topographic representation of the data manifold of a deep neural network representational space. We find that a smooth mapping of this representational space showed many brain-like motifs, with (i) large-scale organization of animate vs. inanimate and big vs. small response preferences, supported by (ii) feature tuning related to textural and coarse form information, with (iii) naturally emerging face- and scene-selective regions embedded in this larger-scale organization. While some theories of the object-selective cortex posit that these differently tuned regions of the brain reflect a collection of distinctly specified functional modules, the present work provides computational support for an alternate hypothesis that the tuning and topography of the object-selective cortex reflects a smooth mapping of a unified representational space.

                A growing body of evidence indicates that gut microbiota influence brain function and behavior. However, the molecular basis of how gut bacteria modulate host nervous system function is largely unknown. Here we show that vitamin B12-producing bacteria that colonize the intestine can modulate excitatory synaptic transmission and behavior in the host Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that vitamin B12 reduces cholinergic signaling in the nervous system through rewiring of the methionine (Met)/S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle in the intestine. We identify a conserved metabolic crosstalk between the Met/SAM cycle and the choline oxidation pathway. We show that metabolic rewiring of these pathways by vitamin B12 reduces cholinergic transmission by limiting the availability of free choline required by neurons to synthesize acetylcholine. Our study reveals a gut-brain communication pathway by which enteric bacteria modulate host behavior and may affect mental health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things: illusory perception of heartbeat is induced by pain expectation.</a></h4>

              
                Our interoceptive states and their perception are thought to be heavily shaped by interactions between expectations and interoceptive information. Surprisingly, previous research mostly investigated the impact of expectations on interoceptive states themselves (i.e. cardiac activity), rather than the perception of these states (i.e. heartbeat perception). This study investigated whether expectations of pain induce an illusory perception of heartbeat frequency, so that heartbeat perception reflects expectations about how the heartbeat will change, rather than only the actual change. Participants were instructed to report continuously their heartbeat, either tapping along to it (i.e., Experiment 1, heartbeat tapping task) or silently counting (i.e., Experiment 2, heartbeat counting task), while ECG was recorded. Crucially, while completing this task, subjects were presented with two types of cues, which provided valid predictive information about the intensity of an upcoming cutaneous stimulation, that is a painful or non-painful stimulus. Results showed that, whenever participants were exposed to cues that signalled the upcoming high-painful stimulation, they reported a higher number of heartbeats compared to when they were anticipating a low-painful shock. Importantly, the perceived increase was not mirrored by the real cardiac frequency, which showed no difference when participants were anticipating a high- vs. low- pain stimulus. Moreover, such perceptual modulations were dramatically reduced when participants executed the same tapping task but with an exteroceptive visual stimulus (i.e., Experiment 3, exteroceptive tapping task). Together, the findings reveal, for the first time, a perceptual illusion of heartbeats associated to pain expectation. This study offers some important insights for understanding how inferential processes can actively generate interoceptive perception, emphasizing its pivotal role within the predictive aspects of the processing of bodily signals and of physiological regulation.

                Peripheral neuropathy is a pathophysiological state of nerve degeneration and loss of tissue innervation. The most prominent cause of small fiber neuropathy is diabetes which can be demyelinating in nature, but this has not yet been explored in adipose tissue. Both demyelinating neuropathies and axonopathies implicate Schwann cells (SCs), the peripheral glial required for nerve myelination and regeneration after injury. Here, we perform a comprehensive assessment of SCs and myelination patterns of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) nerves, including changes that occur with obesity and other imbalanced energy states in mice and humans. We found that mouse scWAT is densely innervated by both myelinated and unmyelinated sensory and sympathetic nerves. Accordingly, scWAT is home to both myelinating and non-myelinating SCs; the greater proportion of which are myelinating. Furthermore, SCs were found closely associated with synaptic vesicle-containing nerve terminals in scWAT. Obese BTBR ob/ob mice exhibit diabetic peripheral neuropathy in scWAT, and display concordant demyelination specific to small fibers, which was also associated with a decrease in the pan-SC marker Sox10 and compensatory increase in Krox20 gene expression. Together this suggests that adipose SCs may be involved in regulating the plasticity or the neuropathy of adipose tissue nerves.

                There are unique challenges in the preprocessing of spinal cord fMRI data, particularly voluntary or involuntary movement artifacts during image acquisition. Despite advances in data processing techniques for movement detection and correction, there are challenges in extrapolating motion correction algorithm developments in the brain cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord. We trained a Deep Learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) via an unsupervised learning algorithm, called DeepRetroMoCo, to detect and correct motions in axial T2*-weighted spinal cord data. Spinal cord fMRI data from 27 participants were used for training of the network (135 runs for training and 81 runs for testing). We used average temporal signal-to-noise-ratio (tSNR) and Delta Variation Signal (DVARS) of raw and motion-corrected images to compare the outcome of DeepRetroMoco with sct_fmri_moco implemented in the spinal cord toolbox. The average tSNR in the cervical cord was significantly higher when DeepRetroMoco was used for motion correction compared to sct_fmri_moco method. Average DVARS was lower in images corrected by DeepRetroMoco than those corrected by sct_fmri_moco. The average processing time for DeepRetroMoco was also significantly shorter than sct_fmri_moco. Our results suggest that DeepRetroMoCo improves motion correction procedures in fMRI data acquired from the cervical spinal cord.

                Patterns of activity across many neurons are fundamental units of neural computation. Two-photon holographic photostimulation allows both delivering input to, and imaging responses from, patterns or populations of neurons. However, to make this method an easily-deployable tool, simple methods are needed to robustly and stably express opsins and indicators in the same cells. Here we describe a bicistronic adeno-associated virus (AAV) that in transfected cells expresses both the fast and bright calcium indicator GCaMP8s, and a soma-targeted (st) and two-photon-activatable opsin, ChrimsonR. With this method, in the visual cortex of mice, stChrimsonR stimulation with two-photon holography drives robust spiking in targeted cells, and neural responses to visual sensory stimuli and spontaneous activity are strong and easy to measure. stChrimsonR is a good choice of opsin when a balance is needed between stimulation-laser activatability and avoidance of imaging laser activation. This approach is a simple and robust way to prepare neurons in vivo for two-photon holography and imaging.

                Walking through an environment generates retinal motion, which humans rely on to perform a variety of visual tasks. Retinal motion patterns are determined by an interconnected set of factors, including gaze location, gaze stabilization, the structure of the environment, and the walker's goals. The characteristics of these motion signals have important consequences for neural organization and behavior. However, to date, there are no empirical in situ measurements of how combined eye and body movements interact with real 3D environments to shape the statistics of retinal motion signals. Here, we collect measurements of the eyes, the body, and the 3D environment during locomotion. We describe properties of the resulting retinal motion patterns. We explain how these patterns are shaped by gaze location in the world, as well as by behavior, and how they may provide a template for the way motion sensitivity and receptive field properties vary across the visual field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-Frequency Stimulation Does Not Improve Comfort of Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord neuromodulation has gained much attention for demonstrating improved motor recovery in people with spinal cord injury, motivating the development of clinically applicable technologies. Among them, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is attractive because of its non-invasive profile. Many tSCS studies employ a high-frequency (10 kHz) carrier, which has been reported to reduce stimulation discomfort. However, these claims have come under scrutiny in recent years. The purpose of this study was to determine whether high-frequency tSCS is more comfortable at therapeutic amplitudes, which evoke posterior root-muscle (PRM) reflexes. In 16 neurologically intact participants, tSCS was delivered using a 1-ms long monophasic pulse with and without a high-frequency carrier. Stimulation amplitude and pulse duration were varied and PRM reflexes were recorded from the soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles. Participants rated their discomfort during stimulation from 0-10 at PRM reflex threshold. At PRM reflex threshold, high-frequency stimulation (0.87 {+/-} 0.2) was equally comfortable as conventional stimulation (1.03 {+/-} 0.18) but required approximately double the charge to evoke the PRM reflex (conventional: 32.4 {+/-} 9.2 C; high-frequency: 62.5 {+/-} 11.1 C). Strength-duration curves for high-frequency stimulation had a rheobase that was 4.8X greater and a chronaxie that was 5.7X narrower than the conventional monophasic pulse, indicating that high-frequency stimulation was less efficient in recruiting neural activity in spinal roots. High-frequency tSCS is equally as comfortable as conventional stimulation at amplitudes required to stimulate spinal dorsal roots.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early suppression of excitability in subcortical band heterotopia modifies epileptogenesis in rats</a></h4>

              
                Malformations of cortical development represent a major cause of epilepsy in childhood. However, the pathological substrate and dynamic changes leading to the development and progression of epilepsy remain unclear. Here, we characterized an etiology-relevant rat model of subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), a diffuse type of cortical malformation associated with drug-resistant seizures in humans. We used longitudinal electrographic recordings to monitor the age-dependent evolution of epileptiform discharges during the course of epileptogenesis in this model. We found both quantitative and qualitative age-related changes in seizures properties and patterns, accompanying a gradual progression towards a fully developed seizure pattern seen in adulthood. We also dissected the relative contribution of the band heterotopia and the overlying cortex to the development and age-dependent progression of epilepsy using timed and spatially targeted manipulation of neuronal excitability. We found that an early suppression of neuronal excitability in SBH slows down epileptogenesis in juvenile rats, whereas epileptogenesis is paradoxically exacerbated when excitability is suppressed in the overlying cortex. However, in rats with active epilepsy, similar manipulations of excitability have no effect on chronic spontaneous seizures. Together, our data support the notion that complex developmental alterations occurring in both the SBH and the overlying cortex concur to creating pathogenic circuits prone to generate seizures. Our study also suggests that early and targeted interventions could potentially influence the course of these altered developmental trajectories, and favorably modify epileptogenesis in malformations of cortical development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A parabrachial-to-amygdala circuit that determines hemispheric lateralization of somatosensory processing</a></h4>

              
                Background: The central amygdala (CeA) is a bilateral hub of pain and emotional processing with well-established functional lateralization. We reported that optogenetic manipulation of neural activity in the left and right CeA has opposing effects on bladder pain. Methods: To determine the influence of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) on this diametrically opposed lateralization, we administered CGRP and evaluated the activity of CeA neurons in acute brain slices as well as the behavioral signs of bladder pain in the mouse. Results: We found that CGRP increased firing in both the right and left CeA neurons. Furthermore, we found that CGRP administration in the right CeA increased behavioral signs of bladder pain and decreased bladder pain-like behavior when administered in the left CeA. Conclusions: These studies reveal a parabrachial-to-amygdala circuit driven by opposing actions of CGRP that determines hemispheric lateralization of visceral pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noradrenergic cross-modular reciprocal inhibition within the Locus Coeruleus.</a></h4>

              
                The Locus Coeruleus (LC) is the primary noradrenergic nucleus in the brain with widespread projections driving changes in cognitive state and animal behaviour. The LC is composed of multiple 'modules' with specific efferent target domains enabling discretional neuromodulation. LC neuronal activity releases noradrenaline within the nucleus as a local feedback mechanism, but it is not known how this influences modular output. We address this question using whole-cell recordings and calcium imaging in rat pontine slices in combination with LC neuronal ensemble modelling to assess the influence of local noradrenaline release on cross-modular interactions. Electrophysiological recordings of LC neurons from rats transduced with the optogenetic actuator ChR2 showed auto-inhibition and lateral inhibition (of surrounding non transduced neurons). This inhibition was strongly frequency dependent and was mediated by noradrenaline acting on alpha2-adrenceptors (alpha;2R). To allow calcium-imaging of LC neuronal ensembles a Canine-Adenoviral vector strategy was developed using the PRS promoter to drive selective expression GCaMP6s. Calcium imaging allowed resolution of both increases and decreases in LC activity (to TTX / clonidine or high potassium). Selective chemogenetic activation of subsets of LC neurons (expressing the ionotropic actuator PSAM) revealed both a direct excitation (after application of PSEM308, 3-PSEM308) and an alpha2R-mediated inhibition of neighbouring LC cells (non-transduced). Differential retrograde targeting of PSAM or GCaMP6s to specific LC modules showed the presence of strong, reciprocal cross-modular inhibition (shown for the LC-olfactory bulb vs LC bulbospinal modules) and a subsequent rebound activity inversion. This represents a preferential, targeted, cross-modular, lateral inhibition within the LC rather than a non-specific surround inhibition. Computational modelling showed the emergence of lateral inhibition and biphasic responses to modular activation when alpha2R signalling and noradrenergic reuptake saturation were included. This interaction may facilitate recruitment of neuronal ensembles by coherent inputs and represents a bottom-up differential contrast-enhancement mechanism within the LC to produce a modality specific focus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Low forces push the maturation of neural precursors into neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical stimulation modulates neural development and neuronal activity. In a previous study, we proposed magnetic nano-pulling as a tool to generate active forces. By loading neural cells with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), a precise force vector is remotely generated through static magnetic fields. In the present study, human neural stem cells (NSCs) were subjected to a standard differentiation protocol, in the presence or absence of nano-pulling. Under mechanical stimulation, we found an increase in the length of the neural processes which showed an enrichment in microtubules, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. A stimulation lasting up to 52 days induced a strong remodelling at the level of synapse density and a re-organization of the neuronal network, halving the time required for the maturation of neural precursors into neurons. We then injected the MNP-loaded NSCs into mouse spinal cord slices, demonstrating that nano-pulling stimulates the elongation of the NPC processes and modulates their orientation even in an ex vivo model system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing that active mechanical stimuli can guide the outgrowth of NSCs transplanted into the spinal cord tissue. Our findings suggest that MNPs play an important role in neuronal maturation which could be applied in regenerative medicine.

	<p>Intracranial hemangiopericytomas are rare tumors, accounting for 1% of all central nervous system malignancies. This tumor is considered at high risk of local and also distant metastases. Surgical excision is the gold standard for treatment, but it is seldom curative by itself. Adjuvant radiotherapy is often recommended. We report an overview and update of the available literature on one such rare but aggressive mesenchymal tumor, using the case of a 46-year-old woman affected by hemangiopericytoma of the cavernous sinus surgically removed and treated with adjuvant radiotherapy at our institution. After seven years, the patient underwent a local recurrence and was treated with exeresis and Gamma Knife radiotherapy. Sixteen years after the initial diagnosis, she is still well with stable disease.</p>

	<p>Objective: Schizophrenia is a complex functionally debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder, with associated social cognitive impairment. Corpus Callosum (CC) white matter tracts deficits are reported for people with schizophrenia; however, few studies focus on interhemispheric processing relative to social cognition tasks. This study aimed to determine if a relationship between the CC and social cognition exists. Method: In this cross-section study, a sample of n = 178 typical controls and n = 58 people with schizophrenia completed measures of mentalising (Reading the Mind in the Eyes), emotion recognition outcome and reaction time (Emotion Recognition Test), and clinical symptoms (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale), alongside diffusion-based tract imaging. The CC and its subregions, i.e., the genu, body, and splenium were the regions of interest (ROI). Results: Reduced white matter tract integrity was observed in the CC for patients when compared to controls. Patients performed slower, and less accurately on emotion recognition tasks, which significantly and negatively correlated to the structural integrity of the CC genu. Tract integrity further significantly and negatively related to clinical symptomatology. Conclusions: People with schizophrenia have altered white matter integrity in the genu of the CC, compared to controls, which relates to cognitive deficits associated with recognising emotional stimuli accurately and quickly, and severity of clinical symptoms.</p>

	<p>The heterogeneous and multi-factorial nature of dementia requires the consideration of all health aspects when predicting the risk of its development and planning strategies for its prevention. This systematic review of reviews provides a comprehensive synthesis of those factors associated with cognition in the context of dementia, identifying the role of social aspects and evidencing knowledge gaps in this area of research. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses from 2009&amp;amp;ndash;2021 were searched for within Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos. Reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and assessed the records, following the PRISMA-2020 guidelines. From 314 included studies, 624 cognitive-related factors were identified, most of them risk factors (61.2%), mainly belonging to the group of &amp;amp;lsquo;somatic comorbidities&amp;amp;rsquo; (cardiovascular disease and diabetes) and &amp;amp;lsquo;genetic predispositions&amp;amp;rsquo;. The protective factors (20%) were mainly related to lifestyle, pointing to the Mediterranean diet, regular physical activity, and cognitively stimulating activities. Social factors constituted 9.6% of all identified factors. Research on biological and medical factors dominates the reviewed literature. Greater social support and frequent contact may confer some protection against cognitive decline and dementia by delaying its onset or reducing the overall risk; however, overall, our findings are inconsistent. Further research is needed in the fields of lifestyle, psychology, social health, and the protective factors against cognitive decline and dementia.</p>

	<p>Gait disturbance is a prototypical feature of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and the quantification of gait using wearable sensors is promising. This study aimed to identify gait impairment in the early and progressive stages of PD according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;amp;ndash;Y) scale. A total of 138 PD patients and 56 healthy controls (HCs) were included in our research. We collected gait parameters using the JiBuEn gait-analysis system. For spatiotemporal gait parameters and kinematic gait parameters, we observed significant differences in stride length (SL), gait velocity, the variability of SL, heel strike angle, and the range of motion (ROM) of the ankle, knee, and hip joints between HCs and PD patients in H&amp;amp;ndash;Y &amp;amp;#8544;-&amp;amp;#8545;. The changes worsened with the progression of PD. The differences in the asymmetry index of the SL and ROM of the hip were found between HCs and patients in H&amp;amp;ndash;Y &amp;amp;#8547;. Additionally, these gait parameters were significantly associated with Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire-39. This study demonstrated that gait impairment occurs in the early stage of PD and deteriorates with the progression of the disease. The gait parameters mentioned above may help to detect PD earlier and assess the progression of PD.</p>

	<p>The present study aimed to explore the effect of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on visual working memory for people suffering from methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Five sessions of iTBS were carried over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the vertex as a sham control, with each session in one day. Orientation free-recall tasks were conducted before the iTBS stimulation, after the first and fifth sessions of stimulation. Results showed that when compared with the sham group, a single session of iTBS over the left DLPFC improved participants&amp;amp;rsquo; working memory performance. Specifically, iTBS over the left DLPFC increased the working memory capacity and such effects enlarged with multiple sessions. The present finding suggested that iTBS over DLPFC could be a promising intervention method to enhance the cognitive function of addicts with MUD.</p>

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a sudden injury that causes damage to the brain. Rehabilitation therapies include specific training, such as attention process training (APT) programs using either standard or innovative approaches. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a non-immersive virtual reality-based attention training to stimulate attention processes and mood in TBI patients. Thirty subjects with TBI were enrolled at the Neurorehabilitation Unit of the IRCCS Neurolesi Center and divided into either the Conventional Attention Process Training Group (C_APT: n = 15) or the Virtual-Based Attention Processes Training Group (VB_APT: n = 15), treated with the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS-Evo). All of the patients were evaluated with a specific psychometric battery before (T0) and after the end (T1) of each program. We found statistically significant differences between the two groups, in particular concerning global cognitive status (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.02), attention processes (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.03), depression symptoms (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04) and visual attention (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Experimental intragroup analysis showed great statistical significances in all psychometric tests, i.e., the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0006), Attention Matrices (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0007), the Hamilton Rating Scale-Depression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.004), the Trail Making Test-A (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0007), the Trail Making Test-B (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0007), and the Trail Making test-BA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.007). Our results suggest that non-immersive virtual reality may be a useful and effective approach for the attention processes recovery and mood of TBI patients, leading to better cognitive and behavioral outcomes.</p>

	<p>We investigated the relationship between physical activity (PA) and emotional regulation strategies among college students to establish the mediating role of cortical thickness. A total of 60 university students (18&amp;amp;ndash;20 years old) were enrolled in this study. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-L) was used to estimate PA levels. Based on the International Physical Activity Working Group standards, PA levels were divided into low, medium, and high PA groups; emotional regulation strategies were determined by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), including the Cognitive Reappraisal Scale (CR) and the Expressive Suppression Scale (ES). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure cortical thickness. Differences in use of the ES strategy among high, medium, and low PA groups were not marked. However, compared to the low PA group, the CR strategy was frequently used in the high PA group, with a thicker right hemisphere rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rrACC). PA levels were positively correlated with thickness of the rrACC cortex (r = 0.398, p = 0.002 &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and CR strategy (r = 0.398, p = 0.002 &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and negatively correlated with the ES strategy (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.348, p = 0.007 &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The rrACC cortical thickness played a partial mediating role in the relationship between PA and CR strategy, accounting for 33.1% of total effect values. These findings indicate that although the negative correlation between PA and ES was not significant, the positive correlation between PA with CR was significant, and rrACC thickness played a partial mediating role in the relationship between PA and CR, providing new evidence toward comprehensively revealing the relationship between PA, rrACC cortical thickness, and emotion regulation strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perceived risk of infection and death from COVID-19 among community members of low- and middle-income countries: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Risk perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are considered important as they impact community health behaviors. The aim of this study was to determine the perceived risk of infection and death due to COVID-19 and to assess the factors associated with such risk perceptions among community members in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa, Asia, and South America. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 LMICs in Africa, Asia, and South America from February to May 2021. A questionnaire was utilized to assess the perceived risk of infection and death from COVID-19 and its plausible determinants. A logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with such risk perceptions. Results: A total of 1,646 responses were included in the analysis of the perceived risk of becoming infected and dying from COVID-19. Our data suggested that 36.4% of participants had a high perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, while only 22.4% had a perceived risk of dying from COVID-19. Being a woman, working in healthcare-related sectors, contracting pulmonary disease, knowing people in the immediate social environment who are or have been infected with COVID-19, as well as seeing or reading about individuals infected with COVID-19 on social media or TV were all associated with a higher perceived risk of becoming infected with COVID-19. In addition, being a woman, elderly, having heart disease and pulmonary disease, knowing people in the immediate social environment who are or have been infected with COVID-19, and seeing or reading about individuals infected with COVID-19 on social media or TV had a higher perceived risk of dying from COVID-19. Conclusions: The perceived risk of infection and death due to COVID-19 are relatively low among respondents; this suggests the need to conduct health campaigns to disseminate knowledge and information on the ongoing pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Soluble FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1: Role in placenta accreta spectrum disorder [version 4; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Placenta accreta is a pregnancy condition where the placenta's blood vessels attach too deeply to the uterine wall. Incidence of placenta accreta Â is increasingly seen today as the rate of cesarean section increases, however, the exact pathophysiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 Â (sflt-1) as a protein produced by the placenta was found to be decreased in placenta accreta, Therefore we aim Â to see if Â sfltsFlt-1 has a role in the development of placenta accreta. Methods:Â This study involved 40 samples from patients that had been diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum disorder (case group), and 40 samples from patients with normal pregnancies (control group) Â at Rumah Skit Umum Pusat H.Adam Malik (RSUP) Haji Adam Malik Medan, in Indonesia. Â Diagnosis of placenta accreta syndrome was based on Placenta Accreta Spectrum Â Score (PAS), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Â (FIGO) classification of placenta accreta spectrum disorder.Analyses Â were performed by independent t-test, man Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis test, with a P-value <0.05 Â considered as statistically significant (95%CI). Results:Â Based on this study, we found that the sFlt-1 level in the case group was lower than the control group. Data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a difference in sFlt-1 levels in this study group (p = 0.02), which was further evaluated Â with post hoc analysis using Mann. -Whitney U test. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the control and PAS 0, PAS1, and PAS 2 (p = 0.043; p = 0.002; p = 0.03). Conclusion:Â sFlt-1 levels decreased in placental invasive pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, however, this still needs to be investigated further in a multi-center study, considering that sFlt-1 levels are also influenced by ethnicity and other conditions that cannot be excluded in this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of Leptin and Leptin receptor Gene polymorphisms with Insulin resistance in pregnant women: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Leptin is an adipokine hormone that regulates insulin sensitivity and lipid profile, which may contribute to complications like gestational diabetes.The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance.. Methods: 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) and lipid profile by automated chemistry analyzer. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results: Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62Â±29.23 and 59.88Â±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, âAAâ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion: No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Depression among pet owners and non-pet owners: a comparative cross-sectional study in Dhaka, Bangladesh [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Depression is a major contributor to overall global disease burden, often beginning in the teenage years and continuing into later life. Previous studies have reported high global rates of depression during these formative years, including in Bangladesh. At the same time, the positive impact that pet ownership can have on depression is steeply Â being recognized. However, studies examining these effects in Bangladesh are scarce. This study examined the association between household pet ownership and depression among people older than 13 years in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using online and offline approaches. We employed a snowball sampling technique to identify pet owners aged greater than 13 years residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Both web-based survey questionnaires using social media and hard copies were used to collect data from urban-dwelling pet owners. Logistic regression model was used to identify the independent role of pet ownership in depression, adjusting for confounders, including age, sex, marital status, known chronic disabilities, and other variables. Results: A total of 140 pet owners and an equal number of non-pet owners participated in the study. Pet owners were found to be 41% less depressed than non-pet owners (AOR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.31â1.14). In addition, males (AOR: 3.38; 95% CI: 1.50â7.62) who were either unmarried (AOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.05â4.16), smoked tobacco (AOR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.50â18.53), or had a physical disability (AOR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.50â18.53) were significantly more likely to be depressed. Conclusion: Regression analysis revealed that in Dhaka, pet owners were associated with lower levels of depression compared to non-pet owners.
