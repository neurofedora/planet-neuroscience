              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13481">Complex-valued Phase Synchrony Reveals Directional Coupling in FMRI and Tracks Medication Effects</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interactions in complex systems requires capturing the directionality of coupling, not only its strength. Phase synchronization captures this timing, yet most methods either reduce phase to its cosine or collapse it into scaler indices such as phase-locking value, discarding directionality. We propose a complex-valued phase synchrony (CVPS) framework that estimates phase with an adaptive Gabor wavelet and preserves both cosine and sine components. Simulations confirm that CVPS recovers true phase offsets and tracks non-stationary dynamics more faithfully than Hilbert-based methods. Because antipsychotics are known to modulate the timing of cortical interactions, they provide a rigorous context to evaluate whether CVPS can capture such pharmacological effects. CVPS further reveals cortical neuro-hemodynamic drivers, with occipital-to-parietal and prefrontal-to-striatal lead-lag flows consistent with known receptor targets, confirming its ability to capture pharmacological timing. CVPS, therefore, offers a robust and generalizable framework for detecting directional coupling in complex systems such as the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13612">Rest2Visual: Predicting Visually Evoked fMRI from Resting-State Scans</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how spontaneous brain activity relates to stimulus-driven neural responses is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures localized stimulus-evoked brain activation, its acquisition is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale across populations. In contrast, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is task-free and abundant, but lacks direct interpretability. We introduce Rest2Visual, a conditional generative model that predicts visually evoked fMRI (ve-fMRI) from resting-state input and 2D visual stimuli. It follows a volumetric encoder--decoder design, where multiscale 3D features from rs-fMRI are modulated by image embeddings via adaptive normalization, enabling spatially accurate, stimulus-specific activation synthesis. To enable model training, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset from the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), aligning each rs-fMRI volume with stimulus images and their corresponding ve-fMRI activation maps. Quantitative evaluation shows that the predicted activations closely match ground truth across standard similarity and representational metrics, and support successful image reconstruction in downstream decoding. Notably, the predicted maps preserve subject-specific structure, demonstrating the model's capacity to generate individualized functional surrogates. Our results provide compelling evidence that individualized spontaneous neural activity can be transformed into stimulus-aligned representations, opening new avenues for scalable, task-free functional brain modeling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13875">Personalized Detection of Stress via hdrEEG: Linking Neuro-markers to Cortisol, HRV, and Self-Report</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic stress is a major risk factor for cognitive decline, neurodegenerative disease, and systemic health burden, underscoring the need for reliable individual-level biomarkers of stress reactivity. While cortisol, heart rate variability (HRV), and self-report measures are widely used, they provide limited insight into neural mechanisms. Here, we tested whether two single-channel hdrEEG biomarkers, ST4 and T2, serve as personalized indices of stress regulation by linking neural activity to validated physiological and subjective measures. We conducted two studies. Study 1 included 101 healthy adults (22-82 years) who completed questionnaires on resilience, burnout, and perceived stress, provided salivary cortisol, and underwent hdrEEG during resting, detection, n-back, lexical, emotional music, and startle tasks. Study 2 included 82 adults (19-42 years) who completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, were monitored for HRV, and performed auditory, stress-inducing (job interview, arithmetic), and emotional tasks during hdrEEG recording. Across studies, ST4 reflected physiological arousal and cognitive strain, correlating positively with cortisol, subjective stress, and pulse pressure, and negatively with resilience and HRV indices. T2 showed a complementary profile, linking emotional and autonomic processes. T2 activity correlated with cortisol, heart rate, HRV measures, resilience, and trait anxiety, especially during lexical and emotional tasks. Together, ST4 and T2 capture distinct facets of the stress response: physiological arousal versus emotional-regulatory sensitivity. These findings highlight portable hdrEEG as a promising tool for personalized stress assessment, bridging neural, physiological, and subjective domains with implications for clinical and occupational monitoring.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13867">Plasticity-induced multistability on fast and slow timescales enables optimal information encoding and spontaneous sequence discrimination</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit remarkable computational flexibility, enabling adaptive responses to noisy and ever-changing environmental cues. A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns how a wide range of behaviors can emerge from a relatively limited set of underlying biological mechanisms. In particular, the interaction between activities of neuronal populations and plasticity modulation of synaptic connections may endow neural circuits with a variety of functional responses when coordinated over different characteristic timescales. Here, we develop an information-theoretic framework to quantitatively explore this idea. We consider a stochastic model for neural activities that incorporates the presence of a coupled dynamic plasticity and time-varying stimuli. We show that long-term plasticity modulations play the functional role of steering neural activities towards a regime of optimal information encoding. By constructing the associated phase diagram, we demonstrate that either Hebbian or anti-Hebbian plasticity may become optimal strategies depending on how the external input is projected to the target neural populations. Conversely, short-term plasticity enables the discrimination of temporal ordering in sequences of inputs by navigating the emergent multistable attractor landscape. By allowing a degree of variability in external stimuli, we also highlight the existence of an optimal variability for sequence discrimination at a given plasticity strength. In summary, the timescale of plasticity modulation shapes how inputs are represented in neural activities, thereby fundamentally altering the computational properties of the system. Our approach offers a unifying information-theoretic perspective of the role of plasticity, paving the way for a quantitative understanding of the emergence of complex computations in coupled neuronal-synaptic dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14118">Multi-Source Neural Activity Indices and Spatial Filters for EEG/MEG Inverse Problem: An Extension to MNE-Python</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters, establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13034">Synthesis and Perceptual Scaling of High Resolution Naturalistic Images Using Stable Diffusion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Naturalistic scenes are of key interest for visual perception, but controlling their perceptual and semantic properties is challenging. Previous work on naturalistic scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences between stimuli. However, it is often desirable to assess representations of naturalistic images that vary along a continuum. Traditionally, perceptually continuous variations of naturalistic stimuli have been obtained by morphing a source image into a target image. This produces transitions driven mainly by low-level physical features and can result in semantically ambiguous outcomes. More recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate continuous perceptual variations within a stimulus category. Here we extend and generalize this approach using a different machine learning approach, a text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL), to generate a freely customizable stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions, with each image representing a unique exemplar within a prompted category. We demonstrate the approach by generating a set of 108 object scenes from 6 categories. For each object scene, we generate 10 variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. This ordering was first estimated using a machine learning model of perceptual similarity (LPIPS) and then subsequently validated with a large online sample of human participants. In a subsequent experiment we show that this ordering is also predictive of confusability of stimuli in a working memory experiment. Our image set is suited for studies investigating the graded encoding of naturalistic stimuli in visual perception, attention, and memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13628">Language modulates vision: Evidence from neural networks and human brain-lesion models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.13628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing information structures in between deep neural networks (DNNs) and the human brain has become a key method for exploring their similarities and differences. Recent research has shown better alignment of vision-language DNN models, such as CLIP, with the activity of the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) than earlier vision models, supporting the idea that language modulates human visual perception. However, interpreting the results from such comparisons is inherently limited due to the "black box" nature of DNNs. To address this, we combined model-brain fitness analyses with human brain lesion data to examine how disrupting the communication pathway between the visual and language systems causally affects the ability of vision-language DNNs to explain the activity of the VOTC. Across four diverse datasets, CLIP consistently captured unique variance in VOTC neural representations, relative to both label-supervised (ResNet) and unsupervised (MoCo) models. This advantage tended to be left-lateralized at the group level, aligning with the human language network. Analyses of 33 stroke patients revealed that reduced white matter integrity between the VOTC and the language region in the left angular gyrus was correlated with decreased CLIP-brain correspondence and increased MoCo-brain correspondence, indicating a dynamic influence of language processing on the activity of the VOTC. These findings support the integration of language modulation in neurocognitive models of human vision, reinforcing concepts from vision-language DNN models. The sensitivity of model-brain similarity to specific brain lesions demonstrates that leveraging manipulation of the human brain is a promising framework for evaluating and developing brain-like computer models.

                arXiv:2509.08179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale modelling presents a multifaceted perspective into understanding the mechanisms of the brain and how neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD) manifest and evolve over time. In this study, we propose a novel co-simulation multiscale approach that unifies both micro- and macroscales to more rigorously capture brain dynamics. The presented design considers the electrodiffusive activity across the brain and in the network defined by the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus that is implicated in the mechanics of PD, as well as the contribution of presynaptic inputs in the highlighted regions. The application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and its effects, along with the inclusion of stochastic noise are also examined. We found that the thalamus exhibits large, fluctuating spiking in both the deterministic and stochastic conditions, suggesting that noise contributes primarily to neural variability, rather than driving the overall spiking activity. Ultimately, this work intends to provide greater insights into the dynamics of PD and the brain which can eventually be converted into clinical use.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08548">Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.

                arXiv:2509.13459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological and artificial intelligence systems navigate the fundamental efficiency-robustness tradeoff for optimal encoding, i.e., they must efficiently encode numerous attributes of the input space while also being robust to noise. This challenge is particularly evident in hierarchical processing systems like the human brain. With a view towards understanding how systems navigate the efficiency-robustness tradeoff, we turned to a population geometry framework for analyzing representations in the human visual cortex alongside artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the ventral visual stream, we found general-purpose, scale-free representations characterized by a power law-decaying eigenspectrum in most areas. However, in certain higher-order visual areas did not have scale-free representations, indicating that scale-free geometry is not a universal property of the brain. In parallel, ANNs trained with a self-supervised learning objective also exhibited free-free geometry, but not after fine-tune on a specific task. Based on these empirical results and our analytical insights, we posit that a system's representation geometry is not a universal property and instead depends upon the computational objective.

                arXiv:2509.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the steeped-transmission shaft design problem is proposed for weight optimization. The bio-inspired search-based Snail Homing and Mating Search (SHMS) algorithm is utilized to solve the problem. It is inspired by the social behaviour of snails and their inherent nature of finding better homes, and mate. The proposed steeped-transmission shaft design problem is modelled considering the fatigue loading, combined bending, torsion loads, and the principle of Modified Goodman criteria. The forces diagram and the bending moment diagrams are obtained using the MDSOLIDS software. The forces and bending moment are then used to mathematical model the objective function and constraints. The SHMS algorithm has yielded the desired solution with reasonable computational cost. The constraints are handled using a static penalty function approach. The statistical results obtained using SHMS algorithm are further used for generating CAD model. The analysis is carried out in ANSYS Workbench. Further, the deflection obtained from SHMS algorithm and ANSYS Workbench are compared and results are discussed in details.

                arXiv:2509.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensory processing at the edge requires ultra-low power stand-alone computing technologies. This is particularly true for modern agriculture and precision irrigation systems which aim to optimize water usage by monitoring key environmental observables continuously using distributed efficient embedded processing elements. Neuromorphic processing systems are emerging as a promising technology for extreme edge-computing applications that need to run on resource-constrained hardware. As such, they are a very good candidate for implementing efficient water management systems based on data measured from soil and plants, across large fields. In this work, we present a fully energy-efficient neuromorphic irrigation control system that operates autonomously without any need for data transmission or remote processing. Leveraging the properties of a biologically realistic spiking neural network, our system performs computation, and decision-making locally. We validate this approach using real-world soil moisture data from apple and kiwi orchards applied to a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor, and show that the generated irrigation commands closely match those derived from conventional methods across different soil depths. Our results show that local neuromorphic inference can maintain decision accuracy, paving the way for autonomous, sustainable irrigation solutions at scale.

                arXiv:2509.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Abstract: It is shown that the port behavior of a resistor-diode network corresponds to the solution of a ReLU monotone operator equilibrium network (a neural network in the limit of infinite depth), giving a parsimonious construction of a neural network in analog hardware. We furthermore show that the gradient of such a circuit can be computed directly in hardware, using a procedure we call hardware linearization. This allows the network to be trained in hardware, which we demonstrate with a device-level circuit simulation. We extend the results to cascades of resistor-diode networks, which can be used to implement feedforward and other asymmetric networks. We finally show that different nonlinear elements give rise to different activation functions, and introduce the novel diode ReLU which is induced by a non-ideal diode model.

                arXiv:2509.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyone who has tried to swat a fly has likely been frustrated by its remarkable agility.This ability stems from its visual neural perception system, particularly the collision-selective neurons within its small brain.For autonomous robots operating in complex and unfamiliar environments, achieving similar agility is highly desirable but often constrained by the trade-off between computational cost and performance.In this context, insect-inspired intelligence offers a parsimonious route to low-power, computationally efficient frameworks.In this paper, we propose an attention-driven visuomotor control strategy inspired by a specific class of fly visual projection neurons-the lobula plate/lobula column type-2 (LPLC2)-and their associated escape behaviors.To our knowledge, this represents the first embodiment of an LPLC2 neural model in the embedded vision of a physical mobile robot, enabling collision perception and reactive evasion.The model was simplified and optimized at 70KB in memory to suit the computational constraints of a vision-based micro robot, the Colias, while preserving key neural perception mechanisms.We further incorporated multi-attention mechanisms to emulate the distributed nature of LPLC2 responses, allowing the robot to detect and react to approaching targets both rapidly and selectively.We systematically evaluated the proposed method against a state-of-the-art locust-inspired collision detection model.Results showed that the fly-inspired visuomotor model achieved comparable robustness, at success rate of 96.1% in collision detection while producing more adaptive and elegant evasive maneuvers.Beyond demonstrating an effective collision-avoidance strategy, this work highlights the potential of fly-inspired neural models for advancing research into collective behaviors in insect intelligence.

                arXiv:2504.17827v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

                arXiv:2507.20923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

Abstract: In this paper, we experiment with novelty-based variants of OpenAI-ES, the NS-ES and NSR-ES algorithms, and evaluate their effectiveness in training complex, transformer-based architectures designed for the problem of reinforcement learning, such as Decision Transformers. We also test if we can accelerate the novelty-based training of these larger models by seeding the training with a pretrained models. The experimental results were mixed. NS-ES showed progress, but it would clearly need many more iterations for it to yield interesting agents. NSR-ES, on the other hand, proved quite capable of being straightforwardly used on larger models, since its performance appears as similar between the feed-forward model and Decision Transformer, as it was for the OpenAI-ES in our previous work.

Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a $\textit{non-linear}$ recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the Jacobian matrix to be diagonal, the full sequence can be solved in parallel, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Importantly, the diagonal Jacobian structure of our model results in no performance loss compared to the original model with dense Jacobian, and the approach can be generalized to other non-linear recurrent models, demonstrating broader applicability. On a suite of long-range forecasting tasks, we demonstrate that LrcSSM outperforms Transformers, LRU, S5, and Mamba.

                <p>Auditory perception can be modulated by other sensory stimuli. However, we do not fully understand the neural mechanisms that support multisensory behavior. Here, while male nonhuman primates detected a target vocalization that was embedded in a background chorus of vocalizations, we recorded spiking activity from the primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that a congruent video of a monkey eliciting the target vocalization improved the monkeys' behavior, relative to their performance when we only presented a static image of the monkey. As a proxy for the functional organization of A1, we compared the contribution of neurons with significant spectrotemporal response fields (STRFs) with those that had nonsignificant STRFs (nSTRFs). Because, on average, STRF and nSTRF neurons have different spike waveform shapes, firing rates, and neural-correlation structure, we hypothesized that they might belong to different neural populations. Consistent with this, we found that, although STRF neurons encode stimulus information through synchronized activity, task-related information in the primate A1 is encoded more as a structured dynamic process in the population of nSTRF neurons. Together, these findings suggest that modulatory multisensory behavior is supported by nSTRF neurons and identifies, for the first time, a functional differentiation between the role that STRF and nSTRF neurons contribute to behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/38/e0084252025?rss=1">Characterization of Auditory Responsive Neurons in the Mouse Superior Colliculus to White Noise and Frequency-Restricted Sounds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Locating the source of a specific sound in a complex environment and determining its saliency is critical for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor midbrain structure, plays an important role in sound localization and has been shown to have a topographic map of the auditory space in a range of species. In mice, previous studies using broadband white noise stimuli found that high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural-level differences (ILDs) are used to generate a neuron's spatially restricted receptive field (RF) and that these RFs are organized topographically along the azimuth. However, in a naturalistic environment, the auditory stimuli that an animal encounters may have restricted spectral components, although these sound sources can still be localized efficiently. It remains unknown whether and how the SC neurons respond to frequency-restricted sounds and, in turn, how this changes the organization of their RFs into a topographic map. Here, we show results from large-scale in vivo physiological recordings of SC neurons from male and female mice in response to white noise, naturalistic ultrasonic pup call, and chirps. We find that mouse SC auditory neurons respond to a pup call and chirps with distinct temporal patterns and a spatial preference predominantly at ~60&deg; in contralateral azimuth. In addition, we categorized auditory SC neurons based on their spectrotemporal RF patterns and demonstrated that there are at least four classes of auditory-responsive neurons in the SC that lie in different locations along the anteroposterior axis of the SC.</p>

                <p>The left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) supports diverse cognitive functions through the finely differentiated yet coordinated interactions of its subregions, including the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), angular gyrus (AG), and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lbIPS). However, how these subregions dynamically represent and exchange information during cognitive processing remains unclear. Language processing, integrating visual form, phonology, and semantics provide an ideal model for investigating the IPL's functional capabilities and dynamics. To overcome the limitations of traditional neuroimaging techniques that lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture these fast-evolving processes and univariate analyses unable to detect fine-grained representational structure in neural signals, we employed stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 13 epilepsy patients (eight males and five females) performing an oral word reading task. Combining SEEG with representational similarity analysis (RSA), a multivariate approach linking neural activity patterns to cognitive models, we mapped spatiotemporal language information dynamics across IPL subregions. Results revealed dynamic functional differentiation within the left IPL: the SMG and AG exhibited sequential language representations, with the SMG showing early semantics, followed by phonology and later visual form and semantics; the AG showed early semantics followed by visual form; in contrast, the lbIPS was engaged only in visual form representation. Connectivity analyses revealed the dynamic coordination among IPL subregions throughout the task. These findings demonstrate that the left IPL operates as a dynamic network, where functional specialization and interregional information exchange collectively support complex cognitive processes.</p>

                <p>Abnormal excitatory synaptic transmission in the human prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based primarily on genetic evidence. However, changes in synaptic function cannot be predicted from altered gene expressions, but determining the amount, density, and subsynaptic distribution of synaptic proteins is the only reliable indirect readout of function. Detecting proteins in individual synapses of human postmortem tissues has been severely constrained by technical limitations. Here we overcome this limitation by optimizing a high-resolution, quantitative localization method to facilitate antigen recognition at excitatory synapses in postmortem brains of both sexes. Using PSD-95 immunoreactivity as molecular marker of excitatory synapses, we demonstrate the lack of significant differences in synapse density and size in upper cortical layers of control and schizophrenia subjects. The synaptic densities of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and presynaptic molecules Bassoon and Munc13-1 are also indistinguishable between control and schizophrenia subjects. The number of Munc13-1 nanoclusters, marking presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites, does not differ either. Excitatory synapses on parvalbumin expressing interneurons contain similar AMPA but significantly lower NMDA receptor densities in schizophrenia compared with control subjects. Our study provides the first comprehensive comparison of key functionally relevant synaptic proteins in individual human excitatory synapses and demonstrates that changes in the molecular composition of only a specific subset of excitatory synapses may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>

                <p>Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual versus auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform <I>N-</I>back WM judgments in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including the dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including the precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, and presupplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in the frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual-, and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span the frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.</p>

                <p>There is growing evidence that sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are equipped with mechanisms for "gating" nociceptive information before it enters the central nervous system. However, direct in vivo evidence remains limited due to the anatomical inaccessibility of the DRG. Here, we developed a decerebrate, arterially perfused preparation of the rat (of either sex) that allows simultaneous recordings from the C8 spinal nerve (SN) and dorsal root (DR), with full access to the corresponding DRG in the absence of anesthesia. The C8 segment contributes to the median nerve supplying the forepaw, which was used for sensory stimulation. Spikes in DR were recorded and temporally matched to their origin spikes in the SN. Noxious mechanical stimulation to the forepaw increased firing in both the SN and the DR, and application of GABA (200&nbsp;&micro;M) or the GABA reuptake inhibitor, NO-711 (200&nbsp;&micro;M), directly into the DRG significantly reduced firing frequency only in the DR without affecting SN activity. Spike sorting revealed that this reduction in the spike rate from SN to DR, a phenomenon we term here as "filtering," was greater for C-fiber spikes compared with A-fiber spikes. Innocuous stimuli (brush/cotton bud strokes and proprioceptive stimulation) also increased firing in both SN and DR, but GABA application into the DRG failed to reduce DR firing rates. Taken together, our findings lend direct support to the hypothesis of peripheral gating of the nociceptive signaling at the DRG and highlight the therapeutic potential of these peripheral structures.</p>

                <p>The neurotransmitter release and the synaptic vesicle cycle require a specific lipidic composition of presynaptic and vesicle membranes. Phospholipids with long-chain acyl groups are necessary to confer to membranes the physical properties necessary for synaptic transmission. Elovl5 is crucial for the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) beyond 18-carbon atoms, and its deletion or mutation causes cerebellar motor deficits in humans and mice. In the mouse cerebellum of both sexes, deletion of <I>Elovl5</I> increased 18- and 20-carbon atoms PUFAs, decreased long-chain PUFAs, and increased saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Electrophysiological recordings in Purkinje cells revealed that basal synaptic transmission was preserved in <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice. However, the recovery from depression of the climbing fiber synapse lacked the fast phase, suggesting a deficit in replenishment of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. The parallel fiber synapse showed slower replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool at relatively high but physiological frequencies of 50 and 100&nbsp;Hz. Endocannabinoids contain a long-chain PUFA, and in Purkinje cells, they mediate the synaptically induced suppression of excitation (SSE). In <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice, SSE had a shorter duration, suggesting a role of Elovl5 in this form of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we show dramatic change in length and level of unsaturation of lipids in synaptosomes isolated from <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice. These results suggest that the shift in PUFA lipidic species caused by the absence of Elovl5, in the cerebellar cortex, is responsible for specific deficits in neurotransmitter release.</p>

                <p>The homophilic adhesion molecule Kirrel3 drives synapse formation between dentate granule (DG) neurons and GABA neurons, and Kirrel3 gene variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the circuit function and behavioral relevance of Kirrel3-expressing neurons are unknown. Using intersectional genetics, we identified a population of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons that regulate memory discrimination in male and female mice. Using chemogenetics with in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral assays, we discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons, but not parvalbumin neurons, potently inhibits CA3 neuron activity and impairs contextual memory discrimination during recall, revealing a critical role for these neurons in the retrieval of precise memories. Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites. Together, this multiscale approach demonstrates how cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules mark subsets of neurons that control key features guiding memory and behavior.</p>

Mechanistically, <I>miR-153</I> directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. <I>miR-153</I> suppressed <I>KPNA5</I> via two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction.

                <p>Olfactory dysfunction is a common outcome of brain injuries, negatively affecting quality of life. The adult mammalian nervous system has limited capacity for olfactory recovery, making it challenging to study olfactory regeneration and recovery. In contrast, zebrafish are ideal for such studies due to its extensive and lifelong regenerative abilities. In this work, we describe a model of excitotoxic injury in the olfactory bulb (OB) using quinolinic acid lesions in adult zebrafish of both sexes. We observed extensive neurodegeneration in both the OB and olfactory epithelium, including a reduction of bulbar volume, neuronal death, and impaired olfactory function. Recovery mechanisms involved tissue remodeling, cell proliferation, and neurogenesis, leading to full restoration of olfactory function by 21&nbsp;d. This study provides a model to further investigate the effects of excitotoxicity on olfactory dysfunction and highlights zebrafish's remarkable regenerative abilities, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for restoring olfactory function following brain injuries.</p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were taken to mitigate virus spread. Assessing their effectiveness is essential in policy support but often challenging, due to interactions between measures, the increase of immunity, variant emergence and seasonal effects. These factors make results difficult to interpret over a long period of time. Using a mechanistic approach, we estimate the overall effectiveness of sets of NPIs in reducing transmission over time. Our approach quantifies the effectiveness by comparing the observed effective reproduction number, which is the number of secondary infections caused by a typical infected person, to a counterfactual reproduction number if no NPIs were taken. The counterfactual reproduction number accounts for seasonal variations in transmissibility, for emergence of more transmissible variants, and for changes in immunity in the population. The immune fraction is reconstructed from age-specific data of longitudinal serological surveys and vaccination coverage, taking immunity loss due to waning into account. We estimate the effectiveness of NPIs in the Netherlands from the start of the pandemic in March 2020 until the emergence of the Omicron variant in November 2021. We find that the effectiveness of NPIs was high in March and April 2020 during the first pandemic wave and in January and February 2021, coinciding with the two periods with the most stringent measures. For both periods the effectiveness was estimated at approximately 50%, i.e., without any measures the reproduction number would have been twice as high as observed. The proposed approach synthesises available epidemiological data from different sources to reconstruct the population-level immunity. With sufficient data, it can be applied not only to COVID-19 but also to other directly transmitted diseases, such as influenza. This method provides a near real-time assessment of the effectiveness of control measures when the required data are available.

Nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence from capsid protein of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) binds to importin-<i>α</i> transport protein and clogs nuclear import. Prevention of viral NLS binding to importin-<i>α</i> may represent a viable therapeutic route. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which two diffusively binding inhibitors, DP9 and DP9o, interfere with the binding of VEEV’s NLS peptide to importin-<i>α</i>. Our study uses all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations, which probe the competitive binding of the VEEV NLS fragment, the coreNLS peptide, and the inhibitors to importin-<i>α</i>. Our previous simulations of non-competitive binding of the coreNLS, in which it natively binds to importin-<i>α</i>, are used as a reference. Both inhibitors abrogate native peptide binding and reduce the fraction of its native interactions, but they fail to prevent its non-native binding to importin-<i>α</i>. As a result, these inhibitors turn the coreNLS into diffusive binder, which adopts a manifold of non-native binding poses. Competition from the inhibitors compromises the free energy of coreNLS binding to importin-<i>α</i> showing that they reduce its binding affinity. The inhibition mechanism is based on masking the native binding interactions formed by the coreNLS amino acids. Surprisingly, ligand interference with the binding interactions formed by importin-<i>α</i> amino acids contributes little to inhibition. We show that DP9 is a stronger inhibitor than DP9o. By comparative analysis of DP9 and DP9o interactions we determine the atomistic reason for a relative “success” of DP9, which is due to the intercalation of this inhibitor between the side chains of NLS lysine residues. To test our simulations, we performed AlphaScreen experiments measuring IC50 values for the inhibitors. AlphaScreen data confirmed <i>in silico</i> ranking of the inhibitors. By combining our recent studies, we discuss the putative mechanism by which diffusively binding inhibitors impact protein-protein interactions.

                <p>by Dennis N. Makau, Jonathan Arzt, Kimberly VanderWaal</p>

Accurately estimating cross-neutralization between serotype O foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs) is critical for guiding vaccine selection and disease management. In this study, we developed a machine learning approach to estimate r1 values—an established measure of antigenic similarity—using VP1 sequence data and published virus neutralization titer (VNT) results. Our dataset comprised 108 serum-virus pairs representing 73 distinct FMDV strains. We applied Boruta feature selection and random forest classifiers, optimizing model performance through tenfold cross-validation and sub-sampling to address class imbalance. Predictors included pairwise amino acid distances, site-specific polymorphisms, and differences in potential N-glycosylation sites. Using a 0.3 r1 threshold to define cross-neutralization, the final model achieved high accuracy (0.96), sensitivity (0.93), and specificity (0.96) in training, and performed robustly on independent test sets - accuracy was 0.75 (95% CI 0.60 and 0.90), F1 score 0.86% and PPV 0.77. Importantly, key VP1 residues—positions 48, 100, 135, 150, and 151—emerged as strong predictors of antigenic relationships. Our results demonstrate the utility of integrating routinely generated genomic data with machine learning to inform vaccine candidate selection and anticipate immune interactions among circulating FMDV strains. This approach offers a practical tool for accelerating vaccine decision-making and can be adapted to other FMDV serotypes. The latest version of the r<sub>1</sub> predictive model is available for access via a Shiny dashboard (https://dmakau.shinyapps.io/PredImmune-FMD/).

                <p>by Jiancheng Zhang, Xiangting Li, Xiaolu Guo, Zhaoyi You, Lucas Böttcher, Alex Mogilner, Alexander Hoffmann, Tom Chou, Mingtao Xia</p>

Proper regulation of cell signaling and gene expression is crucial for maintaining cellular function, development, and adaptation to environmental changes. Reaction dynamics in cell populations is often noisy because of (i) inherent stochasticity of intracellular biochemical reactions (“intrinsic noise”) and (ii) heterogeneity of cellular states across different cells that are influenced by external factors (“extrinsic noise”). In this work, we introduce an extrinsic-noise-driven neural stochastic differential equation (END-nSDE) framework that utilizes the Wasserstein distance to accurately reconstruct SDEs from stochastic trajectories measured across a heterogeneous population of cells (extrinsic noise). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and experimental data from three different systems in cell biology: (i) circadian rhythms, (ii) RPA-DNA binding dynamics, and (iii) NFκB signaling processes. Our END-nSDE reconstruction method can model how cellular heterogeneity (extrinsic noise) modulates reaction dynamics in the presence of intrinsic noise. It also outperforms existing time-series analysis methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). By inferring cellular heterogeneities from data, our END-nSDE reconstruction method can reproduce noisy dynamics observed in experiments. In summary, the reconstruction method we propose offers a useful surrogate modeling approach for complex biophysical processes, where high-fidelity mechanistic models may be impractical.

                <p>by Xuwen Wang, Yanfang Guan, Wei Gao, Xin Lai, Wuqiang Cao, Xiaoyan Zhu, Xiaoling Zeng, Yuqian Liu, Shenjie Wang, Ruoyu Liu, Xin Yi, Shuanying Yang, Jiayin Wang</p>

Molecular residual disease (MRD) detection, initially developed for hematologic malignancies, has become a critical biomarker for monitoring solid tumors. MRD detection primarily relies on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis using next-generation sequencing, offering high sensitivity and broad genomic coverage. However, challenges remain in designing cost-effective panels that maximize mutation detection while maintaining biological relevance. Fixed panels often lack sufficient patient-specific mutation coverage, while WES-based personalized MRD assays, despite their high sensitivity, are costly and less accessible. We developed a tumor comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP)-informed personalized MRD assay to detect tumor-derived mutations, which allowed us to design patient-specific personalized panels and meanwhile, provide a cost-effective alternative to whole exome sequencing (WES). To address these limitations, we developed MRDtarget, a heuristic multivariate Gaussian model-based targeted capture region selection method. By expanding beyond traditional hotspot regions, MRDtarget optimizes variant tracking for MRD detection, significantly improving sensitivity. Using a Bayesian inference-based heuristic approach, MRDtarget integrates multi-feature informativeness rates to identify optimal genomic regions for capture. Experimental results demonstrate that MRDtarget enables the detection of more variants per patient. This study underscores the importance of rational panel design to improve MRD sensitivity and provides a novel approach to enhance precision diagnostics and treatment for solid tumor patients.

                <p>by Pengcheng Lv, Dong Chen, Chao Zhang, Wei Duan, Pingping Lu, Kai Zhang, Liang Wang</p>

To execute goal-directed behavior, retrieval of both context and object information is crucial. Despite the ubiquity of such contextual computations in daily navigation, the neural mechanisms underlying this process in humans and its connection to behavior remain largely elusive. Leveraging intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recorded from epilepsy patients (<i>N</i> = 31) engaged in a context-dependent spatial navigation task, we uncovered distinct oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex (EC) that represented context and object information, respectively. Notably, the covariation of these neural representations predicted behavioral performance. Furthermore, both representations were primarily driven by low-frequency oscillations (2–8 Hz). The synchronization of low-frequency oscillations between HC and EC was associated with enhanced object representations in the EC. These findings highlight the importance of low-frequency neural dynamics in mediating both local representations and interregional interactions within the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit during context-dependent spatial navigation.

Potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) dynamics are vital for various biological processes. However, the limited availability of detection tools for tracking intracellular and extracellular K<sup>+</sup> has impeded a comprehensive understanding of the physiological roles of K<sup>+</sup> in intact biological systems. In this study, we developed two novel red genetically encoded potassium indicators (RGEPOs), RGEPO1 and RGEPO2, through a combination of directed evolution in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and subsequent optimization in mammalian cells. RGEPO1, targeted to the extracellular membrane, and RGEPO2, localized in the cytoplasm, exhibited positive K<sup>+</sup>-specific fluorescence response with affinities of 3.55 and 14.81 mM in HEK293FT cells, respectively. We employed RGEPOs for real-time monitoring of subsecond K<sup>+</sup> dynamics in cultured neurons, astrocytes, acute brain slices, and the awake mouse in both intracellular and extracellular environments. Using RGEPOs, we were able, for the first time, to visualize intracellular and extracellular potassium transients during seizures in the brains of awake mice. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations provided new insights into the potassium-binding mechanisms of RGEPO1 and RGEPO2, revealing distinct K<sup>+</sup>-binding pockets and structural features. Thus, RGEPOs represent a significant advancement in potassium imaging, providing enhanced tools for real-time visualization of K<sup>+</sup> dynamics in various cell types and cellular environments.

                Nausea serves as a protective response against harmful ingested stimuli but can also be experienced as a discomforting aspect of various conditions. Recent insights have emerged regarding neural pathways and molecular mechanisms linked to this sensation. This often involves complex interactions of interoceptive neural pathways with the digestive, endocrine, and immune systems. This review summarizes recent findings using non-emetic (e.g., rodents) and emetic (e.g., ferrets, shrews, dogs) mammalian models to explore the molecular mechanisms of nausea, particularly in understudied malaise states. By investigating how nausea is triggered across different contexts, we aim to clarify the general sensory principles governing this response and to promote a shift in therapeutic research – from a top-down, observational paradigm to a bottom-up, mechanism-driven approach.

                In this issue of Neuron, Biane et al. used cellular-resolution recordings in ventral CA1 (vCA1) to comprehensively establish that it encodes stimulus features and identity, but not a generalized abstraction of valence. This suggests a complementary role of vCA1 to valence coding regions by providing stimulus-specific representations.

                In their recent study, Sasmita et al.1 reported that the parental origin of the 5xFAD (Tg6799) transgene substantially influences amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition in this widely used amyloid model for this aspect of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Mice inheriting the transgene from the male parent exhibited approximately twice the plaque burden compared to those with maternal inheritance. This effect was consistent across multiple breeding colonies and independent of maternal care or in utero environment, indicating a robust and reproducible influence of parental origin on pathology.

                Ye et al. demonstrate a consistent developmental trajectory for variability in recurring brain state engagement (SEV) across four independent datasets (N > 3,000). SEV increases with age before plateauing in adolescence, with female participants reaching stabilization before male participants. SEV further predicts executive function (EF) in previously unseen individuals.

                This review examines how chronic opioid use reshapes medial ventral tegmental area circuits, increasing sensitivity to aversive stimuli, amplifying negative affect, and reinforcing withdrawal-avoidance behaviors that drive opioid misuse. It also explores how chronic pain may exacerbate these effects through heightened aversive signaling, further increasing misuse risk.

                Echeverry et al. show that Munc13-1 regulates insulin granule release via two C2B-domain dependent mechanisms: promoting Munc13-1 recruitment to granules and subsequent activation by Ca2+. The findings identify two separate Munc13-regulated mechanisms that act during granule priming and facilitation.

The p53-Bax pathway regulates epiblast cell numbers via apoptosis, and epiblast cell counts predict reactivation, a defining trait of diapause.

                Prakash and Inamdar show that mitochondrial remodeling during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) drives hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) formation. Differential mitochondrial membrane potential governs HSPC heterogeneity, impacting their fate and lineage choice. Mitochondrial activity during EHT shapes postnatal hematopoietic homeostasis and reveals a developmental origin of HSPC heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94288">A novel mouse model for LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy with analysis of molecular pathogenesis and clinical phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of <i>LAMA2</i>-related muscular dystrophy (<i>LAMA2</i>-MD) requires improving. Here, we report the phenotype, neuropathology, and transcriptomics data (scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq) of a new <i>Lama2</i> knockout mouse (dy<sup>H</sup>/dy<sup>H</sup>) which was created based on the human <i>LAMA2</i>-MD mutation hotspot region using CRISPR-Cas9. The dy<sup>H</sup>/dy<sup>H</sup> mice presented a severe phenotype with muscular dystrophy. Mouse brain scRNA-seq showed that <i>Lama2</i> gene was expressed predominantly and specifically in vascular and leptomeningeal fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells, and weakly in astrocytes in wild-type mouse. Laminin α2 expression on the cortical surface was observed with immunofluorescence. In dy<sup>H</sup>/dy<sup>H</sup>, <i>Lama2</i> expression was decreased in those cell types, which might be associated with the disruption of gliovascular basal lamina assembly. Additionally, transcriptomic investigation of muscles showed 2020 differentially expressed genes, mainly associated with the impaired muscle cytoskeleton and development. In summary, this study provided potentially useful information for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of <i>LAMA2</i>-MD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99602">Fast evolutionary turnover and overlapping variances of sex-biased gene expression patterns defy a simple binary sex classification of somatic tissues</a></h4>

              
                Sexual dimorphism in phenotypes is largely driven by genes with sex-biased expression, spanning from key regulators to numerous organ-specific effectors. Current understanding is limited regarding the evolutionary dynamics of these genes in somatic tissues that generate the adult phenotype versus gonadal organs that are required for reproduction. Here, we investigate sex-biased gene expression and micro-evolutionary patterns of these genes in populations of subspecies and species of wild mice (genus <i>Mus</i>) that were raised under controlled conditions. We find a faster evolutionary turnover of sex-biased gene expression in somatic tissues, but not in the gonads, when compared to the turnover of non-sex-biased genes. We introduce a sex-biased gene expression index (SBI) to quantify individual variances. We find a range from binary to overlapping SBI patterns across individuals. SBI values do not correlate between organs of the same individuals, thus supporting a mosaic model of somatic sex determination. Comparison with data from humans shows mostly fewer sex-biased genes compared to mice and strongly overlapping SBI distributions between the somatic organs of the sexes. We conclude that adult individuals are composed of a mosaic spectrum of sex characteristics in their somatic tissues that should not be cumulated into a simple binary classification.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106484">Coupled equilibria of dimerization and lipid binding modulate SARS Cov 2 Orf9b interactions and interferon response</a></h4>

              
                Open Reading Frame 9b (Orf9b), an accessory protein of SARS-CoV and –2, is involved in innate immune suppression through its binding to the mitochondrial receptor Translocase of Outer Membrane 70 (Tom70). Previous structural studies of Orf9b in isolation revealed a β-sheet-rich homodimer; however, structures of Orf9b in complex with Tom70 revealed a monomeric helical fold. Here, we developed a biophysical model that quantifies how Orf9b switches between these conformations and binds to Tom70, a requirement for suppressing the type 1 interferon response. We used this model to characterize the effect of lipid binding and mutations in variants of concern to the Orf9b:Tom70 equilibrium. We found that the binding of a lipid to the Orf9b homodimer biases the Orf9b monomer:dimer equilibrium towards the dimer by reducing the dimer dissociation rate ~100 fold. We also found that mutations in variants of concern can alter different microscopic rate constants without significantly affecting binding to Tom70. Together, our results highlight how perturbations to different steps in these coupled equilibria can affect the apparent affinity of Orf9b to Tom70, with potential downstream implications for interferon signaling in coronavirus infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99572">Impact of maximal overexpression of a non-toxic protein on yeast cell physiology</a></h4>

              
                While it is recognized that excess expression of non-essential proteins burdens cell growth, the physiological state of cells under such stress is largely unknown. This is because it is challenging to distinguish between adverse effects arising from the properties of the expressed excess protein (cytotoxicity) and those caused solely by protein overexpression. In this study, we attempted to identify the model protein with the lowest cytotoxicity in yeast cells by introducing a new neutrality index. We found that a non-fluorescent fluorescent protein (mox-YG) and an inactive glycolytic enzyme (Gpm1–CCmut) showed the lowest cytotoxicity. These proteins can be expressed at levels exceeding 40% of total protein while maintaining yeast growth. The transcriptome of cells expressing mox-YG to the limit indicated that the cells were in a nitrogen source requirement state. Proteome analysis revealed increased mitochondrial protein and decreased ribosome abundance, similar to the inactivated state of the TORC1 pathway. The decrease in ribosome abundance was presumably due to defective nucleolus formation, partially rescued by a mutation in the nuclear exosome. These findings suggest that massive overexpression of excess protein, termed protein burden, causes nitrogen source starvation, a metabolic shift toward more energy-efficient respiration, and a ribosomal biosynthesis defect due to an imbalance between ribosomal protein and rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus.

">Hemispheric laterality of the putamen predicts pseudoneglect</a></h4>

              
                Healthy individuals tend to exhibit a subtle leftward attentional bias, a phenomenon termed pseudoneglect. While this bias is thought to reflect a right-hemisphere dominance when allocating spatial attention, the contribution of subcortical structures remains poorly understood. Although lesion and neuroimaging studies in clinical populations have implicated asymmetries in the basal ganglia and thalamus to dysfunction in spatial attention, it remains unclear whether naturally occurring subcortical asymmetries in healthy individuals predict behavioural biases in spatial attention. In this study, we investigated whether volumetric asymmetries in subcortical structures are associated with biases in spatial attention in a non-clinical population. This was achieved by using the landmark task to assess spatial biases, alongside acquiring T1-weighted MRI data from 44 healthy participants. The subcortical regions were segmented using the FIRST algorithm to estimate the volumetric asymmetry of specific regions. We found that variability in pseudoneglect was predicted by the degree of leftward lateralisation of putamen volume, indicating that the putamen contributes to the magnitude of spatial attention biases. This also suggests that the left putamen may support right-hemisphere neocortical dominance through the indirect pathway. These findings bridge anatomical and behavioural measures, highlighting the functional relevance of subcortical asymmetry in shaping attentional processes in the healthy brain. Our findings pave the way for early diagnosis of neurological disorders associated with subcortical atrophies including Parkinson's Disease and dementia.

">The ventral visual stream for reading converges on the transmodal language network</a></h4>

              
                Reading bridges sensation and cognition. To derive meaning from written words, visual input is first processed in unimodal (i.e., sensory-specific) visual streams and then engages a distributed language network (LANG) that includes classic perisylvian language areas and supports transmodal (i.e., sensory-nonspecific) functions. A reading-relevant region in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC), sometimes called the visual word form area (VWFA), has been the subject of controversy because it displays properties of both systems: it responds to meaningless written pseudowords, implying a unimodal visual function, but also responds to meaningful speech, implying a transmodal function. We investigated whether precision functional mapping could help clarify this region's role in reading. We characterized a stream of visual regions along the ITC that responded preferentially to visual orthographic forms (i.e., written pseudowords, consonant strings, and real words). Network mapping revealed that only the most anterior region of this "orthographic stream" was connected to the LANG network and accordingly showed responses to meaningful speech. Furthermore, this anterior region was more selective, responding preferentially to text-based stimuli, whereas the more posterior regions of the stream were additionally activated by perceptually similar images (i.e., number strings, foreign script). Our results support that connections to the LANG network may drive specialization along the orthographic stream for writing. This basal language network region may represent an interface between visual and transmodal language systems, thus serving as a critical nexus for reading.

Most previous studies have utilized cross-sectional or acute approaches, limiting insights into the longitudinal dynamics of the neural network. In this study, we chronically recorded laminar electrophysiological activity in both the primary visual cortex (V1) and hippocampal CA1 region of young (2-month-old) and aged (13-month-old) mice over 16 weeks. This approach allowed us to directly assess how aging modulates functional connectivity within hierarchically connected cortical and hippocampal circuits. We found that single-unit spiking activity and the signal-to-noise ratio were largely preserved in aged versus young mice, suggesting intact neuronal firing properties. However, aged mice showed global reductions in local field potential (LFP) power and a selective decrease in coherence across delta, alpha-beta, and gamma frequency bands within and between cortical layers and V1-CA1 pathways, while phase amplitude coupling remained unaffected. Interestingly, population level excitatory activity in CA1 was increased in aged animals. These findings indicate that aging selectively impairs network-level synchrony and temporal coordination in specific frequency bands and regions, with minimal loss of single-neuron function. Our results highlight the necessity of longitudinal, multi-region measurements to uncover the multi-scale vulnerabilities of the aging brain. Understanding the depth- and region-dependent circuit changes will guide strategies to preserve cortical-hippocampal communication and cognitive function in aging, as well as enhance neural interface technologies for older populations.

">Novel monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal HEAT domain of Huntingtin</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Reliable detection of huntingtin (HTT) is essential for understanding Huntington's disease (HD) biology and evaluating therapeutic strategies. However, high-quality monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the HTT C-terminal domain remain limited. OBJECTIVE: We sought to generate and validate novel monoclonal antibodies targeting the HTT C-terminal HEAT containing domain to better detect HTT independently of potential effects of polyglutamine length that can impact some N-terminally targeted antibodies. METHODS: We immunized mice with a highly purified, well characterized recombinant protein corresponding to the HTT C-terminal domain. We generated monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma cell lines and characterized the antibodies using parental and HTT-knockout cell lines in common immuno-applications. RESULTS: Three novel, independent hybridoma lines producing anti-HTT monoclonal antibodies were derived. Using CRISPR-edited HTT knockout cell lines we identified one clone, anti-HTT [2F8], that was specific and effective across Western blot, immunofluorescence, and ELISA assays. All antibodies bound full-length HTT irrespective of HAP40 interaction or polyQ length and showed no cross-reactivity to the N-terminal HEAT domain. CONCLUSIONS: These C-terminal HTT mAbs are thus valuable additional tools for studying endogenous HTT function in both normal and disease contexts.

">Coincidence detection supported by electrical synapses is shaped by the D-type K+ current</a></h4>

              
                Electrical synapses mediated by gap junctions are widespread in the mammalian brain, playing essential roles in neural circuit function. Beyond their role synchronizing neuronal activity, they also support complex computations such as coincidence detection, a circuit mechanism in which differences in input timing are encoded by the firing rates of coupled neurons, enabling preferential responses to synchronous over temporally dispersed inputs. Electrical coupling allows each neuron to act as a current sink for its partner during independent depolarizations, thereby reducing excitability. In contrast, synchronous inputs across the network minimize voltage differences through gap junctions, reducing current shunting and increasing spiking probability. However, the contribution of intrinsic neuronal properties to coincidence detection remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated this issue in the Mesencephalic Trigeminal (MesV) Nucleus of mice, a structure composed of somatically-coupled neurons. Using whole-cell recordings and pharmacological tools, we examined the role of the D-type K+ current (ID), finding that it critically shapes both the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of MesV neurons and the dynamics of electrical synaptic transmission. Its fast activation kinetics and subthreshold voltage range of activation make ID a key determinant of transmission strength and timing. Furthermore, the ID, likely mediated by Kv1 subunits, is expressed at the soma and the axon initial segment. Finally, we characterized two key parameters of coincidence detection, precision (time window for effective input summation) and gain (differential response to coincident versus dispersed inputs), finding that ID enhances precision by accelerating membrane repolarization and reduces the gain by limiting neuronal excitability.

">Dual AAV gene therapy using laminin-linking proteins ameliorates muscle and nerve defects in LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene replacement holds promise for treating genetic diseases but faces challenges due to AAV's limited packaging capacity and potential immune responses to transgene products, especially in patients lacking endogenous protein. LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD), a severe congenital disorder caused by loss of laminin-2, presents both hurdles: the LAMA2 gene exceeds AAV capacity, and severely affected patients do not produce the native protein. Here, we developed an AAV-based therapy using two engineered linker proteins derived from endogenously expressed components. These linker proteins restore laminin receptor binding and polymerization, enabling reassembly of a functional basement membrane. Dual AAV delivery of the linkers in a severe LAMA2 MD mouse model resulted in robust expression and significant improvements in muscle histology and function. Employing myotropic capsids enabled therapeutic efficacy at lower vector doses. However, muscle-specific targeting unmasked a LAMA2-related peripheral neuropathy. To address this, we expressed one linker under a muscle-specific promoter and the other under a ubiquitous promoter, delivered via AAV9 or AAV8. This approach achieved near-complete phenotypic restoration when administered neonatally and provided significant benefit when given at progressed disease stages. Our strategy offers a mutation-independent, size-compatible, and potentially immune-tolerable treatment for LAMA2 MD with broad clinical potential.

">Multi-Source Neural Activity Indices and Spatial Filters for EEG/MEG Inverse Problem: An Extension to MNE-Python</a></h4>

              
                Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters, establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.

">Movie-trained transformer reveals novel response properties to dynamic stimuli in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual stimuli remains a fundamental challenge. This study introduces ViV1T, a transformer-based model trained on natural movies to predict neuronal responses in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). ViV1T outperformed state-of-the-art models on both natural and artificial dynamic stimuli, while being faster to run and requiring fewer parameters. Movie-trained ViV1T accurately captured core V1 properties, including orientation and direction selectivity as well as contextual modulation, despite lacking explicit feedback mechanisms. The model also revealed a new subpopulation of neurons that switched its response to iso-oriented surround stimuli from inhibition to excitation between high and low contrasts. Additionally, novel dynamic ViV1T-generated surround stimuli elicited stronger modulatory effects than static images and traditional gratings. We confirmed these predictions through semi-closed-loop in vivo recordings. ViV1T provides a powerful, data-driven framework for understanding how brain sensory areas process dynamic stimuli across space and time.

">Cannflavin B ameliorates social and anxiety deficits and neuronal systems dysfunction in adolescent rats exposed to prenatal valproic acid</a></h4>

              
                There has been growing interest in natural products as potential therapeutics for the core and comorbid symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. Almost all the studies on autism have focused on the therapeutic benefits of cannabis and its associated cannabinoids. In this study the potential therapeutic efficacy of cannflavin B, a related, yet non-psychoactive component of the Cannabis sativa plant, was evaluated. Using prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure in rats, a model that has been widely used to study aspects of autism, we showed that cannflavin B was anxiolytic in the female VPA rats, and normalized sociality in VPA animals of both sexes. When neuronal oscillatory activity was examined, in female VPA rats cannflavin B normalized alterations in low frequency power within the cingulate cortex (Cg), and theta-gamma cross frequency coupling between the dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In male VPA animals, cannflavin B induced frequency-specific alterations in power within the PFC, Cg, and dHIP and ameliorated the VPA-induced suppression of oscillatory coherence between all three regions. In each brain region, cannflavin B also attenuated the sex-specific VPA-induced elevations in microglia. In vitro, cannflavin B normalized VPA-induced elevations in cortical and HIP neuronal activity and promoted more organized cortical firing. These findings demonstrate cannflavin B normalizes behavioural and neuronal systems function alterations induced by prenatal VPA in rats. The present study highlights the importance of alternative cannabis compounds in autism and other disorders.

">Beyond Circadian: A Yearlong Electroencephalography Study Reveals Hidden Ultralong-term Sleep Cycles</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is essential for brain function and overall health. While circadian rhythms and sleep stages across the night have been well-characterized, long-term variations in sleep remain poorly understood. We used a novel technology, subcutaneous electroencephalography, to collect yearlong sleep recordings from 20 healthy individuals. We investigated intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of sleep variability and identified recurring multi-day cycles of 8-60 days in sleep duration, latency, architecture, and stability. Additionally, sleep was modulated by external factors including season, weather, weekends and holidays. This reveals that while sleep processes are governed by internal dynamics, they remain sensitive to environmental influences. These results uncover a previously unrecognized temporal variation in human sleep and suggest new directions for understanding sleep patterns and their relevance to health and disease.

">Lateral septal inhibition of nucleus basalis through direct and indirect pathways in focal limbic seizures</a></h4>

              
                Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy and is characterized by focal seizures originating from limbic structures, including the hippocampus. Patients with TLE often experience impaired consciousness. A recent awake mouse model study demonstrated decreased cortical cholinergic innervation during focal seizures with impaired consciousness, based on cortical slow wave activity and decreased behavioral responsiveness. But the underlying mechanisms for reduced cortical cholinergic activity are not fully understood. This study employs the same awake mouse model combined with electrophysiology recordings in key network nodes, cell-specific calcium imaging in the lateral septum, and neurotransmitter sensing in one of the major subcortical cholinergic systems, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). We demonstrate that decreased cortical cholinergic innervation during focal seizures comes from both direct inhibition and indirect de-excitation of the NBM, showing a parallel pathway NBM suppression mechanism from the LS directly and through the paratenial thalamic nucleus indirectly. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the neural processes involved in impaired consciousness during focal seizures and may open the way to new treatments for this disorder.

">Pharmacological Modulation of MC4R in the Periaqueductal Gray Does Not Alter Social Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Competing motivational drives are integral to survival and encompass a spectrum of internal physiological needs such as hunger to external goals like social connection. Elucidating how these motivational states interact at the neural level is critical to our understanding of adaptive behavior. Hunger-driven behaviors are primarily initiated by agouti-related peptide (AgRP), an inverse agonist of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), which acts to promote feeding by suppressing MC4R signaling. MC4R is present in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a midbrain region involved in pain, appetite, and social behavior. A pilot study found a dense concentration of AgRP fibers in the PAG of male rats, suggesting a potential link between hunger-related signaling and social behavior in this region. To investigate the role of AgRP and MC4R in the PAG on social interaction, we conducted a within-subject dose-response experiment using male rats. Subjects received bilateral microinjections (0.5 L/side) of either vehicle, an MC4R agonist (THIQ), or an antagonist (HS014) into the PAG prior to a five-minute social exploration (SE) test with a novel juvenile conspecific. Contrary to our hypothesis, pharmacological manipulation of MC4R activity in the PAG did not produce significant changes in social interaction time, suggesting that MC4R in the PAG may not directly play a major role in modulating social behavior in rodents. These results highlight the complexity of the neural circuitry involved in social motivation, hunger, and other competing motivational states.

">Loss of PIKfyve in Rod Photoreceptors and RPE Cells Leads to Endolysosomal Dysfunction and Retinal Degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptor outer segment (OS) degradation is primarily mediated by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells through daily phagocytosis of shed distal OS tips. In contrast, much less is understood about the cell-autonomous mechanisms photoreceptors use to clear mislocalized molecules caused by protein misfolding or trafficking defects. Mislocalized or excess rhodopsin that fails to reach the OS is retained in the inner segment or cell body, where it is presumably degraded via the endolysosomal system. We identify PIKfyve, a phosphoinositide kinase that generates PI(3,5)P2, as a key regulator of this pathway. Using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), we find that PIKfyve is highly expressed in rod photoreceptors. Rod-specific PIKfyve deletion causes progressive retinal degeneration, marked by inner segment vacuolation, elevated LAMP1/2, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and eventual loss of rod and cone function. Loss of one copy of PIKfyve in rod photoreceptors accelerates degeneration in P23H rhodopsin mutant mice. In RPE cells, PIKfyve loss disrupts phagocytosis and autophagy, leading to accumulation of rhodopsin, LAMP1, LC3A/B, and lipid droplets, along with metabolic disturbances. These findings demonstrate that PIKfyve is essential for photoreceptor and RPE health by regulating lysosomal function, phagocytosis, autophagy, and metabolism, and suggest that enhancing PIKfyve activity could be a therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases.

">Kat5 cKO Biological Domain Signatures Align with Human Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with amyloid plaques and can be caused by autosomal dominant mutations in APP or PSEN1/2, which form an enzyme substrate complex. Decreases in catalysis of AD mutant APP and PSEN1 supports the hypothesis that membrane delimitation of KAT5 could contribute to AD. METHODS: We compare the hippocampal transcriptome profiles of the Kat5 brain-specific knockout mouse to multiple AD datasets through alignment with the TREAT-AD AD biological domains. We examine KAT5 subcellular localization in human WT and AD neurons. RESULTS: The Kat5 KO mouse demonstrates downregulation of synaptic genes, metabolic pathways, and upregulation of DNA replication and repair, cell cycle and immune response genes. We see similar profiles in Kat5 and comparative AD datasets. KAT5 is restricted to the cytosol in human AD neurons. DISCUSSION: This analysis supports the hypothesis that KAT5 nuclear signaling down stream of APP cleavage plays a pivotal role in neuronal homeostasis and immune regulation.

">Altered network function in hippocampus after sub-chronic activation of Cannabis receptors in peri-adolescence</a></h4>

              
                The Cannabinoid 1-receptor (CB1R) is found in particularly high levels in the hippocampus (HPC), increased CB1R density and binding observed in patients with schizophrenia, and epidemiological studies suggest that regular cannabis use during adolescence is a risk factor for the disease. Historically, concerns around adolescent marijuana use focused on the development of psychosis later in life, however recent findings indicate that cognitive domains may also be at risk. CB1R was shown to interfere with neuronal network oscillations and to impair sensory gating and memory function. Neuronal oscillations are essential in multiple cognitive functions and their impairment was documented in neurological and psychiatric diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate how adolescent pre-treatment with the CB1R selective agonist CP-55940 may lead to abnormalities in theta synchronization in adulthood. Rats were pre-treated with CP-55940 (n=11, 6 males, 5 females) or vehicle (n=8, 4 males, 4 females) during adolescence (daily i/p injections between PND 32-36 or PND 42-46, n=10 and 9, respectively). They were then tested in adulthood (PND 70-88, n=17 or PND 111-115, n=2) under urethane anesthesia. Hippocampal theta rhythm was elicited by brainstem stimulation at 5 intensity levels one hour before and up to 5 hours after injection. We found a lasting significant decrease in theta power after CP-55940 in adult rats which was aggravated further in rats pre-treated in adolescence with the CB1R agonist. The effect was significantly larger (p=0.0462) in rats pre-treated during early adolescence (PND 32-36) compared to the group pre-treated during late adolescence (PND 42-46). We conclude that 1. Exposure to cannabis during adolescence leads to increased sensitivity to CB1R agonist in adulthood; 2. Early adolescence, a critical period for development of HPC networks generating theta rhythm, is particularly prone to this sensitivity.

">Excitatory cholecystokinin neurons in CA3 area regulate the navigation learning and neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampus, a key hub of neural circuits for spatial learning and memory, has attracted tremendous studies. Neuronal information processing in the hippocampus can be regulated by many types of neuropeptides. Cholecystokinin (CCK), the most abundant neuropeptide in the central nervous system which is involved in modulating neuronal functions, such as cognition, memory and neuroplasticity, is widely expressed in the hippocampus. However, whether local excitatory CCK neurons modulates hippocampal function is still unclear. In this study, we showed that CA1 pyramidal neurons receive projections from excitatory CCK neurons in area CA3 (CA3CCK neurons). Subsequently, activation of the CA1-projecting CA3CCK neurons triggers the release of CCK. Then, we found that activity of CA3CCK-CA1 neurons supports the hippocampal-dependent tasks. Furthermore, inhibition of CA3CCK-CA1 projections or knockdown of CA3CCK gene expression markedly impaired the behavioral tasks and neuroplasticity. Taken together, these results may add to a better understanding of how neuromodulators regulate the neural functions in central nervous system.

">Long non-coding RNA Cerox1 targets components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain to regulate the memory impairment caused by sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep deprivation (SD) impairs long-term memory, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of sleep loss on memory are poorly understood. Molecular changes driven by SD have thus far focused on transcription and translation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of regulatory RNAs, have recently been recognized as an important player in memory research. However, it remains unclear how sleep deprivation modulates the expression of lncRNAs or their targets to lead to memory impairment. In this study, we explored the role of lncRNAs in the disruption of spatial memory caused by SD. We examined a set of synapse-associated lncRNAs that were identified through a transcriptome analysis after SD. Among them, we discovered that the lncRNA Cerox1 is downregulated in dorsal hippocampus following SD, and its levels recover after 2.5 hours of rebound sleep. Sleep is critical for the regulation of metabolism and sleep loss impairs mitochondrial function. Both sleep deprivation and Cerox1 knockdown were found to reduce complex I activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This reduction of complex I activity is linked to the decrease in expression of a subset of complex I subunits including Ndufs1, Ndufs3, Ndufa3 and Ndufs6. Overexpression of Cerox1 has the opposite effect, leading to increased complex I activity. Sleep deprivation reduced ATP levels in the dorsal hippocampus, while Cerox1 overexpression restored it. SD disrupted memory consolidation, and this impairment was rescued when Cerox1 was overexpressed. Cerox1 transcript contains multiple miRNA binding sites that regulate the activity of the lncRNA. Notably, overexpression of Cerox1 transcript lacking miRNA binding sites did not rescue the memory deficit caused by SD. Our findings demonstrated that the impairment of memory consolidation after SD is linked to lncRNA-mediated control of mitochondrial electron transport chain activity essential for sustaining energy requirements.

">Neural correlates of perceptual biases in duration perception</a></h4>

              
                How we perceive a current event depends not only on its immediate context, but also on how our internal expectations are shaped by prior experience. In time perception, these expectations manifest as systematic biases, namely sequential dependence, where the current percept is influenced by the previous stimulus, and central tendency, the overestimation of short durations and underestimation of long ones. Both perceptual biases, corresponding to individual beliefs about stimulus generation, can vary substantially between participants. However, the neural correlates of these individual beliefs and their effects are unknown. Here, we investigate how these biases and their individual variations are reflected in neural responses in a duration reproduction task. Our EEG results show that in the frontocentral region, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) while experiencing the current stimulus depends on the previous stimulus regardless of whether sequential dependence is high or low. In contrast, in the right parietal region, CNV significantly correlated with the amount of sequential dependence. Central tendency was associated with frontocentral CNV amplitude and post-stimulus P2 components. A Bayesian model of time perception reproduced the observed neural dynamics, suggesting that internal estimates and expectations of stimulus offset are reflected in EEG responses. Our results demonstrate that both forms of perceptual bias, sequential dependence and central tendency, are reflected in neural activity while experiencing the ongoing stimulus, suggesting that both biases directly affect the measurement of time.

">Decoding human lifespan from neural noise and explaining age-related changes in fractal dimension and gamma oscillations using fractional harmonic oscillator</a></h4>

              
                Predicting human lifespan is a longstanding objective of biomedical research. Traditional statistical models estimate mortality risk or biological age but not lifespan. We propose a two-parameter model based on stochastic fractional harmonic oscillator for neural signals. The model computes maximum human lifespan using 1/f slope, the measure of neural power decay with frequency, which is indicative of neural noise. Using slope rate from electroencephalographic and electrocorticographic datasets, we estimate the mean lifetimes of healthy adults and epileptic patients as 76.9 and 69.7 years, resulting in 89.4% and 96.9% accuracy respectively. Additionally, the present model resolves the inconsistency in age-related changes of fractal dimension (FD) and captures naturally the non-monotonic variation of stimulus-induced gamma power. Thus, the present model provides a simple way to estimate lifespan while explaining age-related changes in slope, FD and power simultaneously, thereby, paving the way for individualized lifetime measurements and unveiling fundamental principles governing life.

">Cortical Origins of the Flash-Lag Effect distortions: The Influence of Retinotopic Map Architecture</a></h4>

              
                The flash-lag effect (FLE) is an illusion whereby the position of a moving object is perceived as being offset in the direction of movement when compared to a flashed static stimulus. This perceptual misalignment has been posited as a key phenomenon in explaining our ability to accurately predict the future position of moving objects, despite the delays in neuronal processing. Our working hypothesis is that the FLE is resulting from the anticipation generated by propagation of neural activity within visual cortical retinotopical maps. According to this hypothesis, the FLE should be affected by discontinuities and anisotropies of the retinotopic map architecture. Using psychophysics we show that the FLE is strongly affected by crossing and the direction of motion in respect to retinotopic features, such as vertical and horizontal meridians and the fovea. The specificity of how early visual cortical retinotopic maps are splitted and magnified around these features led us to suggest that the FLE distortions emerge from propagation in retinotopically organized networks, particularly V1. This work bridges the gap between human psychophysics and the known constraints of retinotopic maps layout, offering a testable framework for future studies of motion position encoding in the visual hierarchy.

">Distribution of big tau isoforms in the human central and peripheral nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To characterize the distribution of big tau, a longer tau isoform expressed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and select central nervous system (CNS) regions, and to examine its relationship with aging and neurodegeneration. Methods: We performed mass spectrometric sequencing of big tau sequence and mapped its distribution across the human nervous system. Postmortem samples included brains from Alzheimer disease (AD), disease controls, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); spinal cord from young controls, disease controls and ALS; and peripheral nerves. Big and small tau levels were also quantified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from young normal controls, amyloid positive and amyloid negative participants. Results: Human big tau results from the insertion of 355 amino acids in the tau protein, encoded by the exon 4a-long and not exon 4a-short. Alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 generates multiple big tau isoforms, expanding the known human tau repertoire. Total tau concentration is ~ 1000-fold higher in the brain than in PNS, where big tau rises sharply along a central-to-peripheral gradient, comprising ~ 50 % of total tau in peripheral nerves compared to only ~ 1 % in brain. CSF big tau levels remain unaltered with CSF A{beta} abnormalities in AD, unlike the small tau isoform, which increases significantly with concomitant A{beta} and cognitive abnormalities. Interpretation: Big tau exhibits a distinct distribution in the human nervous system, decoupled from the changes associated with brain-derived small tau in AD. These findings open opportunities for developing specific blood-based biomarkers to differentiate CNS versus PNS disorders.

">Task-Parametrized Dynamics: Representation of Time and Decisions in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                How do recurrent neural networks (RNNs) internally represent elapsed time to initiate responses after learned delays? To address this question, we trained RNNs on delayed decision-making tasks of increasing complexity: binary decisions, context-dependent decisions, and perceptual integration. We analyzed RNN dynamics after training using eigenvalue spectra, connectivity structure, and population trajectories, and found that 1) distinct dynamical regimes emerge across networks trained on the same task whereby oscillatory dynamics support precise timing, and integration supports evidence accumulation, 2) a population-wide representation of time and decision variables emerges rather than dedicated sub-populations to tracking time and other task-specific variables; and 3) the neural trajectories align only with the output weights near decision points, as shown by trajectory readout correlations, revealing task-driven coordination of precisely timed task representation and readout. These results show that RNNs can use either integration or oscillations to represent time, and highlight how structured connectivity enables diverse solutions to temporal computation problems, consistent with biological principles of degeneracy and functional redundancy.

                Chronic pain states are challenging to control with current drug therapies. Here, we demonstrate that a single dose of psilocybin can produce a sustained anti-nociceptive effect in a model of chronic neuropathic pain in male and female mice. Psilocybin anti-nociceptive effects were mediated by 5-HT2A receptors, although additional mechanisms might also be involved. Furthermore, a single dose of psilocybin caused a significant increase in the anti-nociceptive potential of gabapentin, a widely used treatment for neuropathic pain consistent with the establishment of longer lasting changes in network processing. Overall, these findings present the first preclinical evidence that psilocybin could be a valuable approach for treating chronic pain from nerve injury and serve as a new therapeutic addition for pain management.

">Early micro and nanoscopic responses of microglia to blood-brain barrier modulation by transcranial-focused ultrasound</a></h4>

              
                Modulation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using transcranial-focused ultrasound (FUS) has rapidly progressed to clinical trials. In combination with phospholipid microspheres, also known as microbubbles, administered in the bloodstream, ultrasound energy is guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to target specific brain regions with millimetric precision. At the targeted area, the interaction between FUS and microbubbles increases local BBB permeability for 4 to 6 hours, with an ensuing inflammation that resolves within days to weeks. Microglia, as the resident immune cells of the brain, are triggered by FUS-BBB modulation, although the time course of this response is unclear. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize the early cellular (i.e., density, distribution, and morphology) and subcellular (i.e., ultrastructure) changes in microglial activities following FUS-BBB modulation. Methods: We targeted the hippocampi of adult mice with FUS, in the presence of intravenous microbubbles and guided by MRI, and performed analyses 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation. Microglia were investigated at the population, cellular and subcellular levels, where hippocampal BBB permeability was identified by the entry of endogenous immunoglobulin (Ig)G in the parenchyma. Respective outcome measures included i) the density and distribution of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-positive (Iba)1-positive (+) cells; ii) the morphology of the soma and processes of Iba1+ cells; and iii) the quantification of microglial organelles (e.g., phagosomes) and contacts with blood vessels and synapses using chip mapping scanning electron microscopy. Results: No significant changes in baseline density and distribution of microglia were found in IgG-positive hippocampal areas at 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation. By contrast, FUS-BBB modulation was associated with more elongated microglial cell bodies at both time points. The relative distribution of morphologies at 1 hour shifted toward compact shapes with stubby processes, whereas at 24 hours, shapes were bigger, with fewer processes. At the nanoscale, microglia maintained their interactions with blood vessel elements, except vessels most affected by swollen endfeet, which occurred regardless of treatment. In the parenchyma, 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation, microglia reduced the frequency of contacts with pre-synaptic elements and extracellular space pockets, while showing features of increased metabolic demand and reduced lysosomal activity. Conclusion: At 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation, traits of microglial surveillance activity were largely maintained, with shifts in the shape of a subset of cells, which adopted a morphology associated with injury shielding. FUS-BBB modulation also appears to temporarily modify the digestive, but not the phagocytic activity, of microglia and to reduce pre-synaptic remodeling early after treatment.

">PEDOT:PSS conducting eutectogel for enhanced electrical recording and stimulation in implantable neural interfaces</a></h4>

              
                Conductive polymers such as PEDOT:PSS are widely used in bioelectronic interfaces due to their mixed ionic-electronic conductivity and biocompatibility. However, their mechanical fragility and limited processability constrain their performance in implantable devices. Deep eutectic solvents (DES), when combined with PEDOT:PSS, form eutectogels that enable thick, soft coatings. Here, we present a PEDOT:PSS-based eutectogel incorporating choline chloride: lactic acid and GOPS, integrated into flexible thin-film electrode arrays for sciatic nerve interfacing. These implants feature an array of electrodes and a pre-formed spiral geometry to conformally wrap small-diameter nerves. Devices were fabricated using standard photolithography and reactive ion etching techniques, allowing side-by-side comparison of PEDOT:PSS/DES with conventional PEDOT:PSS electrodes. PEDOT:PSS/DES enabled single-layer films up to 800 nm thick, significantly greater than PEDOT:PSS, and yielding over two-fold improvements in impedance and charge injection capacity in vitro. Acute in vivo electrophysiology in rats confirmed enhanced neural recording and stimulation capabilities, with lower impedance, higher capacitance, and reduced motor activation thresholds. While PEDOT:PSS/DES more reliably elicited motor responses at lower stimulation currents, electromyogram signal amplitudes from the tibialis anterioris at matched stimulation levels were comparable between materials. These results suggest that while superior electrochemical properties improve neural interface performance, local electrode-tissue interactions remain critical. Overall, this work establishes DES-modified PEDOT:PSS as a promising electrode material for soft neural interfaces and highlights its potential for advancing implantable bioelectronics.

">Trait-Relevant Tasks Improve Personality Prediction from Structural-Functional Brain Network Coupling</a></h4>

              
                Personality traits capture stable patterns of behavior and thought, and neurobiological correlates were identified in structural and functional brain networks. Here, we investigate whether the coupling between structural and functional brain networks (SC-FC coupling), during resting state and seven tasks of varying trait-relevance, is associated with individual differences in the Big Five personality traits. We used diffusion-weighted and functional magnetic resonance imaging from 764 participants of the Human Connectome Project and modelled individual differences in SC-FC coupling with similarity and communication measures. These measures approximate functional interactions unfolding on top of the structural connectome and were set in relation to individual variations in personality traits. Significant associations were only observed during trait-relevant tasks: for agreeableness during social cognition, and conscientiousness could be predicted from task-general coupling patterns. We conclude that optimizing trait-relevance of tasks during neuroscientific measurements presents a promising means to increase effect sizes in studies on brain-behavior associations.

">OfUSA: OpenfUS Analyzer, a versatile open-source framework for the analysis and visualization of functional ultrasound imaging data across animal models</a></h4>

              
                Functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging is rapidly gaining interest for its unprecedented ability to study large-scale brain dynamics, yet its adoption and broader dissemination have been hindered by the lack of standardized tools and methodologies to analyze and interpret its rich datasets. We present OpenfUS Analyzer (OfUSA), a companion software suite designed to help researchers quickly engage with fUS data and perform the full range of analyses needed to generate publication-ready results and figures without relying on additional software. OfUSA offers a versatile and modular architecture including preprocessing, recording quality assessment, signal dynamics exploration, statistical analysis and visualization. These functions are separated yet easily combined into analytic pipelines through a programming-free graphical interface. The framework can be applied across species and experimental contexts, either by registering data to anatomical atlases, as shown here for the mouse brain, or by analyzing data without atlas constraints, as illustrated in a primate dataset. This flexibility, together with its comprehensive functionality, makes OfUSA a practical solution for standardized and reproducible analysis of fUS data in both preclinical and translational research. Using OfUSA, we demonstrate the capacity to detect stimulus-evoked responses with high sensitivity, identify their spatial localization within brain networks, and quantify both their extent and temporal dynamics. These results highlight the software's ability to capture robust activation patterns and provide detailed insights into brain function, thereby accelerating the use of fUS as a powerful tool for systems neuroscience.

">Comparative distribution of the hypothalamic neurons activated during Wakefulness and Paradoxical (REM) sleep using TRAP2-red mice: contribution of Orexin, MCH, Lhx6 and a new marker Meis2</a></h4>

              
                Study objectives: Paradoxical sleep (PS) is a state involving numerous hypothalamic neuronal subpopulations, many remaining neurochemically uncharacterized. Our goal was to compare hypothalamic neurons active during Wakefulness or PS rebound (PSR) and explore their potential overlap, with a focus on melanin-concentrating-hormone (MCH), Orexin (Orx), Lhx6 and a new contingent of Meis2-expressing neurons. Method: In the same TRAP2-red mouse, neurons activated during Wakefulness (4h) and PSR (2h) express TdTomato and c-Fos, respectively. Double-labelling and triple immunofluorescence with neurochemical markers were performed to characterize and quantify cell populations in hypothalamic structures. Results: Twelve hypothalamic structures showed distinct activation patterns. The anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), zona incerta (ZI) and tuberal nucleus contained more activated neurons during PSR than Wakefulness, whereas the paraventricular hypothalamic (PVN) and supraoptic (SO) nuclei were predominantly activated during Wakefulness. MCH and Lhx6 neurons were mainly recruited during PSR, whereas Orx neurons were activated during both. A ventral subpopulation of MCH neurons showed higher activation during PSR than the dorsal subpopulation. Additionally, ~30% of the c-Fos+ neurons in ZI and AHA express Meis2. A similar proportion of TdTomato+ neurons positive for Meis2 were encountered in PVN and SO. Overall, ~20% of all hypothalamic neurons activated during PSR are now neurochemically identified. Conclusion: Our study identifies new neuronal populations activated during PSR in AHA and tuberal nucleus. We further get evidence that Meis2 delineates novel neuronal populations activated during PSR. In summary, our results using TRAP2-red mice characterize new cell populations activated during Wakefulness or PSR, opening experimental paths for determining their function regarding vigilance states.

">Distinct perceptual and conceptual representations of natural actions along the lateral and dorsal visual streams: an EEG-fMRI fusion study</a></h4>

              
                Actions are the building blocks of our dynamic visual world, yet the neural computations supporting action perception are not well understood. How does perceptual and conceptual information unfold in the brain when we observe what others are doing? We collected EEG and fMRI data while participants viewed short videos and sentences depicting naturalistic actions. Using representational similarity analysis, we found a posterior-to-anterior gradient along the lateral pathway, from perceptual features to conceptual, modality-invariant representations. Among conceptual features, the target of actions (i.e. whether the action was directed at an object, a person, or the self) explained the most unique variance in EEG responses. In fMRI, we found distinct conceptual representations along the ventral, dorsal, and lateral pathways, with the target of actions specifically encoded in lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Finally, EEG-fMRI fusion revealed rapid processing along the lateral and dorsal pathways. Together, our results disentangle the perceptual and conceptual components of action understanding and characterize the underlying spatiotemporal dynamics in the human brain.

">Fusogen-induced recovery of spinal cord function andmorphology after complete transection</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spinal cord injury is a critical issue in neurosurgery, lacking established clinical methods for functional restoration. This study reports the effects of a fusogen sealant, composed of polyethylene glycol and chitosan, in an experimental model of complete spinal cord transection in pigs. Objective: To evaluate the functional and morphological recovery of the spinal cord in an animal model of complete transection following treatment with a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate.Materials and methods: Hungarian Mangalica pigs (m = 20.0 {+/-} 2.0 kg, N = 5) underwent complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord, followed by an extended laminectomy and transpedicular fixation. In the experimental group (N = 3), a synthesized gel based on a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate was applied to the spinal gap; the other group (N = 2) served as a control. The postoperative period lasted 60 days and included multi-component rehabilitation. Clinical-functional status was assessed using established neurological scales. In vivo retrograde tracing of the spinal cord was performed using hydroxystilbamidine (FluoroGold). Following the experiment, immunofluorescent histology was conducted using primary antibodies to neurofilament (NF-200), a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody, and the nuclear dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The resulting morphology was examined via fluorescence and light microscopy. Results: Control animals maintained lower paraplegia, anesthesia, and pelvic dysfunction throughout the experiment. In contrast, the experimental group showed positive changes, including the return of sensation from day two. By the end of the study, all animals in this group could assume an upright posture and ambulate on all limbs. These outcomes were statistically significant. Microscopy revealed axons traversing the injury site in the experimental group, whereas control samples showed degenerative post-traumatic changes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a fusogen sealant based on a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate promotes significant morphofunctional recovery after complete spinal cord transection, supporting its therapeutic potential. Keywords: spinal cord injury, polyethylene glycol, PEG, chitosan, PEG-chitosan, Neuro-PEG, fusogens, fusogen sealants.
