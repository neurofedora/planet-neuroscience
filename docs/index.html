              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21554">Finding Similar Objects and Active Inference for Surprise in Numenta Neocortex Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jeff Hawkins and his colleagues in Numenta have proposed the thousand-brains system. This is a model of the structure and operation of the neocortex and is under investigation as a new form of artificial intelligence. In their study, learning and inference algorithms running on the system are proposed, where the prediction is an important function. The author believes that one of the most important capabilities of the neocortex in addition to prediction is the ability to make association, that is, to find the relationships between objects. Similarity is an important example of such relationships. In our study, algorithms that run on the thousand-brains system to find similarities are proposed. Although the setting for these algorithms is restricted, the author believes that the case it covers is fundamental. Karl Friston and his colleagues have studied the free-energy principle that explains how the brain actively infers the cause of a Shannon surprise. In our study, an algorithm is proposed for the thousand-brains system to make this inference. The problem of inferring what is being observed from the sensory data is a type of inverse problem, and the inference algorithms of the thousand-brains system and free-energy principle solve this problem in a Bayesian manner. Our inference algorithms can also be interpreted as Bayesian or non-Bayesian updating processes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21738">The Spatiotemporal Organization of Motor Cortex Activity Supporting Manual Dexterity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor cortex (M1) is a crucial brain area for controlling voluntary movements, such as reaching and grasping for a cup of coffee. M1 is organized in a somatotopic manner, such that M1 output driving movement to different parts of the body is organized along the cortical surface. In primates, the arm and hand are represented in M1 as separate but overlapping territories. Unit activity recorded from the M1 forelimb representation comodulates with parameters related to reaching and/or grasping. The overall aim of this dissertation is to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of M1 activity that produces reach-to-grasp movements. To address this goal, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is delivered along the precentral gyrus of two macaque monkeys to define the M1 motor map. Subsequently, cortical activity is recorded from the M1 forelimb representation using intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) while macaques execute an instructed reach-to-grasp task. Results from imaging experiments produce spatial maps that define cortical territories with increased activity during reach-to-grasp movements. Next, unit activity was recorded from the M1 forelimb representation with a laminar multielectrode while macaques completed the same reach-to-grasp task. Recording site locations differed between sessions to comprehensively sample unit responses throughout the M1 forelimb representation. Imaging experiments reveal that activity supporting reach-to-grasp movements was concentrated in patches that comprise less than half of the M1 forelimb representation. Electrophysiology recordings reveal that activity related to reaching is spatially organized within M1 distinctly from activity related to grasping. The results support the idea that spatial organizing principles are inherent in M1 activity that supports reach-to-grasp movements.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21781">Recency effect disappears when information is integrated from independent perceptual sources</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making often involves integrating discrete pieces of information from distinct sources over time, yet the cognitive mechanisms underlying this integration remain unclear. In this study, we examined how individuals accumulate and integrate discrete sensory evidence. Participants performed a task involving random dot motion stimuli presented in single- and double-pulse trials. These stimuli varied in motion coherence, source consistency of pulses (either the same or orthogonal directions), and temporal gaps between pulses. We found that participants effectively integrated information regardless of source type or temporal gaps. As expected, when both pulses originated from the same source, performance showed a sequence-dependent effect-accuracy was influenced by the order of pulse presentation. However, this effect disappeared when the pulses came from orthogonal sources. Confidence judgments were similarly unaffected by temporal gaps or pulse sequence but were higher when information originated from orthogonal sources. These findings highlight the specific role of perceptual independency on information integration and consequently, on decision-making.

                arXiv:2506.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans. Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined, including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in prenatal care.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17970">The Relationship between Cognition and Computation: "Global-first" Cognition versus Local-first Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What fundamental research questions are essential for advancing toward brain-inspired AI or AGI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can? We believe the key question today is the relationship between cognition and computation (RCC). For example, the widely discussed question "Will artificial intelligence replace the human mind?" is, in essence and in scientific terms, an issue concerning RCC.
  We have chosen to classify RCC into four categories: 1. The relationship between the primitives of cognition and the primitives of computation. 2. The relationship between the anatomical structure of neural representation of cognition and the computational architecture of artificial intelligence. 3. The relationship between emergents in cognition and emergents in computation. 4. The relationship between the mathematical foundations of cognition and computation.
  The cumulative empirical evidence and theoretical analyses led us to formulate the "Global-first" principle, which highlights the contrast between "Global-first" cognition and local-first computation in RCC, offering a specific and well-defined starting point for understanding RCC.

                arXiv:2506.21439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) patients experience pain fluctuations that significantly reduce their quality of life. Despite the vast knowledge of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) role in PD, the STN biomarkers for pain fluctuations and the relationship between bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) activities and pain occurrence are still less understood. This observational study used data-driven methods by collecting annotated pain followed by a series of corresponding binary pain ratings and wirelessly transmitted STN signals, then leveraging the explainable machine learning algorithm to predict binary pain levels and sort the feature influence. The binary pain levels could be predicted among annotated pain reports corresponding to PD-related pain characteristics. The STN activity from both sides could impact pain prediction, with gamma and beta bands in the contralateral STN and delta and theta bands in the ipsilateral STN showing a prominent role. This study emphasizes the role of bilateral STN biomarkers on endogenous pain fluctuations.

                arXiv:2506.21915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a simple and effective variation of genetic algorithm (GA) for solving RCPSP, denoted as 2-Phase Genetic Algorithm (2PGA). The 2PGA implements GA parent selection in two phases: Phase-1 includes the best current solutions in the parent pool, and Phase-2 excludes the best current solutions from the parent pool. The 2PGA carries out the GA evolution by alternating the two phases iteratively. In exploring a solution space, the Phase-1 emphasizes intensification in current neighborhood, while the Phase-2 emphasizes diversification to escape local traps. The 2PGA was tested on the standard benchmark problems in PSPLIB, the results have shown that the algorithm is effective and has improved some of the best heuristic solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22122">In situ fine-tuning of in silico trained Optical Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) promise significant advantages over traditional electronic neural networks, including ultrafast computation, high bandwidth, and low energy consumption, by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of photonics. However, training ONNs poses unique challenges, notably the reliance on simplified in silico models whose trained parameters must subsequently be mapped to physical hardware. This process often introduces inaccuracies due to discrepancies between the idealized digital model and the physical ONN implementation, particularly stemming from noise and fabrication imperfections.
  In this paper, we analyze how noise misspecification during in silico training impacts ONN performance and we introduce Gradient-Informed Fine-Tuning (GIFT), a lightweight algorithm designed to mitigate this performance degradation. GIFT uses gradient information derived from the noise structure of the ONN to adapt pretrained parameters directly in situ, without requiring expensive retraining or complex experimental setups. GIFT comes with formal conditions under which it improves ONN performance.
  We also demonstrate the effectiveness of GIFT via simulation on a five-layer feed forward ONN trained on the MNIST digit classification task. GIFT achieves up to $28\%$ relative accuracy improvement compared to the baseline performance under noise misspecification, without resorting to costly retraining. Overall, GIFT provides a practical solution for bridging the gap between simplified digital models and real-world ONN implementations.

                arXiv:2506.21771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs' parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a vision-based video game called DOOM.

">Switches in Orientation Coding by Mouse Primary Visual Cortex Neurons Depend on Stimulus Predictability.</a></h4>

              
                How the brain processes a stimulus depends on contextual factors, such as whether it is predictable or surprising. While this process has been partially characterized using EEG and fMRI, and invasive cellular approaches, the microcircuit mechanisms responsible for comparing sensory input and expectations remain poorly understood. Here, we combined layer-resolved recordings of single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFP) in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) with a visual oddball paradigm using oriented gratings. Both event-related potentials and firing rates exhibited distinct temporal components across cortical layers and trial types. We identified robust stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), mismatch negativity (MMN), and deviant detection (DD) contrast at both early and late epochs. Surprisingly, a substantial subset of excitatory neurons exhibited complete reversals of orientation preference ('preference switches') between standard and deviant trials, rather than only changes in selectivity. These preference-switching cells were primarily observed in layers 2/3 and 5/6 and contributed as much information to stimulus decoding as stably tuned neurons. Our findings demonstrate that context-dependent flexibility in feature preference is an integral part of predictive coding in V1 and challenge the notion of fixed stimulus representations at the single-neuron level.

">Intrinsic mechanisms contributing to the biophysical signature of mouse gamma motoneurons</a></h4>

              
                Precise motor control relies on continuous sensory feedback from muscles, a process in which gamma motoneurons play a key role. These specialized spinal neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibres, modulating their sensitivity to stretch and maintaining proprioceptive signalling during movement. Gamma motoneurons are characterized by a distinct biophysical profile, including low recruitment thresholds and high firing rates that enable rapid activation of intrafusal fibres at contraction onset. Despite their importance, the intrinsic mechanisms that underlie these properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we analysed published and unpublished data to identify a population of low-threshold, high-gain motoneurons with features consistent with gamma motoneurons, emerging during the third postnatal week in mice. Their low recruitment threshold was linked to lower membrane capacitance, higher input resistance, a more hyperpolarized activation of persistent inward currents (PICs), and a narrower axon initial segment. In contrast, higher firing rates were associated not with PIC amplitude but with shorter action potential durations and smaller medium afterhyperpolarizations. Notably, 92% of putative gamma motoneurons exhibited a sodium pump-mediated ultra-slow afterhyperpolarization (usAHP), which was absent in slow alpha motoneurons. This difference could not be attributed to h-current activity or expression of the alpha 3 subunit of the sodium-potassium ATPase. These findings reveal key intrinsic properties that support the unique excitability of gamma motoneurons, offering new insight into their contribution to motor control. This work provides a foundation for future studies into their development, regulation, and involvement in neuromuscular disorders.

">Spatial Reorganization of Object Representations in High-Level Visual Cortex Distinguishes Working Memory from Perception</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system balances veridical object visual perception with flexible object visual working memory (VWM), both relying on high-level visual regions. However, how these competing demands shape spatial representations remains unclear. Here, we ask whether VWM inherits the spatial constraints observed in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) during perception, or instead reorganizes these representations to meet mnemonic demands. Using matched bilateral presentation paradigms and fMRI-based decoding, we systematically compared spatial representations during perception and VWM. This approach revealed a striking dissociation: during perception, object information is largely confined to the contralateral LOC, whereas during VWM, robust ipsilateral representations emerge--even when both hemifields must be remembered. Vertex-ablation analyses revealed that VWM engages 70-90% of ipsilateral LOC territories, far exceeding those recruited during unilateral perception. Neither increased attentional span nor top-down feedback from association areas fully explained this expansion; rather, ipsilateral LOC patterns closely mirrored contralateral sensory representations, implicating interhemispheric coordination in VWM. Together, these findings demonstrate that object VWM flexibly recruits distributed high-level visual cortex, with spatial reorganization distinguishing mnemonic flexibility from perceptual fidelity.

">IP3-mediated Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria stimulates ATP synthesis in primary hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                During electrical activity, Ca2+ enhances mitochondrial ATP production, helping to replenish the energy consumed during this process. Most Ca2+ enters the cell via ligand- or voltage-gated channels on the neuronal membrane, where it stimulates the release of additional Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although the influence of cytosolic Ca2+ on neuronal metabolism has been widely investigated, relatively few studies have explored the contribution of ER Ca2+ release in this context. Therefore, we investigated how activity-driven Ca2+ crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria influences the regulation of mitochondrial ATP production. We show that in primary hippocampal neurons derived from rat pups of either sex, depletion of ER Ca2+ led to a reduction in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels during both resting and stimulated states, while exerting only a minimal impact on cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Additionally, impaired ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer led to a reduction in mitochondrial ATP production. Similar effects were observed when inositol-3-phosphate receptors (IP3Rs), but not ryanodine receptors (RyRs), were pharmacologically inhibited. Together, our findings show that, in hippocampal neurons, Ca2+ is transferred from the ER to mitochondria through IP3 receptors, and this Ca2+ crosstalk in turn enhances mitochondrial ATP production in response to neuronal activity.

">Early postnatal CA3 hyperexcitability drives hippocampal development and epileptogenesis in SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies caused by pathogenic variants in SCN2A (SCN2A-DEE), encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, present with early-life seizures, developmental delay, and increased mortality. Using a novel Scn2a p.A263V gain-of-function (GOF) mouse model, we demonstrate gene-dose and background-dependent phenotypes ranging from self-limited neonatal seizures to chronic epilepsy with high mortality. In vivo electrophysiology revealed hippocampal seizures as early as postnatal day 2.5, with CA3-driven gamma oscillations preceding seizure onset. CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibited transient hyperexcitability during early postnatal development, resolving by P24-30. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered gene dose-dependent accelerated maturation of hippocampal networks, peaking at P7, alongside widespread transcriptional changes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In adulthood, persistent hippocampal network alterations emerged, marked by reduced mid-gamma oscillations and theta-gamma coupling. Our findings establish hippocampal CA3 hyperexcitability as an early driver of epileptogenesis in SCN2A-DEE and highlight it as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate disease progression.

">Interleaved Replay of Novel and Familiar Memory Traces During Slow-Wave Sleep Prevents Catastrophic Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals can learn continuously, acquiring new knowledge and integrating it into a pool of lifelong memories. Memory replay during sleep has been proposed as a powerful mechanism contributing to interference-free new learning. In contrast, artificial neural networks suffer from a problem called catastrophic forgetting, where new training damages existing memories. This issue can be mitigated by interleaving training on new tasks with past data; however, whether the brain employs this strategy remains unknown. In this work, we show that slow-wave sleep (SWS) employs an interleaved replay of familiar cortical and novel hippocampal memory traces within individual Up states of the slow oscillation (SO), allowing new memories to be embedded into the existing pool of cortical memories without interference. Using a combination of biophysical modeling and analyses of single-unit activity from the mouse retrosplenial cortex - for a mouse trained first in a highly familiar environment and then in a novel one - we found that hippocampal ripples arriving near the Down-to-Up or Up-to-Down transitions of the sleep SO can entrain novel memory replay, while the middle phase of the Up state tends to replay familiar cortical memories. This strategy ensures the consolidation of novel cortical memory traces into long-term storage while minimizing damage to familiar ones. This study presents a novel framework for how replay of familiar and novel memory traces is organized during SWS to enable continual learning.

">Altered Brain Energy Metabolism in the APPPS1 Alzheimer's Model during anesthesia: Integration of Experimental Data and In Silico Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Background: Synaptic transmission and network activity rely on high ATP turnover. Impairments in cerebral energy metabolism are increasingly recognized as central in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Elderly patients and patients with AD are also at elevated risk for perioperative neurological complications, including post-operative delirium and further cognitive deterioration. However, the interaction between metabolic vulnerability and anesthetic exposure remains incompletely understood. Methods: We investigated cortical metabolic responses and potassium homeostasis in acute brain slices from wild-type (WT) and AD-like APPPS1 transgenic mice, which were either exposed to isoflurane or left untreated. Glia cells were assessed by staining microglia and astrocytes. Measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), extracellular potassium dynamics, and proteomic profiling were integrated with computational modeling to assess oxidative metabolism and anesthetic effects under different conditions. Results: APPPS1 mice exhibited reduced CMRO2 and attenuated neuronal activity compared to age-matched WT controls, showing sex-specific differences. Proteomic analysis revealed the downregulation of key mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes, indicating an impaired ATP-generating capacity. Exposure to isoflurane further suppressed CMRO2, with a more pronounced effect in the APPPS1 brain tissue, while glia cells exhibited no acute changes. Additionally, isoflurane exacerbated deficits in extracellular potassium ([K]) clearance, highlighting impaired ion homeostasis under anesthetic challenge. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that AD-like pathology in APPPS1 mice is associated with a significant decline in oxidative metabolism and ATP availability. These deficits are exacerbated by anesthetic exposure, contributing to impaired potassium regulation. This suggests that diminished metabolic flexibility may underlie increased anesthetic vulnerability and postoperative complications in AD.

">Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics Modulate TRPV1 Channel Activation via Tissue Entropy Production</a></h4>

              
                Inflammatory processes involve complex interactions between molecular signaling and biophysical mechanisms, yet the thermodynamic consequences of such processes remain underexplored. Here, we present a theoretical multiscale model that demonstrates how elevated entropy production in inflamed tissue environments modulates the activation threshold of TRPV1 thermosensitive ion channels. Our framework integrates axonal electrophysiology based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, thermodynamic heat transfer with explicit entropy generation, and a dynamic model of TRPV1 channel gating. Simulations reveal that increased entropy production leads to a downward shift in the activation temperature of TRPV1 channels, driven by cumulative non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects. This result provides a mechanistic explanation for the enhanced excitability of sensory axons in inflamed tissue and highlights entropy production as a fundamental physical variable influencing ion channel behavior. The study contributes a novel perspective on the coupling between thermodynamics and sensory transduction at the cellular level.

">Forgetting in Drosophila consists of an increase in uncertainty rather than a stochastic loss of memory</a></h4>

              
                While forgetting has been studied extensively in various organisms, its precise nature has often been unclear. Here, we used behavioral experiments in Drosophila to determine that a significant aspect of forgetting consists of a decrease in the ability of a memory to induce an appropriate behavior. We tested flies for memory retention at various times after training and then separately retested both flies that chose correctly and those that chose incorrectly. Although the ability to choose correctly decreased over time, we could not measure any differences in memory between flies that initially chose correctly and those that chose incorrectly upon retest. This suggests that forgetting is unlikely to consist of a spontaneous loss of a memory but instead consists of a decrease in the probability of flies that remember choosing the correct behavioral response. Thus, although flies maintain memory over time, there is an increase in uncertainty associated with this memory. We find that forgetting of long-term memories and accelerated forgetting in old flies occur in a similar manner.

">TRPML3 regulates neuronal gene expression in an in vitro model of autophagy and may act as a genetic marker of familial neurodegenerative disorders</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a conserved pro-survival pathway for delivering misfolded proteins and damaged organelles to lysosomes for degradation and protein homeostasis. Anomaly in autophagy leads to aberrant protein aggregation in neuronal cells, which is a common etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Endo-lysosomal cation channel TRPML3 (Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin-3) has been shown to induce autophagy in cell line models. However, the mechanism of TRPML3 mediated autophagy induction and the underlying gene expression changes are not clearly understood. Here, by using Ca2+- and electrical-current measurements, RNA sequencing and RT PCR studies, we explored the cellular function of TRPML3 and the global transcriptomic profile in a cell-based serum starvation model of autophagy. We report that serum starvation leads to downregulation of neuronal developmental genes during autophagy induction. TRPML3 overexpression further amplifies the effect of starvation in downregulating neuronal gene expression. But, when nutrition is not a limiting condition, TRPML3 overexpression upregulated neuronal genes including those responsible for axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and dendritic arborization. TRPML3 mediated neuronal gene expression changes were, presumably, due to transcription factors (TF) TFEB, FOXO1 and neuron-specific TFs such as SOX2, and ETV5. To further validate the role of TRPML3 in neuronal gene regulation, we performed meta-analysis of publicly available RNAseq datasets on neurodegenerative disorders which provided insight into the heterogeneity in the molecular mechanisms of autophagy and corroborated the TFEB-mediated autophagy induction and neuronal gene expression in TRPML3 overexpression condition. Based on our results, we propose that TRPML3 may act as a potential genetic marker for familial neurodegenerative disorders.

">The Vomeronasal System of Talpa occidentalis: A Combined Histological, Immunohistochemical, and Lectin-Binding Approach</a></h4>

              
                The vomeronasal system (VNS) is critical for detecting pheromonal cues that modulate sociosexual behaviors. Despite its central role in chemical communication, our understanding of its anatomical and functional variability across mammals remains incomplete. This study provides the first detailed characterization of the VNS in the Iberian mole (Talpa occidentalis), a fossorial species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We performed a morphofunctional and neurochemical analysis of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) using histology, immunohistochemistry, and lectin histochemistry. The VNO in T. occidentalis exhibited an unusual circular lumen lined by a uniform sensory epithelium, lacking the dual epithelial organization seen in most species. The vomeronasal cartilage was limited in extent and did not form the typical J-shaped structure. Importantly, no evidence of a vomeronasal pump was found, suggesting alternative mechanisms for semiochemical entry, likely facilitated by the anatomical position of the organ and continuous receptor distribution. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong expression of Gai2 and Gg8 in sensory neurons, with weaker Ga0 expression, suggesting predominance of V1R-type signal transduction. The AOB, though small, exhibited clear lamination and specific marker localization (Gai2, OMP, CR, MAP2), indicating robust functional organization. Lectin binding revealed specific glycosylation patterns in the glomerular layer, with STL and LEA marking synaptic regions. These findings uncover unprecedented anatomical and molecular features in the VNS of T. occidentalis, positioning this species as a valuable model for studying vomeronasal diversity and evolution among Laurasiatherian mammals.

">Identification of Small Molecule Dimethyoxyphenyl Piperazine Inhibitors of Alpha-Synuclein Fibril Growth</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (asyn) fibril accumulation is the defining feature of Parkinson disease and is a target for disease-modifying treatments. One therapeutic strategy to reduce fibril accumulation is inhibition of asyn fibril growth. We developed a sensitive fluorescence-based fibril growth assay to screen for small molecule inhibitors. After validating the inhibition assay using a previously identified inhibitor, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, we identified compound 1 as a lead for inhibition of fibril growth. We analysed structure-activity relationships with analogs of 1 to optimize inhibition potency. Our results identified two dimethoxyphenyl piperazine analogs with more potent inhibition of in-vitro assembled fibrils. These analogs also inhibited the growth of asyn fibrils amplified from Lewy Body Disease brain tissue, further validating the inhibitor screening assay. Molecular docking studies indicate that these compounds can bind to the fibril ends, suggesting a potential capping mechanism through which these compounds inhibit the sequential association of monomeric asyn required for fibril growth.

">Identifying out-of-voxel echoes in edited MRS with phase cycle inversion</a></h4>

              
                Purpose To identify the origin of out-of-voxel (OOV) signals based on the coherence transfer pathway (CTP) formalism using signal phase conferred by the acquisition phase cycling scheme. Knowing the CTP driving OOV artifacts enables optimization of crusher gradients to improve their suppression without additional data acquisition. Theory and Methods A phase cycle systematically changes the phase of RF pulses across the transients of an experiment, encoding phase shifts into the data that can be used to suppress unwanted CTPs. We present a new approach, phase cycle inversion (PCI), which removes the receiver phase originally applied to the stored transients, replacing it with new receiver phases, matching the phase evolutions associated with each unwanted CTP, to identify the OOV signals. We demonstrated the efficacy of PCI using the MEGA-edited PRESS sequence in simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. Based on these findings, the crusher gradient scheme was optimized. Results The simulation results demonstrated that PCI can fully separate signals originating from different CTPs using a complete phase cycling scheme. PCI effectively identified the CTP responsible for OOV signals in phantom experiments and in vivo, though with reduced specificity in vivo due to phase instabilities. Re-optimization of the gradient scheme based on the identified OOV-associated CTP to suppress these signals, resulted in cleaner spectra in six volunteers. Conclusion PCI can be broadly applied across pulse sequences and voxel locations, making it a flexible and generalizable approach for diagnosing the CTP origin of OOV signals.

">Stretching of the insect mechanoreceptor evokes mechano-electrical transduction in auditory chordotonal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Insect proprioception, vibration and sound detection rely on the scolopidium--a mechanosensory unit enclosing the sensory cilium of chordotonal organ neurons. The cilium contains mechanosensitive ion channels, and is enclosed by a scolopale cell with its tip embedded in a cap. Despite knowledge of the scolopidium's structure in multiple insects, the mechanism by which mechanical force elicits the transduction current remains speculative. We examined scolopidia in the auditory Muller's organ of the desert locust and present a comprehensive three-dimensional ultrastructure of a scolopidium using Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM). Next, we characterised sound-evoked motions of Muller's organ and the scolopidium using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and high-speed light microscopy. We further measured transduction currents via patch clamp electrophysiology during mechanical stimulation of individual scolopidia. By combining ultrastructure, sound-evoked motions, and transduction current recordings, our finding suggests that the scolopidium is activated best by stretch along the ciliary axis.

">Triceps Surae Muscle Ia Proprioceptive Weighting During Quiet Stance with Vision Occlusion</a></h4>

              
                Visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and cutaneous sensory information is important for posture control during quiet stance. When the reliability of one source of sensory information used to detect self-motion for posture control is reduced, there may be a reweighting of inputs within and/or across the remaining sensory systems determining self-motion for postural control. Muscle vibration, which creates an illusion of muscle stretch and a compensatory movement to shorten the vibrated muscle, may be used to determine the weighting of muscle spindle Ia proprioception for posture control. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vision occlusion on triceps surae muscle Ia proprioceptive weighting for postural control during quiet stance, utilizing 80 Hz muscle vibration and a quantitative measure of the bodys anterior to posterior ground center of pressure response to triceps surae muscle vibration in freely standing subjects. Subjects (N = 41; mean(standard deviation), 19.6(2.0) years) were examined as they stood with eyes open or eyes closed. Ground center of pressure was measured during quiet standing with, and without, bilateral vibration of the triceps surae muscles. The mean backward center of pressure shift induced by triceps surae vibration was significantly greater during the eyes closed condition compared to eyes open (eyes closed: -4.93(1.62) centimeters; eyes open: -3.21(1.33) centimeters; p = 6.85E-10; Cohens d = 1.29). Thirty-seven subjects increased, and two subjects decreased, their vibration induced center of pressure backward shift in the eyes closed condition compared to eyes open, although the magnitude of the change varied. Results support the idea that for most subjects, during an eyes closed stance there is an increased triceps surae muscle Ia proprioceptive weighting for postural control, due to the need for posture control to depend more on non-visual feedback.

">Prior knowledge influences the neural mechanisms supporting memory-based inference</a></h4>

              
                Memory-based inference allows individuals to integrate information acquired across separate episodes to support novel decisions and reasoning. Although prior knowledge, such as schemas, is known to influence learning and memory, its impact on the neural mechanisms underlying inference remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how schema congruency affects the encoding and retrieval of overlapping events and how these processes contribute to memory-based inference. Thirty-nine participants encoded AB associations, consisting of picture-word pairs presented on either schema-congruent or schema-incongruent backgrounds. These were followed by BC associations involving the same word paired with a new picture on a neutral background. At test, participants were asked to infer the indirect AC association. While overall inference accuracy did not differ as a function of schema congruency, behavioral and neural data revealed distinct mechanisms. Inference for schema-incongruent events depended on accurate retrieval of both AB and BC associations, whereas schema-congruent inferences did not. To investigate the neural processes involved, we trained hierarchical multivariate pattern classifiers on EEG data to detect schema and context reinstatement during task performance. For schema-congruent events, successful inference was predicted by schema reinstatement during BC encoding, consistent with integrating overlapping information into a unified memory trace. In contrast, successful inference for schema-incongruent events was predicted by context reinstatement during AC retrieval, reflecting a reliance on flexible recombination of separate memory representations. These findings demonstrate that schema congruency modulates the neural basis of memory-based inference. Congruent events are integrated during encoding, whereas incongruent events rely on retrieval-based inference. Keywords: memory integration, schema, congruency, context, MVPA, EEG

">Heterogeneity and variability in short term synaptic plasticity and implications for signal transformation</a></h4>

              
                There are many sources of heterogeneity in the CA1 network, including plasticity, connectivity and cell properties, yet the extent and functional consequences of this diversity remains poorly understood. We used patterned optogenetic stimulation of CA3 pyramidal neurons and whole-cell patch clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, to characterize the contributions of different forms of heterogeneity to information flow. We found pronounced heterogeneity in synaptic responses and short-term plasticity (STP), influenced by the neurotransmitter identity, input pattern, and size of the activated presynaptic ensemble. Inhibitory synapses exhibited greater diversity in both response variability and depression profiles than excitatory synapses. We incorporated these readings in a molecule-to-network multiscale model of the CA3->CA1 circuit. The reference model shows strong decorrelation of autocorrelated input, but removal of STP makes the decorrelation frequency dependent. Removal of stochasticity and heterogeneity in connections makes the output periodic. Thus heterogeneity, short-term plasticity, and stochasticity each have distinct effects on cellular information transmission.

">Inhibition of nonsense-mediated decay in TDP-43 deficient neurons reveals novel cryptic exons</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is an essential splicing repressor whose loss of function underlies the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD). Nuclear clearance of TDP-43 disrupts its function and leads to the inclusion of aberrant cryptic exons. These cryptic exons frequently introduce premature termination codons resulting in the degradation of affected transcripts through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Conventional RNA sequencing approaches thus may fail to detect cryptic exons that are efficiently degraded by NMD, precluding identification of potential therapeutic targets. We generated a comprehensive set of neuronal targets of TDP-43 in human iPSC-derived i3Neurons (i3N) by combining TDP-43 knockdown with inhibition of multiple factors essential for NMD, revealing novel cryptic targets. We then restored expression of selected NMD targets in TDP-43 deficient i3Ns and determined which genes improved neuronal viability. Our findings highlight the role of NMD in masking cryptic splicing events and identify novel potential therapeutic targets for TDP-43-related neurodegenerative disorders.

                A role for the trafficking receptor SORLA in reducing A{beta} levels has been well-established, however, relatively little is known with respect to whether and how SORLA can potentially affect tau pathology in vivo. Here, we show that transgenic SORLA upregulation (SORLA TG) can reverse pathological effects in aged PS19 (P301S tau) mouse brain, including tau phosphorylation and seeding, ventricle dilation, synapse loss, LTP impairment and glial hyperactivation. Proteomic analysis indicates reversion of PS19 profiles in PS19/SORLA TG hippocampus, including pathological changes in synapse-related proteins as well as key drivers of synaptic dysfunction such as Apoe and C1q. snRNA-seq analysis reveals suppression of PS19- signatures with SORLA upregulation, including proinflammatory induction of Plxnb1/Plxnb2 in glia. Tau seeding and aggregation, neuroinflammation, as well as PlxnB1/B2 induction are exacerbated in PS19 hippocampus with SORLA deletion. These results implicate a global role for SORLA in neuroprotection from tau toxicity in PS19 mouse brain.

">A systematic protocol to identify 'clinical controls' for pediatric neuroimaging research from clinically acquired brain MRIs</a></h4>

              
                Progress at the intersection of artificial intelligence and pediatric neuroimaging necessitates large, heterogeneous datasets to generate robust and generalizable models. Retrospective analysis of clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans offers a promising avenue to augment prospective research datasets, leveraging the extensive repositories of scans routinely acquired by hospital systems in the course of clinical care. Here, we present a systematic protocol for identifying scans with limited imaging pathology through machine-assisted manual review of radiology reports. The protocol employs a standardized grading scheme developed with expert neuroradiologists and implemented by non-clinician graders. Categorizing scans based on the presence or absence of significant pathology and image quality concerns, facilitates the repurposing of clinical brain MRI data for brain research. Such an approach has the potential to harness vast clinical imaging archives exemplified by over 250,000 brain MRIs at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia to address demographic biases in research participation, to increase sample size, and to improve replicability in neurodevelopmental imaging research. Ultimately, this protocol aims to enable scalable, reliable identification of clinical control brain MRIs, supporting large-scale, generalizable neuroimaging studies of typical brain development and neurogenetic conditions.

Here, we show that fasting and caloric restriction, two forms of dietary restriction, induce transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and 17{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family enzymes, promoting ADIOL biosynthesis. ADIOL, in turn, acts on the nervous system to reduce levels of kynurenic acid, a neuroactive metabolite linked to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This effect requires NHR-91, the C. elegans homolog of estrogen receptor {beta}, specifically in the RIM neuron, a key site of kynurenic acid production. Consistent with the known benefits of fasting and caloric restriction on healthspan, enhancing ADIOL signaling improves multiple healthspan indicators during aging. Conversely, animals deficient in ADIOL signaling exhibit reduced healthspan under normal conditions and in genetic models of caloric restriction, underscoring the functional significance of this pathway. Furthermore, ADIOL suppresses cellular stresses induced by the Alzheimer's-associated APOE4 variant, highlighting its potential as a neuroprotective agent. Notably, ADIOL does not significantly impact lifespan, indicating that its healthspan benefits are not simply a byproduct of lifespan extension. Together, these findings establish a physiological role for ADIOL in mediating the neuroprotective and pro-healthspan effects of fasting and caloric restriction and suggest that boosting ADIOL signaling may help narrow the gap between lifespan and healthspan. This positions ADIOL as a promising mimetic of dietary restriction effects on healthspan that could be used as a therapeutic strategy for age-related neurodegenerative conditions.

">The effects of gait speed on the responses to immediate and prolonged exposure to mediolateral optic flow perturbation in healthy young adults</a></h4>

              
                Background: Optic flow is vital for locomotor control and is often perturbed to study the impact of optic flow on balance control. However, it remains unclear whether gait speed influences responses to such perturbations. This study aims to examine the effects of gait speed on gait parameters following immediate and prolonged exposure to mediolateral optic flow perturbations. Methods: Twenty-one young adults (23.43 +/- 4.19 years) walked on an instrumented treadmill, including 3 phases: baseline (3 min), perturbation with mediolateral optic flow (8 min), and post-perturbation (3 min). Trials were conducted at 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 m/s. Ground reaction forces and 3D motion data were collected to calculate mediolateral margin of stability (MoS), mean step length (SL), step width (SW) and their variabilities. Three repeated-measures ANOVAs (Speed by Phase) were used to compare: baseline vs. early perturbation, early vs. late perturbation, and baseline vs. post-perturbation. Results: The responses to immediate and prolonged exposure to optic flow perturbation were speed dependent. Walking at slow speeds induced greater immediate responses in mediolateral gait parameters (SW and mediolateral MoS, both p < 0.001) compared to walking at faster speeds. During the perturbation phase, the adaptations were larger at faster vs. slower speeds for gait parameters in the direction of movement (SL, p = 0.007). Conclusion: Immediate responses and adaptations to mediolateral optic flow perturbations are speed-dependent and larger at slower gait speeds. The responses to prolonged perturbation are interpreted as step-to-step adaptations that may inform future interventions and studies on gait speed selection.

">Cortical dissociation of spatial reference frames during place navigation</a></h4>

              
                Animals rely on both sensory perception and memory when navigating relative to learned allocentric locations. Incoming sensory stimuli, which arrive from an egocentric perspective, must be integrated into an allocentric reference frame to allow neural computations that direct an animal toward a learned goal. This egocentric-allocentric spatial transformation has been proposed to involve projections from the rodent postrhinal cortex (POR), which receives strong visual input, to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which contains allocentric spatial cell types such as grid and border cells. A major step toward understanding this transformation is to identify how POR and MEC spatial representations differ during place navigation, which is currently unknown. To answer this question, we recorded single neurons from POR and MEC as rats engaged in a navigation task that required them to repeatedly visit a learned uncued allocentric location in an open field arena to receive a randomly scattered food reward. While neurons in both regions displayed strong tuning to the spatial structure of the environment, neither showed bias toward the goal location despite strongly biased behavior. Critically, when local visual landmarks were manipulated to place the visual scene in conflict with the learned location, POR neurons adjusted their tuning preferences to follow the visual landmarks, while MEC neurons remained in register with the true global reference frame. These findings reveal a strong dissociation between POR and MEC spatial reference frames during place navigation and raise questions regarding the mechanisms underlying integration of POR egocentric signals into the MEC allocentric spatial map.

">Motor Learning Outside the Body: Broad Skill Generalisation with an Extra Robotic Limb</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to transfer motor skills across tools and contexts is what makes modern technology usable. The success of motor augmentation devices, such as supernumerary robotic limbs, hinges on users' capacity for generalised motor performance. We trained participants over seven days to use an extra robotic thumb (Third Thumb, Dani Clode Design), worn on the right hand and controlled via the toes. We tested whether motor learning was confined to the specific tasks and body parts involved in controlling and interacting with the Third Thumb, or whether it could generalise beyond them. Participants showed broad skill generalisation across tasks, body postures, and even when either the Third Thumb or the controller was reassigned to a different body part, suggesting the development of abstract, body-independent motor representations. Training also reduced cognitive demands and increased the sense of agency over the device. However, participants still preferred using their biological hand over the Third Thumb when given the option, suggesting that factors beyond motor skill generalisation, cognitive effort, and embodiment must be addressed to support the real-world adoption of such technologies.

">Long-Term Effects of Adolescent 5F-MDMB-PICA Intravenous self-administration: Neurobehavioral Consequences and medial Prefrontal Cortex Dysfunction in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Synthetic Cannabinoids Receptor Agonists (SCRAs) are the largest group of new psychoactive substances monitored worldwide. 5F-MDMB-PICA is a recent SCRA classified as a potent full agonist at CB1/CB2 receptors able to activate the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission in adolescent but not in adult mice. Here, we have studied its reinforcing effects in adolescent mice and characterized the neurochemical and behavioral effects induced in the same animals in adulthood. Methods: We utilized an intravenous self-administration (IVSA) protocol in adolescent (PND 40-56) CD-1 male mice. In adulthood (PND 66-78), we conducted several behavioral and neurobiological assessments including: Sucrose Preference Test (SPT); Resident Intruder Test (RIT); Olfactory Reactivity Test (ORT); brain microdialysis to quantify DA levels in the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC); and fiber photometry analysis using the GCaMP calcium sensor to monitor excitatory neural dynamics in the mPFC after exposure to an aversive odorant. Results: We found that 5F-MDMB-PICA, administered through IVSA in adolescent mice, produced an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. The dose of 2.5 g/kg/25ul elicited behavior consistent with drug seeking. Adult mice exposed to 5F-MDMB-PICA during adolescence exhibited significant behavioral and neurochemical changes in adulthood compared to control mice. These behaviors included increased aggression, reduced social interaction, an anhedonic state, and an abolishment of mPFC DA response to an aversive odorant, as measured by in vivo brain microdialysis. Moreover, fiber photometry analysis of excitatory neuronal activity in the mPFC showed diminished calcium activity in response to the same aversive odorant in 5F-MDMB-PICA-exposed mice compared to controls. Conclusions: Notably, this study is the first to demonstrate that adolescent mice can acquire and sustain IVSA of 5F-MDMB-PICA. Furthermore, it highlights the long-term behavioral and neurochemical changes associated with adolescent exposure to 5F-MDMB-PICA, underscoring the potential detrimental effects of its use during this critical developmental period.

">Simultaneous recording of spikes and calcium signals in odor-evoked responses of Drosophila antennal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Most insects, including agricultural pests and disease vectors, rely on olfaction for key innate behaviors. Consequently, there is growing interest in studying insect olfaction to gain insights into odor-driven behavior and to support efforts in vector control. Calcium imaging using GCaMP fluorescence is widely used to identify olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) responsive to ethologically relevant odors. However, accurate interpretation of GCaMP signals in the antenna requires understanding both response uniformity within an ORN population and how calcium signals relate to spike activity. To address this, we optimized a dual-modality recording method combining single-sensillum electrophysiology and widefield imaging for Drosophila ORNs. Calcium imaging showed that homotypic ab2A neurons exhibit similar odor sensitivity, consistent with spike recordings, indicating that a single ORN's response can reliably represent its homotypic counterparts. Furthermore, concurrent dual recordings revealed that peak calcium responses are linearly correlated with spike activity, regardless of imaging site (soma or dendrites), GCaMP variant, odorant, or fly age. These findings validate the use of somatic calcium signals as a reliable proxy for spike activity in fly ORNs and provide a foundation for future large-scale surveys of spike vs. calcium response relationships across diverse ORN types.

">Photothrombotic Ischemic Thalamic Stroke in Mice Recapitulates Spontaneous Pain Features of Central Post-Stroke Pain in Humans</a></h4>

              
                Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a highly distressing condition that develops in 50% of people who suffer a thalamic stroke, and is typically unresponsive to current clinical treatments. Hypoxic damage to the ventral posterolateral (VPL) and ventral posteromedial (VPM) sensory thalamic nuclei, in particular, precipitates CPSP. One barrier to developing treatments for CPSP is the lack of preclinical models of thalamic ischemic stroke. In this study, we present a novel mouse model of CPSP induced through targeted photothrombotic ischemia. After eliciting hypoxia in the sensory thalamus of male mice, we assessed pain behaviors over a four-week period. Stroke-affected mice exhibited a persistent spontaneous facial grimace from day four to week four post-stroke, indicative of pain. Hind-paw mechanical hypersensitivity indicative of altered nociception, characteristic of VPL and VPM hemorrhagic CPSP models, was not detected in our model. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed increased activated microglia (Iba1) and reactive astrocytes (GFAP). Iba1 fluorescence intensity in the VPL thalamus, but not the VPM thalamus, correlated with the severity of facial grimace at four weeks post-stroke. Clustering based on behavioral phenotypes identified a subpopulation of mice in which grimace pain spontaneously resolved, by four weeks post-stroke, relative to sham controls, suggesting that this model can be used to understand how stroke recovery may influence pain chronification. This model provides a valuable tool to investigate the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying CPSP after an ischemic thalamic stroke.

">Rod photoreceptors control the ON vs OFF polarity of cone-signaling neurons</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental feature of the visual system is its ability to detect image contrast. The contrast processing starts in the first synapse of the retina where parallel pathways are established to compute contrast to bright (ON pathway) and dark (OFF pathway) objects, separately transferred to morphologically identified ON and OFF cells throughout the visual system. Here, we found that response polarity in ON and OFF neurons is not fixed but rather switches dynamically to the opposite sign. The switch was not observed in rod-knockout mice, indicating that rods generate the polarity switch. We determined that neither horizontal cells nor rod-signaling pathways were responsible for the switch. Instead, we discovered that EAAT5 glutamate transporters located at photoreceptor terminals were required to produce the polarity switch. Our findings provide a new perspective on the adaptive properties of neural networks and their ability to encode contrast across the visual dynamic range.

">REACTIVATION PROTECTS HUMAN MOTOR MEMORIES AGAINST INTERFERENCE FROM COMPETING INPUTS</a></h4>

              
                Many newly encoded memories are labile when acquired but then consolidate to more stable states. Reconsolidation theory posits that reactivating a consolidated memory again destabilizes it, increasing its vulnerability to interference from competing memories. In a series of 3-day experiments, we investigated the fate of a motor memory when it is reactivated and challenged with a competing one. We pursued a modular design in which humans adapted to a visuomotor rotation A (day 1), then an opposite rotation B (day 2), followed by a retest on A (day 3). We first found that reactivating A before learning B (A-AB-A) caused no greater impairment in A retention than non-reactivation (A-B-A). That is, while interference occurred, it appeared to be uninfluenced by reactivation, contradicting reconsolidation predictions. We then tested an alternate idea, that reactivation might serve to protect the original memory from interference. In subsequent experiments, we introduced no rotation (N) trials either prior to A relearning (A-AB-NA and A-B-NA groups), or immediately after B learning (A-ABN-A and A-BN-A groups). Here, we observed that reactivation served a protective function, but only when B was washed out immediately, preventing its consolidation (A-ABN-A group). Collectively, our results show that reactivation does not necessarily increase the susceptibility of a motor memory to interference but may rather shield it from degradation by competing learning. Our findings align with theories positing memory transitions between active and inactive states, and hold implications for strategies focused on improving memory retention in rehabilitation, sports and skills training.

">A single binge ethanol exposure is apoptotic within hours across neurodevelopment and partially regulated by the Myt1l gene.</a></h4>

              
                Ethanol rapidly produces widespread neuronal apoptosis during early development, but this susceptibility declines as the brain matures. In previous research, we found Myt1l (a proneuronal transcription factor) mutations can cause precocious differentiation, neuronal immaturity, and transcriptomic alterations, including many in apoptotic regulators. Therefore, we used a recently developed Myt1l haploinsufficient mouse model to examine this gene's effects on ethanol-induced apoptosis across different developmental stages. We discovered that haploinsufficiency can moderately influence vulnerability to ethanol in a complex, age- and cell type-specific manner: apoptosis was reduced on P7, increased P21, but unaffected on P60. Remarkably, we also discovered the previously unrecognized ability of a single binge of ethanol to rapidly increase apoptosis within six hours in early adolescent and adult wild-type mice occurring in microglia and the newborn granule neurons in the hippocampus. This suggests apoptosis is an underappreciated contributor to ethanol's neuropathology at older ages and, translated to human use, occurs far more frequently than previously recognized.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Previous studies have shown that lanthionine ketimine ethyl ester (LKE), a semi-synthetic derivative of the endogenous amino acid lanthionine, can induce proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in vivo. In the current study, we examined the effects of LKE on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in primary mouse OPCs, as intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can regulate those processes. Treatment with LKE stimulated proliferation of OPCs and increased the number of Olig2+, CC1+, and PLP+ cells. LKE also reduced cell death (caspase-3 expressing cells). Measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux showed that LKE increased basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following stimulation with glutamate or ATP, and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux because of depolarization with KCl. Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were also observed following treatment with a peptide that disrupts interactions of collapsin response mediated protein 2 (CRMP2), a primary target of LKE. These findings demonstrate regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in OPCs by LKE and suggest that these actions may be mediated, in part, by CRMP2. LKE or related analogs could therefore be of benefit for the treatment of multiple sclerosis as well as other demyelinating conditions.</p>

                Introduction Young people in developing nations are particularly affected by HIV infection, which primarily spreads through sexual contact, including anal, oral, and vaginal sex. Heterosexual couples engage in female anal sex, a receptive sexual behavior in which the penis is placed in the female partner’s anus. Anal intercourse has a higher risk of HIV transmission than vaginal intercourse, especially when there is appropriately low condom use, and the majority of couples are unaware of the risk of HIV transmission during anal intercourse. PROSPERO Registration number CRD42024629445 Objectives of the review To determine the pooled prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practices among young Ethiopian people. Methods This systematic review of peer reviews published in English up to January 31, 2025, measures heterosexual anal and oral sex practices and contributing factors among young people in Ethiopia. STATA version 17 software was used to analyze the pooled prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practices among young people in Ethiopia. Result Female young people were 2.45 times more likely to engage in heterosexual anal sex practice 95%CI, OR 4.05[1.57-3.33]. Young people who were living alone were 2.50 more likely involved in heterosexual anal sex practice with 95% CI, OR 2.50[1.60-3.40]).Those young people who live alone were 1.91 more likely engaged in heterosexual oral sex practice with 95% CI, OR 1.91[1.7-2.12]. Young people whose intimate partners engaged in heterosexual oral sex practice were 5.13 times more likely to engage in heterosexual oral sex practice in Ethiopia. Conclusions The pooled prevalence of heterosexual oral and anal sex practices in Ethiopia is high. Living alone and female sex were associated with heterosexual anal sex practices, while intimate partner engagement in oral heterosexual sex practice was associated with heterosexual oral sex practice among young people in Ethiopia.

                Background Precision medicine is an emerging approach that tailors treatments based on an individual’s genetic profile. The UAE has made significant strides in this field through initiatives like the National Genomics Strategy and the Emirati Genome Program. However, public awareness and engagement remain key challenges. Purpose This study assesses awareness, acceptance, and utilization of precision medicine among UAE residents. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a snowball sampling method, The survey collected demographic data, health status, knowledge, and experiences with precision medicine. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to analyze associations. Results Most participants (94.3%) were under 50 years old, 62.5% were female, and 60.0% held a bachelor’s degree. Awareness of precision medicine was moderate (55.3%), with higher familiarity among females and students. While 40% believed its main benefit was optimizing drug effectiveness, 38.5% viewed it as crucial for preventing adverse drug reactions. Family and friends (29.5%) were the primary sources of information, yet 25.5% had never heard of precision medicine. Awareness of insurance coverage was low, with 59.0% uncertain about their policy. Genetic testing participation was associated with education level (p < 0.05). Acceptance of precision medicine was higher among individuals with chronic illnesses (p = 0.004). Familiarity scores varied significantly by occupation (p < 0.001) and income (p = 0.004), with higher-income individuals showing greater awareness. Males had a broader range of practice scores (p = 0.003), and individuals with chronic conditions were more aware of precision medicine (p = 0.023). Conclusion Despite advancements, public engagement with precision medicine remains limited. Targeted educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and increased awareness of insurance coverage may enhance adoption and utilization.

                <p>by Yuxi Long, Bruce R. Donald</p>

Accurate binding affinity prediction (BAP) is crucial to structure-based drug design. We present PATH+, a novel, generalizable machine learning algorithm for BAP that exploits recent advances in computational topology. Compared to current binding affinity prediction algorithms, PATH+ shows similar or better accuracy and is more generalizable across orthogonal datasets. PATH+ is not only one of the most accurate algorithms for BAP, it is also the first algorithm that is inherently interpretable. Interpretability is a key factor of trust for an algorithm and alongside generalizability, allows PATH+ to be trusted in critical applications, such as inhibitor design. We visualized the features captured by PATH+ for two clinically relevant protein-ligand complexes and find that PATH+ captures binding-relevant structural mutations that are corroborated by biochemical data. Our work also sheds light on the features captured by current computational topology BAP algorithms that contributed to their high performance, which have been poorly understood. PATH+ also offers an improvement of 𝒪(m+n)3 in computational complexity and is empirically over 10 times faster than the dominant (uninterpretable) computational topology algorithm for BAP. Based on insights from PATH+, we built PATH−, a scoring function for differentiating between binders and non-binders that has outstanding accuracy against 11 current algorithms for BAP. In summary, we report progress in a novel combination of interpretability, speed, and accuracy that should further empower topological screening of large virtual inhibitor libraries to protein targets, and allow binding affinity predictions to be understood and trusted. The source code for PATH+ and PATH− are released open-source as part of the osprey protein design software package.

                <p>by Xixuan Feng, Shuqin Zhang, Limin Li</p>

Cell-cell communication (CCC) is a fundamental biological process essential for maintaining the functionality of multicellular organisms. It allows cells to coordinate their activities, sustain tissue homeostasis, and adapt to environmental changes. However, understanding the mechanisms underlying intercellular communication remains challenging. The rapid advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have enabled the analysis of CCC within its spatial context. Despite the development of several computational methods for inferring CCCs from ST data, most rely on literature-curated gene or protein interaction lists, which are often inadequate due to the restricted gene coverage. In this work, we propose OrgaCCC, an orthogonal graph autoencoders approach for cell-cell communication inference based on deep generative models. OrgaCCC leverages the information of gene expression profiles, spatial locations and ligand-receptor relationships. It captures both cell/spot and gene features using two orthogonally coupled variational graph autoencoders across cell/spot and gene dimensions and combines them by maximizing the similarity between their reconstructed cell/spot features. Numerical experiments on five ST datasets demonstrate the superiority of OrgaCCC compared with state-of-the-art methods in CCC inference at the cell-type level, cell/spot level, and ligand-receptor level, in terms of inference accuracy and reliability.

                <p>by Samuel Eriksson Lidbrink, Rebecca J. Howard, Nandan Haloi, Erik Lindahl</p>

The function of a protein is enabled by its conformational landscape. For non-rigid proteins, a complete characterization of this landscape requires understanding the protein’s structure in all functional states, the stability of these states under target conditions, and the transition pathways between them. Several strategies have recently been developed to drive the machine learning algorithm AlphaFold2 (AF) to sample multiple conformations, but it is more challenging to a priori predict what states are stabilized in particular conditions and how the transition occurs. Here, we combine AF sampling with small-angle scattering curves to obtain a weighted conformational ensemble of functional states under target environmental conditions. We apply this to the pentameric ion channel GLIC using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) curves, and identify apparent closed and open states. By comparing experimental SANS data under resting and activating conditions, we can quantify the subpopulation of closed channels that open upon activation, matching both experiments and extensive simulation sampling using Markov state models. The predicted closed and open states closely resemble crystal structures determined under resting and activating conditions respectively, and project to predicted basins in free energy landscapes calculated from the Markov state models. Further, without using any structural information, the AF sampling also correctly captures intermediate conformations and projects onto the transition pathway resolved in the extensive sampling. This combination of machine learning algorithms and low-dimensional experimental data appears to provide an efficient way to predict not only stable conformations but also accurately sample the transition pathways several orders of magnitude faster than simulation-based sampling.

                <p>by Qile Yang, Ksenia R. Safina, Kieu Diem Quynh Nguyen, Zewen Kelvin Tuong, Nicholas Borcherding</p>

Single-cell adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (scAIRR-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide a transformative approach to profiling immune responses at unprecedented resolution across diverse pathophysiologic contexts. This work presents scRepertoire 2, a substantial update to our R package for analyzing and visualizing single-cell immune receptor data. This new version introduces an array of features designed to enhance both the depth and breadth of immune receptor analysis, including improved workflows for clonotype tracking, repertoire diversity metrics, and novel visualization modules that facilitate longitudinal and comparative studies. Additionally, scRepertoire 2 offers seamless integration with contemporary single-cell analysis frameworks like Seurat and SingleCellExperiment, allowing users to conduct end-to-end single-cell immune profiling with transcriptomic data. Performance optimizations in scRepertoire 2 resulted in a 85.1% increase in speed and a 91.9% reduction in memory usage from the first version over the range repertoire size tested in benchmarking, addressing the demands of the ever-increasing size and scale of single-cell studies. This release marks an advancement in single cell immunogenomics, equipping researchers with a robust toolset to uncover immune dynamics in health and disease.

Attention samples visual space sequentially to enhance behaviorally relevant sensory representations. While traditionally conceptualized as a static continuous spotlight, contemporary models of attention highlight its discrete nature. But which neural mechanisms govern the temporally precise allocation of attention? Periodic brain activity as exemplified by neuronal oscillations as well as aperiodic temporal structure in the form of intrinsic neural timescales have been proposed to orchestrate the attentional sampling process in space and time. However, both mechanisms have been largely studied in isolation. To date, it remains unclear whether periodic and aperiodic temporal structure reflect distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we combined computational simulations with a multimodal approach encompassing five experiments, and three different variants of classic spatial attention paradigms, to differentiate aperiodic from oscillatory-based sampling. Converging evidence across behavior as well as scalp and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that periodic and aperiodic temporal regularities can theoretically and experimentally be distinguished. Our results extend the rhythmic sampling framework of attention by demonstrating that aperiodic neural timescales predict behavior in a spatially-, context-, and demand-dependent manner. Aperiodic timescales increased from sensory to association cortex, decreased during sensory processing or action execution, and were prolonged with increasing behavioral demands. These results reveal that multiple, concurrent temporal regularities govern attentional sampling.

                Introduction and Importance Gastrointestinal duplications are rare congenital anomalies, occurring in about 1 in 25,000 births, with duodenal duplications making up 2% to 7% of cases. Typically diagnosed in childhood, they pose diagnostic challenges in adults. Case Presentation We present a case of a 14-year-old boy with mild epigastric pain, whose imaging revealed a large inter-duodeno-pancreatic cystic mass displacing nearby structures. Surgical exploration identified a cystic formation in the second part of the duodenum with a small communication to the duodenal lumen. A subtotal resection and cysto-duodenostomy were performed, leading to an uneventful postoperative recovery. Clinical Discussion Duplication cysts, or alimentary tract duplications, are rare congenital lesions, typically found in the distal ileum but infrequently in the duodenum. Diagnosed mainly in early childhood, they may occasionally present in adulthood, manifesting as abdominal mass, obstruction, or discomfort; in some cases, they mimic choledochal cysts, complicating diagnosis. Surgical removal is the standard treatment, focusing on ensuring proper drainage while preserving biliary and pancreatic ducts. Conclusion Duodenal duplication is a rare, challenging diagnosis in adolescents; this case offers guidance for timely identification and treatment. It aims to support healthcare providers in achieving timely diagnosis and effective management in similar cases.

                Abstract Liver diseases cause nearly 2 million deaths worldwide each year, with approximately 1 million deaths from cirrhosis complications and another 1 million from viral hepatitis and liver cancer, according to WHO estimates. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the primary curative option, boasting success rates of 85% in the first year and 75% at five years post-transplant. Despite high costs, LT is considered cost-effective, especially for younger patients with active work years remaining. However, post-transplant complications, particularly intrahepatic cholestasis, present notable challenges. This complication arises from factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, infections, immunological rejection, and surgical complications, all contributing to impaired bile flow and liver damage. Current medical therapies for post-LT cholestasis are limited, with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) frequently used, despite questionable efficacy. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist approved by the FDA for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has shown potential benefits in reducing elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Given its significant effects on liver health, OCA may offer therapeutic value in managing post-transplant cholestasis and improving graft survival. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate OCA’s efficacy compared to UDCA in reducing cholestatic injury and enhancing graft function post-LT. The primary outcomes will focus on a 15% reduction in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline one month. Secondary outcomes include molecular markers, biliary complications, graft rejection, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Results are anticipated to demonstrate that OCA could improve graft survival, reduce complications, and enhance quality of life, potentially setting a new standard in post-LT care if found beneficial.

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an emerging risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate CHIP's association with cerebrovascular or glymphatic changes in a community-based population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study examined Chinese community cohort participants. CHIP mutations were identified through whole-exome sequencing. Intracranial arterial stenosis, silent brain infarcts, cerebral small vessel disease markers, and diffusion along the perivascular space index were identified by magnetic resonance imaging. The correlation between CHIP and neuroimaging outcomes was investigated through univariate and multivariate logistic/linear regression. The multivariate regression model was adjusted for cerebrovascular disease risk factors, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 18.2% (224 out of 1,229) participants were identified as carriers of CHIP mutations. The prevalence of CHIP generally increases with age (<i>p</i> = 0.009). After adjusting for vascular risk factors using multivariate regression, CHIP mutations were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of large magnetic resonance imaging-defined infarcts (&gt;15 mm; OR 3.20; 95% CI 1.18 to 8.43; <i>p</i> = 0.018), inversely associated with diffusion along the perivascular space (<i>β</i> = −0.02; 95% CI −0.04 to 0; <i>p</i> = 0.034), and showed a borderline association with intracranial arterial stenosis (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.30; <i>p</i> = 0.053). Notably, no statistically significant correlations were observed between CHIP and cerebral small vessel disease markers or brain atrophy measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CHIP was significantly associated with glymphatic dysfunction and large infarcts, and marginally associated with intracranial arterial stenosis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology linking CHIP to cerebral covert changes. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Nambiar et al. showed that radiotherapy induces VISTA+ immunosuppressive myeloid cells, limiting antitumor immunity. Genetic deletion or antibody-mediated blockade of VISTA synergizes with radiotherapy to enhance T cell responses and myeloid repolarization, improving tumor control across models and supporting VISTA as a promising combination partner for radiotherapy treatment regimen.

                Ho et al. report in vivo biosensors of endogenous receptor tyrosine kinase activity in Drosophila called pYtags. Using pYtags to characterize Torso activity during embryonic terminal patterning, they find that a dynamic domain of Torso activity is tuned by negative feedback to produce a longer-range stable gradient of ERK.

                Through CRISPR screening, Granda Farias et al. find results consistent with cis CD47-SIRPA interactions relying on QPCTL and that RAB21/Rab21 inactivation reduces macrophage model surface SIRPA/Sirpa expression. Through surface proteomics, they show that Rab21 inactivation modulates expression of macrophage receptors, e.g., Fc gamma receptors impacting phagocytosis of cells and particles.

They found that VCPIP1 enhanced innate immune activity by stabilizing IRAK1/2. Ablation of VCPIP1 reduces IRAK1/2 levels and thereby impairs inflammatory responses, resulting in attenuated sepsis.

Podoplanin deletion drives inflammation, disrupts lymph node architecture, and attenuates stromal/immune cell crosstalk. This study shows the significance of the podoplanin/CLEC-2 signaling axis beyond controlling cellular mechanics and actomyosin contractility.

SUV39H1 deposits lysine methylation at the IκBα degron, which signals UACA binding and provokes IκBα destabilization. The SUV39H1-IκBα-UACA-NF-κB axis is a critical regulator of bone homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101506">Neurons throughout the brain embed robust signatures of their anatomical location into spike trains</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the brain are known to encode diverse information through their spiking activity, primarily reflecting external stimuli and internal states. However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neuron’s anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Computational approximations of anatomy have the potential to support in vivo electrode localization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96966">Structural characterization and dynamics of AdhE ultrastructures from Clostridium thermocellum show a containment strategy for toxic intermediates</a></h4>

              
                <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i>, a cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobe, is considered by many to be a prime candidate for the realization of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) and is known as an industry standard for biofuel production. <i>C. thermocellum</i> is among the best biomass degraders identified to date in nature and produces ethanol as one of its main products. Many studies have helped increase ethanol titers in this microbe; however, ethanol production using <i>C. thermocellum</i> is still not economically viable. Therefore, a better understanding of its ethanol synthesis pathway is required. The main pathway for ethanol production in <i>C. thermocellum</i> involves the bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE). To better understand the function of the <i>C. thermocellum</i> AdhE, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain a 3.28 Å structure of the AdhE complex. This high-resolution structure, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, provides insight into the substrate channeling of the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde, indicates the potential role of <i>C. thermocellum</i> AdhE to regulate activity and cofactor pools, and establishes a basis for future engineering studies. The containment strategy found in this enzyme offers a template that could be replicated in other systems where toxic intermediates need to be sequestered to increase the production of valuable biochemicals.

TS is frequently associated with autistic traits, which in turn have been linked to altered sensory processing. Using the TS2-neo mouse model, we analyzed the effects of TS2 mutation on the visual system. We observed a widening of APs of pyramidal cells in ex vivo patch clamp recordings and an increase in the density of parvalbumin-positive cells in the primary visual cortex. Neurons from TS2-neo mice recorded extracellularly in vivo were less likely to respond to visual stimuli of low spatial frequency, but more likely to respond to visual stimuli of mid-to-high spatial frequency, compared to those from wild-type mice. These results point to a basic processing abnormality in the visual cortex of TS2-neo mice.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying sensorimotor integration in motor experts (athletes in fast-paced sports), focusing on their enhanced ability to predict and adapt to dynamic movement patterns within the scope of the action emulation framework. Two experiments were conducted to examine these mechanisms. The first experiment compared experts and novices in a continuous tracking task, revealing that athletes displayed superior tracking performance, particularly on predictable trajectory segments. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis identified distinct theta band oscillations between the groups. The source localization highlighted the superior parietal lobule (SPL) as a critical region associated with experts’ enhanced motor prediction capabilities. The second experiment employed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to inhibit SPL activity and explore its causal role in motor expertise. Results indicated that rTMS disrupted specific neural oscillations but did not significantly alter behavioral performance, suggesting compensatory mechanisms in functionally connected regions. Differences in theta and beta oscillations between experts and novices’ post-stimulation highlight the adaptive neural plasticity underlying motor expertise. These findings contribute to our understanding of sensorimotor integration in expertise, reinforcing the role of feedforward modeling and predictive processing. This work advances our understanding of the neural substrates underlying high-level sensorimotor expertise.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Fast and accurate sensory–motor mapping is characteristic of successful interaction with our environment and decision-making. Learning is crucial for the development of decision-making processes and has been linked to the balance of excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) neurochemicals in the cortex. However, learning is not a unitary phenomenon and occurs across time. How neurochemical concentrations are involved, and the role of interventions like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remains unclear. The efficacy of tDCS to modulate learning has been linked to baseline concentrations of GABA and glutamate, and stimulation may influence neurochemical concentrations. Here, we assessed how neurochemical balance is associated with tDCS modulations to early- and later-phase sensory–motor learning using in vivo 7T ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the right motor cortex (M1), right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and left prefrontal cortex. A single-dual task paradigm assessed performance immediately post (early learning) and 20 min post (later learning) offline cathodal stimulation to the left prefrontal cortex. tDCS modulations to learning were associated with neurochemical balance in right IPS during early learning, which shifted to right M1 for later learning. These findings elucidate the neurochemical mechanisms at play as sensory–response mappings shift from executive to motoric operations.</span>

                <p>Savings refers to the gain in performance upon relearning. In sensorimotor adaptation, savings is tested by having participants adapt to perturbed feedback and, following a washout block during which the system resets to baseline, presenting the same perturbation again. While savings has been observed with these tasks, we have shown that the contribution from implicit adaptation, a process that uses errors to recalibrate the sensorimotor map, is attenuated upon relearning (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Avraham et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Here, we test the hypothesis that this attenuation is due to interference arising from the different relationship between the movement and the feedback during washout. Removing the perturbation at the start of the washout block typically results in a salient error signal in the opposite direction to that observed during learning. We first replicated the finding that implicit adaptation is attenuated following a washout period that introduces salient opposite errors. When we eliminated feedback during washout, relearning was no longer attenuated, consistent with the interference hypothesis. Next, we created a scenario in which the perceived errors during washout were not salient, falling within the range of motor noise. Nonetheless, attenuation was still prominent. Inspired by this observation, we tested participants with an extended initial experience with veridical feedback and found that this was sufficient to attenuate adaptation during the first learning block. This effect was context specific and did not generalize to other movements. Taken together, the implicit sensorimotor adaptation system is highly sensitive to memory interference from a recent experience with a discrepant action-outcome contingency.</p>

                <p>Animal studies and human tissue experiments have demonstrated that traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes damage to the extracellular matrix (ECM). To test the hypothesis that TBI causes disruption of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) in the ECM, we measured levels of sGAG in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and urine, in patients with severe TBI in the acute postinjury period. Samples of CSF, blood, and urine were obtained within 72&nbsp;h of injury in patients who received external ventricular drains as part of their treatment of severe TBI. Levels of chondroitin and heparan sGAGs were measured, along with their disaccharide constituents. Demographic information, presence of polytrauma, brain injury load, and distance of radiologically visible parenchymal injury from the ventricle were analyzed for correlation with total subtype sGAG levels. Levels were measured in 14 patients ranging in age from 17 to 90 years. CSF sGAG levels were variable among patients, with higher sGAG levels in plasma compared with CSF. Patients with polytrauma had nonsignificantly higher blood sGAG compared with patients with isolated head injury. Subcategories of CSF sGAG levels correlated with distance from the ventricle of parenchymal injury but not with brain injury load. This study is the first to measure sGAG levels in ventricular CSF and the first to analyze levels in TBI. These data demonstrate the elevation locally of intracranial sGAGs after severe TBI and suggest rapid local metabolism of these breakdown products. The consequences of ECM breakdown may provide unique therapeutic and preventive avenues to mitigate postinjury sequelae.</p>

                <p>by Bart Borghans, Daniel Kortzak, Piersilvio Longo, Bettina Kolen, Jan-Philipp Machtens, Christoph Fahlke</p>

Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) fill synaptic vesicles with glutamate and remove luminal Cl<sup>-</sup> via an additional anion channel mode. Both of these transport functions are stimulated by luminal acidification, luminal-positive membrane potential, and luminal Cl<sup>-</sup>. We studied VGLUT1 transporter/channel activation using a combination of heterologous expression, cellular electrophysiology, fast solution exchange, and mathematical modeling. Cl<sup>-</sup> channel gating can be described with a kinetic scheme that includes two protonation sites and distinct opening, closing, and Cl<sup>-</sup>-binding rates for each protonation state. Cl<sup>-</sup> binding promotes channel opening by modifying the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values of the protonation sites and rates of pore opening and closure. VGLUT1 transports glutamate and aspartate at distinct stoichiometries: H<sup>+</sup>-glutamate exchange at 1:1 stoichiometry and aspartate uniport. Neurotransmitter transport with variable stoichiometry can be described with an alternating access model that assumes that transporters without substrate translocate in the doubly protonated state to the inward-facing conformation and return with the bound amino acid substrate as either singly or doubly protonated. Glutamate, but not aspartate, promotes the release of one proton from inward-facing VGLUT1, resulting in preferential H<sup>+</sup>-coupled glutamate exchange. Cl<sup>-</sup> stimulates glutamate transport by making the glutamate-binding site accessible to cytoplasmic glutamate and by facilitating transitions to the inward-facing conformation after outward substrate release. We conclude that allosteric modification of transporter protonation by Cl<sup>-</sup> is crucial for both VGLUT1 transport functions.

Background <p>Polygenic risk score (PRS) have proved to offer robust risk prediction for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the global CAD PRS summarizes the joint effects of all the markers in the genome, masking potential genetic heterogeneity that may be important for disease interpretation and targeted interventions.</p> Methods <p>Using summary-level data, we identified 43 significant CAD-related traits based on genetic correlations, and further classified them into eight pleiotropy clusters based on their biological functions. We then partitioned the genome into 2,353 near-independent regions. Variants in each region were assigned to the trait most genetically similar to CAD, and then were labeled with the corresponding pleiotropy cluster. We grouped variants without labels into a ninth, non-specific cluster. The Pleiotropy Decomposed (PD) PRSs for each of the nine clusters were calculated using variants assigned to each cluster for 407,903 samples of European ancestry from the UK Biobank (UKBB).</p> Results <p>We decomposed the CAD PRS into nine PD-PRSs and further stratified individuals with high CAD-PRS into nine subgroups. Each PD-PRS accounted for a higher proportion of the global CAD-PRS within its corresponding subgroup than in the remaining subjects with high CAD-PRS (e.g., 25.2% (0.07) vs. 10.06% (0.07) for lipids-PD-PRS). Additionally, these subgroups showed distinct clinical features. For example, in the lipids-related subgroup, lipoprotein(a) and LDL-cholesterol levels were 67.5% and 18.3% higher, respectively, compared to the remaining high-risk individuals. Furthermore, significant interactions were observed between blood pressure and BP PD-PRS, and between current smoking and respiratory system PD-PRS.</p> Conclusion <p>Our findings suggest that PD-PRSs may reveal substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity among individuals with high CAD-PRS. The unique PD-PRS compositions of each individual can highlight the relative importance of different pleiotropic regions.</p>

                <p>by Mihkel Saluri, Michael Landreh, Patrick Bryant</p>

The risk of pandemics is increasing as global population growth and interconnectedness accelerate. Understanding the structural basis of protein-protein interactions between pathogens and hosts is critical for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms and guiding treatment or vaccine development. Despite 21,064 experimentally supported human-pathogen interactions in the HPIDB, only 52 have resolved structures in the PDB, representing just 0.2%. Advances in protein complex structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, now enable highly accurate modelling of heterodimeric complexes, though their application to host-pathogen interactions, which have distinct evolutionary dynamics, remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the structural protein-protein interaction network between humans and ten pathogens, predicting structures for 9,452 interactions, only 10 of which have known structures. We identify 30 interactions with an expected TM-score ≥0.9, tripling the structural coverage in these networks. A detailed analysis of the Francisella tularensis dihydroprolyl dehydrogenase (IPD) complex with human immunoglobulin kappa constant (IGKC) using homology modelling and native mass spectrometry confirms a predicted 1:2:1 heterotetramer, suggesting potential roles in immune evasion. These findings highlight the transformative potential of structure prediction for rapidly advancing vaccine and drug development against novel pathogenic targets.

                <p>by Hilson Gomes Vilar de Andrade, Elisson da Silva Rocha, Kayo H. de Carvalho Monteiro, Cleber Matos de Morais, Danielle Christine Moura dos Santos, Dimas Cassimiro Nascimento, Raphael A. Dourado, Theo Lynn, Patricia Takako Endo</p>

Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) caused by <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves, causing neuropathy to varying degrees. It can result in physical disabilities and functional loss and is particularly prevalent amongst the most vulnerable populations in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The persistent stigma and social exclusion associated with leprosy complicate eradication efforts exacerbate the wider challenges faced by NTDs in sourcing the necessary resources and attention for control and elimination. The introduction of Multidrug Therapy (MDT) significantly lowers the global disease burden. Despite this breakthrough in the treatment of leprosy, over 200,000 new leprosy cases are reported annually across more than 120 countries, emphasizing the need for ongoing detection and management efforts. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform leprosy care by accelerating early detection, improving accurate diagnosis, and enabling predictive modeling to improve the quality for those affected. The potential of AI to provide information to assist healthcare professionals in interventions that reduce the risk of disability, and consequently stigma, particularly in endemic regions, presents a promising path to reducing the incidence of leprosy and improving integration social status of patients. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines the state of the art in research on the use of AI for leprosy care. From an initial 657 works from six scientific databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Springer), only 30 relevant works were identified, after analysis of three independent reviewers. We have excluded works due duplication, couldn’t be retrieved and quality assessment. Results show that current research is focused primarily on the identification of symptoms using image based classification using three main techniques, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and support vector machines; a small number of studies focus on other thematic areas of leprosy care. A comprehensive systematic approach to research on the application of AI to leprosy care can make a meaningful contribution to a leprosy-free world and help deliver on the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

                <p>by Anika T. Löwe, Marit Petzka, Maria M. Tzegka, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Humans sometimes have an insight that leads to a sudden and drastic performance improvement on the task they are working on. The precise origins of such insights are unknown. Some evidence has shown that sleep facilitates insights, while other work has not found such a relationship. One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight. To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime nap. Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep. Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation. In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27301?af=R">The Role of Electroencephalography in Predicting Post‐Stroke Seizures and an Updated Prognostic Model (SeLECT‐EEG)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures negatively impact stroke outcomes, highlighting the need for reliable predictors of post-stroke epilepsy. Although acute symptomatic seizures are a known risk factor, most stroke survivors who develop epilepsy do not experience them. Early electroencephalography (EEG) findings may enhance risk prediction, particularly in patients without acute symptomatic seizures, aiding in patient management and counseling.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multicenter cohort study using data from 1,105 stroke survivors (mean age 71 years, 54% male) with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent EEG within 7 days post-stroke. Electrographic biomarkers, including epileptiform activity and regional slowing, were analyzed for their association with post-stroke epilepsy using Cox proportional hazards regression and Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard models, adjusted for differences in EEG timing and patient characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Post-stroke epilepsy developed in 119 patients (11%), whereas 233 (21%) had acute symptomatic seizures. The 5-year epilepsy risk was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30–49%) in patients with epileptiform activity versus 13% (95% CI: 9–16%) in those without. Regional slowing doubled the 5-year epilepsy risk (23%, 95% CI: 17–30% vs 11%, 95% CI: 7–16%). Epileptiform activity (subdistribution hazard ratio: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5–3.4, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and regional slowing (subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.02) were independently associated with post-stroke epilepsy. A novel prognostic model, SeLECT-EEG (concordance statistic: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71–0.80), outperformed the previous standard (SeLECT<sub>2.0</sub>; 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65–0.76, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Electrographic biomarkers improve post-stroke epilepsy prediction beyond clinical risk factors. The SeLECT-EEG model enhances early risk stratification, particularly in patients without acute symptomatic seizures, informing management strategies and patient counseling.

                <p>Author(s): Gautam Reddy</p><p>Motivated by developmental processes in biology, this study extends a classical optimal transport framework to processes that include growth. One key result presented here is the derivation of an analog of the Benamou-Brenier theorem, which identifies the conditions under which the transport map is described by stochastic dynamics on a potential landscape. The author exploits a mathematical connection between stochastic control theory, optimal transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The framework can be used to find a potential landscape that describes the map from any (non-degenerate) initial distribution over cell states (of arbitrary dimensionality) to any target distribution in a finite time.</p><img src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/63d2-4wq6.png" width="200" height=\"100\"><br/><p>[Phys.

                Background In 2022, WHO’s World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA75.8, emphasizing the critical role of clinical trials in generating high-quality evidence and promoting equitable access to health interventions globally. In response, rapid landscape reviews were conducted to assess global clinical trial regulations, capacities, and funding distribution. Methods The analysis synthesized regulatory frameworks from 94 countries, institutional capacity data from the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), and funding data from World RePORT for trials registered between 2018-2022. Gaps in data availability and quality were assessed. Results Most countries reference international ethical guidelines, with universal requirements for ethics approval and informed consent. However, only 66% mandate public trial registration, and 40% require results reporting, with stark disparities between high- and low-income countries. High-income countries host over half of global trials; low-income countries contribute less than 1% despite high disease burden. Clinical trials sponsored by non-commercial entities are particularly scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Funding remains concentrated in the Americas and European regions, primarily driven by major funders such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States of America and European Commission. Significant data accessibility challenges persist due to incomplete registry records, inconsistent standards, lack of harmonized identifiers, and limited bulk data access. Recommendations Urgent actions include reinforcing international standards for trial registries, harmonizing data fields, improving registry interoperability, leveraging unique identifiers, enhancing multilingual accessibility, auditing data quality, pooling analytical resources, promoting open data policies, and investing in registry infrastructure and trained personnel. Conclusion Addressing data gaps and inequities in clinical trial ecosystems requires concerted action by global stakeholders. Improved data transparency and interoperability are essential to guide equitable research investments, foster coordination, and strengthen clinical trial capacity worldwide.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27289?af=R">μ‐Opioid Receptor Dynamics in the Parameningeal Tissue During Migraine Attacks</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The possible impact of meningeal μ-opioid receptor (μOR) binding in migraine remains unknown. This study investigated μOR availability in the cranial parameninges involved in migraine initiation via nociceptor activation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used positron emission tomography with [<sup>11</sup>C] carfentanil, and measured μOR availability in meninges and adjacent skull bone (parameningeal tissue [PMT]) under resting and sustained thermal pain threshold stress challenge conditions. μOR availability was compared between individuals with migraine in interictal and ictal phases and healthy controls. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between μOR availability and headache intensity, as well as the potential influence of sex on this measure.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 36 patients with interictal episodic migraine (8 also assessed ictally), 7 patients with ictal chronic migraine, and 22 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Both the episodic migraine and chronic migraine groups showed lower μOR availability in the parietal PMT than healthy controls during the ictal resting phase. No significant differences were observed during the interictal phase. Exploratory analyses on the effects of sex indicated that both healthy women and migraine patients of both sexes showed lower μOR availability in the frontal PMT compared with healthy men in the ictal sustained thermal pain threshold stress condition. Furthermore, the interictal μOR availability in the frontal PMT was negatively associated with headache intensity in the preceding month.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed variability in PMT μOR availability across the different cortical regions and migraine episodes, along with its association with pain intensity, underscores the critical role of extracerebral mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                da Silva Antunes et al. examine SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity across 3 years of repeated vaccinations. While antibodies increase with each booster, T cells responses plateau early and remain stable without signs of exhaustion or functional impairment. Asymptomatic infections promote Th17-like and regulatory CD4+ T cell expansion, suggesting balanced immunity.

                Brain tumors alter gut microbiota composition, influencing immune responses. Kim et al. show that tryptophan supplementation restores microbiota balance, particularly increasing Duncaniella dubosii, which replicates the beneficial effects of tryptophan on T cell responses and immunotherapy efficacy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96157">Focal adhesion-derived liquid-liquid phase separations regulate mRNA translation</a></h4>

              
                Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a major organizing principle in cells. Recent work showed that multiple components of integrin-mediated focal adhesions, including p130Cas can form LLPS, which govern adhesion dynamics and related cell behaviors. In this study, we found that the focal adhesion protein p130Cas drives the formation of structures with the characteristics of LLPS that bud from focal adhesions into the cytoplasm. Condensing concentrated cytoplasm around p130Cas-coated beads allowed their isolation, which were enriched in a subset of focal adhesion proteins, mRNAs, and RNA binding proteins, including those implicated in inhibiting mRNA translation. Plating cells on very high concentrations of fibronectin to induce large focal adhesions inhibited message translation which required p130Cas and correlated with droplet formation. Photo-induction of p130Cas condensates using the Cry2 system also reduced translation. These results identify a novel regulatory mechanism in which high adhesion limits message translation via induction of p130Cas-dependent cytoplasmic LLPS. This mechanism may contribute to the quiescent state of very strongly adhesive myofibroblasts and senescent cells.

                <p>Extracellular recordings in freely moving mice, especially those with movable electrodes (microdrives), are crucial for understanding brain function. However, existing microdrives are often heavy, expensive, fragile, and unsuited for long-term studies with multichannel recordings. The OptoDrive is a new, lightweight (3.2&nbsp;g), low-cost system for chronic neural recordings and optogenetic manipulation in mice. It features a detachable, 16-channel tungsten-wire electrode assembly with a 3&nbsp;mm stroke (15&nbsp;&mu;m step displacement) and an integrated optical fiber. This system enables repeated implantation and explantation without surgery, requiring only gas anesthesia. The OptoDrive has demonstrated stable recordings from the lateral hypothalamus of freely behaving mice for nearly 1&nbsp;month and successful optogenetic silencing of neuronal activity. In conclusion, OptoDrive offers a cost-effective, compact solution for long-term electrophysiology and optogenetics in freely moving mice.</p>

                <p>Marker-based motion capture (MBMC) is a powerful tool for precise, high-speed, three-dimensional tracking of animal movements, enabling detailed study of behaviors ranging from subtle limb trajectories to broad spatial exploration. Despite its proven utility in larger animals, MBMC has remained underutilized in mice due to the difficulty of robust marker attachment during unrestricted behavior. In response to this challenge, markerless tracking methods, facilitated by machine learning, have become the standard in small animal studies due to their simpler experimental setup. However, trajectories obtained with markerless approaches at best approximate ground-truth kinematics, with accuracy strongly dependent on video resolution, training dataset quality, and computational resources for data processing. Here, we overcome the primary limitation of MBMC in mice by implanting minimally invasive markers that remain securely attached over weeks of recordings. This technique produces high-resolution, artifact-free trajectories, eliminating the need for extensive post-processing. We demonstrate the advantages of MBMC by resolving subtle drug-induced kinematic changes that become apparent only within specific behavioral contexts, necessitating precise three-dimensional tracking beyond simple flat-surface locomotion. Furthermore, MBMC uniquely captures the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of harmaline-induced tremors, revealing previously inaccessible correlations between body parts and thus significantly improving the translational value of preclinical tremor models. While markerless tracking remains optimal for many behavioral neuroscience studies in which general posture estimation suffices, MBMC removes barriers to investigations demanding greater precision, reliability, and low-noise trajectories. This capability significantly broadens the scope for inquiry into the neuroscience of movement and related fields.</p>

                <p>When a cue is located away from its associated reward, some animals will learn to approach the site of reward (goal-tracking behavior) while others will approach the cue (sign-tracking behavior). The acquisition of sign tracking, but not goal tracking, is dependent on dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and we have previously demonstrated that reward-evoked activity in the NAc core may reflect different patterns of dopamine release in sign tracker versus goal tracker individuals. However, a causal relationship among dopamine release, NAc activity, and sign tracking has not been established. Using male and female TH::Cre rats, we expressed inhibitory or excitatory opsins in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and examined the impact of optical manipulation of dopamine neurons on behavior and concurrent NAc neuronal activity. We found that inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons at the time of reward suppressed the acquisition of sign-tracking, but not goal-tracking, behavior. On the other hand, stimulation of dopamine neurons did not alter the acquisition of sign tracking; however, cessation of stimulation impeded further acquisition of sign tracking. Finally, both inhibition and stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons rapidly modulated activity in a subset of NAc neurons and led to changes in cue- and reward-related activity across sessions. Overall, these findings support the ideas that sign tracking and goal tracking are the products of two different learning processes&mdash;one dopamine-dependent and one not&mdash;and that the impact of VTA dopamine on sign tracking may be mediated by activity in the NAc core.</p>
