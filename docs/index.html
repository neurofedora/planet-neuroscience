                Background Cement-based materials deteriorate significantly when exposed to high temperatures due to extensive microcracking, increased porosity, and dehydration of hydration products, all of which lower the materials’ mechanical performance and post-fire stability. This makes thermally robust mortar essential for protective applications in fire-prone areas as well as structural restoration. Method The goal of this study is to assess how the amount of polypropylene (PP) fiber in cement mortar affects its mechanical behavior, thermal resistance, and residual performance at temperatures as high as 600°C. Prior to and following exposure to increased temperatures of 200, 400, and 600°C, mortar mixes containing 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% PP fibers by volume were made and tested for workability, density, compressive strength, flexural strength, and flexural toughness. Results The results show that increasing PP fiber content decreases workability. PP fibers significantly improved high-temperature performance. At 600°C, the control mix retained only 19% of its compressive strength, while the 0.5% PP mix retained 33%. Flexural strength increased by 26–44% at ambient temperature for 0.5–1.0% PP fiber content, and at 600°C, PP mixes preserved up to 8% more flexural strength than the control. Toughness improved substantially, with the 1.5% PP mix showing nearly 10-time higher residual toughness than the control at 600°C. Conclusions In conclusion, the incorporation of 0.5-1.0% polypropylene fibers provides a balanced enhancement in thermal resistance, residual strength and ductility, confirming its effectiveness in producing mortar with superior structural integrity after exposed to high temperatures.

                Medical education is intellectually demanding and emotionally taxing. Students must maintain academic excellence, acquire professional competence, and manage stress. Traditionally, academic success has been attributed to cognitive ability and classroom performance. However, growing evidence shows that extracurricular or non-academic activities such as research, leadership, athletics, volunteering, and peer teaching positively influence student learning and development. Participation in these activities fosters transferable skills such as time management, teamwork, communication, and resilience, which are vital for both academic success and clinical practice. Moreover, structured extracurricular involvement can protect against burnout, enhance motivation, and strengthen a sense of belonging, all of which are known to support learning outcomes. Despite increasing interest, existing studies remain fragmented and often focus on single activity types or well-being outcomes rather than direct academic achievement. This scoping review aims to map and synthesize the available evidence on how extracurricular participation relates to academic performance among medical students. Findings will clarify the educational value of such activities, identify gaps in the literature, and guide institutional policy and support strategies.

                This essay compares how Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Abdulrazak Gurnah, two leading East African writers, represent postcolonial identity and historical trauma through fiction. It examines their contrasting approaches to literary resistance: Ngugi embraces radical language politics and collective cultural reclamation, while Gurnah employs narrative ambiguity, exile experiences, and linguistic hybridity. The analysis reveals how intergenerational trauma operates in their works, with memory functioning as a morally charged force shaping identity and narrative authority. Despite their differences, Ngugi prioritizing political clarity and revolutionary consciousness, Gurnah exploring subtle psychological details and narrative dissonance, both authors demonstrate literature’s ethical power to contest historical erasure and reimagine postcolonial futures with compassion and complexity.

                Objectives To evaluate the effect of diode laser therapy on bleeding control and soft tissue healing after tooth extraction in patients with controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods Six patients with type 2 diabetes requiring dental extractions were included. Medical histories were reviewed, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels confirmed glycemic control, and panoramic radiographs ruled out periapical pathology. Extractions were performed under local anesthesia. Postoperatively, LLLT was applied using an 808-nm diode laser at 0.3 J energy output for 60 seconds to occlusal, vestibular, and lingual/palatal surfaces. A placebo laser application was performed in control sites. Results Diode laser therapy resulted in a reduction in both the amount and duration of postoperative bleeding, attributed to enhanced clot stability. Improved soft tissue healing was observed in laser-treated sites compared with placebo-treated sites. Conclusions LLLT using an 808-nm diode laser appears to promote hemostasis and accelerate soft tissue healing following dental extraction in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest a potential role for diode laser therapy as an adjunctive treatment in managing diabetic patients undergoing dental surgery.

                Background This study aimed to document the occurrence of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus in King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve (KSRNR), Hail region, Saudi Arabia, where its presence had not previously been confirmed. Methods Field surveys were conducted in the Hail region, and direct observations were documented using photographic and video evidence. The colony was visually counted in the field during a single daytime visit from an estimated distance of 15 meters. Results More than 50 individuals, including adults and juveniles, were observed roosting in a rock crevice. The photographic documentation confirms the presence of a colony of R. aegyptiacus in this area, extending the known distribution of the species into a previously unrecorded region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions These findings provide the first photographic record of R. aegyptiacus in KSRNR and highlight the species’ ecological use of arid rock crevices. The results emphasize the need for targeted surveys and long-term monitoring to better understand the distribution and conservation of this species in desert environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03478">Emergent togetherness in collaborative dance improvisation: neural and motor synchronization reveal a coupling-decoupling paradox</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective improvisation in dance provides a rich natural laboratory for studying emergent coordination in coupled neuro-motor systems. Here, we investigate how training shapes spontaneous synchronization patterns in both movement and brain signals during collaborative performance. Using a dual-recording protocol integrating 3D motion capture and hyperscanning EEG, participants engaged in free, interaction-driven, and rule-based improvisation before and after a program of generative dance, grounded in cellular-automata. Motor behavior was modeled through a time-resolved {\alpha}-exponent derived from Movement Element Decomposition scaling between mean velocity and displacement, revealing fluctuations in energetic strategies and degrees of freedom. Synchronization events were quantified using Motif Synchronization (biomechanical data) and multilayer Time-Varying Graphs (neural data), enabling the detection of nontrivial lead-lag dependencies beyond zero-lag entrainment. Results indicate that training produced an intriguing dissociation: inter-brain synchronization increased, particularly within the frontal lobe, while interpersonal motor synchrony decreased. This opposite trend suggests that enhanced participatory sense-making fosters neural alignment while simultaneously expanding individual motor explorations, thereby reducing coupling in movement. Our findings position collaborative improvisation as a complex dynamical regime in which togetherness emerges not from identical motor outputs but from shared neural intentionality distributed across multilayer interaction networks, exemplifying the coupling-decoupling paradox, whereby increasing inter-brain synchrony supports the exploration of broader and mutually divergent motor trajectories. These results highlight the nonlinear nature of social coordination, offering new avenues for modeling creative joint action in human systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03498">A Quantifiable Information-Processing Hierarchy Provides a Necessary Condition for Detecting Agency</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As intelligent systems are developed across diverse substrates - from machine learning models and neuromorphic hardware to in vitro neural cultures - understanding what gives a system agency has become increasingly important. Existing definitions, however, tend to rely on top-down descriptions that are difficult to quantify. We propose a bottom-up framework grounded in a system's information-processing order: the extent to which its transformation of input evolves over time. We identify three orders of information processing. Class I systems are reactive and memoryless, mapping inputs directly to outputs. Class II systems incorporate internal states that provide memory but follow fixed transformation rules. Class III systems are adaptive; their transformation rules themselves change as a function of prior activity. While not sufficient on their own, these dynamics represent necessary informational conditions for genuine agency. This hierarchy offers a measurable, substrate-independent way to identify the informational precursors of agency. We illustrate the framework with neurophysiological and computational examples, including thermostats and receptor-like memristors, and discuss its implications for the ethical and functional evaluation of systems that may exhibit agency.

                arXiv:2601.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework to characterize large-scale brain dynamical states directly from correlation matrices at the single-subject level. By treating correlation thresholding as a percolation-like probe of connectivity, the approach tracks multiple cluster- and network-level observables and identifies a characteristic percolation threshold, rc, at which these signatures converge. We use $r_c$ as an operational and physically interpretable descriptor of large-scale brain dynamical state. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of healthy individuals (N = 996), the method yields stable, subject-specific estimates that covary systematically with established dynamical indicators such as temporal autocorrelations. Numerical simulations of a whole-brain model with a known critical regime further show that $r_c$ tracks changes in collective dynamics under controlled variations of excitability. By replacing arbitrary threshold selection with a criterion intrinsic to correlation structure, the r-spectra provides a physically grounded approach for comparing brain dynamical states across individuals.

                arXiv:2601.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient navigation in swarms often relies on the emergence of decentralized approaches that minimize traversal time or energy. Stigmergy, where agents modify a shared environment that then modifies their behavior, is a classic mechanism that can encode this strategy. We develop a theoretical framework for stigmergic transport by casting it as a stochastic optimal control problem: agents (collectively) lay and (individually) follow trails while minimizing expected traversal time. Simulations and analysis reveal two emergent behaviors: path straightening in homogeneous environments and path refraction at material interfaces, both consistent with experimental observations of insect trails. While reminiscent of Fermat's principle, our results show how local, noisy agent+field interactions can give rise to geodesic trajectories in heterogeneous environments, without centralized coordination or global knowledge, relying instead on an embodied slow fast dynamical mechanism.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked significant interest among researchers to understand their mechanisms and functional characteristics. Although prior studies have attempted to explain LLM functionalities by identifying and interpreting specific neurons, these efforts mostly focus on individual neuron contributions, neglecting the fact that human brain functions are realized through intricate interaction networks. Inspired by research on functional brain networks (FBNs) in the field of neuroscience, we utilize similar methodologies estabilished in FBN analysis to explore the "functional networks" within LLMs in this study. Experimental results highlight that, much like the human brain, LLMs exhibit certain functional networks that recur frequently during their operation. Further investigation reveals that these functional networks are indispensable for LLM performance. Inhibiting key functional networks severely impairs the model's capabilities. Conversely, amplifying the activity of neurons within these networks can enhance either the model's overall performance or its performance on specific tasks. This suggests that these functional networks are strongly associated with either specific tasks or the overall performance of the LLM.

Abstract: Neuroimaging provides essential tools for characterizing brain activity by quantifying connectivity strength between remote regions, using different modalities that capture different aspects of connectivity. Yet, decoding meaningful neural signatures must contend with modality-specific challenges, including measurement noise, spatial and temporal distortions, heterogeneous acquisition protocols, and limited sample sizes. A unifying perspective emerges when these data are expressed through symmetric positive definite (SPD)-valued representations: across neuroimaging modalities, SPD-valued representations naturally give rise to SPD matrices that capture dependencies between sensors or brain regions. Endowing the SPD space with Riemannian metrics equips it with a non-Euclidean geometric structure, enabling principled statistical modeling and machine learning on the resulting manifold.
  This review consolidates machine learning methodologies that operate on the SPD manifold under a unified framework termed SPD matrix learning. SPD matrix learning brings conceptual clarity across multiple modalities, establishes continuity with decades of geometric statistics in neuroimaging, and positions SPD modeling as a methodological bridge between classical analysis and emerging AI-driven paradigms. We show that (i) modeling on the SPD manifold is mathematically natural and numerically stable, preserving symmetry and positive definiteness while avoiding degeneracies inherent to Euclidean embeddings; (ii) SPD matrix learning extends a broad family of established geometric statistical tools used across neuroimaging; and (iii) SPD matrix learning integrates new-generation AI technologies, driving a new class of neuroimaging problems that were previously out of reach. Taken together, SPD matrix learning offers a principled and forward-looking framework for next-generation neuroimaging analytics.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in complex and partially observable environments remains a central challenge in robotics. Several bio-inspired models of mapping and navigation based on place cells in the mammalian hippocampus have been proposed. This paper introduces a new robust model that employs parallel layers of place fields at multiple spatial scales, a replay-based reward mechanism, and dynamic scale fusion. Simulations show that the model improves path efficiency and accelerates learning compared to single-scale baselines, highlighting the value of multiscale spatial representations for adaptive robot navigation.

                arXiv:2601.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PSO-X framework incorporates dozens of modules that have been proposed for solving single-objective continuous optimization problems using particle swarm optimization. While modular frameworks enable users to automatically generate and configure algorithms tailored to specific optimization problems, the complexity of this process increases with the number of modules in the framework and the degrees of freedom defined for their interaction. Understanding how modules affect the performance of algorithms for different problems is critical to making the process of finding effective implementations more efficient and identifying promising areas for further investigation. Despite their practical applications and scientific relevance, there is a lack of empirical studies investigating which modules matter most in modular optimization frameworks and how they interact. In this paper, we analyze the performance of 1424 particle swarm optimization algorithms instantiated from the PSO-X framework on the 25 functions in the CEC'05 benchmark suite with 10 and 30 dimensions. We use functional ANOVA to quantify the impact of modules and their combinations on performance in different problem classes. In practice, this allows us to identify which modules have greater influence on PSO-X performance depending on problem features such as multimodality, mathematical transformations and varying dimensionality. We then perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of problem classes that share similar module effect patterns. Our results show low variability in the importance of modules in all problem classes, suggesting that particle swarm optimization performance is driven by a few influential modules.

                arXiv:2601.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

                arXiv:2601.03392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

                arXiv:2601.03683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

Abstract: The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE802.15.4 standard provides ultra high end-to-end reliability and low-power consumption for application in field of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With the evolving of Industrial 4.0, dynamic and bursty tasks with varied Quality of Service (QoS); effective management and utilization of growing number of mobile equipments become two major challenges for network solutions. The existing TSCH-based networks lack of a system framework design to handle these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel, service-oriented, and hierarchical IoT network architecture named Mobile Node as a Service (Monaas). Monaas aims to systematically manage and schedule mobile nodes as on-demand, elastic resources through a new architectural design and protocol mechanisms. Its core features include a hierarchical architecture to balance global coordination with local autonomy, task-driven scheduling for proactive resource allocation, and an on-demand mobile resource integration mechanism. The feasibility and potential of the Monaas link layer mechanisms are validated through implementation and performance evaluation on an nRF52840 hardware testbed, demonstrating its potential advantages in specific scenarios. On a physical nRF52840 testbed, Monaas consistently achieved a Task Completion Rate (TCR) above 98% for high-priority tasks under bursty traffic and link degradation, whereas all representative baselines (Static TSCH, 6TiSCH Minimal, OST, FTS-SDN) remained below 40%.Moreover, its on-demand mobile resource integration activated services in 1.2 s, at least 65% faster than SDN (3.5 s) and OST/6TiSCH (> 5.8 s).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess substantial reasoning capabilities and are increasingly applied to optimization tasks, particularly in synergy with evolutionary computation. However, while recent surveys have explored specific aspects of this domain, they lack an integrative perspective that connects problem modeling with solving workflows. To address this gap, we present a systematic review of recent developments and organize them within a structured framework. First, we classify existing research into two primary stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. Second, we divide the latter into three paradigms based on the role of the LLM: stand-alone optimizers, low-level components embedded within algorithms, and high-level managers for algorithm selection and generation. Third, for each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. Finally, we review interdisciplinary applications across the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. Based on this analysis, we highlight key limitations and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems.

                arXiv:2511.18429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism.
  We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE's robustness and its superior generalization capability.

Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 08 January 2026; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67984-y">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67984-y</a></p>The response of different immune cell subsets to radiation therapy (RT) greatly influences treatment outcome. Here, the authors compare the effects of RT and Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in preclinical mouse models of melanoma and colorectal cancer, and show that BNCT achieves tumor cell-selective killing while preserving immune cell functions, allowing sustained anti-tumor immunity and long-term memory.

                Background Ternary ABX2 semiconductors, in which A represents silver, B denotes indium, and X signifies tellurium, have garnered growing interest for optoelectronic applications owing to their advantageous optical band gaps and carrier transport characteristics. Among these materials, AgInTe2 has proven to be a promising absorber for high-efficiency thin-film photovoltaic applications. Layer thickness optimization is a critical factor that impacts device efficiency. Methods Numerical simulations were conducted utilizing the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator in One Dimension (SCAPS-1D) to assess the influence of layer thickness on the efficacy of an AgInTe2-based solar cell. The device architecture comprised an aluminum antimonide window layer, an AgInTe2 absorber layer, and a barium silicide rear layer. The thicknesses of the window, absorber, and rear layers were methodically varied. Key photovoltaic parameters, such as open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency, were derived from the simulations. Results The simulation results indicate that the efficacy of the device is highly contingent upon the thickness of each individual layer. An optimized configuration with window, absorber, and back layer thicknesses of 0.1 micrometers, 0.6 micrometers, and 0.2 micrometers, respectively, resulted in a maximal power conversion efficiency of 32.6%. This enhancement is ascribed to improved carrier generation and collection, coupled with diminished recombination losses within the device. Conclusions The study illustrates that meticulous optimization of layer thickness substantially improves the efficiency of AgInTe2-based solar cells. The proposed device architecture offers valuable design principles for the development of high-efficiency thin-film photovoltaic devices.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-25/v1?src=rss">Uncovering fertility potential: Clinical and histopathological insights from testicular biopsies in azoospermic men in a large Indonesian cohort [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective This study aims to evaluate spermatogenic failure in azoospermic men by characterizing patterns in Modified Johnsen Scores from testicular biopsies, examining their correlation with clinical and hormonal parameters, and determining the probability of live sperm retrieval. Novelty As the largest dataset on azoospermia in Indonesia, this study provides a comprehensive histopathological and hormonal profile of azoospermic patients, while also emphasizing the diagnostic value of bilateral testicular biopsies—an area often underexplored in Southeast Asian populations. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on azoospermic patients who underwent bilateral testicular biopsies between April 2011 and July 2024. Testicular tissue samples were assessed using the Modified Johnsen scoring system (range: 1 to 10), and classified histopathologically from tubular fibrosis to complete spermatogenesis. Clinical parameters including age, body mass index, sperm retrieval outcomes, and serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone were collected and analyzed. Statistical associations between these parameters and histopathological subtypes were determined using significance testing. Results A total of 409 testicular biopsies were evaluated. The most frequent Modified Johnsen Scores were 7 (20%) and 5 (16.6%). Histopathological analysis showed that 40.3% of cases exhibited spermatogenic arrest, while only 7% demonstrated normal spermatogenesis. Discordant histopathological patterns between the two testes were observed in 18.5% of patients. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels showed statistically significant associations with histopathological subtypes (p < 0.001). Age, body mass index, and testosterone levels did not correlate significantly. Conclusion Spermatogenic arrest is the predominant abnormality in azoospermic men, with hormonal variations—particularly in follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone—strongly associated with testicular pathology. The presence of discordant histology between testes underscores the importance of bilateral biopsies. Higher Modified Johnsen Scores were positively correlated with the likelihood of successful sperm retrieval.

                We report a single case history of successful treatment of female genital mutilation with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. There were other vaginal pain issues. Variations to the standard protocol are noted. For example, substituting target decomposition over the safe place procedure. We demonstrate that EMDR is a possible treatment for FGM. We cannot find any previous case report of EMDR and FGM.

                Background Institutional legitimacy—the belief that authorities are just and deserving of compliance—depends on the interplay of participation, pluralism, transparency, and trust. This study applies the Voice–Choice–Transparency–Trust (VCTT) framework to construct a composite institutional quality index (INST) and to identify how elite behaviour, market structure, inequality, and development jointly shape legitimacy across countries. The analysis bridges the conceptual divide between extractive and value-creating power by empirically testing how elite quality and market concentration interact to affect institutional outcomes. Methods Using an unbalanced panel of 22 countries from 2000 to 2004, the study combines hierarchical multiple imputation with panel econometrics. Institutional quality (INST) was derived from standardised VCTT pillars. Core regressors include the Elite Quality Index (EQx), market power (mark-up), the Gini coefficient, and GDP per capita. Two complementary estimators were applied: a fixed-effects (pooled OLS) model and a Mundlak correlated random-effects model, both corrected for heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence using Driscoll–Kraay robust standard errors. Results The fixed-effects model shows that higher Elite index values strongly improve institutional quality (p < 0.01), whereas greater market concentration significantly reduces it (p < 0.01). Moderate inequality displays a small but positive association with institutional stability (p < 0.05). The Mundlak model confirms a positive within-country effect of elite quality (p = 0.004) and a negative effect of rising domestic inequality (p = 0.046). Between-country averages reveal that nations with productive elites and moderate inequality sustain stronger institutions, while persistent market dominance undermines them. Conclusions Across the sample, institutional legitimacy strengthens where elites are value-creating and markets remain competitive. Concentrated market power erodes institutional quality, and inequality’s influence is context-dependent—detrimental when it widens domestically but neutral or stabilising when moderate. Balanced power relations, therefore, underpin transparent, accountable, and trusted institutions within the VCTT framework.

                Background Reducing maternal and neonatal deaths in low- and middle-income countries requires a comprehensive understanding of the challenges within the healthcare system. Effective upward referral systems play a crucial role in ensuring timely emergency care for obstetric complications in the healthcare system. The aim of this study is to understand the factors (antecedents) and defining characteristics (attributes) that influence upward referrals of obstetric emergencies. from Community Health Centres to higher-level hospitals in the OR Tambo district, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods Data were collected through document analysis, observations, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, consisting of 59 participants, using a qualitative grounded theory approach. Results The study reveals a complex web of interrelated antecedents and attributes that influence the effectiveness of upward referrals in obstetric emergencies. While formal protocols exist, referral decisions are often undermined by systemic barriers. The findings suggest that the lack of coordination between referring and receiving facilities, coupled with fragmented feedback systems, hampers continuity of care. Despite these challenges, instances of effective referral were observed in settings where interprofessional collaboration, timely information sharing, and adequate preparation of patients were prioritised. Conclusion Effective upward referral of obstetric emergencies depends on timely decision-making, adequate patient preparation, clear communication, and inter-facility collaboration. This highlights the need for an integrated approach that strengthens health system functions, which are essential to reducing preventable maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in resource-constrained settings like South Africa.

                Background The acardiac fetus is a rare malformation specific to multiple monozygotic pregnancies. Two main theories have been proposed regarding the etiology of this malformation: the vascular theory, and the second supposes a defect in the embryogenesis of the heart. Diagnosis is typically suspected and confirmed based on ultrasound findings. Case presentation We present the case of a 36-year-old woman, G3P4, with a bi-scarred uterus. The last pregnancy was a monochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancy complicated by an acardiac fetus suspected in the first trimester and confirmed by ultrasound at 23 weeks of gestation. She gave birth by an emergency cesarean section at 34 weeks + 4 days to two babies: a normal female baby and an acardiac fetus. Conclusion Acardiac twin pregnancies present challenges and require careful management to optimize outcomes for both the acardiac and the healthy twins. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this condition is crucial to provide effective prenatal care and support.

                Background This experimental study evaluates the structural behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams incorporating walnut shell fine aggregate (WFA) and 15% powdered waste glass (PWG). Method Eight simply-supported RC beams were cast and tested in two series: Group 1 (beams with transverse stirrups i.e. flexure-dominated) and Group 2 (beams without stirrups i.e. shear-dominated). Mixes included a control (0% WFA) and three WFA replacement levels (10%, 20%, 30% by volume of sand), with PWG fixed at 15% of cement in all mixes. Tests included 28-day compressive strength, density measurements, and two-point bending load–deflection tests. Results Results show that 10% WFA replacement enhanced compressive strength by 3–5%, flexural capacity by ~6%, and ductility by 64%, while reducing density by 6–8%. Higher WFA contents reduced stiffness but improved energy absorption and crack distribution. Conclusions The findings confirm that moderate WFA replacement (≤10%) combined with PWG yields eco-efficient RC beams with improved ductility and reduced dead load.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>While the hippocampus has intrigued generations of neuroscientists for its contributions to cognitive and emotional processing, functional specialization along its longitudinal axis confers particular importance to the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) in affective regulation under normal and pathological conditions. In particular, vHPC is extensively linked to the encoding, expression, and extinction of fear memories, which mediate behavioral adaptation to environmental threats. Despite decades of research, however, many questions remain about precisely what is encoded among specific populations of vHPC neurons and what brain systems cooperate in processing this information during fear regulation. Furthermore, as insights accumulate into the function of discrete afferent projections of vHPC, an important area of focus is how vHPC circuitry might be organized to support different output patterns through synaptic integration. Here, we summarize the current understanding of these issues based on contemporary circuit-based approaches and highlight potential clues to the anatomical and functional organization of synaptic networks that may help reconceptualize vHPC as a system of interacting modules.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-19/v1?src=rss">Inspiratory Muscle Training plus Pulmonary Rehabilitation versus Rehabilitation alone in COPD A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an established intervention for COPD, but the added value of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) within PR remains uncertain. This systematic review examined whether IMT plus PR provides benefits beyond PR alone in adults with moderate to severe COPD. Methods PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IMT+PR with PR alone in adults with moderate to severe COPD were included. Primary outcomes were inspiratory muscle strength (PImax), dyspnea, health related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise capacity [six minute walk test (6MWT)], and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Results Nine RCTs (n=295) met the inclusion criteria. IMT+PR improved PImax in 6/9 studies, with gains of 5.2 to 22.9 cmH2O. Dyspnea improved in 6/8 studies, often exceeding the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). HRQoL improved in all studies assessing this outcome (6/6), although superiority of IMT+PR over PR or control conditions was not consistently demonstrated. Exercise capacity findings were mixed, with significant within-group 6MWT gains in 4 of 7 studies but inconsistent between-group differences. PFTs (FEV1, FVC) were generally unchanged, while limited data from single-center trials suggest reductions in dynamic hyperinflation and small increases in inspiratory capacity. Conclusion Adding IMT to PR meaningfully improves PImax and HRQoL in moderate to severe COPD, with frequent but less consistent benefits for dyspnea and 6MWT performance and minimal effect on spirometry. IMT may be most appropriate for patients with inspiratory muscle weakness (PImax <60 cmH2O or <50% predicted). Further RCTs should define optimal IMT protocols and clarify which COPD phenotypes derive the greatest benefit.

                Background Peristaltic or undulating flow plays a significant role in various biomedical and industrial processes, where it provides an efficient mechanism for transporting fluids through flexible conduits such as catheters and endoscopic channels. Understanding such flow behavior is essential for improving medical devices and industrial applications involving non-Newtonian fluids. Methods This study investigates the peristaltic motion of a Carreau fluid whose viscosity varies with both temperature and concentration within a flexible, axisymmetric channel composed of two overlapping cylindrical tubes. The outer wall of the channel exhibits a sinusoidal wave pattern, simulating a realistic endoscopic configuration. The governing nonlinear, nonhomogeneous partial differential equations were formulated in cylindrical coordinates under the assumption of a long wavelength and low Reynolds number. The equations were transformed into a dimensionless form and solved using the uniform perturbation method. Graphical analyses were performed using Mathematica software. Results The results illustrate the combined effects of temperature-dependent and concentration-dependent viscosity on the velocity distribution and pressure gradient within the channel. Increasing temperature and solute concentration were found to enhance fluid velocity and reduce flow resistance. Conclusions The study provides a comprehensive understanding of peristaltic transport in variable-viscosity Carreau fluids under realistic physiological conditions. These findings may contribute to optimizing the design and performance of endoscopic and biomedical fluid transport systems.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 07 January 2026; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04001-8">doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04001-8</a></p>A long-standing question has been how viral RNAs that use genetic codes different from those used in human cells can still drive efficient viral protein production during infection. It emerges that the sequences of 5′ untranslated regions in viral RNAs drive codon-usage-independent translation by blocking mRNA circularization, enabling viruses to evade the host’s codon-usage control of translation.

However, the established model that describes how this sensitivity arises is an equilibrium model, which is inconsistent with experimental findings. A model is now proposed in which high sensitivity results from non-equilibrium mechanical interactions within the motor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108175">A co-evolutionary perspective on humans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the era of systems biology</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis is once again the most fatal global infectious disease and has killed many more humans than any other pathogen. Despite the identification of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) over 140 years ago, we have yet to control the epidemic. A central issue is the complexity of the host–pathogen interaction, with multiple underlying pathways leading to tuberculosis disease. This intricate relationship stems from the prolonged co-evolution of the pathogen with humans, resulting in diverse immunological processes leading to tuberculosis disease. Conversely, Mtb exposure may give a survival advantage through innate immune training, thereby providing selective pressure over millennia. Emerging methodologies, such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, offer a golden opportunity to understand the immunology unpinning this host–pathogen interaction at unprecedented resolution. However, these analyses will be fundamentally flawed if they do not consider the intricacies of human Mtb infection. Here, we propose that attempts to find single immunological mechanisms leading to tuberculosis are hindering progress, and we must embrace the complexity of multiple paths to disease to allow the systems biology era to deliver transformative solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107072">Atypical collective oscillatory activity in cardiac tissue uncovered by optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Many biological processes emerge as frequency-dependent responses to trains of external stimuli. Heart rhythm disturbances, that is cardiac arrhythmias, are important examples as they are often triggered by specific patterns of preceding stimuli. In this study, we investigated how ectopic arrhythmias can be induced by external stimuli in cardiac tissue containing a localised area of depolarisation. Using optogenetic in vitro experiments and in silico modelling, we systematically explored the dynamics of these arrhythmias, which are characterised by local oscillatory activity, by gradually altering the degree of depolarisation in a predefined region. Our findings reveal a bi-stable system, in which transitions between oscillatory ectopic activity and a quiescent state can be precisely controlled, that is by adjusting the number and frequency of propagating waves through the depolarised area oscillations could be turned on or off. These frequency-dependent responses arise from collective mechanisms involving stable, non-self-oscillatory cells, contrasting with the typical role of self-oscillations in individual units within biophysical systems. To further generalise these findings, we demonstrated similar frequency selectivity and bi-stability in a simplified reaction–diffusion model. This suggests that complex ionic cell dynamics are not required to reproduce these effects; rather, simpler non-linear systems can replicate similar behaviour, potentially extending beyond the cardiac context.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89573">Replication stress-inducing ELF3 upregulation promotes BRCA1-deficient breast tumorigenesis in luminal progenitors</a></h4>

              
                BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor, mutations in which greatly increase risks for many tumors in carriers, most notably breast cancer. Luminal progenitor cells (LPs) are the currently recognized cells of origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. However, the reason why LPs are prone to transform with BRCA1 deficiency has not been elucidated. Here, using single-cell sequencing of human <i>BRCA1</i> mutant breast cancers and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of <i>BRCA1</i>-deficient normal mammary cells, we reveal that replication stress is a feature of LPs and a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency lead to significant upregulation of ELF3 expression. ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability and promote LP transformation with BRCA1 deficiency. Moreover, ELF3 emerged as a core transcription factor regulating LP genes, leading to LP expansion. Our findings suggest that replication stress is a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis in luminal progenitor cells and elucidates the key role of ELF3 during this process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93645">Identification of a Musashi2 translocation as a novel oncogene in myeloid leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Myeloid leukemias, diseases marked by aggressiveness and poor outcomes, are frequently triggered by oncogenic translocations. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the BCR-ABL fusion initiates chronic phase disease with second hits allowing progression to blast crisis. Although Gleevec has been transformative for CML, blast crisis CML remains relatively drug resistant. Here, we show that <i>MSI2-HOXA9</i>, a translocation with an unknown role in cancer, can serve as a second hit in driving bcCML. Compared to BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 led to a more aggressive disease in vivo with decreased latency, increased lethality, and a differentiation blockade that is a hallmark of blast crisis. Domain mapping revealed that the <i>MSI2</i> RNA binding domain RRM1 had a preferential impact on growth and lethality of bcCML relative to RRM2 or the HOXA9 domain. Mechanistically, MSI2-HOXA9 triggered global downstream changes with a preferential upregulation of mitochondrial components. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 cells exhibited a significant increase in mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that MSI2-HOXA9 acts, at least in part, by increasing expression of the mitochondrial polymerase POLRMT and augmenting mitochondrial function and basal respiration in blast crisis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that translocations involving the stem and developmental signal MSI2 can be oncogenic and suggest that MSI, which we found to be a frequent partner for an array of translocations, could also be a driver mutation across solid cancers.

">Cortical Field Model of Complex Spiral Traveling Waves</a></h4>

              
                Complex spiral traveling waves observed experimentally occurs across the cortex. The underlying mechanisms responsible for generating such mesoscopic activity are not well understood. Understanding how local cortical neuronal populations interact to produce emergent spirals dynamics during cognitive processing remains unknown. Therefore, to bridge this gap, a spatiotemporal cortical field rate model of local cortical circuits composed of excitatory and three distinct time-scale inhibitory populations is proposed which is extended as a two dimensional cortical sheet consisting of both nonlinear local interactions and diffusive global coupling of distance dependent axonal delays. Simulation results indicates mixed-mode oscillations that might represent the coexistence of multiple rhythms and shows emergence of complex dynamics such as rotating spirals with annihilation events. Spiral waves differentially respond to the strength of the grating input stimulus and exhibit working memory like characteristics. Also hypothesize that local patterns, such as planar, source, sink, or concentric across the cortex might be an inherent integral part of the spiral state dynamics.

">Induction of ferroptotic and amyloidogenic signatures linked to Alzheimers disease by chemically distinct air pollutants</a></h4>

              
                Air pollution (AirP) exposure is associated with increased Alzheimers disease (AD) risk, yet AirP is chemically heterogeneous, complicating identification of shared pathogenic drivers. We examined acute cortical responses to two metal-rich AirP sources, diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and World Trade Center (WTC) dust, and compared them to woodsmoke (WS), a particulate exposure with low metal content. DEP and WTC elicited highly convergent transcriptional responses, sharing over 1200 differentially expressed genes linked to inflammation, ferroptosis, neuronal remodeling, and amyloid processing. These changes were accompanied by impaired antioxidant activity and increased lipid peroxidation within lipid rafts, a membrane microdomain critical for amyloid processing, resulting in increased A{beta} generation. In contrast, WS produced a distinct transcriptional signature and failed to induce ferroptotic priming or lipid peroxidation, consistent with its low metal composition. Together, these findings implicate metals as a shared driver linking diverse AirP exposures to amyloidogenic vulnerability and elevated AD risk.

">Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (PTPRκ) regulates Superior ON-Direction Selective Ganglion Cell development, facilitating image stabilization</a></h4>

              
                In vertebrates, gaze stabilization during global visual motion requires ON direction-selective ganglion cells (oDSGCs) in the Accessory Optic System (AOS) to drive the optokinetic reflex (OKR). Three types of oDSGCs form independent mosaics; however, the mechanisms that specify and maintain their numbers to create these mosaics during development remain unknown. Here, we identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (Ptprk) as a key regulator of Superior oDSGC density, the subtype tuned to upward motion. High-depth single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) reveals that Ptprk is selectively enriched in Superior oDSGCs compared to Inferior oDSGCs, which detect downward motion. Genetic deletion of Ptprk selectively halves the number of Superior oDSGCs while preserving the number of Inferior oDSGCs. Anatomically, Superior oDSGCs in Ptprk mutants exhibit compensatory neurite remodeling to preserve mosaics. Physiologically, oDSGCs have broader tuning curves, and a subset of Superior oDSGCS have aberrant preferred directions in Ptprk mutants. Postsynaptically, loss of Ptprk reduces oDSGC connectivity to central targets. Behaviorally, the OKR responses to upward motion are attenuated in both global and pan-retinal Ptprk mutants, confirming a retinal role for Ptprk in upward image stabilization. Together, these findings demonstrate that the density of a retinal ganglion cell type is under molecular control, and that reducing density drives neurite remodeling, alters circuit computation, and ultimately impairs visually-guided behavior.

">Maximum entropy model reveals frequent brain state switching in psychotic disorders in a multiversal brain function analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Regional activation and pairwise correlation are mainstay neuroimaging methods. Yet, neither approach fully captures how brain networks evolve and interact over time. The maximum entropy model (MEM), which integrates regional and inter-regional activity, represents a promising integrative approach to examine dynamically evolving functional networks. Methods: Activation-only, pairwise-coactivation-only analyses and an MEM framework were applied to the Human Connectome Project-Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) dataset (109 patients, 56 controls). Using the 360-node HCP/Glasser atlas to define brain regions from the default mode (DMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks, group differences were quantified in nodal frequency band power, functional connectivity (FC), and MEM features such as transition rates between basins in energy landscapes and their associations with cognitive and psychopathological measures were examined. Results: Psychosis was associated with reduced first-order BOLD frequency band power and FC graph metrics. Findings specific to the MEM demonstrated a wider variety of DMN and DAN activation/deactivation patterns, with more frequent switching between them during the resting state in psychosis. Network configuration differences were more pronounced in sub-systems comprised of both DMN and DAN nodes. While BOLD frequency band power of a few regions correlated with working memory, none of the graph metrics correlated. However, basins transitions and energy correlated negatively with working memory. Conclusion: MEM provides unique information unavailable from other analyses. Results converge among first-order-only, second-order-only, and MEM analyses, suggesting attenuated inter-network connectivity with less stability of DMN and DAN brain states in psychosis. Such changes may underlie cognitive impairments, specifically basin transitions rates in psychosis.

">Disrupted dynamics of brain structure function coupling link genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease and aging to cognitive decline in 34,067 adults</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how a stable structural connectome supports flexible cognition, especially in aging, is a fundamental question in neuroscience. While static structure function coupling (SFC) is well-studied, the dynamic decoupling of functional activity from structural constraints, dynamic SFC (DSFC), remains poorly understood. Leveraging MRI data from 34,067 UK Biobank participants (ages 45~82), we characterized the distinct roles of SFC and DSFC in aging, cognition, and health. We found that SFC and DSFC followed spatially divergent aging trajectories: SFC declined primarily in sensorimotor systems, whereas DSFC decreased most prominently in higher order networks. Both SFC and DSFC in higher-order networks were positively correlated with cognitive performance (e.g., fluid intelligence). However, the associations with mental and physical health diverged between the two measures: reduced DSFC was predominantly linked to health burdens in high-order default/limbic networks, whereas weakened SFC was primarily associated with health burdens in low-order sensory-motor networks. Genetic analyses revealed that Alzheimer's risk, specifically APOE4 dosage, significantly reduced DSFC in higher-order cognitive networks and SFC in visual cortex. Mediation analyses further demonstrated that aging and APOE4-linked cognitive decline were mediated via visual SFC and ventral attention DSFC. These findings position static and dynamic coupling as complementary mechanisms: static SFC preserves network robustness, while dynamic SFC enables transient reconfiguration for complex integration. Together, our results highlight these dual mechanisms as crucial for maintaining cognitive flexibility, providing potential biomarkers for age-related neurodegeneration.

">Reactive Astrocytes Drive Extracellular Acidification to Mediate α-Synuclein Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as key players in neurodegeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they drive disease remain elusive. Here, we uncover a fundamental pathway in which reactive astrocytes fuel neurodegeneration in -synucleinopathies-including Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia-by acidifying the brain's extracellular environment. We demonstrate that both human patient tissue and a gut-to-brain -synuclein mouse model exhibit accumulation of reactive astrocytes and extracellular acidosis. Mechanistically, we show that astrocytic lysosomal exocytosis releases acidic contents, driving a drop in pH that activates neuronal acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), resulting in neuronal loss and behavioral decline. Blocking this pathway-either by inhibiting astrocytic lysosomal exocytosis or genetically or pharmacologically targeting neuronal ASIC1a-mitigates pathology and rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in vivo. These findings provide a conceptual advance by establishing a mechanistic link between glial inflammation, acid-base homeostasis, and neuronal vulnerability, and suggest that targeting astrocyte-driven acidification or ASIC1a signaling could offer new avenues for disease modification in -synucleinopathies.

">Grey matter microstructural alterations distinguish cognitive impairment in Lewy body diseases</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION. Despite widespread cortical involvement in Lewy body diseases, conventional grey matter MRI measures have limited sensitivity. Microstructural measures from diffusion MRI may be more sensitive to early changes. METHODS. We examined grey matter microstructure in 197 participants across the Lewy body diseases spectrum: 88 Lewy body dementia (LBD), 109 Parkinson's normal cognition (PD-NC), and 46 controls. We compared tissue-weighted neurite density (tNDI), orientation dispersion index (tODI), and free water fraction (FWF) cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We examined relationships between microstructure, disease severity and plasma p-tau217. RESULTS. LBD participants showed widespread cortical and subcortical tODI and FWF increases compared to controls and PD-NC, despite minimal atrophy. These changes correlated with cognitive (but not motor severity) and with p-tau217. In 100 Parkinson's patients followed-up over 3 years, cortical FWF increased in those developing cognitive decline. DISCUSSION. Microstructural measures capture early grey matter changes, offering a sensitive marker of grey matter integrity in Lewy body diseases.

">High performance sorting of motor unit action potentials with EMUsort</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural signals control muscle activity during behavior is a key challenge in motor neuroscience. To this end, recent advances in intramuscular multielectrode arrays have enabled high-quality multichannel recordings of many motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in freely moving subjects. However, identifying individual MUAP events within multichannel recordings is a significant challenge for existing spike sorting methods, which are typically optimized for identifying action potentials from neurons in the brain. To overcome this challenge, we developed the Enhanced Motor Unit sorter (EMUsort), an extension of Kilosort4 (KS4) that achieves high-performance MUAP spike sorting. We applied EMUsort to high-resolution intramuscular recordings from rat forelimb during locomotion and monkey forelimb during a reaching task. EMUsort improves upon prior methods by addressing key challenges encountered with MUAP datasets, including: 1) long time delays across electrodes due to propagation along muscle fibers, 2) more complex waveform shapes compared to neuronal action potentials, and 3) a high degree of MUAP overlap due to cumulative motor unit recruitment. We compared EMUsort to existing spike sorting methods quantitatively using simulated datasets that closely emulated the rat and monkey datasets we recorded. EMUsort provided median error rate reductions of 67.5% and 49.9% during periods of high motor unit activation for the rat and monkey datasets, respectively. In sum, EMUsort provides a substantial improvement to MUAP spike sorter accuracy, especially during regions of high MUAP overlap, in an easy-to-use software package.

">Alcohol Use Disorder Affects Brain Metals</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the risks associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD) is dementia. While the exact pathology is unknown, there is increasing evidence that alcohol consumption may dysregulate iron homeostasis in the brain leading to increased brain iron concentrations. Unregulated iron can produce oxidative stress and cellular damage to neurons. Iron-related cellular death is a relatively new finding and is called ferroptosis. To test the hypothesis that alcohol use disorder may cause brain iron dysregulation, we measured iron in hippocampus, caudate and substantia nigra in brain tissues obtained from individuals diagnosed with (AUD) and from individuals with no apparent alcoholrelated problems. Methods: We obtained hippocampus, caudate, and substantia nigra tissues from the New South Wales Brain Tissue Resource Centre, University of Sydney. The tissues came from 20 males and 20 females, half of each diagnosed with AUD. The tissues were wet-ashed and prepared for analysis of iron, copper, and zinc by total x-ray reflectance fluorescence. Results: In the hippocampus, we observed AUD-related decreased iron, but nothing more. In the substantia nigra, we observed a significant increase in iron and a trend toward an in increase in copper content in females and decreased iron and zinc in males. In the caudate we saw a near doubling of iron in females and a significant increase in copper in females and males. Conclusions: These results provide direct evidence that at least part of AUD-related pathophysiology involves the dysregulation of trace metals in the brain. These changes are more severe in females, which may relate to extended levels of exposure due to slower alcohol metabolism.

">Computational modeling and preclinical validation support targeting somatic instability for Huntington's disease treatment</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Genetic modifiers of disease onset and progression in HD implicate somatic instability (SI) of the expanded CAG repeat as a key pathogenic driver, with MSH3 emerging as a leading therapeutic target. Reducing SI, particularly in the most affected neuronal cell type, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum, is thus a rational therapeutic strategy for HD. To inform the development of an SI-targeted therapy, we generated a computational model simulating SI in MSNs to infer therapeutic effects on MSN survival resulting from an intervention that reduces SI. The model takes advantage of HD patient data to predict therapeutic benefit across a range of inherited CAG lengths and ages of intervention, considering the degree of target engagement regionally and per cell. To target SI experimentally, we designed an artificial microRNA to lower MSH3 mRNA (miMSH3) after delivery with AAV-DB-3, a previously described MSN-targeting AAV capsid variant. AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 achieved from 48 to 94% MSH3 mRNA reduction in MSNs of nonhuman primates (NHPs), which, when modeled, would reduce the composite Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale change over baseline from 50 to over 120% as well as delay motor symptom onset by many years. AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 also showed robust target engagement in vivo with up to 46% reduction in SI in HdhQ111 mice. The integration of preclinical experimental data and the computational model support the translational potential of AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 as a disease modifying therapy applicable for HD patients with a broad range of inherited repeat lengths.

">Noradrenergic infraslow rhythm during sleep is the critical link between heart-rate dynamics and memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Recent work shows that the brains arousal system remains active during sleep, with rhythmic locus coeruleus (LC) activity shaping sleep architecture and supporting memory consolidation. The LC releases norepinephrine (NE) in infraslow (~0.02 Hz) bouts that gate NREM sleep spindles. Here, we demonstrate that heart rate (HR) fluctuations during NREM are tightly phase-locked to these NE rhythms, identifying the LC as a key driver of very-low-frequency HR variability (VLF-HRV), an understudied autonomic signal. Using optogenetics, transient LC inhibition blunts HR slowing, whereas LC activation produces rapid HR acceleration, directly linking LC output to cardiac control during sleep. We further show that infraslow HR variability is a cross-species marker of spindle-dependent memory processing. In mice, the amplitude of HR decelerations during NREM predicts spindle activity and subsequent memory performance. Remarkably, human sleepers show the same pattern: stronger VLF-HR fluctuations during NREM correspond to increased spindle expression and better overnight memory retention. These findings reveal a mechanistic pathway through which LC activity modulates autonomic physiology during sleep and identify infraslow HR variability as a non-invasive marker of brainstem function and memory-promoting sleep. Because LC degeneration occurs early in neurodegenerative disease, sleep-derived HR metrics may provide a scalable indicator of emerging neuromodulatory dysfunction.

">No group-level changes in corticospinal excitability following low-intensity theta-burst ultrasound stimulation of the primary motor hand area.</a></h4>

              
                Background Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel non-invasive brain-stimulation technique offering high spatial precision and depth penetrance. Theta burst TUS (tbTUS), featuring a temporal theta burst stimulation pattern, has been reported to facilitate corticomotor excitability, when applied to the human primary motor hand area (M1-HAND). However, replication attempts have yielded inconsistent results. Methods Fifteen healthy human participants underwent neuronavigated tbTUS targeting the left M1-HAND in the anterior wall of the precentral sulcus, as well as anterior and posterior active control sites. The three tbTUS conditions were applied in counterbalanced order on separate days. Corticospinal excitability was assessed via motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded before and 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after tbTUS, and analyzed using an rmANOVA. Results None of the tbTUS conditions produced consistent group-level changes in MEP amplitude at any time point. Both intra- and inter-subject variability were high, and individual MEP changes following precentral tbTUS did not correlate with changes after control-site stimulation. Conclusions We did not observe reliable modulatory effects of neuronavigated tbTUS on corticospinal excitability. Methodological and hardware differences may account for discrepancies across studies. Our findings align with recent reports questioning the robustness of tbTUS-induced facilitation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Metacontrol refers to the ability to dynamically adjust cognitive-control strategies, ensuring a balance between persistence and flexibility. Empirical findings point to a strong link between metacontrol and emotion, but the mechanistic underpinnings of this link remain unknown. Here, we had two goals. First, we hypothesized that metacontrol and emotion are mechanistically linked through aperiodic EEG activity, in the sense that both positive emotion and metacontrol flexibility come with increases, and both negative emotion and metacontrol persistence with decreases of aperiodic activity. Second, we tested whether and to what degree emotional stimuli affect behavior and aperiodic activity automatically. In a large sample (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 120), we examined EEG and behavioral data from three tasks in which we systematically varied the task-relevance of the emotional information presented to participants. As hypothesized, positive pictures resulted in higher aperiodic activity than negative pictures. Task context and, more specifically, the relevance of emotional stimuli significantly influenced overt behavior but had no effect on aperiodic activity. We conclude that positive and negative emotions may represent the phenomenal “feel” of metacontrol biases towards flexibility and persistence, respectively, and that the degree to which processes are affected by emotional content automatically depends on the process under consideration.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Auditory evoked responses undergo notable changes during childhood, likely reflecting modifications in synaptic signaling in the auditory cortex. Particularly robust response, observed around 200 to 300 ms post stimulus (N/M250), has been consistently reported in children but is absent in adults. This long-latency response, evoked even in passive listening conditions, may indicate heightened sensory pathway responsiveness, facilitating experience-driven cortical plasticity. However, it remains unclear whether this delayed activation pattern is an intrinsic, species-general feature of brain development. We recorded cortical auditory evoked responses to monaural sine-wave tones/click sounds in 3 age groups (preadolescents, adolescents, and young adults) of human subjects and rats. Following short-lived early responses, both species exhibited a long-latency (150 to 450 ms) response in the auditory cortex. In both species, the relative amplitude of the long-latency response, compared to early responses, was increased in younger individuals. In human children, single-trial analysis demonstrated more consistent trial-by-trial timing of the response in this later time window than in the adult-typical 100-ms response in the earlier time window. Given its emergence in purely passive conditions, and across species, the robust current activity in late time window could represent a distinct synaptic event and may serve as a marker of the maturational stage, particularly in GABAergic cortical circuits.</span>

                Background Impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The pineapple core (Ananas comosus L. Merr. var. Queen) has been reported to contain various bioactive compounds, including bromelain and flavonoids, which possess antibacterial properties effective against Staphylococcus aureus. This study aimed to compare the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes to fusidic acid and pineapple core extract (PCE) in patients diagnosed with impetigo. Methods An in vitro experimental study using a post-test only control group design, conducted between January and March 2025. A total of 60 bacterial isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were collected from patients with impetigo who met the inclusion criteria. The isolates were divided into five treatment groups, with each bacterial group receiving interventions in concentrations of 50%, 70%, and 100% PCE, 10 μg fusidic acid (positive control), and a negative control. The inhibition zone diameters were measured using the disk diffusion method. Results There was a significant difference in susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to the 50%, 70%, and 100% concentrations of PCE compared to fusidic acid. However, Streptococcus pyogenes showed no statistically significant difference in susceptibility between the 100% pineapple extract and 10 μg fusidic acid. The descending order of inhibition zone diameter observed in both bacteria was as follows: 10 μg fusidic acid, 100% PCE, 70% PCE, 50% PCE, and negative control. Conclusion Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from impetigo patients demonstrated susceptibility to both 100% PCE and fusidic acid, indicating the potential of PCE as a natural antibacterial agent

                Background The growing incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education presents significant ethical challenges, particularly regarding the critical and responsible use of these technologies by students. In this context, the present study aimed to analyze responsible practices and ethical behaviors in the use of AI among students at the State University of Milagro. Methods A quantitative, explanatory-level approach was applied, employing a non-experimental and cross-sectional design, with a validated questionnaire administered to 716 participants from various academic programs. The analysis was conducted through structural equation modeling to explore the influence of affective, behavioral, and cognitive learning dimensions on the ethical dimension. Results The affective and cognitive dimensions exert a significant and positive impact on the development of learning ethics, while the behavioral component did not show statistically relevant effects. Additionally, the study evidenced high reliability and validity of the instrument, as well as a medium level of AI appropriation among students, with predominant use of tools such as ChatGPT. Conclusions Ethical training cannot be dissociated from emotional attitudes and technical knowledge about AI. The study acknowledges as limitations the non-probabilistic nature of the sample and the cross-sectional design.

                Background The cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor is the primary target of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis sativa (commonly known as “kif” in Morocco). Methods Here, we identified novel CB1 agonists using virtual screening approaches. First, we developed a pharmacophore model based on the known CB1 agonist AM11542 and screened a database of over three million compounds. Molecular docking using AutoDock Vina identified 61 hits with binding affinities of less than -9.00 Kcal/mol. Subsequent ADME-Tox (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) analysis narrowed the selection to 18 promising candidates. Results Among these, three agonists exhibited strong characteristics, including a favorable inhibition constant (Ki) and key hydrogen-bond interactions with critical residues in the CB1 binding pocket: PUBChem157251136 (Ki=2.09 nM), ZINC64438485 (Ki= 0.262 nM) and ZINC64438506 (Ki =0.244 nM). These agonists formed stable hydrogen bonds with CB1 binding pocket residues (Ser383, Ser173, His178 and Thr197). Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns, GROMACS) demonstrated structural stability (RMSD < 1 nm) and low conformational flexibility (RMSF < 1 nm) for all complexes. MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations further confirmed the thermodynamic stability of all complexes, with interaction energies ranging from -30.59 to -49.98 kcal/mol. These comprehensive simulations confirm that all identified agonist complexes maintain stable binding conformations with optimal interaction profiles characteristic of CB1 receptor activation. Conclusion These results could pave the way for researching and developing new quinazolinz-2, 4(1H, 3H)-Dione derivatives as a new class of CB1 receptor agonists.

                Background Pediatric glioma surgery poses significant anesthetic challenges due to raised intracranial pressure (ICP), neurodevelopmental vulnerability, and the need to achieve optimal brain relaxation without delaying postoperative recovery. Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), through NMDA receptor antagonism and analgesic- and hemodynamic-sparing effects, may support propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) within pediatric ERAS pathways. Case Presentation A 10-year-old girl with a left temporoparietal glioma presented with seizures, progressive right hemiparesis, and papilledema. She underwent craniotomy under propofol-based TIVA augmented with MgSO4 (loading 30 mg/kg; maintenance 10–15 mg/kg/h). Individualized cerebral physiology was guided using real-time optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements. After induction and MgSO4 infusion, ONSD values and middle cerebral artery pulsatility indices decreased toward more favorable ranges, consistent with improved intracranial compliance. Intraoperatively, brain relaxation was excellent, hemodynamics were stable, and only minimal rescue opioids and neuromuscular blockers were required. The patient was extubated within 24 hours, demonstrated low postoperative pain scores without agitation or PONV, and had no magnesium-related toxicity. A transient episode of diabetes insipidus occurred postoperatively, attributed to tumor-related hypothalamic–pituitary involvement, and resolved with vasopressin therapy. Discussion This case highlights the feasibility of MgSO4 as an adjunct to propofol-based TIVA in pediatric neuro-oncologic surgery. Real-time ONSD and TCD monitoring provided a practical, non-invasive method to tailor ICP and cerebral perfusion management. Conclusion MgSO4 may be a safe and effective adjuvant during pediatric glioma resection when combined with vigilant monitoring and ultrasound-guided cerebral physiology assessment. Prospective studies are needed to validate standardized dosing and ultrasound-guided ICP management protocols.

                Background Identifying research gaps and priorities guides evidence-informed decision-making in health and social sciences. Although scoping reviews are widely used to map evidence and highlight gaps, but definitions, conceptualizations, and methods for identifying gaps and priorities vary considerably, resulting in inconsistent methodological approaches. Aim This study synthesized methodological frameworks in published scoping reviews and mapped how research gaps and priorities were reported across health disciplines (2000–2025). It also aimed to develop an integrated framework to enhance future scoping review methodology. Methods A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, enhanced by the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Comprehensive searches of electronic databases and grey literature were performed for English-language publications from January 2000 and May 2025. Eligible studies explicitly reported methodological approaches for identifying research gaps or research priorities. Study selection followed a three-stage screening process, and data were charted and synthesized using descriptive statistics and inductive content analysis. Results Among the twenty included studies, (45%) employed general scoping review approaches. Key themes were methodology and research (65%), education & training (15%), stakeholder engagement (10%), and Practice & Care (10%). Across the reviews, eleven categories of research gaps spotlights population underrepresentation, methodological inconsistency, and specialty-specific limitations. Additionally, seven research priorities centered on methodological rigor, innovation, stakeholder engagement, as the most emphasized areas. Conclusion This study provides the first comprehensive synthesis of how research gaps and priorities are identified within scoping reviews. Findings highlight under representation of human-centered, equity-focused, and practice-oriented domains, emphasizing the need for stakeholders to ensure research is inclusive, relevant, and impactful. The Integrated Framework provides guidance for future scoping reviews to enhance methodological rigor and impact.

                Abstract* Background In 2023, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia mandated all mining companies to assess their Mining Safety and Health Performance Maturity Level (MSHPML) as a basis for formulating Occupational Safety and Health (OHS) incident prevention programs. One year into its implementation, official data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (2025) recorded 42 mining accidents and 8 worker fatalities due to illness within the nickel mining sector, highlighting a notable gap between policy expectations and actual outcomes. This study aims to examine the relationship between MSHPML and lagging OHS indicators in nickel mining, with the goal of informing strategies to enhance implementation effectiveness. Methods The study population comprised nickel mining companies operating in Indonesia, with a final sample of 77 companies. The dependent variables were OHS performance out-comes, while the independent variable was the MSHPML score. Quantitative analysis was conducted across three stages: univariate, bivariate, and multivariate, supported by assumption testing Results Results revealed that higher MSHPML achievement was significantly associated with improvements in occupational safety outcomes. However, no statistically significant relationship was found between MSHPML and occupational health indicators. Conclusions These findings suggest that while MSHPML is a useful predictor of safety performance, further refinement is needed to adequately capture occupational health dimensions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-12/v1?src=rss">Solar Irradiation Forecasting Using Genetic Algorithms [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background For many applications such as photovoltaic system planning, grid stability, and renewable energy integration, accurate forecasting of solar irradiation is essential. Solar irradiation exhibits strong nonlinearity and variability driven by atmospheric conditions, seasonal cycles, and site-specific meteorological factors, making reliable short-term prediction challenging for conventional statistical models. Methods We propose a hybrid solar irradiation forecasting framework that combines machine learning regression models with genetic algorithm (GA)–based model optimization. Multiple predictive models, including linear regression and gradient-boosted decision trees, are trained using meteorological variables such as zenith angle, temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric indices. The GA is employed to identify optimal feature subsets by maximizing predictive accuracy while minimizing redundancy, treating feature selection as a combinatorial optimization problem. Model performance is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), variance, and percentage accuracy derived from mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results The GA-optimized models demonstrate improved forecasting accuracy and stability compared to baseline machine learning approaches using full feature sets. Empirical results show that GA-based feature selection reduces prediction error, enhances robustness across seasonal regimes, and yields interpretable feature importance patterns aligned with known physical drivers of solar irradiation. Comparative evaluation across training and validation datasets confirms consistent gains in predictive performance. Conclusions The proposed genetic algorithm–enhanced forecasting framework provides an effective and interpretable approach for modeling solar irradiation under complex atmospheric conditions. By integrating evolutionary optimization with machine learning, the methodology supports more reliable solar energy forecasting and can be readily extended to real-time energy management systems and large-scale renewable deployment scenarios.

                Background Research on resilience and motivation among incarcerated populations has expanded substantially over the past century, reflecting a broader shift in penal philosophy from punitive control toward rehabilitation and reintegration. However, this literature remains fragmented across disciplines, conceptually heterogeneous, and geographically uneven, with a strong concentration in Western contexts. This limits theoretical integration and constrains the global applicability of existing models. Methods A bibliometric analysis was conducted on 1,309 publications indexed between 1912 and 2024. Co-occurrence, citation, collaboration, and temporal overlay analyses were performed using VOSviewer to map thematic structures, intellectual influences, and patterns of knowledge production. Inclusion criteria targeted peer-reviewed and scholarly works addressing resilience and/or motivation in correctional settings. Results and Discussion The analysis reveals a temporal shift from early psychological adjustment and behavioral control models toward integrated frameworks emphasizing resilience, motivation, rehabilitation, and post-release reintegration. Emerging themes include trauma-informed care, addiction recovery, human rights, and reentry processes, while gender-specific, cross-cultural, and socioeconomic reintegration perspectives remain underdeveloped. Citation and collaboration networks demonstrate strong institutional concentration in North America and Western Europe, reflecting structural and epistemic asymmetries that shape dominant theoretical paradigms. Although interdisciplinary integration has increased, comparative and culturally grounded research remain limited. Conclusions This review synthesizes a century of research into a coherent intellectual map, identifying key trends, gaps, and structural imbalances in the field. The findings highlight the need for more inclusive, culturally responsive, and structurally informed research frameworks that integrate psychological, institutional, and social dimensions of rehabilitation. Advancing this agenda is essential for developing correctional policies and interventions that are both empirically robust and globally relevant.

<p>Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is the critical, rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin production, governing mood, stress response, and anxiety. The specific isoforms TPH1 and TPH2 control synthesis in peripheral tissues and the brain, respectively, making them pivotal target for the correction of affective and neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of mood, emotional state, sleep, appetite, digestion, and cognitive functions. It plays a key role in the creation of a sense of well-being, reduction of anxiety and control of the response to stress. Imbalances in its levels are associated with many disorders, notably depression, anxiety disorders and migraines. This review examines the structural and functional aspects of the regulation of TPH activity with an emphasis on its isoforms, TPH1 and TPH2, which are responsible for serotonin synthesis in peripheral tissues and in neurons, respectively. Approaches to TPH regulation at the gene, protein, and enzymatic activity levels are discussed. The role of TPH in the pathogenesis of affective disorders such as depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder is also discussed. Approaches to modulating TPH activity are proposed, including, for example, using calpain inhibitors.</p>

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Psilocybin-containing mushrooms, commonly known as magic mushrooms, strongly affect mood, cognition, and behavior. <i>Psilocybe azurescens</i> is a species of psilocybin mushrooms that contains the main active compounds psilocybin and psilocin. Psilocybin mushrooms have been used since ancient times to improve the quality of life. However, their adverse effects have been less studied. This study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the effect of oral consumption of <i>P. azurescens</i> on social behavior, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in rats. The underlying mechanisms of these behaviors were also studied. Male Wistar rats received three doses of <i>P. azurescens</i> (10, 100, and 250 mg/kg) by gavage every other day for 14 days. Social interaction, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors were assessed using the three-chamber, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests, respectively. Protein levels of neurotrophic (BDNF and GDNF), neuroinflammatory (IL-6 and TNFα), and oxidative stress (ROS and SOD) factors were measured in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and amygdala by ELISA technique. The results showed that <i>P. azurescens</i> significantly increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and disrupted social interaction behavior in rats. These effects were accompanied by increased neuroinflammation and oxidative stress and decreased neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus, PFC, and amygdala. This study suggests that the high doses of <i>P. azurescens</i> can cause mood disorders by increasing inflammatory responses and oxidative stress and decreasing the expression of neurotrophic factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/13/1/ENEURO.0195-25.2025?rss=1">Lasting Increases in Neuronal Activity and Serotonergic Receptor Expression Following Gestational Chlorpyrifos Exposure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perinatal exposure to the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is associated with an increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. While these behavioral detriments have been modeled in rodents, the underlying functional alterations in the developing brain are largely unknown. Previous reports using a rat model have identified alterations to both inhibitory synaptic transmission and serotonergic (5-HT) receptor binding in the cortex following developmental CPF exposure. Here, we use a rat model of gestational CPF exposure to investigate whether this altered inhibitory activity is driven by increased spontaneous firing of inhibitory interneurons and altered 5-HT receptor expression. Using cell-attached ex vivo electrophysiology in young rats of both sexes, we identified a significant increase in the number of spontaneously firing neurons in the somatosensory cortex of CPF-exposed offspring. Analysis of action potential metrics identified a subset of these neurons as fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Immunohistochemical labeling of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activity, further revealed a pronounced increase in activity of neurons of the somatosensory cortex in both juvenile and adult rats that had been gestationally exposed to CPF. Finally, RNAscope in situ hybridization showed an increase in the expression of the inhibitory receptor 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> in PV neurons of male offspring. The preliminary data reported here suggest that gestational exposure to CPF may result in persistent hyperexcitation of the somatosensory cortex. These neurophysiological effects may contribute to the established behavioral outcomes resulting from gestational exposure to CPF and offer guidance for novel preventative interventions.</p>

                This paper studies a new family of polyominoes. The family is defined through a graphic representation called James diagram, also known as the nested chain abacus. This form is referred to as the Ω-nested Abacus. The proposed class is defined by geometric constraints satisfied by sets of rows, columns, and chains. Through the application of combinatorial approaches and variable generating function, we enumeration of this new class of polyominoes. During the new construction process transformation is formulates which plays a crucial role in the enumerate of a family of classes. To further extend this study generating function for theses class are formulated using an enumeration method known as the Enumeration Combinatorial Object (ECO) technique. ECO method, derived from a smaller one though a series of local expansion. Theses expansion are systematically defined by succession rule which can subsequently be expressed as a functional equation for the generating function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-690/v2?src=rss">Examining types of Organizational Structure in Private Chartered Universities in Western Uganda and their Impact on Academic Staff Performance [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the types of organizational structures in privately chartered universities in Western Uganda and how these structures impact academic staff performance. Grounded in Henri Fayol’s Administrative Management Theory and Vroom’s Expectancy Theory, this study integrates structural and motivational perspectives to explore the impact of institutional design on academic operations. Method A concurrent triangulation research design was employed to combine quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data were collected from 186 academic staff members using structured questionnaires and 10 academic deans through in-depth interviews. Results Quantitative findings revealed that functional and hierarchical structures were the most common, with 55.4% of respondents reporting highly centralized decision-making and 42.5% reporting poor communication flow. A significant positive correlation was observed between organizational structure and academic staff performance (r = 0.512, p < 0.01). Regression analysis showed that organizational structure explained 26.2% of the variance in academic staff performance (R2 = 0.262, F (1, 184) = 65.46, p < 0.001). Qualitative data supported these results, with participants highlighting that rigid and bureaucratic structures limit flexibility, innovation, and collaboration, whereas excessive centralization undermines academic autonomy (Yusoff & Isa, 2021). Conclusion The study concludes that, while traditional structures dominate private chartered universities, they often hinder academic performance. To enhance staff effectiveness, universities should adopt adaptive and participatory structures (Berkowitz, 2023). Aligning Fayol’s principles of work specialization, centralization, and communication flow with Vroom’s motivational framework offers a strategic path for organizational improvement.

                Background The Fekete–Szegö inequality and coefficient bounds play a fundamental role in the study of Bazilevič-type functions, a subclass of univalent functions with significant applications in complex analysis and related mathematical fields. These functions have been extensively studied for their geometric properties and coefficient behavior, yet there remains a need to explore subclasses defined via differential operators and subordination techniques to obtain sharper and more general bounds. Understanding the coefficient structure of these functions provides insight into their analytic behavior and extends classical results in the theory of univalent functions. Methods This study focuses on a specific subclass of Bazilevič-type functions and investigates its properties using differential subordination and differential operators. These mathematical tools are employed to derive explicit coefficient estimates and establish the Fekete–Szegö inequalities. The analysis involves careful application of operator techniques to obtain bounds that reflect the influence of the subclass parameters on the analytic functions under consideration. Results The derived inequalities demonstrate the effectiveness of differential operators in obtaining precise coefficient constraints. The results highlight how variations in the defining parameters of the subclass influence the function behavior, providing clear and explicit bounds for the coefficients. These findings extend existing results in the literature and offer new insights into the structure of Bazilevič-type functions. Conclusions Overall, this study provides a systematic approach to understanding the coefficient structure of Bazilevič-type functions. The findings establish a foundation for further theoretical research on univalent functions and offer tools that can be applied in both theoretical investigations and practical problems in complex analysis. The results contribute to the broader understanding of analytic functions and their applications in mathematical modeling.

                Background Climate change is expanding arid regions globally, intensifying drought, salinity, and heat stress that threaten ecosystem stability and food security. Desert plants of the Arabian Peninsula have evolved physiological and microbial adaptations that enable survival under such extremes. This study investigates the endophytic microbial communities of four representative xerophytic species; Zygophyllum mandavillei, Tribulus zeyheri, Limeum arabicum, and Cyperus conglomeratus, to identify functional traits that promote their climatic resilience. These perennial species were selected because they inhabit similar arid environments and share xerophytic traits such as reduced leaf area, fibrous root systems, and high drought tolerance, making them ideal models for examining interactions between plants and their associated microbes in desert ecosystems. Methods High-throughput environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing was performed on 27 plant samples, generating 3,660,664 high-quality reads. Taxonomic clustering resolved the sequences into 30 phyla, 15 classes, 20 orders, 27 families, and 21 genera. Diversity analyses were conducted to evaluate microbial richness and community structure, and functional inference was performed using PICRUSt2. Results Dominant microbial taxa included Alphaproteobacteria, Actinomycetia, Cyanophyceae, and Gammaproteobacteria, groups known for nitrogen fixation, carbon cycling, and resistance to desiccation and heat. Alpha-diversity analyses revealed significant variation in species richness among the host plants, while beta-diversity metrics showed distinct clustering patterns, indicating host-specific microbial assembly shaped by plant genotype and microhabitat. Functional prediction suggested enrichment of pathways related to amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, DNA repair, and secondary-metabolite biosynthesis, supporting metabolic versatility and stress adaptation. Conclusions These findings provide a comprehensive genomic overview of endophytic bacterial communities associated with key desert plants of the Arabian Peninsula and establish a foundation for future functional validation and sustainable applications of desert microbiomes under climate change.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The evidence regarding adherence to dietary patterns and Parkinson's disease (PD) risk is inconsistent. Because of the long prodromal PD phase, reverse causation represents a major threat to investigations of diet in relation to PD. We examined whether adherence to the Mediterranean (MED) and Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets is associated with PD incidence, while considering reverse causation, in a large cohort of women with a 25-year follow-up.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants from the E3N (Etude Epidémiologique auprès des femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l’Education Nationale) study were prospectively followed-up from 1993 to 2018. PD diagnoses were validated using medical records and drug claim databases. Baseline MED and MIND scores were computed using a validated food questionnaire. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models. Exposures were lagged by 5 years in main analyses and longer lags in sensitivity analyses. We performed age-stratified analyses and adjusted for prodromal symptoms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Analyses (5-year–lag) are based on 71,542 women (845 PD patients). Higher adherence to MED and MIND diets was not associated with PD overall, but was associated with lower PD incidence in women &lt;71 years old (MED, HR<sub>high vs. low+medium</sub> = 0.76 [0.58–1.00], <i>p</i>-Age × MED interaction = 0.038; MIND, HR<sub>high vs. low+medium</sub> = 0.75 [0.58–0.97], <i>p</i>-Age × MIND interaction = 0.035). Legumes and high unsaturated to saturated fat ratio had the strongest contribution for the MED diet, while beans and olive oil had the strongest contribution for the MIND diet. Results were consistent after adjustment for constipation/depression and in analyses with lags up to 20 years.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Adherence to the MED and MIND diets was associated with lower PD incidence &lt;71 years in women. These findings are important for planning preventative interventions. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Abstract* Background Coastal ecosystems, including mangrove forests, are at the core of the socio-economic life of the local communities. Conversely, these ecosystems remain highly sensitive to the increasing impacts of climate change. Against such a backdrop, bamboo has been an important material, especially for construction and tool-making in coastal areas like East Lampung Regency. Despite the importance, such bamboo demands have yet to be met by local supplies or by the development of downstream value-added processing. Policy and Implications This study illustrates the strategic potential of bamboo as an economic and ecological resource, contributing to coastal resilience in East Lampung. If integrated into the Nature-based Solutions (NbS) framework, bamboo utilization can enhance livelihoods while restoring and protecting coastal ecosystems in communities. The study has revealed that sustainable management of bamboo provides a means to link environmental conservation to inclusive local development and climate adaptation. Recommendations The study outlines four strategies designed to advance the sustainable use of bamboo in East Lampung, including (a) empowering community-based bamboo cultivation focuses on facilitating regeneration activities that restore ecosystems and provide economic benefits to local communities, (b) investing in capacity building to equip local communities and key stakeholders with essential knowledge and skills in sustainable bamboo management and utilization, (c) driving policy advocacy that aims to champion the cause of sustainable bamboo utilization across multiple sectors, and (d) strengthening institutional frameworks that strengthen upstream bamboo resource management and optimize downstream processing and marketing systems, establish a robust industry infrastructure. Conclusions Bamboo utilization in East Lampung has the potential to change from a traditional subsistence material to a strategic instrument toward coastal sustainability. Bamboo-based initiatives can support ecological resilience, help boost the economy along the coast, and inspire a stronger socio-cultural regeneration toward a more sustainable future for East Lampung through the NbS approach.

                Abstract* Background Several studies have investigated internet-based interventions, demonstrating that they are an effective resource, including the use of gamification, which can enhance engagement in psychological interventions. This study explores the efficacy of gamified internet-based intervention programs in enhancing self-awareness among early adults. Methods This research used a pretest-posttest design to determine the effectiveness of the program. A dual-phase approach was adopted: the first phase involved a blend of online interventions and regular offline meetings with 25 participants, while the second was purely online, involving 40 participants. Participants, aged 18-22 years, engaged with a mental health application over a 30-day period. This study utilizing the Self Awareness Outcomes Questionnaire (SAOQ) for assessment. Results The Results indicated a statistically significant enhancement in self-awareness in both setups, with face-to-face interactions yielding a larger effect size (0.76) compared to online-only interventions (0.48). Conclusions Gamification offers a promising alternative for supporting participants in developing self-awareness as a means to improve mental health. Gamification programs have the ability to help individuals process independently or simultaneously get guidance from professionals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-5/v1?src=rss">A Systematic Literature Review on Biometric Authentication in Mobile Banking [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                As mobile banking continues to grow at an exponential rate, the financial industry is faced with a critical challenge: How to keep user credentials secure without compromising on efficiency. Password-based authentication is still dominant but has major limitations which compromise both security and user experience. These systems are susceptible to the most common attack vectors such as phishing, malware and man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if users are using weak passwords or sharing passwords. Additionally, mobile devices have limited input interfaces that are frequently sources of frustration and error. As a result, there is increasing interest in other more secure and convenient alternatives such as biometric and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate the inherent weaknesses of password-based systems. This systematic literature review, which covers studies from 2020 to 2025, provides a critical review of biometric authentication methods used in mobile banking. It analyses existing approaches, security risks and implementation practices adopted by major banks across the world. While biometric systems are more secure and user friendly than traditional systems, they also introduce new challenges in terms of privacy, spoofing and regulatory compliance. The review gives a detailed overview of the current advances, key issues, and emerging research directions, which will give valuable insight to the development of secure and easy-to-use authentication systems in mobile banking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-4/v1?src=rss">Survival and immunophenotypes of patients with acute leukaemia treated in a hospital in Chiclayo, Peru [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Objectives To determine the overall survival and immunophenotypes of patients with acute leukemia from a hospital in Chiclayo, Peru, during the period 2015-2019. Methods Observational research was conducted, analysing a total of 168 samples from patients diagnosed with acute leukemia, evaluating overall survival in the different types of leukemia at 5 years of follow-up using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results The overall survival for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) was found to be 52.7% at 5 years of follow-up, while for T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL), it was 50% at 2 years. The overall survival for non-promyelocytic Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) was 53.3% at 3 years of follow-up, and for promyelocytic leukemia, it was 66.7% at 3 years. The predominant immunophenotype was B-ALL, which represented 77.38%, while AML represented the remaining cases. Conclusions The overall survival of lymphoid leukemia was superior to that of myeloid leukemia. The most frequent aberration in B-ALL was the hyperexpression of CD10, while the absence of antigens was noted in T-ALL. The most frequent aberration in promyelocytic leukemia was the hyperexpression of CD13, and for non-promyelocytic leukemia, asynchronisms and lineage infidelity were observed.

                In development, cells navigate highly complex gene-regulatory landscapes to make fate choices. Steinschaden et al. synthesize concepts of multilineage priming, microheterogeneity, and collective multipotency, explaining how competing gene programs shape commitment to a specific fate. They also evaluate computational approaches that infer lineage biases and dissect mechanisms of fate selection.
