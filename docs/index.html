                Background COVID-19 pandemics increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk during hospitalization, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Limited radiological diagnosis in pandemic requires a guided protocol for anticoagulant adjustment. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center as part of a quality improvement program evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation protocols. The study focused on implementing a guideline for anticoagulant dosing protocol based on dynamic changes in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The dosing guideline allowed for dose escalation from standard prophylactic levels to escalated prophylactic or therapeutic levels, depending on the patient's risk profile for VTE. The primary endpoints included in-hospital survival comparing between fix and dynamic adjustment treatment groups. Secondary endpoints encompassed major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events, incidence of breakthrough thrombosis, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, days of mechanical ventilator use, and survival duration. Findings Among the 260 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020. The patients received fixed anticoagulant dosage in 188, 72.3%) patients, while 72 (27.7%) were up-titrated according to the protocol. In-hospital survival at 30 days demonstrated superiority among patients whose anticoagulation was up-titrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (80.2%) compared to receiving fixed anticoagulant dosage (51.3%) (p=0.01). Bleeding events were significantly higher in up-titrate group (12.5%) compared to fixed anticoagulant dosage group (2.13%). Most of them are CRNMB. Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer-based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 holds promise in improving in-hospital mortality rates without a significant increase in fatal bleeding events.

                Background The danger of earthquakes poses a serious threat to people worldwide. One of the most significant challenges is preparing communities to cope effectively with this disaster. Therefore, understanding earthquake hazards is critically important for preparedness, mitigation, and an effective response to this threat. This report aims to observe and conduct a preliminary assessment of the degree to which community preparedness for earthquake disasters has been implemented. Methods Empirical data were obtained from survey respondents and interviews. The respondents were members of a community affected by the Cianjur earthquake, which occurred on November 21, 2022. The data were analysed using the mean range approach, based on Likert scales. Additionally, the Spearman correlation method was employed to indicate the relationship between community awareness and infrastructure readiness. Result Based on empirical evidence and preliminary analysis, it is evident that the preparedness of the community to respond effectively to earthquake catastrophes is inadequate. An apparent lack of readiness is observed in the inadequate construction of housing that fails to meet disaster standards, and the absence of disaster response facilities is notable. Conclusions Based on our initial assumption, it appears that knowledge related to disaster resilience in this area has not been adequately disseminated or socialized. However, this premise requires further investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-886/v1?src=rss">All-cause mortality according to COVID-19 vaccination status: An analysis of the UK office for National statistics public data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 has been commonly considered the best response to the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis. However, to assess its real-world overall effects, the best way can be the analysis of all-cause mortality by vaccination status. The UK is perhaps the only country which has made publicly available all-cause mortality data by vaccination status. Methods Data from April 2021 to May 2023 published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) were retrospectively analyzed by age groups and vaccination status; the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality was calculated against the corresponding unvaccinated groups. Results We found that across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs increased from a certain date, dependent on the age group. Across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs were initially much lower than 1. However, due to their increase, by a certain date for the 18-39, 80-89 and 90+ age groups they exceeded the reference value. For the other age groups, the date at which the SMR would reach 1 can be predicted, provided the trend is maintained. Non-COVID-19 SMRs’ trends were very similar. Their initial values much lower than 1 are suggestive of significant biases in the ONS dataset, leading to underestimate the risks for the vaccinated people, as it is implausible that COVID-19 vaccines protect against non-COVID-19 deaths. Conclusions The increase over time in all-cause death SMRs in vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated, and their excess from the reference values for certain age groups, should be carefully considered to understand the underlying factors. It would be desirable for other major countries to systematically collect all-cause mortality by vaccination status and, in the meantime, a moratorium on promoting mass vaccination campaigns should be implemented.

                <p>The frontal cortex-striatum circuit plays a pivotal role in adaptive goal-directed behaviors. However, it remains unclear how decision-related signals are mediated through cross-regional transmission between the medial frontal cortex and the striatum by neuronal ensembles in making decision based on outcomes of past action. Here, we analyzed neuronal ensemble activity obtained through simultaneous multiunit recordings in the secondary motor cortex (M2) and dorsal striatum (DS) in rats performing an outcome-based left-or-right choice task. By adopting tensor component analysis (TCA), a single-trial&ndash;based unsupervised dimensionality reduction approach, for concatenated ensembles of M2 and DS neurons, we identified distinct three spatiotemporal neural dynamics (TCA components) at the single-trial level specific to task-relevant variables. Choice-position&ndash;selective neural dynamics reflected the positions chosen and was correlated with the trial-to-trial fluctuation of behavioral variables. Intriguingly, choice-pattern&ndash;selective neural dynamics distinguished whether the incoming choice was a repetition or a switch from the previous choice before a response choice. Other neural dynamics was selective to outcome and increased within-trial activity following response. Our results demonstrate how the concatenated ensembles of M2 and DS process distinct features of decision-related signals at various points in time. Thereby, the M2 and DS collaboratively monitor action outcomes and determine the subsequent choice, whether to repeat or switch, for action selection.</p>

                Background: Phlebotomy is a medical procedure that is performed frequently in the blood collection activities of medical institutions. The procedure involves close interaction with different types of patients—some of whom are cooperative and others, who, for many reasons, are not (for example, patients who have a fear of needles). Blood extraction is an essential skill in several medical specialties, such as in laboratory sciences. Lesson planning in phlebotomy education is mainly focused on procedural skills, and very little attention is given towards teaching communication skills despite the close patient interaction in phlebotomy. In this paper, I propose a lesson plan for teaching communication skills to medical laboratory sciences and nursing students based on Gagne’s instructional design. Methods: The training session included two main parts: training session using Gange’s instructional design and at the end of the session, the participants were surveyed for the effectiveness of the training session. Results: 17 participants were included in the study. Overall, the majority of the participants were highly satisfied with the effectiveness of the training session in teaching communication skills with all seven survey questions receiving a mean score of 4.58 on a Likert scale of 1-5. Conclusion: We demonstrated the effectiveness of Gange’s instructional beyond theoretical lesson planning to teach communication skills through role-play in phlebotomy education.

                Background Preterm birth, which is child delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy, is the primary cause of perinatal mortality worldwide. Preterm birth remains a major public health challenge in Rwanda, affecting approximately 13.8% of birth. The World Health Organization estimates that 15 million babies are born prematurely each year. While the association between periodontitis and preterm deliveries is increasingly recognized, little is known about this link in Rwanda. This policy brief aims to bridge this knowledge gap by presenting the findings of a recent study investigating the prevalence of periodontitis among pregnant women in Rwanda and its association with preterm deliveries. This policy brief also aims to inform and guide decision making towards incorporating periodontal screening into the antenatal care package in Rwanda. This has the potential to improve pregnancy outcomes and contribute to improved oral health in the future. Policy outcome and Implications Contemporary evidence has shown a six-fold increased risk of preterm delivery for women with periodontitis in Rwanda, with a concerningly high prevalence (60%) among pregnant women. Additionally, nurses working in antenatal clinics displayed insufficient knowledge about gum disease. Actionable recommendations The adoption of basic periodontal screening within existing antenatal care packages is recommended. This, coupled with nurse training and public awareness campaigns, can empower women and healthcare professionals to prioritize oral health for better pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Integrating periodontal screening into antenatal care has the potential to significantly reduce preterm deliveries and contribute to a healthier future generation in Rwanda.

                Background Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, has emerged as a global health concern due to the migration of infected individuals. With its epidemiological complexity, by difficulty to obtain appropriate diagnoses and poor treatment, the search for novel therapeutic options remains. Methods In this context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies employing animal models to verify the progress in CD treatment. We searched the PubMed database for CD treatment studies published between 1990 and 2023, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Results Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that the fifteen treatment alternatives examined, mainly between 2010 and 2014, demonstrated efficacy in experimental CD models, evidenced by significant parasitemia reduction. Bis-triazole DO870 and VNI were effective in the acute and chronic phases, respectively. However, of these emerging therapies, only posaconazole and fexinidazole have progressed to clinical trials, yielding unsatisfactory outcomes as CD monotherapies Conclusions This meta-analysis highlights the existence of promising new drug candidates for CD treatment, but most remain in the preclinical stages. Those that reached clinical trials did not demonstrate optimal results, underscoring the ongoing challenges in CD therapy. Collaborative efforts among the academic community, pharmaceutical industries, funding agencies, and government agencies are urgently needed to accelerate the development of more effective medications against CD.

                Background: Mammary cancer, called breast cancer in humans, results from the abnormal growth of cells in the mammary glands that attack the surrounding tissue. The process of carcinogenesis at the molecular level can be monitored through the production of proteins as biomarkers for carcinogenesis. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) is a known carcinogenic compound. This study aimed to analyze the proteomic profile as critical data regarding DMBA-induced carcinogenesis in Sprague‒Dawley rats. Methods: Experimental animals were divided into two groups: a treatment group given DMBA at a dose of 10 mg/kg (intramammary) at intervals of 48 hours for a total of 10 doses, and a negative control group that was not given any treatment. Measurement of the total protein concentration was carried out using a spectrophotometer, and the data were analyzed using a t-test, while the characterization of protein profiles was carried out based on molecular weight data using SDS‒PAGE. Mammary gland histopathology was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Results: The results showed a significant (p<0.05) increase of 27% in the total protein concentration in the rat mammary cancer model. The results of proteomic characterization showed a protein profile containing proteins of 187, 169, 68, 64, 53, 41, 24, 18, and 14 kDa, which were suspected to be HER-2, Nischarin, COX-2, Albumine, Vimentin, ACTB, TNF, p16, and fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), respectively. Histopathology of the mammary glands showed an irregular and indistinct arrangement of the alveoli and extensive epithelial cell proliferation from the surface to the lumen of the mammary ducts, and the mammary stroma showed the formation of new epithelial cells, which were cancer cells that spread to surrounding tissue. Conclusions: The proteomic profile was strongly associated with morphological alterations in mammary carcinogenesis in a rat model of DMBA-induced mammary cancer.

                Background. The return to normality post-pandemic brought some inconveniences to the population, especially students. To evaluate the frequency of awake bruxism behaviors through the use of an app on smartphones in dental students returning to presential classes. Awake bruxism was evaluated with the creation of an app that according to the authors evaluates: relaxed jaw muscles, dental contact, jaw effort, clenching teeth and teeth grinding, 5 frequent oral conditions in the population. The frequency of awake/daytime bruxism (AB) in healthy individuals when comparing other populations with possible risk factors for additive bruxism (psychological factors, depression, suicide delusions, etc.), evaluating consequent clinical signs (fatigue, muscle pain, attritions and dental openings). Methods: The sample of three hundred (n=300) young adults legally enrolled in two Ecuadorian universities, the sample was selected among fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth semester students legally enrolled and who are attending Faculty of Dentistry classes in 2 different cities (Quito and Guayaquil). The app was configured to provide 20 alerts during the day x seven days a week, in real time. Results. The study obtained 95% reliability and 5% error in research, was used. The relaxation condition was present in all users, but 40% of the alerts were associated with jaw and tooth discomfort, 39% corresponded to the discomfort of mandibular clenching, and 24% corresponded to tooth contact. A direct significant association was found between the state of relaxation and nonrelaxation, with a high probability of reports related to nonrelaxation (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: Awake bruxism with the app was evaluated, identifying 5 behaviors such as: relaxed mandibular muscles, dental contact, mandibular effort, clenching and grinding teeth, frequent conditions in the population; reporting a state of mandibular relaxation, there is a high probability that a condition of nonrelaxation would be reported (p≤0.05).

                Background Women’s educational attainment and their generation of value through education has increased the prospects for achieving economic equality between men and women. However, women continue to earn lower wages than men, reflecting growing inequality in several countries. Therefore, the objective of the study is to estimate the impact of education on the gender wage gap in Peru over the period 2017-2021. Methods Quantitative, explanatory study aimed at identifying the impact of education on the gender wage gap in Peru during the period 2017-2021. The research design is non-experimental and uses a time series that analyses the influence of the latent variable of education on the gender wage gap. This is a continuous variable to estimate the Tobit model. Results The results show that the gender gap in Peru exhibited a decreasing trend between men and women during the period 2017-2020, with an average reduction of 10% until 2020 due to the health crisis. The highest average salary was achieved by men in 2019, reaching S/2289.97 soles, while women reached an average salary of S/1368.85 soles. In the post-pandemic scenario for 2021, the gender gap increased by 3%, with men earning an average salary of S/1999.63 soles and women earning an average salary of S/1281.16 soles. The analysis from 2017-2021 shows that years of education had a positive impact on the gender wage gap in Peru based on the Tobit model estimation. Conclusions During the analysis period of 2017-2021, years of education had a positive impact on the gender wage gap in Peru, with the greatest impact occurring during the health crisis. The probability of women’s incomes improving with an increase in years of education was 2.35%, while for men, the highest impact was in 2018, with a probability of income improvement of 2.16% in terms of marginal effect.

                Background Research waste has become an increasing issue for research institutions and researchers due to poor research reproducibility and replicability. Interventions to improve research quality at research institutions are important to reduce research waste. This review aims to identify and classify possible interventions to improve research quality, reduce waste, and improve reproducibility and replicability within research-performing institutions. Methods Steps to develop the taxonomy were 1) Use an exemplar paper looking at journal-level interventions to improve research quality, 2) Adapt intervention titles to align with Michie’s behaviour change wheel, 3) Conduct a 2-stage search in PubMed using seed articles and reviews, and a forward and backward citation search to identify articles that evaluated or described the implementation of interventions to improve research quality, 4) Pilot draft taxonomy with researchers at an openscience conference workshop, and 5) Iterative drafting and revisions by the research team. Results Overall, 93 individual interventions were identified through the peer-review literature and researcher reporting. Eleven peer-reviewed articles were identified. Interventions identified covered research stages from before, during, and after study conduct, and whole of institution. Types of intervention included: Tools, Education & Training, Incentives, Modelling and Mentoring, Review & Feedback, Expert involvement, and Policies & Procedures. The taxonomy identified areas for research institutions to focus on to improve research quality, reproducibility, and replicability. Conclusions Areas of focus and future research include improving incentives to implement quality research practices, evaluating current interventions, encouraging no- or low-cost and high-benefit interventions, examining institution culture and individual research ethos, and encouraging researcher mentor-mentee relationships.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                <p>by Seth Commichaux, Tu Luan, Harihara Subrahmaniam Muralidharan, Mihai Pop</p>

For decades, the 16S rRNA gene has been used to taxonomically classify prokaryotic species and to taxonomically profile microbial communities. However, the 16S rRNA gene has been criticized for being too conserved to differentiate between distinct species. We argue that the inability to differentiate between species is not a unique feature of the 16S rRNA gene. Rather, we observe the gradual loss of species-level resolution for other nearly-universal prokaryotic marker genes as the number of gene sequences increases in reference databases. This trend was strongly correlated with how represented a taxonomic group was in the database and indicates that, at the gene-level, the boundaries between many species might be fuzzy. Through our study, we argue that any approach that relies on a single marker to distinguish bacterial taxa is fraught even if some markers appear to be discriminative in current databases.

                <p>by Michael B. Sohn, Cynthia Monaco, Steven R. Gill</p>

In many omics data, including microbiome sequencing data, we are only able to measure relative information. Various computational or statistical methods have been proposed to extract absolute (or biologically relevant) information from this relative information; however, these methods are under rather strong assumptions that may not be suitable for multigroup (more than two groups) and/or longitudinal outcome data. In this article, we first introduce the minimal assumption required to extract absolute from relative information. This assumption is less stringent than those imposed in existing methods, thus being applicable to multigroup and/or longitudinal outcome data. We then propose the first normalization method that works under this minimal assumption. The optimality and validity of the proposed method and its beneficial effects on downstream analysis are demonstrated in extensive simulation studies, where existing methods fail to produce consistent performance under the minimal assumption. We also demonstrate its application to real microbiome datasets to determine biologically relevant microbes to a specific disease/condition.

                <p>by Anton Suvorov, Daniel R. Schrider</p>

A phylogenetic tree represents hypothesized evolutionary history for a set of taxa. Besides the branching patterns (i.e., tree topology), phylogenies contain information about the evolutionary distances (i.e. branch lengths) between all taxa in the tree, which include extant taxa (external nodes) and their last common ancestors (internal nodes). During phylogenetic tree inference, the branch lengths are typically co-estimated along with other phylogenetic parameters during tree topology space exploration. There are well-known regions of the branch length parameter space where accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees is especially difficult. Several novel studies have recently demonstrated that machine learning approaches have the potential to help solve phylogenetic problems with greater accuracy and computational efficiency. In this study, as a proof of concept, we sought to explore the possibility of machine learning models to predict branch lengths. To that end, we designed several deep learning frameworks to estimate branch lengths on fixed tree topologies from multiple sequence alignments or its representations. Our results show that deep learning methods can exhibit superior performance in some difficult regions of branch length parameter space. For example, in contrast to maximum likelihood inference, which is typically used for estimating branch lengths, deep learning methods are more efficient and accurate. In general, we find that our neural networks achieve similar accuracy to a Bayesian approach and are the best-performing methods when inferring long branches that are associated with distantly related taxa. Together, our findings represent a next step toward accurate, fast, and reliable phylogenetic inference with machine learning approaches.

<i>Plasmodium</i> parasites cause Malaria disease, which remains a significant threat to global health, affecting 200 million people and causing 400,000 deaths yearly. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> remain the two main malaria species affecting humans. Identifying the malaria disease in blood smears requires years of expertise, even for highly trained specialists. Literature studies have been coping with the automatic identification and classification of malaria. However, several points must be addressed and investigated so these automatic methods can be used clinically in a Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) scenario. In this work, we assess the transfer learning approach by using well-known pre-trained deep learning architectures. We considered a database with 6222 Region of Interest (ROI), of which 6002 are from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC), and 220 were acquired locally by us at Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) in Porto Velho Velho, Rondônia—Brazil, which is part of the legal Amazon. We exhaustively cross-validated the dataset using 100 distinct partitions with 80% train and 20% test for each considering circular ROIs (rough segmentation). Our experimental results show that DenseNet201 has a potential to identify <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites in ROIs (infected or uninfected) of microscopic images, achieving 99.41% AUC with a fast processing time. We further validated our results, showing that DenseNet201 was significantly better (99% confidence interval) than the other networks considered in the experiment. Our results support claiming that transfer learning with texture features potentially differentiates subjects with malaria, spotting those with <i>Plasmodium</i> even in Leukocytes images, which is a challenge. In Future work, we intend scale our approach by adding more data and developing a friendly user interface for CAD use. We aim at aiding the worldwide population and our local natives living nearby the legal Amazon’s rivers.

                <p>by Alireza Zaeemzadeh, Giulio Tononi</p>

Originally developed as a theory of consciousness, integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to quantify the causal irreducibility of systems and subsets of units in the system. Specifically, <i>mechanism integrated information</i> quantifies how much of the causal powers of a subset of units in a state, also referred to as a mechanism, cannot be accounted for by its parts. If the causal powers of the mechanism can be fully explained by its parts, it is reducible and its integrated information is zero. Here, we study the upper bound of this measure and how it is achieved. We study mechanisms in isolation, groups of mechanisms, and groups of causal relations among mechanisms. We put forward new theoretical results that show mechanisms that share parts with each other cannot all achieve their maximum. We also introduce techniques to design systems that can maximize the integrated information of a subset of their mechanisms or relations. Our results can potentially be used to exploit the symmetries and constraints to reduce the computations significantly and to compare different connectivity profiles in terms of their maximal achievable integrated information.

                <p>by Andrew A. Schmidt, Alexander Y. Grosberg, Anna Grosberg</p>

Understanding muscle contraction mechanisms is a standing challenge, and one of the approaches has been to create models of the sarcomere–the basic contractile unit of striated muscle. While these models have been successful in elucidating many aspects of muscle contraction, they fall short in explaining the energetics of functional phenomena, such as rigor, and in particular, their dependence on the concentrations of the biomolecules involved in the cross-bridge cycle. Our hypothesis posits that the stochastic time delay between ATP adsorption and ADP/Pi release in the cross-bridge cycle necessitates a modeling approach where the rates of these two reaction steps are controlled by two independent parts of the total free energy change of the hydrolysis reaction. To test this hypothesis, we built a two-filament, stochastic-mechanical half-sarcomere model that separates the energetic roles of ATP and ADP/Pi in the cross-bridge cycle’s free energy landscape. Our results clearly demonstrate that there is a nontrivial dependence of the cross-bridge cycle’s kinetics on the independent concentrations of ATP, ADP, and Pi. The simplicity of the proposed model allows for analytical solutions of the more basic systems, which provide novel insight into the dominant mechanisms driving some of the experimentally observed contractile phenomena.

Cells exhibit various morphological characteristics due to their physiological activities, and changes in cell morphology are inherently accompanied by the assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Stress fibers are a prominent component of the actin-based intracellular structure and are highly involved in numerous physiological processes, e.g., mechanotransduction and maintenance of cell morphology. Although it is widely accepted that variations in cell morphology interact with the distribution and localization of stress fibers, it remains unclear if there are underlying geometric principles between the cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton. Here, we present a machine learning system that uses the diffusion model to convert the cell shape to the distribution and alignment of stress fibers. By training with corresponding cell shape and stress fibers datasets, our system learns the conversion to generate the stress fiber images from its corresponding cell shape. The predicted stress fiber distribution agrees well with the experimental data. With this conversion relation, our system allows for performing virtual experiments that provide a visual map showing the probability of stress fiber distribution from the virtual cell shape. Our system potentially provides a powerful approach to seek further hidden geometric principles regarding how the configuration of subcellular structures is determined by the boundary of the cell structure; for example, we found that the stress fibers of cells with small aspect ratios tend to localize at the cell edge while cells with large aspect ratios have homogenous distributions.

                <p>by Rune Höper, Daria Komkova, Tomáš Zavřel, Ralf Steuer</p>

The metabolism of phototrophic cyanobacteria is an integral part of global biogeochemical cycles, and the capability of cyanobacteria to assimilate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> into organic carbon has manifold potential applications for a sustainable biotechnology. To elucidate the properties of cyanobacterial metabolism and growth, computational reconstructions of genome-scale metabolic networks play an increasingly important role. Here, we present an updated reconstruction of the metabolic network of the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and its quantitative evaluation using flux balance analysis (FBA). To overcome limitations of conventional FBA, and to allow for the integration of experimental analyses, we develop a novel approach to describe light absorption and light utilization within the framework of FBA. Our approach incorporates photoinhibition and a variable quantum yield into the constraint-based description of light-limited phototrophic growth. We show that the resulting model is capable of predicting quantitative properties of cyanobacterial growth, including photosynthetic oxygen evolution and the ATP/NADPH ratio required for growth and cellular maintenance. Our approach retains the computational and conceptual simplicity of FBA and is readily applicable to other phototrophic microorganisms.

                <p>by Teemu J. Rintala, Vittorio Fortino</p>

Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. We present the COPS R-package, tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies.

                <p>by The CRyPTIC consortium </p>

There remains a clinical need for better approaches to rapid drug susceptibility testing in view of the increasing burden of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Binary susceptibility phenotypes only capture changes in minimum inhibitory concentration when these cross the critical concentration, even though other changes may be clinically relevant. We developed a machine learning system to predict minimum inhibitory concentration from unassembled whole-genome sequencing data for 13 anti-tuberculosis drugs. We trained, validated and tested the system on 10,859 isolates from the CRyPTIC dataset. Essential agreement rates (predicted MIC within one doubling dilution of observed MIC) were above 92% for first-line drugs, 91% for fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, and 90% for new and repurposed drugs, albeit with a significant drop in performance for the very few phenotypically resistant isolates in the latter group. To further validate the model in the absence of external MIC datasets, we predicted MIC and converted values to binary for an external set of 15,239 isolates with binary phenotypes, and compare their performance against a previously validated mutation catalogue, the expected performance of existing molecular assays, and World Health Organization Target Product Profiles. The sensitivity of the model on the external dataset was greater than 90% for all drugs except ethionamide, clofazimine and linezolid. Specificity was greater than 95% for all drugs except ethambutol, ethionamide, bedaquiline, delamanid and clofazimine. The proposed system can provide quantitative susceptibility phenotyping to help guide antimicrobial therapy, although further data collection and validation are required before machine learning can be used clinically for all drugs.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has generated a considerable number of infections and associated morbidity and mortality across the world. Recovery from these infections, combined with the onset of large-scale vaccination, have led to rapidly-changing population-level immunological landscapes. In turn, these complexities have highlighted a number of important unknowns related to the breadth and strength of immunity following recovery or vaccination. Using simple mathematical models, we investigate the medium-term impacts of waning immunity against severe disease on immuno-epidemiological dynamics. We find that uncertainties in the duration of severity-blocking immunity (imparted by either infection or vaccination) can lead to a large range of medium-term population-level outcomes (<i>i.e</i>. infection characteristics and immune landscapes). Furthermore, we show that epidemiological dynamics are sensitive to the strength and duration of underlying host immune responses; this implies that determining infection levels from hospitalizations requires accurate estimates of these immune parameters. More durable vaccines both reduce these uncertainties and alleviate the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in pessimistic outcomes. However, heterogeneity in vaccine uptake drastically changes immune landscapes toward larger fractions of individuals with waned severity-blocking immunity. In particular, if hesitancy is substantial, more robust vaccines have almost no effects on population-level immuno-epidemiology, even if vaccination rates are compensatorily high among vaccine-adopters. This pessimistic scenario for vaccination heterogeneity arises because those few individuals that are vaccine-adopters are so readily re-vaccinated that the duration of vaccinal immunity has no appreciable consequences on their immune status. Furthermore, we find that this effect is heightened if vaccine-hesitants have increased transmissibility (<i>e.g</i>. due to riskier behavior). Overall, our results illustrate the necessity to characterize both transmission-blocking and severity-blocking immune time scales. Our findings also underline the importance of developing robust next-generation vaccines with equitable mass vaccine deployment.

Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous across the kingdoms of life and serve important roles in regulating physiology and behavior at many levels. These rhythms occur in ~24-hour cycles and are driven by a core molecular oscillator. Circadian timekeeping enables organisms to anticipate daily changes by timing their growth and internal processes. <i>Neurospora crassa</i> is a model organism with a long history in circadian biology, having conserved eukaryotic clock properties and observable circadian phenotypes. A core approach for measuring circadian function in Neurospora is to follow daily oscillations in the direction of growth and spore formation along a thin glass tube (race tube). While leveraging robust phenotypic readouts is useful, interpreting the outputs of large-scale race tube experiments by hand can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To provide the field with an efficient tool for analyzing race tubes, we present Rhythmidia, a graphical user interface (GUI) tool written in Python for calculating circadian periods and growth rates of Neurospora. Rhythmidia is open source, has been benchmarked against the current state-of-the-art, and is easily accessible on GitHub.

                <p>by Robby Concha-Eloko, Michiel Stock, Bernard De Baets, Yves Briers, Rafael Sanjuan, Pilar Domingo-Calap, Dimitri Boeckaerts</p>

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria. Many of them produce specific enzymes called depolymerases to break down external polysaccharide structures. Accurate annotation and domain identification of these depolymerases are challenging due to their inherent sequence diversity. Hence, we present DepoScope, a machine learning tool that combines a fine-tuned ESM-2 model with a convolutional neural network to identify depolymerase sequences and their enzymatic domains precisely. To accomplish this, we curated a dataset from the INPHARED phage genome database, created a polysaccharide-degrading domain database, and applied sequential filters to construct a high-quality dataset, which is subsequently used to train DepoScope. Our work is the first approach that combines sequence-level predictions with amino-acid-level predictions for accurate depolymerase detection and functional domain identification. In that way, we believe that DepoScope can greatly enhance our understanding of phage-host interactions at the level of depolymerases.

                <p>by Priscilla E. Greenwood, Lawrence M. Ward</p>

Synchronous neural oscillations are strongly associated with a variety of perceptual, cognitive, and behavioural processes. It has been proposed that the role of the synchronous oscillations in these processes is to facilitate information transmission between brain areas, the ‘communication through coherence,’ or CTC hypothesis. The details of how this mechanism would work, however, and its causal status, are still unclear. Here we investigate computationally a proposed mechanism for selective attention that directly implicates the CTC as causal. The mechanism involves alpha band (about 10 Hz) oscillations, originating in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, being sent to communicating cortical areas, organizing gamma (about 40 Hz) oscillations there, and thus facilitating phase coherence and communication between them. This is proposed to happen contingent on control signals sent from higher-level cortical areas to the thalamic reticular nucleus, which controls the alpha oscillations sent to cortex by the pulvinar. We studied the scope of this mechanism in parameter space, and limitations implied by this scope, using a computational implementation of our conceptual model. Our results indicate that, although the CTC-based mechanism can account for some effects of top-down and bottom-up attentional selection, its limitations indicate that an alternative mechanism, in which oscillatory coherence is caused by communication between brain areas rather than being a causal factor for it, might operate in addition to, or even instead of, the CTC mechanism.

Bacterial pathogens utilize the factors of their hosts to infect them, but which factors they exploit remain poorly defined. Here, we show that a pathogenic <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>Tm) exploits host polyamines for the functional expression of virulence factors. An <i>S</i>Tm mutant strain lacking principal genes required for polyamine synthesis and transport exhibited impaired infectivity in mice. A polyamine uptake-impaired strain of <i>S</i>Tm was unable to inject effectors of the type 3 secretion system into host cells due to a failure of needle assembly. <i>S</i>Tm infection stimulated host polyamine production by increasing arginase expression. The decline in polyamine levels caused by difluoromethylornithine, which inhibits host polyamine production, attenuated <i>S</i>Tm colonization, whereas polyamine supplementation augmented <i>S</i>Tm pathogenesis. Our work reveals that host polyamines are a key factor promoting <i>S</i>Tm infection, and therefore a promising therapeutic target for bacterial infection.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The master control of mammalian circadian rhythms is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is formed by the ventral and dorsal regions. In SCN neurons, GABA has an important function and even excitatory actions in adulthood. However, the physiological role of this neurotransmitter in the developing SCN is unknown. Here, we recorded GABAergic postsynaptic currents (in the perforated-patch configuration using gramicidin) to determine the chloride reversal potential (E<sub>Cl</sub>) and also assessed the immunological expression of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) at early ages of the rat (postnatal days (P) 3 to 25), during the day and night, in the two SCN regions. We detected that E<sub>Cl</sub> greatly varied with age and depending on the SCN region and time of day. Broadly speaking, E<sub>Cl</sub> was more hyperpolarized with age, except for the oldest age studied (P20–25) in both day and night in the ventral SCN, where it was less negative. Likewise, E<sub>Cl</sub> was more hyperpolarized in the dorsal SCN both during the day and at night; while E<sub>Cl</sub> was more negative at night both in the ventral and the dorsal SCN. Moreover, the total NKCC1 fluorescent expression was higher during the day than at night. These results imply that NKCC1 regulates the circadian and developmental fluctuations in the [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to fine-tune E<sub>Cl</sub>, which is crucial for either excitatory or inhibitory GABAergic actions to occur in the SCN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90565">Combining array tomography with electron tomography provides insights into leakiness of the blood-brain barrier in mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Like other volume electron microscopy approaches, automated tape-collecting ultramicrotomy (ATUM) enables imaging of serial sections deposited on thick plastic tapes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ATUM is unique in enabling hierarchical imaging and thus efficient screening for target structures, as needed for correlative light and electron microscopy. However, SEM of sections on tape can only access the section surface, thereby limiting the axial resolution to the typical size of cellular vesicles with an order of magnitude lower than the acquired xy resolution. In contrast, serial-section electron tomography (ET), a transmission electron microscopy-based approach, yields isotropic voxels at full EM resolution, but requires deposition of sections on electron-stable thin and fragile films, thus making screening of large section libraries difficult and prone to section loss. To combine the strength of both approaches, we developed ‘ATUM-Tomo, a hybrid method, where sections are first reversibly attached to plastic tape via a dissolvable coating, and after screening detached and transferred to the ET-compatible thin films. As a proof-of-principle, we applied correlative ATUM-Tomo to study ultrastructural features of blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around microthrombi in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Microthrombi and associated sites of BBB leakiness were identified by confocal imaging of injected fluorescent and electron-dense nanoparticles, then relocalized by ATUM-SEM, and finally interrogated by correlative ATUM-Tomo. Overall, our new ATUM-Tomo approach will substantially advance ultrastructural analysis of biological phenomena that require cell- and tissue-level contextualization of the finest subcellular textures.

                Bathymodioline mussels dominate deep-sea methane seep and hydrothermal vent habitats and obtain nutrients and energy primarily through chemosynthetic endosymbiotic bacteria in the bacteriocytes of their gill. However, the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate mussel host–symbiont interactions remain unclear. Here, we constructed a comprehensive cell atlas of the gill in the mussel <i>Gigantidas platifrons</i> from the South China Sea methane seeps (1100 m depth) using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and whole-mount in situ hybridisation. We identified 13 types of cells, including three previously unknown ones, and uncovered unknown tissue heterogeneity. Every cell type has a designated function in supporting the gill’s structure and function, creating an optimal environment for chemosynthesis, and effectively acquiring nutrients from the endosymbiotic bacteria. Analysis of snRNA-seq of in situ transplanted mussels clearly showed the shifts in cell state in response to environmental oscillations. Our findings provide insight into the principles of host–symbiont interaction and the bivalves' environmental adaption mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95680">Disparity in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiological and fMRI signals</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state brain networks (RSNs) have been widely applied in health and disease, but the interpretation of RSNs in terms of the underlying neural activity is unclear. To address this fundamental question, we conducted simultaneous recordings of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and electrophysiology signals in two separate brain regions of rats. Our data reveal that for both recording sites, spatial maps derived from band-specific local field potential (LFP) power can account for up to 90% of the spatial variability in RSNs derived from rsfMRI signals. Surprisingly, the time series of LFP band power can only explain to a maximum of 35% of the temporal variance of the local rsfMRI time course from the same site. In addition, regressing out time series of LFP power from rsfMRI signals has minimal impact on the spatial patterns of rsfMRI-based RSNs. This disparity in the spatial and temporal relationships between resting-state electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals suggests that electrophysiological activity alone does not fully explain the effects observed in the rsfMRI signal, implying the existence of an rsfMRI component contributed by ‘electrophysiology-invisible’ signals. These findings offer a novel perspective on our understanding of RSN interpretation.

">Aversion-induced drug taking and escape behavior involve similar nucleus accumbens core dopamine signaling signatures</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) has long been associated with the promotion of motivated behavior. However, inhibited dopamine signaling can increase behavior in certain settings, such as during drug self-administration. While aversive environmental stimuli can reduce dopamine, it is unclear whether such stimuli reliably engage this mechanism in different contexts. Here we compared the physiological and behavioral responses to the same aversive stimulus in different designs to determine if there is uniformity in the manner that aversive stimuli are encoded and promote behavior. NAcC dopamine was measured using fiber photometry in male and female rats during cocaine self-administration sessions in which an acutely aversive 90 dB white noise was intermittently presented. In a separate group of rats, aversion-induced changes in dopamine were measured in an escape design in which operant responses terminated aversive white noise. Aversive white noise significantly reduced NAcC dopamine and increased cocaine self-administration in both male and female rats. The same relationship was observed in the escape design, in which white noise reduced dopamine and promoted escape attempts. In both designs, the magnitude of the dopamine reduction predicted behavioral performance. While prior research demonstrated that pharmacologically reduced dopamine signaling can promote intake, this report demonstrates that this physiological mechanism is naturally engaged by aversive environmental stimuli and generalizable to non-drug contexts. These findings illustrate a common physiological signature in response to aversion that may promote both adaptive and maladaptive behavior.

">Amyloid, Tau, and APOE in Alzheimer's Disease: Impact on White Matter Tracts</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss due to the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau tangles in the brain; its onset and progression also depend on genetic factors such as the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Understanding how these factors affect the brain's neural pathways is important for early diagnostics and interventions. Tractometry is an advanced technique for 3D quantitative assessment of white matter tracts, localizing microstructural abnormalities in diseased populations in vivo. In this work, we applied BUAN (Bundle Analytics) tractometry to 3D diffusion MRI data from 730 participants in ADNI3 (phase 3 of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; age range: 55-95 years, 349M/381F, 214 with mild cognitive impairment, 69 with AD, and 447 cognitively healthy controls). Using along-tract statistical analysis, we assessed the localized impact of amyloid, tau, and APOE genetic variants on the brain's neural pathways. BUAN quantifies microstructural properties of white matter tracts, supporting along-tract statistical analyses that identify factors associated with brain microstructure. We visualize the 3D profile of white matter tract associations with tau and amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease; strong associations near the cortex may support models of disease propagation along neural pathways. Relative to the neutral genotype, APOE epsilon3/epsilon3, carriers of the AD-risk conferring APOE epsilon4 genotype show microstructural abnormalities, while carriers of the protective epsilon2 genotype also show subtle differences. Of all the microstructural metrics, mean diffusivity (MD) generally shows the strongest associations with AD pathology, followed by axial diffusivity (AxD) and radial diffusivity (RD), while fractional anisotropy (FA) is typically the least sensitive metric. Along-tract microstructural metrics are sensitive to tau and amyloid accumulation, showing the potential of diffusion MRI to track AD pathology and map its impact on neural pathways.

">The molecular diversity of hippocampal regions and strata at synaptic resolution revealed by integrated transcriptomic and proteomic profiling</a></h4>

              
                The molecular diversity of neurons and their synapses underlies the different responses and plasticity profiles that drive all neural circuits and behavior. While the extent of this diversity has been partially revealed by transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, combined studies of neuronal transcripts and proteins are limited. Here, we used microdissection of mouse hippocampal subregions and CA1 strata and fluorescence-activated synaptosome sorting (FASS) to characterize the transcripts and proteins from different hippocampal neurons and their compartments with synaptic resolution. Parallel RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS of microdissections identified over 15,000 mRNA transcripts and 10,000 proteins, revealing thousands with local enrichment such as classes of glutamate receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels, myelin-associated molecules, and adhesion molecules. Synaptosome analysis further identified specific enrichment of molecules from collagen, ribosome, solute carrier, and receptor families at different synapses formed along CA1 neurons. By integrating mRNA and protein data, we defined clusters of co-regulated molecules such as adhesion and neurofilament proteins and transporter mRNAs, and found subsets of mRNA-protein pairs with strong correlation and anti-correlation in their abundance variation. Our findings comprise a rich resource on the molecular landscape of the hippocampus and its synapses that is accessible at syndive.org, and highlight the coordinated organization of transcripts and proteins between regions, neuronal compartments, and synapses.

">Investigating cocaine- and abstinence-induced effects on astrocyte gene expression in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, astrocytes have been increasingly implicated in cellular mechanisms of substance use disorders (SUD). Astrocytes are structurally altered following exposure to drugs of abuse; specifically, astrocytes within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) exhibit significantly decreased surface area, volume, and synaptic colocalization after operant self-administration of cocaine and extinction or protracted abstinence (45 days). However, the mechanisms that elicit these morphological modifications are unknown. The current study aims to elucidate the molecular modifications that lead to observed astrocyte structural changes in rats across cocaine abstinence using astrocyte-specific RiboTag and RNA-seq, as an unbiased, comprehensive approach to identify genes whose transcription or translation change within NAc astrocytes following cocaine self-administration and extended abstinence. Using this method, our data reveal cellular processes including cholesterol biosynthesis that are altered specifically by cocaine self-administration and abstinence, suggesting that astrocyte involvement in these processes is changed in cocaine-abstinent rats. Overall, the results of this study provide insight into astrocyte functional adaptations that occur due to cocaine exposure or during cocaine withdrawal, which may pinpoint further mechanisms that contribute to cocaine-seeking behavior.

                Alterations to sensory feedback can drive robust adaptive changes to the production of consonants and vowels, but these changes often have no behavioral relevance or benefit to communication (e.g., making "head" more like "had"). This work aims to align the outcomes of adaptation with changes known to increase speech intelligibility - specifically, adaptations that increase the acoustic contrast between vowels in running speech. To this end, we implemented a vowel centralization feedback perturbation paradigm that pushes all vowels towards the center of vowel space, making them sound less distinct from one another. Speakers across the adult lifespan adapted to the centralization perturbation during sentence production, increasing the global acoustic contrast among vowels and the articulatory excursions for individual vowels. These changes persisted after the perturbation was removed, including after a silent delay, and showed robust transfer to words that were not present in the sentences. Control analyses demonstrated that these effects were unlikely to be due to explicit pronunciation strategies and occurred in the face of increasingly more rapid and less distinct production of familiar sentences. Finally, sentence transcription by crowd-sourced listeners showed that speakers' vowel contrast predicted their baseline intelligibility and that experimentally-induced increases in contrast predicted intelligibility gains. These findings establish the validity of a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm to implicitly increase vowel contrast and intelligibility in connected speech, an outcome that has the potential to enhance rehabilitation in individuals who present with a reduced vowel space due to motor speech disorders, such as the hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson's disease.

">Mapping Kappa Opioid Receptor Binding in Titi Monkeys with 11C-GR103545 PET</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) plays a pivotal role in stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, especially in social separation and bonding. However, KOR modulations in these social contexts are not fully characterized. The coppery titi monkey (Plecturocebus cupreus) has been utilized as a translational animal model for studying the neurobiology of attachment, as they form socially monogamous adult pair bonds. While the PET radiotracer 11C-GR103545 has shown the ability to track KOR activity in other species, it has not been utilized in titi monkeys. This study assessed 11C-GR103545 PET for characterizing KOR activity in vivo and its pharmacological blockade in titi monkeys. Methods: Adult titi monkeys (N=6) underwent 11C-GR103545 PET brain scans at baseline, followed by repeat scans upon administration of a KOR antagonist (CERC-501) and a KOR agonist (U50,488). Region-specific, non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated, with the cerebellum as the reference region, focusing on 14 brain volumes of interest (VOIs) implicated in social bonding. Results: Baseline 11C-GR103545 uptake characteristics across VOIs were consistent with previous reports in humans and other monkey models. CERC-501 pretreatment led to a significant reduction in BPND (average 55.99%) across several, but not all brain VOIs, with the most notable reduction in the superior frontal gyrus (76.25%). In contrast, U50,488 pretreatment resulted in no significant BPND changes across the VOIs analyzed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of 11C-GR103545 to assess KOR binding dynamics in a monkey model of social bonding. Region-specific blockade of KOR was observed after pretreatment by CERC-501, while blockade by the KOR agonist U50,488 did not change 11C-GR103545 binding.

">Patient-specific therapeutic benefit of MuSK agonist antibody ARGX-119 in MuSK myasthenia gravis passive transfer models</a></h4>

              
                Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) orchestrates establishment and maintenance of neuromuscular synapses, which enable muscle contraction. Autoantibodies targeting MuSK cause myasthenia gravis (MG), a disease characterized by fatigable skeletal muscle weakness which requires chronic immunosuppressive treatment and ventilatory support at some point in ~30% of patients. MuSK autoantibodies are predominantly IgG4 and are bispecific, functionally monovalent antibodies due to Fab-arm exchange. Through monovalent binding, MuSK IgG4 autoantibodies act as antagonists on the MuSK signalling pathway, impairing neuromuscular synaptic function. In contrast, bivalent MuSK antibodies act as agonists of the MuSK signalling pathway. Since symptoms in MuSK MG are largely caused by antagonistic monovalent MuSK antibodies, we hypothesized that a bivalent MuSK agonist could rescue MuSK MG, bypassing the need for generalized immunosuppression. In this study, we investigated whether an agonist antibody targeting the Frizzled- like domain of MuSK, ARGX-119, can ameliorate disease in MuSK MG models induced by passive transfer of polyclonal IgG4 from unrelated patients. For each patient material we first established the minimal dose for a progressive MG phenotype based on muscle function tests. ARGX-119 significantly improved survival and muscle weakness in a mouse model induced by one patient material, but not by three others. Mechanistically, this patient-specific efficacy could not be explained by autoantibody epitope specificity, titer or competition for ARGX-119 binding, but rather correlated to the presence of MuSK activating antibodies in some patients. We further provide evidence that an in vitro assay may predict which patients potentially benefit from ARGX-119 and that this treatment, when effective in MuSK MG mice, follows a bell-shaped dose-effect curve. These results provide first proof of concept of a MuSK agonist in a clinically relevant model for MuSK MG. We anticipate this to be a starting point for investigating the therapeutic benefit of ARGX-119 in MuSK MG and other neuromuscular diseases hallmarked by neuromuscular synaptic dysfunction.

">Synapse weakening-induced caspase-3 activity confers specificity to microglia-mediated synapse elimination</a></h4>

              
                During brain development, synapses are initially formed in excess and are later eliminated in an activity-dependent manner, with weak synapses being preferentially removed. Previous studies identified glia as mediators of synapse removal, but it is unclear how glia specifically target weak synapses. Here we show that, in the developing mouse visual pathway, inhibiting synaptic transmission induces postsynaptic activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 is essential for synapse elimination driven by both spontaneous and experience-dependent neural activity. Synapse weakening-induced caspase-3 activation determines the specificity of synapse elimination mediated by microglia but not astrocytes. Furthermore, in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease, caspase-3 deficiency protects against synapse loss induced by amyloid-b deposition. Our results reveal caspase-3 activation as a key step in activity-dependent synapse elimination during development and synapse loss in neurodegeneration.

">Nanoscale volumetric fluorescence imaging via photochemical sectioning</a></h4>

              
                Optical nanoscopy of intact biological specimens has been transformed by recent advancements in hydrogel-based tissue clearing and expansion, enabling the imaging of cellular and subcellular structures with molecular contrast. However, existing high-resolution fluorescence microscopes have limited imaging depth, which prevents the study of whole-mount specimens without physical sectioning. To address this challenge, we developed "photochemical sectioning," a spatially precise, light-based sample sectioning process. By combining photochemical sectioning with volumetric lattice light-sheet imaging and petabyte-scale computation, we imaged and reconstructed axons and myelination sheaths across entire mouse olfactory bulbs at nanoscale resolution. An olfactory-bulb-wide analysis of myelinated and unmyelinated axons revealed distinctive patterns of axon degeneration and de-/dysmyelination in the neurodegenerative mouse, highlighting the potential for peta- to exabyte-scale super-resolution studies using this approach.

">Increased listening effort and cochlear neural degeneration underlie behavioral deficits in speech perception in noise in normal hearing middle-aged adults.</a></h4>

              
                Middle-age is a critical period of rapid changes in brain function that presents an opportunity for early diagnostics and intervention for neurodegenerative conditions later in life. Hearing loss is one such early indicator linked to many comorbidities later in life. However, current clinical tests fail to capture hearing difficulties for ~10% of middle-aged adults seeking help at hearing clinics. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND) could play a role in these hearing deficits, but our current understanding is limited by the lack of objective diagnostics and uncertainty regarding its perceptual consequences. Here, using a cross-species approach, we measured envelope following responses (EFRs) - neural ensemble responses to sound originating from the peripheral auditory pathway - in young and middle-aged adults with normal audiometric thresholds, and compared these responses to young and middle-aged Mongolian gerbils, where CND was histologically confirmed. We observed near identical changes in EFRs across species that were associated with CND. Perceptual effects measured as behavioral readouts showed deficits in the most challenging listening conditions and were associated with CND. Additionally, pupil-indexed listening effort increased even at moderate task difficulties where behavioral outcomes were matched. Our results reveal perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults driven by CND and increases in listening effort, which may result in increased listening fatigue and conversational disengagement.

">Modeling impairment of ionic regulation with extended Adaptive Exponential integrate-and-fire models</a></h4>

              
                To model the dynamics of neuron membrane excitability many models can be considered, from the most biophysically detailed to the highest level of phenomenological description. Recent works at the single neuron level have shown the importance of taking into account the evolution of slow variables such as ionic concentration. A reduction of such a model to models of the integrate-and-fire family is interesting to then go to large network models. In this paper, we introduce a way to consider the impairment of ionic regulation by adding a third, slow, variable to the adaptive Exponential integrate-and-fire model (AdEx). We then implement and simulate a network including this model. We find that this network was able to generate normal and epileptic discharges. This model should be useful for the design of network simulations of normal and pathological states.

">Neural representational precision of distance predicts arithmetic performance</a></h4>

              
                Focusing on the distance between magnitudes as the start point to investigate the mechanism of relationship detecting and its contribution to mathematical thinking, this study explores the precision of neural representations of numerical distance and their impact on arithmetic performance. By employing neural decoding techniques and representational similarity analysis, the present study investigate how accurately the brain represents numerical distances and how this precision relates to arithmetic skills. Thirty-two children participated, completing a dot number comparison task during fMRI scanning and an arithmetic fluency test. Results indicated that neural activation patterns in the intra-parietal sulcus decoded the distance between the presented pair of dots, and higher precision in neural distance representation correlates with better arithmetic performance. These findings suggest that the accuracy of neural decoding can serve as an index of the neural representation precision and that the ability to precisely encode numerical distances in the brain is a key factor in mathematical abilities. This provides new insights into the neural basis of mathematical cognition and learning.

">Sensory population activity reveals confidence computations in the primate visual system</a></h4>

              
                Perception is fallible. Humans know this, and so do some non-human animals like macaque monkeys. When monkeys report more confidence in a perceptual decision, that decision is more likely to be correct. It is not known how neural circuits in the primate brain assess the quality of perceptual decisions. Here, we test two hypotheses. First, that decision confidence is related to the structure of population activity in sensory cortex. And second, that this relation differs from the one between sensory activity and decision content. We trained macaque monkeys to judge the orientation of ambiguous stimuli and additionally report their confidence in these judgments. We recorded population activity in the primary visual cortex and used decoders to expose the relationship between this activity and the choice-confidence reports. Our analysis validated both hypotheses and suggests that perceptual decisions arise from a neural computation downstream of visual cortex that estimates the most likely interpretation of a sensory response, while decision confidence instead reflects a computation that evaluates whether this sensory response will produce a reliable decision. Our work establishes a direct link between neural population activity in sensory cortex and the metacognitive ability to introspect about the quality of perceptual decisions.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal region of the hippocampus (dHC) mediates many of the mnemonic functions traditionally associated with the hippocampus proper, such as spatial and episodic memory, whereas ventral hippocampus (vHC) has been extensively implicated in emotional memory and motivational processes. By contrast, the functions of the intermediate hippocampus (iHC) are far less understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mnemonic functions of iHC by reversibly inactivating iHC prior to testing memory in behavioral tasks dependent on the integrity of dHC, iHC, or vHC, namely, rapid place water maze, inhibitory avoidance, spontaneous alternation, and temporal ordering of odors. Given our previous findings showing that dHC and vHC are involved in mnemonic control of ingestive behavior, we also assessed the effects of iHC inactivation on sucrose intake. The results showed that pharmacological inhibition of iHC impairs rapid place water maze memory, which has been previously shown to be dependent on iHC but not dHC or vHC. iHC inactivation does not impact memory dependent on dHC (spontaneous alternation), vHC (temporal odor memory), or either dHC or vHC (inhibitory avoidance), and only modestly affects sucrose intake. These findings provide support for the involvement of iHC in mnemonic functions that are distinct from dHC and vHC and highlight the need to further advance our understanding of the functions of this hippocampal region that has been relatively understudied.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the hippocampus has been implicated in both the temporal organization of memories and association of scene elements, some theoretical accounts posit that the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory is largely atemporal. In this study, we set out to explore this discrepancy by identifying hippocampal activity patterns related to scene construction while participants performed a temporal order memory task. Participants in the fMRI scanner were shown a sequence of photographs, each consisting of a central object and a contextual background scene. On each retrieval trial, participants were shown a pair of the original photographs (FULL), objects from the scenes without the background (OBJ), or background contexts without the main foreground object (BACK). In the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, participants judged the temporal order of the pair of scenes; in the Viewing trials, two identical scenes were shown without any task. First, we found that the anterior hippocampus—particularly the CA1 and subiculum—showed similar patterns of activation between the BACK and OBJ conditions, suggesting that scene construction occurred spontaneously during both TOJ and Viewing. Furthermore, neural markers of scene construction in the anterior hippocampus did not apply to incorrect trials, showing that successful temporal memory retrieval was functionally linked to scene construction. In the cortex, time-processing areas, such as the supplementary motor area and the precuneus, and scene-processing areas, such as the parahippocampal cortex, were activated and functionally connected with the hippocampus. Together, these results support the view that the hippocampus is concurrently involved in scene construction and temporal organization of memory and propose a model of hippocampal episodic memory that takes both processes into account.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. Objective surrogate markers sensitive to detect changes in disease severity are needed to reduce sample sizes in interventional trials and identification of predictors of faster disease progression would facilitate patient selection, enrichment, or stratification in such trials.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal, multimodal study in 34 ataxic SCA1 individuals and 21 healthy controls. We collected clinical, patient-reported outcomes, biochemical and magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers at baseline and after 1 year. We determined 1-year progression and evaluated the potential predictive value of several baseline markers on 1-year disease progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, multiple structural and spectroscopic MR markers in pons and cerebellum differentiated SCA1 from healthy controls and correlated with disease severity. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) chain and CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were elevated in SCA1. In longitudinal analysis, total brainstem and pontine volume change, inventory of non-ataxia signs (INAS) count, and SCA functional index (SCAFI) showed larger responsiveness compared to the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).</p>
<p>Longer disease duration, longer non-expanded CAG repeat length, and higher disease burden were associated with faster SARA increase after 1-year in the SCA1 group. Similarly, lower baseline brainstem, pontine, and cerebellar volumes, as well as lower levels of N-acetylaspartate and glutamate in the cerebellar white matter, were also associated with faster SARA increase.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results guide the selection of the most sensitive measures of disease progression in SCA1 and have identified features associated with accelerated progression that could inform the design of clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To develop a multiparametric machine-learning (ML) framework using high-resolution 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) fingerprinting (MRF) data for quantitative characterization of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>We included 119 subjects, 33 patients with focal epilepsy and histopathologically confirmed FCD, 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs), and 26 disease controls (DCs). Subjects underwent whole-brain 3 Tesla MRF acquisition, the reconstruction of which generated T1 and T2 relaxometry maps. A 3D region of interest was manually created for each lesion, and z-score normalization using HC data was performed. We conducted 2D classification with ensemble models using MRF T1 and T2 mean and standard deviation from gray matter and white matter for FCD versus controls. Subtype classification additionally incorporated entropy and uniformity of MRF metrics, as well as morphometric features from the morphometric analysis program (MAP). We translated 2D results to individual probabilities using the percentage of slices above an adaptive threshold. These probabilities and clinical variables were input into a support vector machine for individual-level classification. Fivefold cross-validation was performed and performance metrics were reported using receiver-operating-characteristic-curve analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>FCD versus HC classification yielded mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.945, 0.980, and 0.962, respectively; FCD versus DC classification achieved 0.918, 0.965, and 0.939. In comparison, visual review of the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected 48% (16/33) of the lesions by official radiology report. In the subgroup where both clinical MRI and MAP were negative, the MRF-ML models correctly distinguished FCD patients from HCs and DCs in 98.3% of cross-validation trials for the magnetic resonance imaging negative group and MAP negative group. Type II versus non-type-II classification exhibited mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.835, 0.823, and 0.83, respectively; type IIa versus IIb classification showed 0.85, 0.9, and 0.87. In comparison, the transmantle sign was present in 58% (7/12) of the IIb cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The MRF-ML framework presented in this study demonstrated strong efficacy in noninvasively classifying FCD from normal cortex and distinguishing FCD subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system is a recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system associated with numerous neurological diseases. However, little is known about glymphatic system development in neonates. We sought to evaluate diffusion along the perivascular space (ALPS) index, a proxy for glymphatic system function, in neonates and investigate its potential associations with maturation, sex, and preterm birth.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 418 neonates, including 92 preterm neonates (57 males) and 326 term neonates (175 males), from the Developing Human Connectome Project were used for evaluating ALPS index. Linear regression modeling was performed to assess group differences in the ALPS index according to preterm birth and sex. Pearson's and partial correlation analysis were performed to assess the association between the ALPS index and gestational age (GA) as well as postmenstrual age (PMA) at MRI. Moderation analysis was performed to assess the moderation effect of preterm birth on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to term neonates, preterm neonates exhibited lower ALPS indices (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The ALPS index positively correlated with PMA (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and GA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Preterm birth (<i>p</i> = 0.013) had a significant moderation effect on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA. Sex had no significant direct effect (<i>p</i> = 0.639) or moderation effect (<i>p</i> = 0.333) on ALPS index.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system development is a dynamic process in neonates, which can be moderated by preterm birth, the ALPS index could serve as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring this process. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To understand the etiological landscape and phenotypic differences between 2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) syndromes: DEE with spike–wave activation in sleep (DEE-SWAS) and epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All patients fulfilled International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) DEE-SWAS or EE-SWAS criteria with a Core cohort (n = 91) drawn from our Epilepsy Genetics research program, together with 10 etiologically solved patients referred by collaborators in the Expanded cohort (n = 101). Detailed phenotyping and analysis of molecular genetic results were performed. We compared the phenotypic features of individuals with DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS. Brain-specific gene co-expression analysis was performed for D/EE-SWAS genes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified the etiology in 42/91 (46%) patients in our Core cohort, including 29/44 (66%) with DEE-SWAS and 13/47 (28%) with EE-SWAS. A genetic etiology was identified in 31/91 (34%). D/EE-SWAS genes were highly co-expressed in brain, highlighting the importance of channelopathies and transcriptional regulators. Structural etiologies were found in 12/91 (13%) individuals. We identified 10 novel D/EE-SWAS genes with a range of functions: <i>ATP1A2</i>, <i>CACNA1A</i>, <i>FOXP1</i>, <i>GRIN1</i>, <i>KCNMA1</i>, <i>KCNQ3</i>, <i>PPFIA3</i>, <i>PUF60</i>, <i>SETD1B, and ZBTB18</i>, and 2 novel copy number variants, 17p11.2 duplication and 5q22 deletion. Although developmental regression patterns were similar in both syndromes, DEE-SWAS was associated with a longer duration of epilepsy and poorer intellectual outcome than EE-SWAS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS have highly heterogeneous genetic and structural etiologies. Phenotypic analysis highlights valuable clinical differences between DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS which inform clinical care and prognostic counseling. Our etiological findings pave the way for the development of precision therapies. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

">The estrous cycle modulates hippocampal spine dynamics, dendritic processing, and spatial coding</a></h4>

              
                AbstractHistological evidence suggests that the estrous cycle exerts a powerful effect on CA1 neurons in mammalian hippocampus. Decades have passed since this landmark observation, yet how the estrous cycle shapes dendritic spine dynamics and hippocampal spatial coding in vivo remains a mystery. Here, we used a custom hippocampal microperiscope and two-photon calcium imaging to track CA1 pyramidal neurons in female mice over multiple cycles. Estrous cycle stage had a potent effect on spine dynamics, with heightened density during periods of greater estradiol (proestrus). These morphological changes were accompanied by greater somatodendritic coupling and increased infiltration of back-propagating action potentials into the apical dendrite. Finally, tracking CA1 response properties during navigation revealed enhanced place field stability during proestrus, evident at the single-cell and population level. These results establish the estrous cycle as a driver of large-scale structural and functional plasticity in hippocampal circuits essential for learning and memory.

">A general principle governing neuronal evolution reveals a human-accelerated neuron type potentially underlying the high prevalence of autism in humans</a></h4>

              
                The remarkable ability of a single genome sequence to encode a diverse collection of distinct cell types, including the thousands of cell types found in the mammalian brain, is a key characteristic of multicellular life. While it has been observed that some cell types are far more evolutionarily conserved than others, the factors driving these differences in evolutionary rate remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that highly abundant neuronal cell types may be under greater selective constraint than rarer neuronal types, leading to variation in their rates of evolution. To test this, we leveraged recently published cross-species single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from three distinct regions of the mammalian neocortex. We found a strikingly consistent relationship where more abundant neuronal subtypes show greater gene expression conservation between species, which replicated across three independent datasets covering >106 neurons from six species. Based on this principle, we discovered that the most abundant type of neocortical neurons--layer 2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons--has evolved exceptionally quickly in the human lineage compared to other apes. Surprisingly, this accelerated evolution was accompanied by the dramatic down-regulation of autism-associated genes, which was likely driven by polygenic positive selection specific to the human lineage. In sum, we introduce a general principle governing neuronal evolution and suggest that the exceptionally high prevalence of autism in humans may be a direct result of natural selection for lower expression of a suite of genes that conferred a fitness benefit to our ancestors while also rendering an abundant class of neurons more sensitive to perturbation.

">Concerted modulation of spontaneous behavior and time-integrated whole-brain neuronal activity by serotonin receptors</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin neurons from the raphe nuclei project across the entire brain and modulate diverse physiology and behavior by acting on 14 distinct receptors. Here, we take a step dissecting this complex process by examining the effects of agonists and antagonists of four widely expressed serotonin receptors (2A, 2C, 1A, and 1B) on spontaneous mouse behavior. We also analyzed time-integrated whole-brain neuronal activity of these same mice based on intensity of Fos, product of an immediate-early gene. Low-dimensional representations of behavioral and Fos map data shed light on the dominant factors of variation in each domain, captured predictable differences across drug groups, and enabled predictions of behavioral changes following perturbations in Fos maps and vice versa. Our study provides rich resources on the effects of manipulating serotonin receptors on animal behavior and whole-brain integrated neuronal activity. It also establishes an experimental and analysis paradigm for interrogating the relationship between behavior and neuronal activity across different time scales.

">Humans use local spectrotemporal correlations to detect rising and falling pitch</a></h4>

              
                To discern speech or appreciate music, the human auditory system detects how pitch increases or decreases over time. However, the algorithms used to detect changes in pitch, or pitch motion, are incompletely understood. Here, using psychophysics, computational modeling, functional neuroimaging, and analysis of recorded speech, we ask if humans detect pitch motion using computations analogous to those used by the visual system. We adapted stimuli from studies of vision to create novel auditory correlated noise stimuli that elicited robust pitch motion percepts. Crucially, these stimuli possess no persistent features across frequency or time, but do possess positive or negative local spectrotemporal correlations in intensity. In psychophysical experiments, we found clear evidence that humans judge pitch direction based on both positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations. The observed sensitivity to negative correlations is a direct analogue of illusory "reverse-phi" motion in vision, and thus constitutes a new auditory illusion. Our behavioral results and computational modeling led us to hypothesize that human auditory processing employs pitch direction opponency. fMRI measurements in auditory cortex supported this hypothesis. To link our psychophysical findings to real-world pitch perception, we analyzed recordings of English and Mandarin speech and discovered that pitch direction was robustly signaled by the same positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations used in our psychophysical tests, suggesting that sensitivity to both positive and negative correlations confers ecological benefits. Overall, this work reveals that motion detection algorithms sensitive to local correlations are deployed by the central nervous system across disparate modalities (vision and audition) and dimensions (space and frequency).

">Bezafibrate treatment rescues neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative defects in 3D cortical organoid model of MAPT frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTIONThe intronic MAPT mutation IVS10+16 is linked to familiar frontotemporal dementia, causing hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau protein, resulting in synaptic and neuronal loss and neuroinflammation in patients. This mutation disrupts MAPT gene splicing, increasing exon 10 inclusion and leading to an imbalance of 3R and 4R Tau isoforms.

METHODSWe generated patterned cortical organoids from isogenic control and mutant human iPSC lines. Nanostring gene expression analysis immunofluorescence and calcium imaging recordings were used to study the impact of the MAPT IVS10+16 mutation on neuronal development and function.

RESULTSTau mutant cortical organoids showed altered mitochondrial function and gene expression related to neuronal development, with synaptic markers and neuronal activity reduction. Bezafibrate treatment, which restored mitochondrial content, rescued synaptic functionality and tau physiology.

DISCUSSIONThese findings suggest that targeting mitochondrial function with bezafibrate could potentially reverse tau-induced neurodevelopmental deficits, highlighting its therapeutic potential for tauopathies like FTD.

HIGLIGHTSO_LIThe IVS 10+16 MAPT mutation significantly disrupts cortical differentiation and synaptic maturation, evidenced by downregulated genes associated with synapses and neuronal development.
C_LIO_LITau-mutant cortical organoids exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, with fewer and smaller mitochondria alongside with tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, which further contribute to neuronal damage and disease progression.
C_LIO_LITreatment with bezafibrate effectively normalizes mitochondrial parameters, enhances neuronal integrity and synaptic maturation, and restores network functionality, showcasing its promise as a therapeutic strategy for tauopathies.
C_LIO_LIThe 3D in vitro disease model used in this study proves valuable for studying tauopathies and testing new drugs, effectively mimicking key aspects of tau-related neurodegeneration.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_LISystematic Review: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for studies on the MAPT IVS10+16 mutations impact on tauopathies, focusing on neuronal development, synaptic function, and mitochondrial involvement. Key terms included "MAPT IVS10+16 mutation," "tauopathy," "neuronal development," "synaptic function," and "mitochondrial function."
C_LIO_LIInterpretation: Our findings reveal that the MAPT IVS10+16 mutation disrupts mitochondrial function altering gene expression related to neuronal development, synaptic structures, impairing neuronal and glial maturation. Bezafibrate treatment restored mitochondrial content, synaptic functionality, and tau physiology in mutant-derived cortical organoids, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic strategy for tauopathies.
C_LIO_LIFuture Directions: Future research should investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the bezafibrates therapeutic effect and its long-term efficacy and safety in vivo, in humanized mouse models. Additionally, the possibility to combine bezafibrate with other therapeutic agents used to treat tauopathies will be worth to assess.

">Biophysical Simulation Enables Multi-Scale Segmentation and Atlas Mapping for Top-Down Spatial Omics of the Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Spatial omics (SO) has produced high-definition mappings of subcellular molecules (like transcripts or proteins) within various tissue samples. Most applications of SO are molecule-driven i.e. the spatial distributions of transcripts are used to make distinctions between samples. However, such inferences do not automatically utilize brain atlas regions. Here, we present SiDoLa-NS (Simulate, Don't Label - Nervous System), an image-driven (top-down) approach to SO analysis in the nervous system. We utilize the biophysical properties of tissue architectures to design synthetic images mimicking tissue samples. With these in silico samples, we train supervised instance segmentation models for nucleus segmentation, achieving near perfect precision and F1-scores > 0.95. We take this a step further with generalizable models that can identify macroscopic tissue structures in the mouse brain (mAP50 = 0.869) and spinal cord (mAP50 = 0.96) and pig sciatic nerve (mAP50 = 0.995). SiDoLa-NS provides a framework in applying and analyzing SO data that leverages high-definition images that are taken alongside spatial omics pipelines. Notably, SiDoLa-NS provides solutions for common challenges in supervised model training, including but not limited to annotator bias, limited generalizability, and production of massive, high-quality training sets.

">Acute stress causes sex-dependent changes to ventral subiculum synapses, circuitry, and anxiety-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Experiencing a single severe stressor is sufficient to drive sexually dimorphic psychiatric disease development. The ventral subiculum (vSUB) emerges as a site where stress may induce sexually dimorphic adaptations due to its sex-specific organization and pivotal role in stress integration. Using a 1-hr acute restraint stress model, we uncover that stress causes a net decrease in vSUB activity in females that is potent, long-lasting, and driven by adrenergic receptor signaling. By contrast, males exhibit a net increase in vSUB activity that is transient and driven by corticosterone signaling. We further identified sex-dependent changes in vSUB output to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and in anxiety-like behavior in response to stress. These findings reveal striking changes in psychiatric disease-relevant brain regions and behavior following stress with sex-, cell-type, and synapse-specificity that contribute to our understanding of sex-dependent adaptations that may shape stress-related psychiatric disease risk.

                Parkinsons disease-associated, activating mutations in Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) block primary cilia formation in cholinergic and parvalbumin interneurons and astrocytes in the striatum, decreasing the production of GDNF and NRTN neuroprotective factors that normally support dopaminergic neuron viability. We show here that 3 month-dietary administration of the MLi-2 LRRK2 kinase inhibitor restores primary cilia and the Hedgehog-responsive production of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN by these neurons; cilia are also restored on cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus. Importantly, we detect recovery of striatal dopaminergic processes and decreased stress-triggered Hedgehog signaling by nigral dopaminergic neurons. Thus, pathogenic LRRK2-driven cilia loss is reversible in post-mitotic neurons and astrocytes, which suggests that early administration of specific LRRK2 inhibitors may have significant therapeutic benefit for patients in the future.

">Integration of sensory and fear memories in the rat medial temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Wong et al. (2019) used a sensory preconditioning protocol to examine how sensory and fear memories are integrated in the rat medial temporal lobe. In this protocol, rats integrate a sound-light (sensory) memory that forms in stage 1 with a light-shock (fear) memory that forms in stage 2 to generate fear responses (freezing) across test presentations of the sound in stage 3. Here, we advance this research by showing that: 1) how/when rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories (online in stage 2 or at test in stage 3) changes with the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1; and 2) regardless of how/when it occurs, the integration requires communication between two regions of the medial temporal lobe: the perirhinal cortex and basolateral amygdala complex. Thus, "event familiarity" determines how/when sensory and fear memories are integrated but not the circuitry by which the integration occurs: this remains the same.

">Optogenetic hedonic hotspots in orbitofrontal cortex and insula: causing enhancement of sweetness liking</a></h4>

              
                Hedonic hotspots are brain subregions that causally amplify the hedonic impact of palatable tastes, measured as increases in affective orofacial  liking reactions to sweetness. Previously, two cortical hedonic hotspots in orbitofrontal cortex and insula were identified by neurochemical stimulation using opioid or orexin microinjections. Here we used optogenetic stimulation in rats as an independent neurobiological technique for activating cortical hedonic hotspots to identify hedonic functions and map boundaries. We report that channelrhodopsin stimulations within rostral orbitofrontal and caudal insula hotspots doubled the number of hedonic  liking reactions elicited by sucrose taste. This independently confirms their robust functional identity as causal amplifiers of hedonic  liking and confirms their anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we confirmed an intervening suppressive hedonic coldstrip, to stretching from caudal orbitofrontal cortex to rostral insula. By contrast to localized hedonic hotspots for  liking enhancement, motivational  wanting for reward, measured as laser self-stimulation, was mediated by more widely distributed anatomical sites.

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has been shown to increase the outcome of speech and language therapy (SLT) in chronic aphasia. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of add-on tDCS on SLT in the early stage of aphasia; this may be due to methodological reasons, in particular the influence of spontaneous remission and the difficulty of establishing stimulation protocols in clinical routines. Thirty-seven participants with subacute aphasia (PwA) after stroke (23 men, 14 women; mean age 62 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12 years; mean duration 49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28 days) were included in two consecutive periods of treatment lasting two weeks each. During the first period (P1) the participants received 10 sessions of SLT, during the second period (P2) the aphasia therapy was supplemented by anodal left hemispheric 2 mA tDCS over the left hemisphere. Severity-specific language tests (Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT), n = 27 and Bielefeld Aphasia Screening-Reha (BIAS-R), n = 10) were administered before P1, between P1 and P2, and after P2. Where information was available, the results were corrected for spontaneous remission (AAT sample), and the therapy outcomes of P1 and P2 were compared. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; overall language abilities improved significantly during P1 and P2. However, improvement&amp;amp;mdash;as measured by the AAT profile level or the BIAS-R mean percentage value&amp;amp;mdash;during P2 (with tDCS) was significantly higher than during P1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; AAT sample and p = 0.005; BIAS-R sample). Thus, tDCS protocols can be implemented in early aphasia rehabilitation. Despite the limitations of the research design, which are also discussed from an implementation science perspective, this is preliminary evidence that an individually tailored anodal tDCS can have a significant add-on effect on the outcome of behavioral aphasia therapy in subacute aphasia.</p>

                <p>Cognitive dysfunction is associated with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to examine the involvement of either Group 2 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) or mGlu3 receptors in memory deficit induced by methamphetamine in mice. Methamphetamine treatment (1&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 5&nbsp;d followed by 7&nbsp;d of withdrawal) caused an impaired performance in the novel object recognition test in wild-type mice, but not in mGlu2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> or mGlu3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Memory deficit in wild-type mice challenged with methamphetamine was corrected by systemic treatment with selectively negative allosteric modulators of mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors (compounds VU6001966 and VU0650786, respectively). Methamphetamine treatment in wild-type mice caused large increases in levels of mGlu2/3 receptors, the Type 3 activator of G-protein signaling (AGS3), Rab3A, and the vesicular glutamate transporter, vGlut1, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Methamphetamine did not alter mGlu2/3-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation but abolished the ability of postsynaptic mGlu3 receptors to boost mGlu5 receptor-mediated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in PFC slices. Remarkably, activation of presynaptic mGlu2/3 receptors did not inhibit but rather amplified depolarization-induced [<sup>3</sup>H]-D-aspartate release in synaptosomes prepared from the PFC of methamphetamine-treated mice. These findings demonstrate that exposure to methamphetamine causes changes in the expression and function of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, which might alter excitatory synaptic transmission in the PFC and raise the attractive possibility that selective inhibitors of mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors (or both) may be used to improve cognitive dysfunction in individuals affected by MUD.</p>

                Background: Cataracts are common causes of visual impairment. Preventing blindness requires an early and accurate diagnosis. This review examines current cataract diagnosis strategies, explores data-driven machine learning algorithms for early detection, investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, assesses improvements in cataract detection accuracy, identifies research gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies. Methods: We gathered labelled cataract and non-cataract fundus data from the Kaggle. Scholarly publications were sourced from reliable databases such as ProQuest, IEEE, ELSEVIER, Google Scholar, and PubMed. A detailed literature search with specific terms expanded the scope of this review. We included studies that used cataract and non-cataract fundus eye images from cross-sectional, retrospective, and prospective studies. The quality assessment used the AMSTAR tool, considering factors such as literature search comprehensiveness, study selection criteria, data extraction methodologies, and study validity (Table 1). Results: This study encompassed 130 research publications, focusing on machine learning models and clinical-based diagnostic approaches for early-stage cataract identification. The performance of machine-learning models is influenced by factors such as dataset noise and limited reliable data. Barriers to the successful implementation of AI for cataract diagnosis were identified. Conclusions: This review emphasises the obstacles hindering the broad application of AI in cataract diagnosis. Addressing these findings is vital for developing strategies to overcome these challenges and enhance cataract detection systems. To achieve improved accuracy and efficiency in cataract diagnosis, future research should prioritise efforts to enhance dataset availability and quality, reduce data noise, and refine machine-learning algorithms. Unlocking the full potential of AI and/or machine learning can lead to significant breakthroughs in cataract diagnosis, ultimately resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced visual impairments.

                Lymphomas of the oral and oropharyngeal regions are rather uncommon, and diagnosis can be challenging and confusing due to the multiple histological subgroups. Lymphomas are the third most common type of tumor in the head and neck region and are brought on by the lymphoreticular system. The two forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case report of oropharyngeal lymphoma. The female patient reported with a complaint of swelling over the palatal region for two to three months. An ulceroproliferative lesion was evident over the posterior palatal region. We diagnosed reactive lymphadenitis based on an incisional biopsy. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions, a punch biopsy followed by immunohistochemical studies were done. Features suggestive of activated B-cell-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were confirmed. Among malignant lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most prevalent variety. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of this disease. In this case report, we aim to correlate the clinical presentation, histology features and immunohistochemical significance in order to promote early discovery, diagnosis, and treatment for a better prognosis of the patient.

                Introduction and importance The cholecystoenteric fistula, a rare complication of cholelithiasis, usually occurs as an internal biliary fistula. Our case features a cholecystoduodenal fistula presenting with severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding originating from the cystic artery. Symptoms vary, and preoperative diagnosis is uncommon. Case presentation A 63-year-old diabetic patient, who had undergone surgical treatment for a left forearm fracture, presented with persistent bleeding, hematemesis, and melena. Diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an actively bleeding ulcer on the duodenal bulb, with an attempted hemostasis. Initial stabilization was achieved, but a recurrence occurred after 17 hours with hemodynamic instability. Emergency laparotomy revealed cholecystitis with a cholecystoduodenal fistula, necessitating cholecystectomy and ulcer resection. The source of bleeding was the cystic artery. The patient had a positive postoperative outcome with no recurrence of hemorrhage. Clinical discussion Cholecystoenteric fistulas, forming from obstructed cystic duct inflammation, are rare complications of biliary lithiasis. Most cases are spontaneous, linked to gallstones. Severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding from cholecystoduodenal fistulas is uncommon, often requiring surgical intervention due to cystic artery erosion. Despite advancements in laparoscopic methods, open operations are preferred for anatomical distortion and inflammation. A clear diagnosis involves hepatic angiography and may necessitate embolization. The rarity of this condition emphasizes the need for vigilant diagnosis, especially in patients with gallstone history. Conclusion Massive bleeding from cystic artery erosion by duodenal ulcer through cholecystoduodenal fistula underscores the need for clinicians’ vigilance. Recognition of gallstone disease history is crucial for timely diagnosis in this rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding.

                Background The absence of a culturally adapted and validated Smile Aesthetics Scale for Peruvian university students reveals a significant gap in aesthetic dentistry and public health research. Addressing this gap is essential for accurately assessing dental aesthetic satisfaction within this demographic, ensuring the scale’s relevance and effectiveness across Spanish-speaking cultures. The aim of the study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Smile Aesthetics Satisfaction Scale for Peruvian university students. Methods This research was applied, with an instrumental, cross-sectional, and descriptive design. Face validity was conducted with 10 students through unstructured interviews. Content validity was carried out by three experts. The validation of psychometric properties was performed on 190 students recruited through university dentistry social networks using simple random probability sampling. The Aiken test was used for face and content validity. Construct validity and internal consistency were examined through principal component and exploratory factor analysis, using promax and varimax rotations, and internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s Alpha. Results Face and content validity confirmed that the items were relevant and applicable, highlighting the significance of the construct evaluated within the specific cultural context of the research. The adapted scale reflected high content validity, with a global Aiken’s V of 0.83, emphasizing the clarity, coherence, and relevance of the items according to expert evaluation. The psychometric properties of the adapted scale were exceptional among the student population, evidenced by a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.889. Conclusions The translation and cultural adaptation process of the Smile Aesthetics Satisfaction Scale has proven to be successful not only in terms of coherence and fidelity with the original instrument but also in its applicability and relevance within the context of university dental students.

                Introduction Due to the specific work content, healthcare workers (HCWs) showed a high risk of mental health and well-being issues. And the COVID-19 pandemic has increased this effect. At the same time, the psychological well-being of HCWs from Central Asian countries remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health and well-being of HCWs from Central Asian countries, as well as associated factors, including the role of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional questioner-based study was carried out among HCWs from Central Asian countries during the July-November, 2022. The study included socio-demographic questions, DASS-21 scale, WHO-5 Well-being Index, and questions to assess the impact of COVID-19 on personal life and work of HCWs. Results The study involved 2,685 HCWs from the Kazakhstan (1,817), Kyrgyzstan (534), and Uzbekistan (334). The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 17.7%, 24.9% and 5.2%, respectively. Socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, marital and family status, occupation, managerial position; as well as pandemic-related frontline work history and changes in work and social life were associated with mental health and well-being. Conclusion The study underscores the pressing need to address the mental health challenges faced by HCWs in Central Asia, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings reveal concerning levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among HCWs, with socio-demographic factors and pandemic-related experiences influencing mental well-being. Urgent interventions, tailored support, and resources are essential to safeguard the psychological health of HCWs and sustain effective healthcare delivery.

                <p>by Ye Chen, Peter Beech, Ziwei Yin, Shanshan Jia, Jiayi Zhang, Zhaofei Yu, Jian K. Liu</p>

Understanding the computational mechanisms that underlie the encoding and decoding of environmental stimuli is a crucial investigation in neuroscience. Central to this pursuit is the exploration of how the brain represents visual information across its hierarchical architecture. A prominent challenge resides in discerning the neural underpinnings of the processing of dynamic natural visual scenes. Although considerable research efforts have been made to characterize individual components of the visual pathway, a systematic understanding of the distinctive neural coding associated with visual stimuli, as they traverse this hierarchical landscape, remains elusive. In this study, we leverage the comprehensive Allen Visual Coding—Neuropixels dataset and utilize the capabilities of deep learning neural network models to study neural coding in response to dynamic natural visual scenes across an expansive array of brain regions. Our study reveals that our decoding model adeptly deciphers visual scenes from neural spiking patterns exhibited within each distinct brain area. A compelling observation arises from the comparative analysis of decoding performances, which manifests as a notable encoding proficiency within the visual cortex and subcortical nuclei, in contrast to a relatively reduced encoding activity within hippocampal neurons. Strikingly, our results unveil a robust correlation between our decoding metrics and well-established anatomical and functional hierarchy indexes. These findings corroborate existing knowledge in visual coding related to artificial visual stimuli and illuminate the functional role of these deeper brain regions using dynamic stimuli. Consequently, our results suggest a novel perspective on the utility of decoding neural network models as a metric for quantifying the encoding quality of dynamic natural visual scenes represented by neural responses, thereby advancing our comprehension of visual coding within the complex hierarchy of the brain.

                <p>by Ulysse Rançon, Timothée Masquelier, Benoit R. Cottereau</p>

Sounds are temporal stimuli decomposed into numerous elementary components by the auditory nervous system. For instance, a temporal to spectro-temporal transformation modelling the frequency decomposition performed by the cochlea is a widely adopted first processing step in today’s computational models of auditory neural responses. Similarly, increments and decrements in sound intensity (i.e., of the raw waveform itself or of its spectral bands) constitute critical features of the neural code, with high behavioural significance. However, despite the growing attention of the scientific community on auditory OFF responses, their relationship with transient ON, sustained responses and adaptation remains unclear. In this context, we propose a new general model, based on a pair of linear filters, named <i>AdapTrans</i>, that captures both sustained and transient ON and OFF responses into a unifying and easy to expand framework. We demonstrate that filtering audio cochleagrams with AdapTrans permits to accurately render known properties of neural responses measured in different mammal species such as the dependence of OFF responses on the stimulus fall time and on the preceding sound duration. Furthermore, by integrating our framework into gold standard and state-of-the-art machine learning models that predict neural responses from audio stimuli, following a supervised training on a large compilation of electrophysiology datasets (ready-to-deploy PyTorch models and pre-processed datasets shared publicly), we show that AdapTrans systematically improves the prediction accuracy of estimated responses within different cortical areas of the rat and ferret auditory brain. Together, these results motivate the use of our framework for computational and systems neuroscientists willing to increase the plausibility and performances of their models of audition.

Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) are novel cellular models that maintain the genetic, phenotypic and structural features of patient tumor tissue and are useful for studying tumorigenesis and drug response. When integrated with advanced 3D imaging and analysis techniques, PDTOs can be used to establish physiologically relevant high-throughput and high-content drug screening platforms that support the development of patient-specific treatment strategies. However, in order to effectively leverage high-throughput PDTO observations for clinical predictions, it is critical to establish a quantitative understanding of the basic properties and variability of organoid growth dynamics. In this work, we introduced an innovative workflow for analyzing and understanding PDTO growth dynamics, by integrating a high-throughput imaging deep learning platform with mathematical modeling, incorporating flexible growth laws and variable dormancy times. We applied the workflow to colon cancer organoids and demonstrated that organoid growth is well-described by the Gompertz model of growth. Our analysis showed significant intrapatient heterogeneity in PDTO growth dynamics, with the initial exponential growth rate of an organoid following a lognormal distribution within each dataset. The level of intrapatient heterogeneity varied between patients, as did organoid growth rates and dormancy times of single seeded cells. Our work contributes to an emerging understanding of the basic growth characteristics of PDTOs, and it highlights the heterogeneity in organoid growth both within and between patients. These results pave the way for further modeling efforts aimed at predicting treatment response dynamics and drug resistance timing.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012048">Modeling the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Janani Ravi, Kewalin Samart, Jason Zwolak</p>

Budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, is widely used as a model organism to study the genetics underlying eukaryotic cellular processes and growth critical to cancer development, such as cell division and cell cycle progression. The budding yeast cell cycle is also one of the best-studied dynamical systems owing to its thoroughly resolved genetics. However, the dynamics underlying the crucial cell cycle decision point called the START transition, at which the cell commits to a new round of DNA replication and cell division, are under-studied. The START machinery involves a central cyclin-dependent kinase; cyclins responsible for starting the transition, bud formation, and initiating DNA synthesis; and their transcriptional regulators. However, evidence has shown that the mechanism is more complicated than a simple irreversible transition switch. Activating a key transcription regulator SBF requires the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, Whi5, or an SBF/MBF monomeric component, Swi6, but not necessarily both. Also, the timing and mechanism of the inhibitor Whi5’s nuclear export, while important, are not critical for the timing and execution of START. Therefore, there is a need for a consolidated model for the budding yeast START transition, reconciling regulatory and spatial dynamics. We built a detailed mathematical model (START-BYCC) for the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle based on established molecular interactions and experimental phenotypes. START-BYCC recapitulates the underlying dynamics and correctly emulates key phenotypic traits of ~150 known START mutants, including regulation of size control, localization of inhibitor/transcription factor complexes, and the nutritional effects on size control. Such a detailed mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamics gets us closer towards deconvoluting the aberrant cellular development in cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011854">scaDA: A novel statistical method for differential analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fengdi Zhao, Xin Ma, Bing Yao, Qing Lu, Li Chen</p>

Single-cell ATAC-seq sequencing data (scATAC-seq) has been widely used to investigate chromatin accessibility on the single-cell level. One important application of scATAC-seq data analysis is differential chromatin accessibility (DA) analysis. However, the data characteristics of scATAC-seq such as excessive zeros and large variability of chromatin accessibility across cells impose a unique challenge for DA analysis. Existing statistical methods focus on detecting the mean difference of the chromatin accessible regions while overlooking the distribution difference. Motivated by real data exploration that distribution difference exists among cell types, we introduce a novel composite statistical test named “scaDA”, which is based on zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB), for performing differential distribution analysis of chromatin accessibility by jointly testing the abundance, prevalence and dispersion simultaneously. Benefiting from both dispersion shrinkage and iterative refinement of mean and prevalence parameter estimates, scaDA demonstrates its superiority to both ZINB-based likelihood ratio tests and published methods by achieving the highest power and best FDR control in a comprehensive simulation study. In addition to demonstrating the highest power in three real sc-multiome data analyses, scaDA successfully identifies differentially accessible regions in microglia from sc-multiome data for an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) study that are most enriched in GO terms related to neurogenesis and the clinical phenotype of AD, and AD-associated GWAS SNPs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-871/v1?src=rss">Effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing and cross platform messaging application in improving oral health knowledge, attitude and behaviours among pregnant women- A Randomized Controlled Trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Body goes through significant hormonal and physiological changes during pregnancy, which could be linked to changes in oral health. Many women are unaware of the negative consequences of poor dental health during and after pregnancy, both for themselves and their children. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing (MI) and cross platform messaging application (WhatsApp messenger) for oral health education on the oral health knowledge, attitude and behaviours among pregnant women attending ante natal care. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 84 pregnant women. Simple random sampling was employed to select participants after oral examination. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups (Group 1: Cross-platform messaging application [WhatsApp]; Group 2: MI) using a lottery method. Pregnant women aged 18 years and older, gestational age between 8 and 30 weeks were included. A face-to-face interview and oral examination were conducted to assess baseline knowledge and oral hygiene status. A follow-up examination was conducted after one month of intervention. Inferential statistics, including the chi-square test and independent t-test, were used to compare variables between the two groups. Results The mean knowledge score at baseline was comparable between Group 1 (WhatsApp) and Group 2 (MI). However, post-intervention, Group 2 showed a significantly higher mean knowledge score compared to Group 1. Post-intervention, Group 2 exhibited a significantly better oral hygiene status compared to Group 1. Significant improvements in oral health behaviours were observed in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (p < 0.001). Conclusions The findings suggested that while both interventions were effective, MI showed superior results in improving knowledge, oral hygiene status, and oral health behaviours. The personalized and client-centred approach of MI enables participants to explore and resolve ambivalence, promoting a deeper understanding of the importance of oral health during pregnancy.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation and considered an inborn error of metabolism. In recent years, we have diagnosed an increasing number of patients where, despite extensive investigation, no disease-causing mutations have been found. We therefore investigated a cohort of consecutive patients, with the objective to detect possible non-genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We searched the patient records and the registry of muscle biopsies, for patients with MADD, diagnosed within the past 10 years. The patient records were reviewed regarding symptoms, clinical findings, comorbidities, drugs, diagnostic investigations, and response to treatment. In addition, complementary investigations of muscle tissue were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 9 patients diagnosed with late-onset MADD. All presented with muscle weakness and elevated levels of creatine kinase. A lipid storage myopathy was evident in the muscle biopsies, as was elevated acylcarnitines in blood. Despite thorough genetic investigations, a probable genetic cause was found in only 2 patients. Remarkably, all 7 patients without disease-causing mutations were treated with sertraline. In some cases, a deterioration of symptoms closely followed dose increase, and discontinuation resulted in an improved acylcarnitine profile. All 9 patients responded to riboflavin treatment with normalization of creatine kinase and muscle biopsy findings, and in 8 patients the clinical symptoms clearly improved.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings strongly suggest that sertraline may induce an acquired form of MADD in some patients. Importantly, riboflavin treatment seems to be similarly effective as in genetic MADD, but discontinuation of sertraline is reasonably warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal area CA2 has garnered attention in recent times owing to its significant involvement in social memory and distinctive plasticity characteristics. Research has revealed that the CA2 region demonstrates a remarkable resistance to plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer Collateral (SC)-CA2 pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Nogo-A, a well-known axon growth inhibitor and more recently discovered plasticity regulator, in modulating plasticity within the CA2 region. The findings demonstrate that blocking Nogo-A in male rat hippocampal slices facilitates the establishment of both short-term and long-term plasticity in the SC-CA2 pathway, while having no impact on the Entorhinal Cortical (EC)-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the study reveals that inhibiting Nogo-A enables association between the SC and EC pathways. Mechanistically, we confirm that Nogo-A operates through its well-known co-receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), and its downstream signaling factor such as Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), as their inhibition also allows plasticity induction in the SC-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in both the EC and SC-CA2 pathways led to persistent LTD, which was not affected by Nogo-A inhibition. Our study demonstrates the involvement of Nogo-A mediated signaling mechanisms in limiting synaptic plasticity within the CA2 region.</p>

                Muik et al. show that, in individuals pre-immunized with SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain mRNA vaccines, cross-reactive humoral immunity targeting conserved epitopes remains dominant after two exposures to Omicron BA.1 spike. Their observations indicate that persistent immune imprinting may limit strain-specific naive B cell priming even after repeated variant spike exposure.

                Cobb-Lewis et al. demonstrate that the LHb plays distinct roles in infant and juvenile rat social approach behaviors. Early adversity disrupts LHb structural and functional growth curves, including volume, protein expression, and firing properties. Finally, inhibiting a specific corticohabenular projection rescues social deficits in adversity-reared pups.

They observed that neurons with NFTs died less frequently than neurons without NFTs. Dying neurons could also be identified by local cortical microstructure changes, providing a method to identify susceptible populations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84875">Spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent mitotic delay is required for cell division in absence of centrosomes</a></h4>

              
                The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) temporally regulates mitosis by preventing progression from metaphase to anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle. Centrosomes refine the spatial organization of the mitotic spindle at the spindle poles. However, centrosome loss leads to elongated mitosis, suggesting that centrosomes also inform the temporal organization of mitosis in mammalian cells. Here, we find that the mitotic delay in acentrosomal cells is enforced by the SAC in a MPS1-dependent manner, and that a SAC-dependent mitotic delay is required for bipolar cell division to occur in acentrosomal cells. Although acentrosomal cells become polyploid, polyploidy is not sufficient to cause dependency on a SAC-mediated delay to complete cell division. Rather, the division failure in absence of MPS1 activity results from mitotic exit occurring before acentrosomal spindles can become bipolar. Furthermore, prevention of centrosome separation suffices to make cell division reliant on a SAC-dependent mitotic delay. Thus, centrosomes and their definition of two spindle poles early in mitosis provide a ‘timely two-ness’ that allows cell division to occur in absence of a SAC-dependent mitotic delay.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96257">Dual targeting of histone deacetylases and MYC as potential treatment strategy for H3-K27M pediatric gliomas</a></h4>

              
                Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94903">Metabolic disruption impairs ribosomal protein levels, resulting in enhanced aminoglycoside tolerance</a></h4>

              
                Aminoglycoside antibiotics target ribosomes and are effective against a wide range of bacteria. Here, we demonstrated that knockout strains related to energy metabolism in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed increased tolerance to aminoglycosides during the mid-exponential growth phase. Contrary to expectations, these mutations did not reduce the proton motive force or aminoglycoside uptake, as there were no significant changes in metabolic indicators or intracellular gentamicin levels between wild-type and mutant strains. Our comprehensive proteomics analysis unveiled a noteworthy upregulation of proteins linked to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mutant strains during the mid-exponential growth phase, suggesting that these strains compensate for the perturbation in their energy metabolism by increasing TCA cycle activity to maintain their membrane potential and ATP levels. Furthermore, our pathway enrichment analysis shed light on local network clusters displaying downregulation across all mutant strains, which were associated with both large and small ribosomal binding proteins, ribosome biogenesis, translation factor activity, and the biosynthesis of ribonucleoside monophosphates. These findings offer a plausible explanation for the observed tolerance of aminoglycosides in the mutant strains. Altogether, this research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of aminoglycoside tolerance, paving the way for novel strategies to combat such cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95257">Deciphering the actin structure-dependent preferential cooperative binding of cofilin</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism underlying the preferential and cooperative binding of cofilin and the expansion of clusters toward the pointed-end side of actin filaments remains poorly understood. To address this, we conducted a principal component analysis based on available filamentous actin (F-actin) and C-actin (cofilins were excluded from cofilactin) structures and compared to monomeric G-actin. The results strongly suggest that C-actin, rather than F-ADP-actin, represented the favourable structure for binding preference of cofilin. High-speed atomic force microscopy explored that the shortened bare half helix adjacent to the cofilin clusters on the pointed end side included fewer actin protomers than normal helices. The mean axial distance (MAD) between two adjacent actin protomers along the same long-pitch strand within shortened bare half helices was longer (5.0–6.3 nm) than the MAD within typical helices (4.3–5.6 nm). The inhibition of torsional motion during helical twisting, achieved through stronger attachment to the lipid membrane, led to more pronounced inhibition of cofilin binding and cluster formation than the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in solution. F-ADP-actin exhibited more naturally supertwisted half helices than F-ADP.Pi-actin, explaining how Pi inhibits cofilin binding to F-actin with variable helical twists. We propose that protomers within the shorter bare helical twists, either influenced by thermal fluctuation or induced allosterically by cofilin clusters, exhibit characteristics of C-actin-like structures with an elongated MAD, leading to preferential and cooperative binding of cofilin.

">Uncovering Individualized Cerebellar Atrophy Pattern and Behavioral Links in Children with Brainstem Tumor</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundBrainstem tumors are rare and result in enduring behavioral issues, posing challenges for patients and surgeons. Despite similarities in symptoms to those resulting from cerebellar injuries, limited research has investigated cerebellar changes in patients with brainstem tumors.

MethodsHere, we employed U-Net-based segmentation to analyze the cerebellum in 26 regions, assessing individual volume deviations. Additionally, we developed a behavior prediction model using the total outlier count (tOC) index and brain volume as features.

FindingsOur normative model results revealed that most patients exhibited negative deviation in most cerebellar regions, particularly in lobule Right V, Left I-III, Right X, and Left X. The results found a significant association between a higher tOC and severe social problems (r = 0.31, p = 0.001) and withdrawal behavior (r = 0.28, p = 0.001). Further analysis showed that smaller cerebellar regions correlated strongly with more pronounced social problems (r = 0.27, p = 0.007) and withdrawal behavior (r = 0.25, p = 0.015). Notably, lobules such as Right X, V, IV, and VIIB, along with Left IX, VIII, and X exerted the greatest influence on social problems, whereas regions including Left V, Right IV, and Vermis VI and VIII were most impactful on withdrawal behavior.

InterpretationIn summary, our study revealed cerebellar atrophy patterns in patients with brainstem tumors, emphasizing the role of both anterior and posterior cerebellar lobes in social problems and withdrawal behavior. This research sheds light on the brain mechanisms underlying complex behavioral disorders in brainstem tumor patients.

FundingThis study was supported by the STI2030-Major Projects 2021ZD0200201 and Beijing Municipal Public Welfare Development and Reform Pilot Project for Medical Research Institutes (grant ID: JYY202X-X).

Research in ContextOur previous neuropsychological research has demonstrated that patients with brainstem tumors exhibit a wide range of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, which closely resemble cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS). Dines et al. hypothesized, based on cognitive impairment observed in patients with brainstem injury, that the brainstem, as an integral part of the cerebellar-cortex pathway, plays a role in cognitive processing. Consequently, brainstem injury may lead to cerebellar dysfunction. Previous studies have also reported that gangliocytoma located in the brainstem can cause ipsilateral cerebellar atrophy. These findings suggest that cerebellar injury may be present in patients with brainstem tumors. However, no systematic studies have investigated the pattern of cerebellar injury in these patients and its association with cognitive and behavioral disorders.

Added value of this studyThis study revealed the pattern of cerebellar heterogeneity in patients with brainstem tumors. Further, this study provides evidences for the cerebellums role beyond motor control, underscoring its involvement in complex social behaviors. This study provides insight into automatic cerebellar segmentation algorithm applied to patients dataset.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study is first to successfully apply machine learning for segmenting deformed cerebellums, providing a reference for future large-sample studies of diseased cerebellum and brainstems. Moreover, this study provides evidence that the brainstem and cerebellum are involved in complex cognitive processing. Future research should focus on developing personalized treatment and rehabilitation programs for patients with brainstem tumors and cerebellar injury to improve their prognosis.

">Co-activation of LIN28A and CTNNB1 disturbs cortical neuronal migration and pia mater integrity</a></h4>

              
                Developmental signalling pathways act in stage and tissue dependent relation and mis-activation can drive tumour formation. The RNA-binding protein LIN28A maintains stemness and is overexpressed in embryonal brain tumours. Activating mutations of CTNNB1 - the WNT pathway effector - have been reported in respective brain tumours. The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay of these oncogenic proteins during embryonal brain development.

The combination of both oncogenic factors did not lead to brain tumour formation but resulted in disturbed lamination and impaired cell migration in the cerebral cortex. Spatially resolved proteome analysis revealed imbalances of the extracellular matrix protein LAMB1 and its receptors RPSA and ITGB1 accompanied by a porous pial border and overmigration of neural cells. Cajal-Retzius cells were misplaced in deeper cortex regions without affecting general REELIN levels and additional reduced levels of -DYSTROGLYCAN.

Taken together, the interplay of LIN28A and CTNNB1 resulted in a cortical migration disorder showing histomorphological and molecular similarities to human Cobblestone lissencephaly (type 2), highlighting novel implications of the oncogene LIN28A in extracellular matrix integrity.

">Distinct neuromodulatory effects of endogenous orexin and dynorphin corelease on projection-defined ventral tegmental dopamine neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to motivationally relevant cues and circuit-specific signaling drives different aspects of motivated behavior. Orexins (ox; also known as hypocretin) and dynorphin (dyn) are co-expressed lateral hypothalamic (LH) neuropeptides that project to the VTA. These peptides have opposing effects on the firing activity of VTADA neurons via orexin 1 (Ox1R) or kappa opioid (KOR) receptors, respectively. Given that Ox1R activation increases VTADA firing, and KOR decreases firing, it is unclear how the co-released peptides contribute to the net activity of DA neurons. We tested if optical stimulation of LHox/dyn neuromodulates VTADA neuronal activity via peptide release and if the effects of optically driven LHox/dyn release segregates based on VTADA projection targets including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the lateral or medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (lAcbSh, mAchSh). Using a combination of circuit tracing, optogenetics, and patch clamp electrophysiology in male and female orexincre mice we showed a diverse response of LHox/dyn optical stimulation on VTADA neuronal firing, that are not mediated by fast transmitter release and are blocked by antagonists to KOR and Ox1R signaling. Additionally, where optical stimulation of LHox/dyn inputs in the VTA inhibited firing of the majority of BLA projecting VTADA neurons, optical stimulation of LHox/dyn inputs in the VTA bidirectionally affects firing of either lAcbSh or mAchSh projecting VTADA neurons. These findings indicate that LHox/dyn corelease may influence the output of the VTA by balancing ensembles of neurons within each population which contribute to different aspects of reward seeking.

Significance StatementThe mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is known to play a crucial role in motivation and reward-learning and receives neuromodulatory input from the lateral hypothalamus (LH). We show that optical stimulation of the orexin-containing LH input in the VTA releases both orexin and dynorphin to bidirectionally alter VTADA firing. Furthermore, orexin and dynorphin differentially modulate firing of DA inputs to the basolateral amygdala, whereby dynorphin predominates, or to the nucleus accumbens which is sensitive to both neuromodulators. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the neuromodulatory effects of coreleased LH orexin and dynorphin on the VTADA system.

">Word-selective EEG/MEG responses in the English language obtained with Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS)</a></h4>

              
                Fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) allows the recording of objective brain responses of human word discrimination (i.e., reproducible word-category-selective responses) with a high signal-to-noise ratio. This approach has been successfully employed over the last decade in a number of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) studies. Three important advances were achieved in this study: (1) robust measures of written word-selective responses with this approach have not been reported in English; (2) responses have only been reported in EEG but not with MEG, and (3) without source localization. Thus, we presented English words periodically (2 Hz) among different types of letter strings (10Hz; consonant strings, non-words, pseudowords) whilst recording simultaneous EEG and MEG in 25 participants who performed a simple non-linguistic color detection task. Data were analyzed in sensor and in source space (L2-minimum-norm estimation, MNE). With only 4 minutes of stimulation we observed a robust word discrimination response in each condition including, importantly, even when words were embedded in word-like pseudowords. This response was larger in nonwords and largest in consonant strings. We observed left-lateralized responses in all conditions in the majority of our participants. Cluster-based permutation tests revealed that these responses were left-lateralized in sensor as well as in source space, with peaks in left posterior regions. Our results demonstrate that the FPVS paradigm can elicit robust English word-discrimination responses in EEG and MEG within only a few minutes of recording time. Together with source estimation, this can provide novel insights into the neural basis of visual word recognition in healthy and clinical populations.

">The Body Mirroring Thought: The Relationship Between Thought Transitions and Fluctuations in Autonomic Nervous Activity Mediated by Interoception</a></h4>

              
                Our thought states change unconsciously. This study verified that the transference of thought states varies with fluctuations in autonomic nervous activity, and that this effect is modulated by interoceptive accuracy. The participants completed the heartbeat counting task (HCT) and vigilance task (VT). We assessed the participants interoceptive accuracy based on their performance on the HCT. The VT is a simple attention task, and during this task, we asked the participants to report the content and contemplation of their thoughts. Consequently, participants with accurate interoception were more likely to remain in a highly contemplative thought state when sympathetic activity was activated. In contrast, the dominance of parasympathetic activity facilitated transitions to different thought states or experiences of less contemplative thought states in them. The results suggest that even subtle changes in bodily responses at rest can affect thought transitions in people with accurate interoception.

">Unraveling the Neural Landscape of Mental Disorders using Double Functional Independent Primitives (dFIPs)</a></h4>

              
                Mental illnesses extract a high personal and societal cost, and thus explorations of the links between mental illness and functional connectivity in the brain are critical. Investigating major mental illnesses, believed to arise from disruptions in sophisticated neural connections, allows us to comprehend how these neural network disruptions may be linked to altered cognition, emotional regulation, and social interactions. Although neuroimaging has opened new avenues to explore neural alterations linked to mental illnesses, the field still requires precise and sensitive methodologies to inspect these neural substrates of various psychological disorders. In this study, we employ a hierarchical methodology to derive double functionally independent primitives (dFIPs) from resting state functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging data (rs-fMRI). These dFIPs encapsulate canonical overlapping patterns of functional network connectivity (FNC) within the brain. Our investigation focuses on the examination of how combinations of these dFIPs relate to different mental disorder diagnoses. The central aim is to unravel the complex patterns of FNC that correspond to the diverse manifestations of mental illnesses. To achieve this objective, we used a large brain imaging dataset from multiple sites, comprising 5805 total individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BPD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and controls. The key revelations of our study unveil distinct patterns associated with each mental disorder through the combination of dFIPs. Notably, certain individual dFIPs exhibit disorder-specific characteristics, while others demonstrate commonalities across disorders. This approach offers a novel, data-driven synthesis of intricate neuroimaging data, thereby illuminating the functional changes intertwined with various mental illnesses. Our results show distinct signatures associated with psychiatric disorders, revealing unique connectivity patterns such as heightened cerebellar connectivity in SCZ and sensory domain hyperconnectivity in ASD, both contrasted with reduced cerebellar-subcortical connectivity. Utilizing the dFIP concept, we pinpoint specific functional connections that differentiate healthy controls from individuals with mental illness, underscoring its utility in identifying neurobiological markers. In summary, our findings delineate how dFIPs serve as unique fingerprints for different mental disorders.

">Augmenting complex and dynamic performance through mindfulness-based cognitive training: an investigation of on-task EEG dynamics.</a></h4>

              
                Mindfulness-based cognitive training exhibits great propensity for improving cognitive performance across a range of contexts. However, the neurophysiological basis of these cognitive enhancements has remained relatively unclear. Previous studies have widely examined EEG during mindfulness practice - or made comparisons with long-term meditators and controls - but have failed to capture how EEG dynamics in subsequent cognitive testing scenarios might be altered as a function of mindfulness-based interventions. The current study therefore aimed to assess a variety of EEG dynamics (oscillatory, aperiodic, and event-related) during engagement in a dynamic and complex cognitive task, following a mindfulness-based cognitive training regime. Participants (n = 40, age range = 18 - 38) attended the lab on two separate occasions (pre- and post-a web-based one-week mindfulness intervention), where EEG was recorded during engagement in the Target Motion Analyst (TMA) task. Previous analysis of the same participants demonstrated that greater adherence to the mindfulness-based cognitive training was associated with improved performance on the TMA task (Dziego, Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, Schlesewsky et al., 2024). Here, we capitalise on these previous findings to assess whether adherence is paralleled by measurable differences in on-task EEG dynamics. Linear mixed-effects modelling demonstrated that, while main effects were observed across session, adherence to cognitive training was not directly associated with alpha power, theta power or 1/f parameters. Challenges also arose when computing event-related potentials (ERPs), illustrating the difficulties of using this technique in more complex testing environments. While these results are challenging to place within the context of previous EEG studies on meditation and cognitive performance, our findings highlight the complexities in understanding the cognitive benefits of mindfulness-based training interventions through EEG dynamics observed during subsequent cognitive testing.

	<p>To better understand the individual differences in fairness, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the fairness characteristics of deaf college students through the ultimatum game task. Behaviorally, the significant main effect of the proposal type was found, which meant both deaf and hearing college students showed a lower acceptance rate for the more unfair proposal. Interestingly, we found a significant interaction between group and proposal type in the early stage (N1). Moreover, in the deaf college group, N1 (induced by moderately and very unfair proposals) was significantly larger than that of fair proposals. However, we found that deaf college students had smaller amplitudes on P2 and P3 than hearing college students. These results suggested that deaf college students might pursue more equity strongly so they are more sensitive to unfair information in the early stage. In a word, we should provide more fair allocations for deaf college students in our harmonious society.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive impairment is common in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and occurs through multiple mechanisms, including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pathology and the involvement of &amp;amp;alpha;-synucleinopathies. We aimed to investigate the pathological biomarkers of both PD and AD in plasma and neuronal extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their association with different types of cognitive impairment in PD patients. Methods: A total of 122 patients with PD and 30 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional cohort study between March 2021 and July 2023. Non-dementia PD patients were divided into amnestic and non-amnestic groups according to the memory domain of a neuropsychological assessment. Plasma and neuronal EV biomarkers, including &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein (&amp;amp;alpha;-syn), beta-amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;), total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), were measured using a single-molecule array and a chemiluminescence immunoassay, respectively. Results: Neuronal EV but not plasma &amp;amp;alpha;-syn levels, were significantly increased in PD as compared to healthy controls, and they were positively associated with UPDRS part III scores and the severity of cognitive impairment. A lower plasma A&amp;amp;beta;42 level and higher neuronal EV T-tau level were found in the amnestic PD group compared to the non-amnestic PD group. Conclusions: The results of the current study demonstrate that neuronal EV &amp;amp;alpha;-syn levels can be a sensitive biomarker for assisting in the diagnosis and disease severity prediction of PD. Both AD and PD pathologies are important factors in cognitive impairment associated with PD, and AD pathologies are more involved in amnestic memory deficit in PD.</p>

	<p>Incidental visuospatial learning acquired under incidental conditions is more vulnerable to aging than in the intentional case. The theta and gamma correlates of the coding and retrieval of episodic memory change during aging. Based on the vulnerability of incidental coding to aging, different theta and gamma correlates could occur under the incidental versus intentional coding and retrieval of visuospatial information. Theta and gamma EEG was recorded from the frontotemporal regions, and incidental/intentional visuospatial learning was evaluated in young (25&amp;amp;ndash;60 years old) and elderly (60&amp;amp;ndash;85 years old) participants. The EEG recorded during encoding and retrieval was compared between incidental low-demand, incidental high-demand, and intentional conditions through an ANCOVA considering the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s gender, IQ, and years of schooling as covariates. Older adults exhibited worse performances, especially in place&amp;amp;ndash;object associations. After the intentional study, older participants showed a further increase in false-positive errors. Higher power at the theta and gamma bands was observed for frontotemporal derivations in older participants for both encoding and retrieval. Under retrieval, only young participants had lower power in terms of errors compared with correct responses. In conclusion, the different patterns of power and coherence support incidental and intentional visuospatial encoding and retrieval in young and elderly individuals. The correlates of power with behavior are sensitive to age and performance.</p>

                <p>Language is an evolutionarily salient faculty for humans that relies on a distributed brain network spanning across frontal, temporal, parietal, and subcortical regions. To understand whether the complex language network shares common or distinct genetic mechanisms, we examined the relationships between the genetic effects underlying the brain responses to language and a set of object domains that have been suggested to coevolve with language: tools, faces (indicating social), and body parts (indicating social and gesturing). Analyzing the twin datasets released by the Human Connectome Project that had functional magnetic resonance imaging data from human twin subjects (monozygotic and dizygotic) undergoing language and working memory tasks contrasting multiple object domains (198 females and 144 males for the language task; 192 females and 142 males for the working memory task), we identified a set of cortical regions in the frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical regions whose activity to language was significantly genetically influenced. The heterogeneity of the genetic effects among these language clusters was corroborated by significant differences of the human gene expression profiles (Allen Human Brain Atlas dataset). Among them, the bilateral basal ganglia (mainly dorsal caudate) exhibited a common genetic basis for language, tool, and body part processing, and the right superior temporal gyrus exhibited a common genetic basis for language and tool processing across multiple types of analyses. These results uncovered the heterogeneous genetic patterns of language neural processes, shedding light on the evolution of language and its shared origins with tools and bodily functions.</p>

                Background The global construction industry causes considerable stress to workers, affecting them physically and mentally. Stress, a reaction to difficult situations, can cause negative health effects. The demanding environment of a construction site increases stress, which leads to psychological, physical, and behavioral reactions. Traditional treatments often have side effects and social stigma. Hydrotherapy, which uses water for healing, offers a promising alternative that promotes relaxation and detoxification. Its multiple benefits make it a valuable stress management tool. This scoping review aims to critically analyze existing interventions on physiological well-being popular in the construction industry and to investigate the biological responses of hydrotherapy to stress markers. Finally, make recommendations that support the health of construction industry workers. Methods An evaluation funneled by the Arksey and O’Malley framework, improvements plus suggestions by Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien, Daudt et al., with the 2015 Johanna Briggs Institute guidelines will be performed. Organized electronic explorations of records and search engines including Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Google Scholar, plus IEEE Xplore will be conducted to retrieve distributed peer-reviewed articles from all research projects, excluding reviews and gray published works. All literature, research questions and sub-questions meeting the inclusion criteria will be integrated in this evaluation. All searched literature is transferred to the Endnote 21 library. The quality evaluation of the involved papers will be achieved by applying the MMAT 2018 version. Discussion We envision charting applicable sources on stress, researching the efficacy of treatment alternatives for stress as well as assessing their correlation with quality of life in construction workers. This study is expected to expose research gaps, which could guide future accomplishment research on stress treatment mediations.

Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was utilized. In the quantitative phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 1008 students (773 females and 235 males) from 23 Syrian universities. A questionnaire consisting of 48 items was designed to be completed by pharmacy students using a 5-point Likert scale. In the qualitative phase, twelve questions were developed to interview thirty pharmacy students from five Syrian universities to obtain in-depth insights into the factors influencing their academic achievement. Results A significant number of students lacked effective time management skills, identified as a weakness among students. The majority of students faced challenges in maintaining a consistent study routine, averaging a score of (2.0). Motivation towards learning emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing academic performance. Lecturers in the pharmacy faculty employed traditional teaching methods (2.01), and the pharmacy curriculum was perceived as lacking modernity (1.92). Quantitative findings demonstrated that pharmacy students experienced exam-related anxiety (2.05), identified as a weakness in the qualitative phase. Factors associated with the Syrian crisis, like unreliable electricity (1.87) and transportation issues (1.83), could have an impact on academic achievement. Economic conditions were identified as challenging to students’ academic performance, negatively affecting the learning process (1.98). Conclusion The results of the study demonstrate that personal factors, lecturers, educational environment, exams, and the Syrian crisis influence the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-867/v1?src=rss">More foreign-accented but more comprehensible: Attrition and amelioration of L1 speech in proficient L2 learners [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background There is an increasing interest in cross-linguistic influences of the second language (L2) on the first (L1), but its communicative impact remains to be elucidated. This study investigates how L2 learners’ L1 pronunciation is perceived as foreign-accented and (in) comprehensible as a function of their L2 learning experience and proficiency levels. Methods Read speech of 154 L1 Japanese learners of L2 English in the J-AESOP corpus was examined, where approximately one-third of them had lived in English-speaking countries and the rest had never lived outside of Japan. Their L1 speech was rated by another group of native Japanese listeners for accentedness and comprehensibility (from October 25, 2022 to August 20, 2023), while their L2 speech was previously rated by native American English listeners for nativelikeness or proficiency. The speakers’ vowel acoustics were also examined. Results More proficient L2 speakers were perceived as more foreign-accented in their L1, but only if they had lived overseas; their length of residence abroad predicted the degree of perceived accentedness. In contrast, more proficient L2 speakers were consistently perceived as more comprehensible in the L1, regardless of prior overseas experience. Acoustic analyses indicated that perceived accentedness is associated with a clockwise chain shift of all vowel categories in the vowel space. It was also revealed that the dispersion, rather than compactness, of vowel production contributed to perceived comprehensibility, although the degree of L1 vowel dispersion did not predict L2 proficiency. Conclusions The overall results suggest two main conclusions. First, perceptible L1 foreign accent likely results from L1 disuse rather than L2 interference, thereby L1 pronunciation differs from native norms at a system-wide rather than category-specific level. Second, L2 learning has a positive influence on perceived L1 comprehensibility, rather than individuals with clearer and more comprehensible L1 speech being inherently better L2 learners.

                Background Music, a profound human expression, can have physical implications for its practitioners. Musicians face various physical challenges that can impact their well-being, with craniofacial and temporomandibular pain being prevalent yet understudied. Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) affects up to one-third of the population, though prevalence varies by study. While musculoskeletal issues like carpal tunnel syndrome are well-documented in musicians, craniofacial and temporomandibular pain is less explored. This study aims to determine the differences in TMJD frequency among music students of different instrumental specialties. Methods The sample was composed of students between 12 and 25 years of age from the National University of Music of Peru. A stratified random probability sample was chosen. Data were collected using a structured instrument covering general data, academic information, dental malocclusion, the Fonseca Simplified Anamnestic Index, and the Global Stress Perception Scale. Statistical analysis included Pearson's Chi-square test and a generalized linear model regression. Results The sample included 71.4% males with a median age of 23 years. Class II dental occlusion was most common (51.4%). TMJD prevalence was: 14.3% no TMJD, 60.0% mild TMJD, 22.9% moderate TMJD, and 2.9% severe TMJD. Metal wind (PR=0.04, 95%CI [0.00; 50.04], p=0.002) and woodwind players (PR=0.03, 95%CI [0.00; 0.56], p=0.018) had lower TMJD prevalence compared to plucked string and percussion players. Post-regression analysis indicated significant differences between metal wind and percussion students (p=0.030) and between percussion and woodwind students (p=0.025). These results are supported by the adjusted ratio of proportions analysis, which maintains statistical significance. Conclusion We found significant differences in TMJD prevalence among music students based on their instrumental specialty, with lower rates in metal wind and woodwind players compared to plucked string and percussion players.

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

                Background Pragmatic language assessment in children is performed in line with standard protocols, guidelines, and best practices. The absence of these aspects in the Indian context has resulted in the quest to explore the approaches used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to assess pragmatic language impairments. This survey explored the current practices of SLPs towards the assessment of pragmatic language among preschool children in India. It also aimed to identify the barriers, facilitators and identify the level of knowledge, skill and overall practice of SLPs towards their practices using self-appraisal. Methods A total of 100 SLPs(94 females and 6 males) working with preschool aged children (three-to-six-year-olds) from across different Indian states participated in the survey. Participants were enquired about the aspects of pragmatic language assessed, methods used for assessment, awareness and use of Indian tools, the settings, members, and language used for the assessment. Additionally, they were asked to mention the specific tools used, informal methods used, barriers and facilitators, and self-appraise their knowledge, skill and overall practice. Results Majority of participants assessed multiple aspects of pragmatic language. All used a combination of different assessment methods, with the participants commonly using informal compared to formal approaches. Preschoolers were assessed at multiple settings, along with different communication partners. Lack of awareness on assessment tools developed in India was the major barrier, while the use of informal tasks or activities were the major facilitators influencing pragmatic language assessment to a greater extent. The knowledge and skills for the assessment of pragmatic language obtained poorer scores compared to practices. Conclusions The assessment practices of the SLPs were largely influenced by the unavailability of developed or adapted tools for Indian preschoolers, leading to the need to develop indigenous assessment tools. Certain considerations for further assessment practices have been identified and discussed.

                Occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is a rare genetic disease and copper transport disorder caused by a faulty ATP7A gene with multisystemic presentations, most originally related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue affections. In our case, a male neonate with OHS presented soon after birth with pathognomonic occipital exostosis, cutis laxa at the nape region, and widely opened skull sutures and fontanels. A skeletal survey showed occipital exostosis projecting from the line of insertion of the trapezius muscle and wide fontanels on skull X-ray films with no exostoses or deformities elsewhere. In addition to our case report being the second reported case for the condition detected early in the neonatal period, it also emphasizes the importance of investigating any sign thoroughly, as it may be an early alarming sign of a progressive disease that may affect the patient’s quality of life. In addition, it highlights the value of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of these patients.

                Background The purpose of this paper was to systematically review the current literature on the use of guest speakers in higher education teaching and evaluate the implications of the findings for teaching in pharmaceutical teaching. Methods A comprehensive search of different academic databases for literature on the use of guest speakers in higher education teaching was conducted and articles meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. A total of 15 articles were used in this systematic review. Results The use of guest speakers has critical benefits including promoting better learning, good career preparedness, positive learning outcomes, and creating an environment where learners have the opportunity to perceive real-world scenarios from the experiences of the guest speakers and thus be better prepared for the job market. With the increasing importance of the role of guest speakers in higher education learning, researchers have been engaging in coming up with standards and best practices for enhancing the effectiveness of the use of guest speakers in learning. The use of guest speakers in the teaching of pharmacy can enhance positive health outcomes by allowing students to have a better view of the situations they will deal with in their careers. Conclusion The use of guest speakers can have major positive outcomes in promoting effectiveness in learning among students of pharmacy. Professors teaching pharmacy courses have the opportunity to benefit from various tools and resources that academic researchers have developed for guiding the process of the use of guest speakers in pharmacy teaching.

                Background Excessive smartphone use has become a growing public health concern, especially among young people. Previous studies have suggested a possible relationship between excessive smartphone use and bruxism. However, the evidence on this relationship is still limited and inconclusive. This study aimed to determine the relationship between smartphone dependence and addiction and bruxism in “NEET” (not in education, employment or training) young people in two coastal cities in Peru: Piura and Chincha. Methods A cross-sectional, correlational, and exploratory study was conducted. The sample consisted of 195 "NEETs" young people who attended to dental office. Two data collection instruments were used: the Smartphone Dependence and Addiction Scale (EDAS-18) and the self-reported bruxism questionnaire (CBA). The Chi2 Pearson test was used to analyze the association between the variables. Results In Piura, a significant association was found between smartphone dependence or addiction and bruxism (49.3% of young people with smartphone dependence or addiction had bruxism, p-value = 0.003). However, in Chincha this relationship was not significant. In the latter city, bruxism showed a significant association with gender (men had a higher prevalence of bruxism, p-value = 0.034), but not with smartphone dependence or addiction (p-value = 0.171). In Piura, the proportion of bruxism was 3.77 times higher in those with smartphone dependence or addiction in the simple model (p-value = 0.004), and 5.38 times higher in the adjusted model (p-value = 0.001). Conclusion This study highlights the regional variability in the relationship between smartphone use and bruxism among “NEETs” young people. A significant association is evident in Piura but not in Chincha, which underscores the need for context-adapted interventions to address the effects of excessive technology use on oral health.

                Background Heat induced by thermogenesis is an essential therapeutic intervention in medical practice. Moreover, thermogenesis improves the innate immune response. This study focuses on hand-clasping with a raised thumb (HCRT) as a thermogenic source and its effect on heart rate variability (HRV). Methods The study analyzed the ECG, thermal images of the upper body, axillary temperature, and breath exergy of 15 participants. The metabolic effect of thermogenesis is an important factor in type II diabetes mellitus (type II DM). Therefore, the clinical application included recording capillary blood glucose of 12 type-II DM subjects before and after the HCRT intervention. Results The mean axillary temperature slope increased by 11.5 %. The spatial change in temperature gradient (∇2T) at hot and cold spots also slightly increased by 3.42 % and 2.53 %, respectively. HRV improved as the VLFHF ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.05) by 52.62 %. The very low frequency (VLF) component of HRV has a relationship to thermoregulation, which is reflected through a significant increase (p < 0.05) of 41.7 % for the power under sub-VLF at 0.0327-0.04 Hz during HCRT. The spot width (SW), range, and norm of ∇2T reduces insignificantly during HCRT. There was a significant (p < 0.001) increase in the exhaled temperature by 0.5 ° C in both nostrils during 1st phase of HCRT. The standard deviation of exergy in the right nostril showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) of 72.72 % during HCRT. The Clinical tests showed a significant reduction (p < 0.001) of 24.14 % in capillary blood glucose (CBG) after HCRT. Conclusions HCRT aids in thermogenesis with higher exergy and HRV owing to a significant reduction in the VLFHF ratio.

                Background Determine the effects of a multifactorial lifestyle intervention on physical activity (PA), BMI and health-related quality of life (QoL) in obese and overweight adolescents. Methods Nine schools in India were clustered randomly in a 12-month study with students allocated to a multifactorial intervention (MFI), or exercise only (EX) or control (CON) group. Participants were adolescents aged 11-16 years (n=671). In the MFI group, adolescents and their parents received lifestyle education using a validated booklet combined with a PA intervention for school students. The EX group received school-based PA only; the CON group continued regular activities. Primary outcomes were PA levels measured with the PAQ-A, and BMI; the secondary outcome was health-related QoL. A linear regression statistical model was used to analyse time, group effects and interactions, with Bonferroni correction for within-group differences at baseline (T0) and at 12-weeks (T1) (post-intervention), 6-month (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups. Results Significant time and group effects observed for all groups with PA scores (p<0.001), with MFI group having largest increase in PA; with BMI (p<0.001) and MFI showing the least gain in BMI; and HRQOL (p<0.001), with MFI group showing greatest improvement in scores. There were significant increases in PA at T1 and T3 time-points with the EX group, and at T3 time-point only for MFI and CON, with MFI group showing largest increase in HRQOL scores. BMI increased significantly for all groups at T2 (MFI p=0.001, EX p<0.001) and T3 (p<0.001), while HRQOL increased significantly for both MFI and EX at both follow-ups (p<0.001). Conclusions School-based lifestyle MFI was more effective for improving PA, lifestyle behaviours and HRQOL than exercise alone for adolescents, although BMI was not reduced. MFI with PA could be an effective school-based approach for behaviour modification but BMI has limitations for measuring body composition changes.

                The translation of animal-based biomedical research into clinical research is often inadequate. Maximizing translation should be central to animal research on human diseases, guiding researchers in study design and animal model selection. However, practical considerations often drive the choice of animal model, which may not always reflect key patient characteristics, such as sex and age, impacting the disease's course. Despite diseases affecting both sexes, researchers frequently use male mice. To address this imbalance, journals and funding agencies have begun questioning the sex of animals used in studies and issued new guidelines. Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade. By systematically assessing the age and sex of the mice, we aim to initiate a discussion on the appropriate choice of animal model to improve the translatability of research results.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with early diagnosis and risk factor identification crucial for improving outcomes. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measurements have emerged as promising tools in breast cancer diagnostics. However, the influence of hormonal status on these measurements remains unclear. Objective This scoping review aims to synthesize current evidence on how hormonal changes in pre- and post-menopausal women influence ADC values of benign, malignant, and fibroglandular breast tissues. Method Following the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases for relevant studies published between January 2000 and 2021. Inclusion criteria encompassed 1.5 Tesla MRI studies reporting ADC values in female subjects, considering menopausal status. Results Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 612 patients, were analyzed. Findings suggest that menopausal status may influence ADC values, with postmenopausal women generally showing lower ADC values in both normal fibroglandular tissue and breast lesions. The impact of menstrual cycle phases on ADC values was less consistent across studies. Conclusions This review highlights the potential influence of hormonal status on ADC values in breast tissues. While DWI with ADC mapping shows promise as a reliable diagnostic tool across different hormonal states, further research is needed to fully understand and account for hormonal influences on ADC measurements. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, standardization of DWI protocols, and integration of hormonal status information into breast cancer risk assessment models.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Sui's hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

                Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are aquatic sessile metazoans found worldwide in marine and freshwater environments. They are significant in the animal tree of life as one of the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and as filter feeders play crucial ecological roles, particularly in coral reefs, but are susceptible to the effects of climate change. In the face of the current biodiversity crisis, genomic data is crucial for species conservation efforts and predicting their evolutionary potential in response to environmental changes. However, there is a limited availability of culturable sponge species with annotated high-quality genomes to further comprehensive insights into animal evolution, function, and their response to the ongoing global change. Despite the publication of a few high-quality annotated sponge genomes, there remains a gap in resources for culturable sponge species. To address this gap, we provide high quality draft genomes of the two congeneric aquarium species Tethya wilhelma and Tethya minuta, small ball-shaped demosponges that are easily maintained long-term in ex situ culture. As such, they offer promising opportunities as laboratory models to contribute to advancing our understanding of sponge biology and provide valuable resources for studying animal evolution, function, and responses to environmental challenges.

                Purpose: This study aims to survey the demographic status of aesthetic plastic surgeons in an economically developed region and to investigate their continuing training needs in contents, training methods, and barriers in private and government hospitals.   Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire was conducted from January to December, 2022 in Guangdong, China. In-depth interviews were conducted with key informants to gain insights on the current demographic status. Demographic data and training needs assessment were collected and compared with the chi-square test, Fisher’s test, Mann-Whitney U-test using R software. Results: The disparity of surgeons’ demographic data between private and government hospitals was small. Over 60% of practicing aesthetic plastic surgeons transferred from other specialties, and one third of them had less than three years of working experience. Half of surgeons attended training less than three times with an affordable expense of 1000-5000RMB. Almost 80% of them had strong willingness to attend a continuing training program. They prefer to attend further study in a tertiary hospital, with a short topic-focused training course and operation demonstrations. Their favorable training contents were rhinoplasty, eye surgery, and new technologies. Our questionnaire survey revealed the likelihood that the surgeons had a graduate degree in government hospitals outweighed those in private hospitals (P<0.05). Results also showed that the government hospitals focused more on repair and reconstructive surgery and academic research, whereas, private hospitals focused on market needs and were more profit-driven, where the organizational needs had influence on their different training needs for aesthetic plastic surgeons. Conclusion: It would be favorable to take the demographic status of aesthetic plastic surgeons and organizational needs into consideration in designing a continuing training program in plastic surgery.

                Background Socket preservation is a surgical procedure aimed at preserving the dimensions of the alveolar bone following tooth extraction. It is performed by filling the extraction socket with bone graft material with or without a barrier membrane. Recently, dentine obtained from extracted teeth has been tried as an autograft for socket preservation. Studies have compared the use of dentin to other bone grafts, however, systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy of dentin for socket preservation are limited. Hence, this systematic review protocol is proposed to generate evidence on the efficacy of dentin as a viable alternative to other bone graft materials for socket preservation. Methods This systematic review protocol was prepared according to the Methodological Expectations of the Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) guidelines. It will be conducted using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, Cochrane Central, and EBSCO databases and clinical trial registries, will be searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies that have used autologous dentin graft (either in particulate/putty, or/matrix form) for socket preservation. The radiographic and clinical assessment of bone and soft tissue healing of the preserved sockets along with patient-related outcomes following surgery will be assessed. The risk of bias assessment of the RCTs and Non-RCTs will be assessed using the ‘Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool (ROB II) and ROBINS-I respectively. The certainty of evidence will be assessed by the GRADE approach. Discussion This evidence is important for dental clinicians and the public to make an informed decision when choosing graft material for socket preservation. The extracted teeth are considered biological waste; however, this evidence provides scope for using a less invasive autograft for bone regenerative procedures.

                Midkine is a secreted protein that acts as a growth factor or cytokine involved in cell survival and inflammatory processes. It accumulates in amyloid plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The reproducibility of Midkine research would be enhanced if the community had access to well-characterized anti-Midkine antibodies. In this study, we characterized 8 commercial Midkine antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in a knockout cell line and isogenic parental control. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

<p>+)-Catechin exerts neuroprotective effects by triggering the Nrf2-induced antioxidant system and attenuates NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle activation through inhibition of ROS production and the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, thereby alleviating CCI-induced neuropathic pain in male rats.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms by which (+)-catechin alleviates neuropathic pain. Thirty-two male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into four groups: the sham group, the chronic constriction injury (CCI)group, the CCI+ ibuprofen group, and the CCI+ (+)-catechin group. CCI surgery induces thermal hyperalgesia in rats and (+)-catechin ameliorated CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and repaired damaged sciatic nerve in rats. CCI decreased SOD levels in male rat spinal cord dorsal horn and promoted MDA production, induced oxidative stress by increasing NOX4 levels and decreasing antioxidant enzyme HO-1 levels, and also increased protein levels of TLR4, p-NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome components, and IL-1β. In contrast, (+)-catechin reversed the above results. In i vitro experiments, (+)-catechin reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GMI-R1 cells after LPS stimulation and attenuated the co-expression of IBA-1 and NLRP3. It also showed significant inhibition of the NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammatory pathways and activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant system. Overall, these findings suggest that (+)-catechin inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through the triggering of the Nrf2-induced antioxidant system, the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, and the production of ROS to alleviate CCI-induced neuropathic pain in male rats.</p>
