              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14313">Investigating cerebral anomalies in preterm infants and associated risk factors with magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Being born very or extreme preterm is a major source of cerebral anomalies and neurodevelopmental disorders, whose occurrence depends on many perinatal factors. A better understanding of these factors could be provided by cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age (TEA). Objective: To investigate, through cerebral TEA-MRIs, the relationship between the main perinatal factors, the occurrence of cerebral anomalies, and cerebral volumetry. Methods: We assembled a cohort of preterm babies born before 32 weeks of gestation who underwent a cerebral TEA-MRI. We assessed cerebral anomalies using a radiological scoring system -- the Kidokoro scoring -- and performed cerebral volumetry. We investigated the relationships between 9 clinical factors (birth characteristics, resuscitation treatments{\ldots}), Kidokoro scores, and brain volumes. Results: Among 110 preterms who underwent a cerebral MRI at TEA, only 6% suffered moderate-to-severe brain anomalies. We identified mechanical ventilation as a risk factor for cerebral anomalies (adjusted Odds-Ratio aOR = 4.6, 95% Confidence Interval CI [1.7-12.8]) and prolonged parenteral nutrition as a protective factor for white matter anomalies (aOR = 0.2, 95%CI [0.1-0.8]). Mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01) and being born small for gestational age (p < 0.001) were risk factors for the reduction of cerebral volumes. An increase in brain lesion severity was associated with decreased cerebral volumes (p = 0.016). Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of treatment-related perinatal factors on the occurrence of cerebral anomalies in very and extreme preterms, and the interest in using both qualitative (Kidokoro scoring) and quantitative (volumetry) MRI-tools.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14961">Power-Law Scaling in the Classification Performance of Small-Scale Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the classification capability of small-scale spiking neural networks based on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model. We analyze the relationship between classification accuracy and three factors: the number of neurons, the number of stimulus nodes, and the number of classification categories. Notably, we employ a large language model (LLM) to assist in discovering the underlying functional relationships among these variables, and compare its performance against traditional methods such as linear and polynomial fitting. Experimental results show that classification accuracy follows a power-law scaling primarily with the number of categories, while the effects of neuron count and stimulus nodes are relatively minor. A key advantage of the LLM-based approach is its ability to propose plausible functional forms beyond pre-defined equation templates, often leading to more concise or accurate mathematical descriptions of the observed scaling laws. This finding has important implications for understanding efficient computation in biological neural systems and for pioneering new paradigms in AI-aided scientific discovery.

                arXiv:2601.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical gamma ($\gamma$)-band activity reflects local excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. In schizophrenia (SCZ), reduced task-evoked gamma suggests altered E/I dynamics, but it is unclear whether differences stem from input properties or systematic shifts in E/I operating point and gain. We coupled a cochlear-inspired speech front end to a Wilson-Cowan E/I model to simulate gamma responses across three conditions: Healthy, SCZ-speech, and SCZ-semantics. Metrics included event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP$_\gamma$) and threshold-time fraction ($\gamma%$). A stable hierarchy emerged: Healthy(speech/semantics) $>$ SCZ(speech) $>$ SCZ(semantics), robust under equal-energy control and gain perturbations. Network dynamics coincided with single-node solutions, supporting interpretability. Pharmacological analogs showed bidirectional effects: reduced inhibition lowered $\gamma$, while reduced excitation increased $\gamma$, with no self-sustained oscillations. Findings indicate SCZ gamma deficits align more with shifts in E/I operating point and gain than input differences. This pipeline provides a testable, reusable mechanistic framework for speech-evoked gamma and a baseline for cross-population studies.

                arXiv:2601.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.

                arXiv:2601.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cognition exhibits strong circadian modulation, yet its influence on high-dimensional semantic behavior remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with "rich-get-richer" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood. The observed temporal structure aligns with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems, suggesting that biological circadian rhythms extend to the semantic domain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10221">A Unified Dynamical Field Theory of Learning, Inference, and Emergence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.10221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning, inference, and emergence in biological and artificial systems are often studied within disparate theoretical frameworks, ranging from energy-based models to recurrent and attention-based architectures. Here we develop a unified dynamical field theory in which learning and inference are governed by a minimal stochastic dynamical equation admitting a Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--de Dominicis formulation. Within this framework, inference corresponds to saddle-point trajectories of the associated action, while fluctuation-induced loop corrections render collective modes dynamically emergent and generate nontrivial dynamical time scales. A central result of this work is that cognitive function is controlled not by microscopic units or precise activity patterns, but by the collective organization of dynamical time scales. We introduce the \emph{time-scale density of states} (TDOS) as a compact diagnostic of the distribution of collective relaxation modes governing inference dynamics. Learning and homeostatic regulation are naturally interpreted as processes that reshape both the effective potential and the underlying state-space geometry, thereby reorganizing the TDOS and selectively stabilizing slow collective modes that support stable inference, memory, and context-dependent computation despite stochasticity and structural irregularity. This framework unifies energy-based models, recurrent neural networks, transformer architectures, and biologically motivated homeostatic dynamics within a single physical description, and provides a principled route toward understanding cognition as an emergent dynamical phenomenon.

                arXiv:2601.10397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is often regarded as a presynaptic filter of spikes, independent of postsynaptic activity. Recent experiments, however, indicate an associative STP that depends on pre- and postsynaptic coactivation. We develop a normative, information-theoretic theory of associative STP. Extending Fisher-information-based learning to Tsodyks-Markram synapses, we derive learning rules for baseline weight and release probability that maximize stimulus information under resource constraints. The rules split into a postsynaptic term tracking local firing and a presynaptic, phase-advanced term that selectively detects stimulus onset. For slowly varying inputs, this onset sensitivity favors anti-causal connectivity and enhances response offset during drive and reverse replay after drive removal in recurrent circuits. Linear-response analysis shows that STP yields frequency-dependent phase selectivity and that release-probability constraints tune temporal asymmetry. These results identify release-probability plasticity as a principled substrate for rapidly reconfigurable temporal coding.

                arXiv:2601.10912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.

                arXiv:2601.12054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain integrates motor suppression with motivational processes remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. The rostral Pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem structure involved in motor control, has been shown to induce transient motor arrest upon optogenetic or electrical stimulation. However, our current understanding of its potential role in linking motor suppression with motivational or reinforcement-related processes is still insufficient. To further explore the effects induced by PPN stimulations and infer the potential mechanism underlying its role involved in both motor and emotional regulation, we developed a fully automated, low-cost system combining real-time animal tracking with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, using the OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and embedded neural network models. The system autonomously detects the rat's position and triggers optical stimulation upon entry into a predefined region of interest, enabling unbiased, unsupervised behavioral assays. Optogenetic activation of CaMKIIa-expressing neurons in the rostral PPN reliably induced transient motor arrest. When motor arrest was spatially paired with a defined region of interest, rats developed a robust place preference after limited training. These results suggest that rostral PPN activation can couple motor inhibition with reinforcement-related behavioral circuitry. Together, our work provides both a technical framework for scalable closed-loop neuroscience experiments and preliminary evidence that the rostral PPN may participate in coordinating motor suppression with motivational processes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709">Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a quadratic similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in DINO, CLIP, and ImageNet-supervised ViTs, but is markedly weaker in MAE, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.

                arXiv:2601.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a critical yet computationally expensive step in training neural networks, particularly when the search space is high dimensional and nonconvex. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are often used for this purpose due to their derivative free nature and robustness against local optima. In this work, we propose Golden Eagle Genetic Optimization (GEGO), a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates the population movement strategy of Golden Eagle Optimization with the genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation.
  The main novelty of GEGO lies in embedding genetic operators directly into the iterative search process of GEO, rather than applying them as a separate evolutionary stage. This design improves population diversity during search and reduces premature convergence while preserving the exploration behavior of GEO.
  GEGO is evaluated on standard unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions from the CEC2017 suite, where it consistently outperforms its constituent algorithms and several classical metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and robustness. The algorithm is further applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset, where GEGO achieves improved classification accuracy and more stable convergence compared to GEO and GA. These results indicate that GEGO provides a balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff and is well suited for hyperparameter optimization under constrained computational settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14705">Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability and sample efficiency, but it often suffers from premature convergence due to limited exploration. In this paper, we propose POEM (Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations), a novel modification to PPO that introduces an adaptive exploration mechanism inspired by evolutionary algorithms. POEM enhances policy diversity by monitoring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a moving average of previous policies. When policy changes become minimal, indicating stagnation, POEM triggers an adaptive mutation of policy parameters to promote exploration. We evaluate POEM on four OpenAI Gym environments: CarRacing, MountainCar, BipedalWalker, and LunarLander. Through extensive fine-tuning using Bayesian optimization techniques and statistical testing using Welch's t-test, we find that POEM significantly outperforms PPO on three of the four tasks (BipedalWalker: t=-2.0642, p=0.0495; CarRacing: t=-6.3987, p=0.0002; MountainCar: t=-6.2431, p<0.0001), while performance on LunarLander is not statistically significant (t=-1.8707, p=0.0778). Our results highlight the potential of integrating evolutionary principles into policy gradient methods to overcome exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14678">Transfer Learning from One Cancer to Another via Deep Learning Domain Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.
  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.
  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.

Abstract: On and off-ramps are understudied road sections even though they introduce a higher level of variation in highway interactions. Predicting vehicles' behavior in these areas can decrease the impact of uncertainty and increase road safety. In this paper, the difference between this Area of Interest (AoI) and a straight highway section is studied. Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested. The results show great promise on horizons up to 4 seconds with prediction accuracy starting from about 76% for the AoI and 94% for the general highway scenarios on the maximum horizon.

                arXiv:2511.16485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search performance is transient during iterations and prone to degradation. Dynamic operators aim to address this but typically rely on predefined designs and localized parameter control during the search process, lacking adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for Evolutionary Optimization (LLM4EO), comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, initialization of operators is performed by transferring the strengths of classical operators via LLMs. Then, search preferences and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance and evolutionary features, accompanied by corresponding suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, gene selection priorities of operators are dynamically optimized via improvement prompting strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of populations and operators in the search, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, a series of validations on multiple benchmark datasets of the flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms both mainstream evolutionary programming and traditional EAs.

                <p>The growing therapeutic promise of repeated, low-dose ketamine treatment across various psychopathologies&mdash;including depression and drug addiction&mdash;warrants clarity on its potential addictive properties and their associated mechanisms in both sexes. Accordingly, the present work examined the effects of intermittent low-dose ketamine in male and female rats on behavioral sensitization to the locomotor-activating effects of ketamine, as well as associated molecular profiles in dopamine D1- and D2-receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1- and D2-MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Following intra-NAc infusion of a Cre-inducible RiboTag virus, locomotor activity was measured in adult Drd1a-iCre and Drd2-iCre male and female rats in either diestrus or proestrus following repeated administration of ketamine (0, 10, or 20&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) to evaluate the development of locomotor sensitization. Female&mdash;but not male&mdash;rats developed sensitization to the locomotor-activating effects of ketamine, occurring more rapidly in proestrus than in diestrus females at the lower dose tested. To examine enduring context- and cell-type-specific changes in translating mRNAs associated with sensitization to ketamine, RNA sequencing was performed on polyribosome-bound mRNA of D1- and D2-MSNs isolated from the NAc of sensitized females in a drug-free state. A greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed selectively in D1-MSNs of ketamine-treated proestrus versus diestrus females, which were broadly related to regulation of transcription and epitranscriptional modification. These findings provide novel evidence of cell-type-specific and estrous cycle-dependent molecular profiles responsive to intermittent ketamine treatment in female rats and identify posttranscriptional mechanisms with relevance to ketamine's effects on behavioral plasticity.</p>

                <p>by Qi Jiang, Longquan Li, Lei Zhang, Lin Wan</p>

The advent of temporal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has enabled in-depth investigation of dynamic processes in heterogeneous multicellular systems. Despite remarkable advancements in computational methods for modeling cellular dynamics, integrating cell-cell interactions (CCIs) into these models remains a major challenge. This is particularly true when dealing with high-dimensional gene expression profiles from large populations of interacting cells, where the intricate interplay between cells can be obscured by data complexity. To address this, we present scIMF, a single-cell deep-generative Interacting Mean Field model that learns collective multicellular dynamics. Leveraging the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation framework, scIMF provides a mathematical foundation for describing interacting multicellular systems, where each cell’s evolution depends on the population’s empirical distribution. By incorporating a cell-wise attention mechanism, the model efficiently captures nonlocal and asymmetric CCIs, enabling realistic reconstruction of complex intercellular relationships in high-dimensional spaces. Benchmarking across diverse temporal scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scIMF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing gene expression at unobserved time points and in inferring cellular velocities. Furthermore, scIMF uncovers biologically interpretable, non-reciprocal interaction patterns of cells, providing a principled framework for studying complex, particularly non-equilibrium biological systems.

                <p>by Lucas Sancéré, Carina Lorenz, Doris Helbig, Oana-Diana Persa, Sonja Dengler, Alexander Kreuter, Martim Laimer, Roland Lang, Anne Fröhlich, Jennifer Landsberg, Johannes Brägelmann, Katarzyna Bozek</p>

Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analyses of Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, available tools for automatic cell type identification perform poorly on skin tissue, e.g. in the classification of non-melanoma tumor cells. This is due to a paucity of labeled training data sets and high morphological similarities between tumor and non-tumor epithelial cells in the skin. Here, we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline designed for the analysis of skin WSIs. To this end we generated two new datasets using WSIs of cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) samples, a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer, by annotating 47,392 cell nuclei across 5 cell types in 21 WSIs and segmenting tumor regions in 144 WSIs. Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification, as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.907 for tumor region segmentation. From these output, the pipeline can generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. As an exemplary use-case, we deploy Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner predicts patient response with mean area under ROC curve of 0.755 ± 0.091 over cross-validation, and identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology. Importantly, Histo-Miner is designed to allow for its use on other cancer types and on other training datasets. Our tool and datasets are available through our github repository: https://github.com/bozeklab/histo-miner.

                <p>by Esther Li Wen Choo, Kris V. Parag, Jo Yi Chow, Jue Tao Lim</p>

Accurate real-time estimation of the effective reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) is critical for infectious disease surveillance and response. In vector-borne diseases like dengue, temperature strongly influences disease transmission by affecting generation times. However, most existing R<sub>t</sub> estimation methods assume a fixed generation interval, leading to biased estimates and unreliable assessments of transmission risk in settings with fluctuating temperatures. In this study, we proposed and evaluated a novel framework to estimate a temperature-dependent reproduction number (td-R<sub>t</sub>) that dynamically updates the generation interval distribution based on observed temperature data. We obtained real-time estimates of td-R<sub>t</sub> through an adapted Bayesian recursive filtering process. Using real and simulated data for a temperature-sensitive disease (dengue), we evaluated the performance of td-R<sub>t</sub> against the typically used temperature-independent reproduction number (ti-R<sub>t</sub>) and angular reproduction number (Ωt), which does not require specification of the generation interval. Simulated data was generated under varying patterns of underlying R<sub>t</sub> and temperature datasets. Performance was evaluated by classification accuracy, defined by the proportion of instances where estimated R<sub>t</sub> correctly identified whether the true R<sub>t</sub> was above or below 1. We found that td-R<sub>t</sub> generally outperformed ti-R<sub>t</sub> and Ωt in classifying periods of epidemic growth. td-R<sub>t</sub> achieved the highest classification accuracy in 54 of 72 simulation scenarios, with accuracy ranging from 37.1%–95.9%. td-R<sub>t</sub> accuracy was highest in scenarios with greater temperature variability, surpassing other methods by up to 20%. With Singapore dengue case data, td-R<sub>t</sub> and Ωt signals showed 75% similarity, highlighting Ωt’s potential as a complementary measure that is less sensitive to model assumptions. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for temperature in real-time transmissibility estimates, as temperature-driven variations in generation time can introduce model misspecification and bias. Incorporating temperature is especially crucial for climate-sensitive diseases like dengue. Future work could extend this framework to other pathogens and additional transmission-relevant covariates.

                <p>by Yun Sok Lee</p>

In obesity, nutrient excess and altered adipocyte secretory profiles reprogram cell-intrinsic metabolism, leading to the activation of immune cells within metabolically active tissues such as adipose tissue. This obesity-associated chronic low-grade metabolic inflammation (often referred to as metaflammation) is a well-established driver of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. However, several lines of emerging evidence suggest that metaflammation is not merely a pathologic process, but may also serve as an adaptive response that supports metabolic homeostasis, particularly at the early stages of obesity. This Essay discusses immunometabolic mechanisms underlying the dual nature of metaflammation in obesity, highlighting how its initially beneficial effects can transition into detrimental outcomes.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                Background In general, truncated distributions provide a flexible framework that allows for more realistic and accurate representation of constrained data compared to using non-truncated distributions, making them a fundamental element in modern statistical models and the analysis of constrained data. Methods Right – truncated [0,1] exponential Rayleigh distribution ([0,1]-RTERD) for lifetime is presented in this paper. The new distribution contains two parameters, one of scale and another for the shape. Statistical functions of the (RTERD), such as cumulative functions (CDF), probability density (PDF), survival, and hazard functions, are presented in terms of mathematical construction and graphics. Besides, discuss the mathematical and statistical properties of the new distribution, including median, moments of the origin, coefficients of skewness and kurtosis, order statistic, moment generating function, the rėnyi entropy, quantile function. Results the parameters of this life expectancy distribution will be estimate using the maximum likelihood estimation method and compare new continuous model with other continuous distributions using statistical information criterion. Finally, apply the ([0,1]-RTERD) to actual datasets to validate the model’s practicality. The ([0,1]-RTERD) frequently produces a better fit and shows more modeling precision when handling lifespan and reliability data, according to comparisons with traditional models. Conclusions The [0,1]-RTERD provides a new framework for more accurately dealing with data restricted to the interval [0,1], where it is characterized by several important properties, including changing the shape, center, and width of the original distribution as a result of the normalization process, which is reflected in the expected value, standard deviation, and other instantaneous properties.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-703/v2?src=rss">Research Trends on Motivation and Job Satisfaction: A Scientometric Analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background All the scholarly papers on “Job Satisfaction” and “Motivation” published from the year 2014 to 2023 constitute the database for conducting a scientometric analysis. Methods The types of records in the literature, including authors, nations, keywords, references, and citation counts, were studied using scientometric analysis. The keywords “Job Satisfaction” and “Motivation” were used to gather all data from the SCOPUS database as of January 10th, 2025. Both VosViewer and Biblioshiny were used to analyze the data. AScientometric method was used to determine the various parameters that fulfilled the research objectives. Results The study finds that there has been an increasing trend of publications and their corresponding citations from the year 2014 to 2023 and the USA publications received the highest number of citations of 8350, followed by the Netherlands (4832 citations), and the United Kingdom (2595 citations). Conclusion The evolution of publications on “Motivation” and “Job Satisfaction” from 2014 to 2023 showed a steady growth rate, despite annual variations over the previous ten years. Research on job satisfaction and motivation has advanced through the work of authors from the USA. We mapped the entire research structure and features of job satisfaction research over the past decade. This was accomplished by examining the research topics of motivation and the analysis revealed a gradual rise in scientific output on the subject of “Job Satisfaction” and “Motivation” from 2014 to 2023. Overall, the study’s findings show that research productivity in the Human Resource Management literature is increasing, which seems to be a healthy trend. The findings of this study add niceties to the corpus of existing literature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1407/v2?src=rss">Mathematical Competencies and Critical Thinking in Secondary Education: A PRISMA-Based Systematic Review (2019–2025) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The integration of mathematical competencies and critical thinking in secondary education has become increasingly relevant to equip students with the ability to reason, argue, and solve complex real-world problems. Despite its recognized importance, this integration remains fragmented across curricula and inconsistently applied in classroom practice. Methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines to analyze empirical evidence published between 2019 and 2025. Searches were performed in Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO, and Dialnet databases. Inclusion criteria focused on open-access, peer-reviewed studies in English or Spanish addressing the integration of mathematical competencies and critical thinking in secondary education. From 1,457 records initially retrieved, 24 empirical studies were selected for full analysis. Results The studies reviewed indicate that mathematical competencies, defined as the ability to model, interpret, and solve problems through logical reasoning, are reinforced when integrated with critical thinking skills such as evaluation, argumentation, and evidence-based decision-making. Active methodologies, including Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Project-Based Learning (PjBL), STEM, and gamification, were identified as the most effective strategies to foster this integration. However, their implementation is often constrained by structural barriers such as limited teacher training, rigid curricula, and insufficient technological infrastructure. Conclusion Integrative, student-centered approaches supported by active learning methodologies enhance higher-order cognitive development and prepare learners to meet the demands of 21st-century education. Future research should address methodological standardization, teacher preparation, and institutional conditions to ensure the sustainable and equitable implementation of these strategies.

                Background The representation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is disproportionate to graduates from STEM fields. There is limited research addressing challenges facing women’s retention in STEM in the UAE. Methods A cross-sectional study using a validated questionnaire was conducted. A total of 165 participants were enrolled; 62% males and 35% females. Results More women believed there is gender inequality in STEM (47% versus 28%). 44% of female participants experienced gender inequality in their careers. Men were significantly less likely to experience gender inequality (OR=0.06, 95% CI=0.02-0.16). Women reported lack of organizational emphasis on diversity and inclusion for promotion to leadership (44% versus 60%). Thematic analysis of open-ended responses showed a number of dominant barriers, such as gender bias in hiring and promotion, career impact of motherhood and family responsibilities, and lack of institutional support and flexibility. Conclusion Data confirms gender-based preconceptions and biases in STEM fields. Institutional initiatives and policies to challenge stereotypes and promote gender equality are required. The governmental role is crucial in creating an inclusive environment for women scientists.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-100/v1?src=rss">Caregiver–Elderly Communication in Dementia Care: A Systematic Literature Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Effective communication between caregivers and elderly individuals with dementia is a central component of quality dementia care, yet it is frequently compromised by progressive cognitive decline affecting verbal and nonverbal interactions. As the global prevalence of dementia continues to increase, there is a growing need to synthesise current evidence on communication barriers, intervention approaches, and contextual factors influencing caregiver–elderly communication across diverse care settings. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2022 and 2025 were identified through comprehensive searches of the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Studies focusing on communication between caregivers and elderly individuals with dementia were included. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and analysed using a thematic narrative synthesis to identify key patterns, interventions, and research gaps. Results The findings were synthesised into three overarching themes. The first theme addressed communication challenges and caregiver strategies in dementia care, highlighting the effects of cognitive impairment on interaction and adaptive communication practices. The second theme examined communication tools, technologies, and intervention-based approaches, including structured communication programmes and assistive technologies. The third theme explored ethical, cultural, and system-level influences on communication, emphasising the roles of sociocultural norms, policy frameworks, and organisational support. Across the reviewed studies, tailored communication strategies were associated with improved interaction quality, while systemic and cultural constraints remained persistent barriers. Conclusions This review highlights the complexity of communication in dementia care and underscores the importance of integrated approaches that combine caregiver training, technological support, and culturally sensitive practices. The findings provide a consolidated evidence base to inform future research, policy development, and practice aimed at strengthening communication strategies and improving the quality of life of both caregivers and elderly individuals with dementia.

                Background Multiplayer Virtual Reality-Based Simulations (MPVR-based simulations) with immersive 3D environments have become an important tool in interprofessional education (IPE). However, instruments to measure interprofessional socialization in MPVR-based education are limited. The Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS) is a useful tool for evaluating interprofessional socialization. This pilot study aimed to adapt and validate the ISVS-24 for use in interprofessional MPVR-based simulations settings. Methods Seventy-two participants, including anesthesiology residents (at novice, junior, and senior levels), general physicians, and professional nurses, were recruited voluntarily. The ISVS-24 was cross-culturally adapted and reviewed by experts for content validity in the MPVR simulation context. Participants completed the adapted ISVS after undergoing an interprofessional MPVR-based simulation. Structural validity was assessed using factorial analysis through principal component analysis. Content validity was measured using the mean content validity index (CVI). Consistency validity was evaluated with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC), and reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Results The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test indicated sampling adequacy (0.885), and Bartlett’s sphericity test was significant (χ2(42) = 472.725, p < 0.05). A three-section structure was confirmed. The mean CVI was 0.815, with 21 valid items (Aiken’s V ≥ 0.5). Among the 72 respondents, 40 were female (55.6%) and 32 were male (44.4%); 26 were anesthesiology residents (36.1%), 23 were general physicians (31.9%), and 23 were professional nurses (31.9%). The overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0.959. PCC for all items exceeded the r table value (> 0.232) with p < 0.05, showing significant item relationships. Conclusions The adapted version of ISVS for MPVR simulation-based education has good validity and reliability to assess interprofessional socialization in an MPVR-based simulation setting.

                Background This study aimed to evaluate the protective role of piperine and piperine-loaded titanium dioxide nanoparticles on oxidative and biochemical parameters, antioxidant levels, and cytogenetic parameters in the brain. Methods forty rats were randomly divided into four equal groups for 35 days as follow: the control group was administered DW/IP; the G1 group received 40 mg/kg B.W. of piperine orally; The G2 group was given TiO2NPs (50 mg/kg B.W.)/i.p. received; and the G3 group received 75 mg/kg B.W. /I. P. of PIP-TiO2NPs. Results A significant increase in serum TAO-C and a significant decrease in ROS were observed in G1 and G3 compared to G2 and the control groups. A significant reduction in serum neurotransmitter concentration was found in the G2 group compared to the G1, control, and G3 groups, while a significant increase was observed in the G1 group. Gene expression data for cyclooxygenase showed upregulation in the G2 group and was significantly higher than in the G3, G1, and control groups. Histopathological examination showed normal brain layers, hippocampus, and thalamus appearance in G1, G2, G3, and the control groups. The G2 group showed mild vascular congestion, hyperplasia, and mild disruption in the molecular cell layer of the cerebral cortex. The hippocampus of the G3 group showed moderate vacuolation with glial reduction. Conclusions These findings indicate that piperine, combined with TiO2NPs (PIP-TiO2NPs), provides neuroprotection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by TiO2NPs in the rat brain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-98/v1?src=rss">Why Static Biomarkers Often Fall Short: Circadian Immune Coherence as a Missing Dimension in Immunotherapy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite major advances in cancer immunotherapy, clinical decision-making still relies heavily on static biomarkers derived from single time-point measurements, such as PD-L1 expression or baseline inflammatory indices. While these markers provide partial prognostic and predictive information, they often fail to capture the dynamic and time-dependent nature of host–tumor immune interactions. Growing evidence from circadian biology demonstrates that immune cell trafficking, cytokine release, antigen presentation, and checkpoint pathway activity are subject to robust endogenous rhythmic regulation. Ignoring this temporal dimension may therefore lead to biological misclassification, inconsistent trial results, and suboptimal therapeutic scheduling. In this perspective, we argue that the limitations of static biomarkers arise not merely from technical insufficiency, but from a deeper conceptual gap: the absence of a system-level, time-aware framework capable of integrating longitudinal immune dynamics. We introduce Circadian Immune Coherence (CIC) as a systems-based property describing the alignment, stability, and rhythmic consistency of immune trajectories over time, rather than isolated absolute values. Drawing on circadian immunology, emerging data on immunotherapy timing, and advances in longitudinal analytical methods, we propose that CIC represents a missing conceptual dimension in immunotherapy research. Preliminary applications of this framework to longitudinal real-world clinical data (manuscript under review) support its operational feasibility and suggest the presence of distinct immune coherence phenotypes associated with immunotherapy outcomes. We discuss how time-series and spectral analytical approaches can operationalize CIC by uncovering latent rhythmic patterns in immune data that remain invisible to conventional static methods. Finally, we outline implications for biomarker development and clinical trial design, suggesting that time-aware stratification and adaptive scheduling may help reconcile conflicting results and improve therapeutic precision. We conclude that formally recognizing time as an intrinsic biological variable—and developing frameworks to measure its organization—is essential for moving beyond the limitations of static biomarkers.

                How do state actors act in regional organizations? For decades, international relations scholars assessing Southeast Asia have examined the agency of middle powers in the region, exerting influence and shaping the introduction of regional norms. However, less has been assessed in the context of smaller states such as Laos, which has displayed some unique traits in its foreign policy. Among the empirical anomalies is Laos’ display of neutrality, despite growing closer to China’s lucrative economic opportunities in the past decades. As a means to understand why Laos’s chairmanship roles have displayed neutrality, this study bridges the relevance of neoclassical realism’s theoretical framework to make sense of foreign policies that are out of the ordinary. Drawing on primary and secondary data on Laos’ ASEAN chairmanships in 2016 and 2024, this study argues that domestic considerations (the growing negative sentiment towards economic ties with China) and external determinants (power relations with China and ASEAN regionalism) affect Laos’ external outlook.

                Background This study analyzes Saudi Arabia’s 2022–2023 reforms to the Commercial Agency Law through legal, economic, and comparative lenses. The pre-reform regime—marked by rigid nationality limits, procedural burdens, and litigation-prone termination rules—constrained market entry and investor confidence. Methods Using a doctrinal approach to statutes and implementing regulations, triangulated with Saudi judicial practice and policy instruments, we benchmark Saudi reforms against the UAE and UK. A Shariah lens clarifies how gharar (uncertainty), fasakh (rescission), and unjust enrichment (akl al-māl bil-bāṭil) shape agency disputes. Results Key changes include more flexible nationality rules, end-to-end digital registration and renewal, clearer termination/compensation standards, and formal recognition of arbitration (including SCCA). Together these measures enhance contractual predictability and lower compliance frictions, with early indications of improved market transparency and investor sentiment. Conclusions The reforms signal a hybrid model—liberalization aligned with global practice while preserving a Shariah-grounded identity. Remaining priorities include consistent judicial application, practitioner training, clearer guidance, and GCC coordination. We propose thematically grouped policy steps to consolidate gains and support Vision 2030’s diversification agenda.

                Abstract* Background Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a prevalent and underdiagnosed disease affecting over 25 million adults worldwide. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) remains the gold standard for great saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency. However, conventional EVLA performed 1–2 cm distal to the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) often leaves residual tributaries, increasing the risk of recurrence. Zone-zero laser crossectomy, defined as laser crossectomy performed exactly at the 0 cm zone of the SFJ (zone-zero ablation), had been proposed as a minimally invasive alternative technique to eliminate residual stumps and reduce varicose vein recurrence. This case series of zone-zero laser crossectomy aims to share our experiences and outcomes amongst 57 patients in our center. Methods A total of 57 consecutive patients with symptomatic GSV insufficiency (CEAP C2–C6) underwent EVLA using a 1470 nm radial double-ring swift laser with zone-zero ablation at the SFJ. Procedural parameters, complications, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. Patients were followed at 7 days, 4, 8, and 12 weeks with physical and duplex ultrasound examinations. Results The mean age was 61.6 years. No recanalization was observed during the 3-month follow-up, with duplex ultrasound confirming complete obliteration of treated GSVs. Postoperative complications included leg pain in 3 cases (5.26%), EHIT grade I–II in 1 case (1.75%), hyperpigmentation in 1 case (1.75%), and paresthesia in 1 case (1.75%). All complications were mild and managed conservatively. Conclusions Zone-zero laser crossectomy is a safe and effective modification of EVLA for GSV insufficiency, demonstrating high obliteration rates and low complication rates. Larger cohorts with longer follow-up are needed to confirm durability.

<p>Ischemic stroke remains a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Non-mammalian models, with unique features absent in mammalian systems, provide complementary insights into stroke pathogenesis and therapy, enhancing multi-model research frameworks.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke remains a major global health burden, consistently ranking among the leading causes of mortality and long-term disability. Although rodent models are widely utilized for ischemic stroke research, their limited translational success has driven the pursuit of alternative experimental systems. This review underscores the growing significance of non-mammalian models, particularly <i>zebrafish</i> and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, in advancing ischemic stroke research. Zebrafish offer notable advantages, including high genetic homology with humans, optical transparency, a pronounced capacity for neural regeneration, in vivo live real-time imaging, and behavioral analyses. Photothrombotic and systemic hypoxia paradigms in zebrafish enable detailed investigation of neurovascular injury and recovery processes. <i>Drosophila</i>, characterized by a rapid life cycle and sophisticated genetic toolkit, serves as a valuable model for elucidating hypoxia-induced neuronal damage and stroke-related comorbidities such as sleep disturbances. These models are cost-efficient, ethically advantageous, and well-suited for high-throughput applications. Despite inherent anatomical and physiological disparities, non-mammalian systems provide critical complementary insights into stroke pathogenesis and therapeutic innovation, reinforcing their integration into multi-model research frameworks.</p>

                In this study, Bejarano et al. show that the multifunctional enzyme CD13 is upregulated during brain metastasis and promotes cancer cell seeding across the blood-brain barrier. Loss of CD13 impairs brain colonization and prolongs survival in mice, highlighting CD13 as a potential therapeutic target in brain metastasis.

                Hu et al. analyzed non-synonymous SNPs across diverse human populations and revealed divergent evolutionary pressures on immune- and cancer-related genes. By integrating population diversity with functional evaluation, they identified STING1 variants as modulators of interferon signaling. Their findings suggest that germline variations shaped by genetic ancestry may influence cancer immunity.

                In lower vertebrates, retinal Müller glia (MG) exhibit a life-long capacity of cell-cycle re-entry to regenerate neurons following the retinal injury. However, the mechanism driving such injury-induced MG cell-cycle re-entry remains incompletely understood. Combining single-cell transcriptomic analysis and in vivo clonal analysis, we identified previously undescribed <i>cxcl18b</i>-defined MG transitional states as essential routes toward MG proliferation following green/red cone (G/R cone) ablation. Inflammation blockage abolished the triggering of these transitional states, which expressed the gene modules shared by cells of the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ), where life-long adult neurogenesis takes place. Functional studies of the redox properties of these transitional states further demonstrated the regulatory role of nitric oxide (NO) produced by <i>Nos2b</i> in injury-induced MG proliferation. Finally, we developed a viral-based strategy to specifically disrupt <i>nos2b</i> in <i>cxcl18b</i>-defined MG transitional states and revealed the effect of transitional state-specific NO signaling. Our findings elucidate the precision redox mechanism underlying injury-induced MG cell-cycle re-entry, providing insights into species-specific mechanisms for vertebrate retina regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105835">Western lifestyle linked to maladaptive trained immunity</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity (TI) refers to a state of innate immune cells that, after encountering an initial stimulus and undergoing epigenetic reprogramming and metabolic changes, allows them to respond more effectively to a subsequent challenge. TI yields a survival advantage, particularly in a pathogen-rich context. However, maladaptive TI may damage the host by exacerbating inflammatory diseases. Here we review which aspects of Western lifestyle may contribute to maladaptive TI, including a Western diet, periodontitis, chronic psychological stress, and environmental triggers such as air pollution and microplastics. Finally, we consider lifestyle intervention as a way to prevent or reduce the impact of maladaptive TI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107688">Ω-Loop mutations control dynamics of the active site by modulating the hydrogen-bonding network in PDC-3 β-lactamase</a></h4>

              
                The expression of antibiotic-inactivating enzymes, such as <i>Pseudomonas</i>-derived cephalosporinase-3 (PDC-3), is a major mechanism of intrinsic resistance in bacteria. Using reinforcement learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations and constant pH MD, we investigate how clinically observed mutations in the Ω-loop (at residues V211, G214, E219, and Y221) alter the structure and function of PDC-3. Our findings reveal that these substitutions modulate the dynamic flexibility of the Ω-loop and the R2-loop, reshaping the cavity of the active site. In particular, E219K and Y221A disrupt the tridentate hydrogen bond network around K67, thus lowering its <i>pKa</i> and promoting proton transfer to the catalytic residue S64. Markov state models reveal that E219K achieves enhanced catalysis by adopting stable, long-lived ‘active’ conformations, whereas Y221A facilitates activity by rapidly toggling between bond-formed and bond-broken states. In addition, substitutions influence key hydrogen bonds that control the opening and closure of the active-site pocket, consequently influencing the overall size. The pocket expands in all nine clinically identified variants, creating additional space to accommodate bulkier R1 and R2 cephalosporin side chains. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic basis for how single residue substitutions in the Ω-loop affect catalytic activity. Insights into the structural dynamics of the catalytic site advance our understanding of emerging <i>β</i>-lactamase variants and can inform the rational design of novel inhibitors to combat drug-resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107794">Anti-resonance in developmental signaling regulates cell fate decisions</a></h4>

              
                Cells process dynamic signaling inputs to regulate fate decisions during development. While oscillations or waves in key developmental pathways, such as Wnt, have been widely observed, the principles governing how cells decode these signals remain unclear. By leveraging optogenetic control of the Wnt signaling pathway in both HEK293T cells and H9 human embryonic stem cells, we systematically map the relationship between signal frequency and downstream pathway activation. We find that cells exhibit a minimal response to Wnt at certain frequencies, a behavior we term anti-resonance. We developed both detailed biochemical and simplified hidden variable models that explain how anti-resonance emerges from the interplay between fast and slow pathway dynamics. Remarkably, we find that frequency directly influences cell fate decisions involved in human gastrulation; signals delivered at anti-resonant frequencies result in dramatically reduced mesoderm differentiation. Our work reveals a previously unknown mechanism of how cells decode dynamic signals and how anti-resonance may filter against spurious activation. These findings establish new insights into how cells decode dynamic signals with implications for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and cancer biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106697">Shifting the PPARγ conformational ensemble toward a transcriptionally repressive state improves covalent inhibitor efficacy</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) regulates transcription in response to ligand binding at an orthosteric pocket within the ligand-binding domain (LBD). We previously showed that two covalent ligands, T0070907 and GW9662—extensively used as PPARγ inhibitors to assess off-target activity—weaken but do not completely block ligand binding via an allosteric mechanism associated with pharmacological inverse agonism (Shang and Kojetin, 2024). These covalent inhibitors shift the LBD toward a repressive conformation, where the activation function-2 (AF-2) helix 12 occupies the orthosteric pocket, competing with orthosteric ligand binding. Here, we provide additional support for this allosteric mechanism using two covalent inverse agonists, SR33065 and SR36708, which better stabilize the repressive LBD conformation and are more effective inhibitors of—but also do not completely inhibit—ligand cobinding. Furthermore, we show that ligand cobinding can occur with a previously reported PPARγ dual-site covalent inhibitor, SR16832, which appears to weaken ligand binding through a direct mechanism independent of the allosteric mechanism. These findings underscore the complex nature of the PPARγ LBD conformational ensemble and highlight the need to develop alternative methods for designing more effective covalent inhibitors.

">Coordinated pre- and postsynaptic protein dynamics underlie rapid Sema4D-mediated inhibitory synapse assembly</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian hippocampus, synapses are either excitatory or inhibitory as defined by the presynaptic neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA, respectively) and the specific ligand-gated ion channel receptors localized to the postsynaptic specialization. While numerous studies explore the formation of excitatory synapses, the process of inhibitory synapse formation is less understood. Using both loss- and gain-of-function approaches, our lab previously identified the class 4 Semaphorin Sema4D as a key regulator of inhibitory synaptogenesis. Here, using recombinant Sema4D protein as a tool to rapidly induce GABAergic synapse formation in cultured hippocampal neurons, we employ two-channel live imaging to identify changes to pre- and postsynaptic protein dynamics during inhibitory synapse formation. We find that Sema4D treatment promotes the mobility of presynaptic GAD65 protein assemblies while having a negligible effect on the behavior of the postsynaptic gephyrin scaffold, leading to increased colocalization of these proteins. In addition, Sema4D treatment promotes the recruitment of GABAAR{gamma}2 subunits to immature gephyrin scaffolds, suggesting that Sema4D primes these scaffolds for receptor recruitment. Surprisingly, we observe new colocalization events between existing gephyrin and GABAAR puncta, suggesting that clustering of either the gephyrin scaffold or the GABAAR is sufficient to nucleate assembly of the postsynaptic specialization. Overall our results support a model in which Sema4D signaling coordinates dynamic changes in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments to assemble inhibitory synapses on rapid timescales.

                Local field potentials (LFPs) measured in the extracellular matrix of the brain are postulated to arise from the integration of synaptic ionic currents and spread by volume conduction. However, there is a lack of consensus on whether these spatiotemporal voltage gradients are just an epiphenomenon of spiking or if the LFPs play a functional role in information processing. To examine a potential functional role of LFPs in information processing, we developed a microfluidic device that allows neurons from the hippocampal formation to self-wire through microfluidic channels, effectively isolating the activity of single axons between subregions of the network. We recorded spontaneous theta-band activity (4-10 Hz) in these axons whose power spectra were independent of simultaneous spiking activity. A sparse set of axons from the CA3 into the CA1 had the highest theta amplitudes. Source neurons for the axonal theta were identified through cross correlation. Functionally, sparse axonal theta phase and amplitude correlated with target subregional spiking and more strongly with burst length. These results suggest that theta voltage oscillations in axons may contribute to activation of slow voltage-gated calcium channels to drive stronger synaptic release of transmitter to coordinate hippocampal activity between subregions. We propose that theta oscillations are controlled by specific ion channels distinct from those that generate spikes, a multiplex coding mechanism for inter-regional communication with implications for routing, executive control, disease states and artificial neural networks.

">Preferential vulnerability of cortical GABAergic interneurons to Nalcn deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal resting membrane potential (RMP) reflects the balance of leak conductances and varies systematically across cortical cell types. Many GABAergic interneurons exhibit more depolarized RMPs than neighbouring excitatory neurons, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these systematic differences in intrinsic excitability remain incompletely defined. The sodium leak channel non-selective (NALCN) mediates a major fraction of basal sodium conductance and cause neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by developmental delay and cognitive impairment. Here we define NALCN contribution to cortical circuit development and function with cell-type precision. Using Nalcn-GFP reporter line, we map Nalcn expression across cortical types revealing enrichment in GABAergic hippocampal interneurons relative to hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Using conditional mouse models, we selectively deleted Nalcn in cortical glutamatergic lineages or forebrain GABAergic cells from early embryogenesis. Electrophysiological analysis show that developmental loss of Nalcn preferentially reduces intrinsic excitability across GABAergic interneuron subtypes while sparing pyramidal neurons. To understand the impact of a depolarized GABAergic RMP on brain function, we assessed the behavioral performance of Nalcn-deficient mice that revealed persistent deficits in contextual adaptation and spatial short-term memory. These findings reveal a neuron type-specific function of NALCN in the cerebral cortex and position NALCN as a crucial ion channel regulating basal excitability of GABAergic inhibitory circuits and cortical circuit function.

">Phosphatidylserine exposure by developing astrocytes initiates microglia-mediated developmental cell death</a></h4>

              
                Developmental cell death is classically attributed to apoptosis, yet in mammalian retina, large numbers of developing astrocytes die non-apoptotically during a defined developmental window. Astrocyte death is important for patterning a cellular template that guides angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that healthy developing astrocytes initiate their own elimination by recruiting microglia via regulated exposure of the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine. Experimentally increasing phosphatidylserine exposure in astrocytes, but not neurons, accelerates their removal by microglia without changing how many astrocytes ultimately survive. This acceleration causes profound vascular defects resembling pathological features of retinopathy of prematurity. Genetic disruption of MFGE8, a phosphatidylserine-binding protein, suppresses microglia-mediated astrocyte killing and prevents vascular pathology despite continued phosphatidylserine exposure. This mechanism extends beyond the retina, because phosphatidylserine also initiates astrocyte death in developing cerebral cortex. Together, these findings identify phosphatidylserine exposure as a developmental signal that times microglia-mediated astrocyte elimination, with essential consequences for neurovascular development.

                The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas provides gene expression data for over 20,000 genes and has been extensively used in neuroscience. However, it is constrained by a resolution of 200 {micro}m3. We improved this to 25 {micro}m3 for 4,083 genes by re-registering 401,660 sections to atlas space. From this, we produced an atlas with regions defined by shared molecular signatures and built an interactive online platform allowing exploration of gene expression patterns.

">Chemogenetic activation induces persistent transcriptomic remodeling and functional plasticity in cultured astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are essential regulators of neuronal function and brain homeostasis. Recent methodological advances have increasingly revealed their active roles through precise manipulation of astrocyte function in the brain. While chemogenetic strategies, such as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), have been widely used to recapitulate endogenous G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling and selectively modulate astrocyte activity, the molecular mechanisms accompanying DREADD activation remain incompletely understood. Here, we characterized the transcriptional responses of cultured cortical astrocytes and found that DREADD activation induces profound changes in astrocytic gene expression profiles. Activation of Gi-, Gq-, and Gs-coupled DREADDs elicited distinct transcriptomic responses. Transcription factor activity profiling further revealed that each DREADD subtype selectively modulates a distinct set of transcription factors that collectively shape astrocytic transcriptomic responses, thereby indicating subtype-specific transcriptional mechanisms. Importantly, DREADD activation induced persistent changes in the astrocytic transcriptome that remained detectable even three days after stimulation. These transcriptomic alterations were associated with sustained changes in astrocytic calcium responses to extracellular ATP, indicating plastic changes in astrocytic physiological function. Together, these findings provide a molecular framework for interpreting astrocytic DREADD manipulations and reveal a mechanistic basis for functional plasticity and heterogeneity of astrocytes.

">Organization, Neuronal Composition, and Dynamics of Neuronal Ensembles in the Songbird Auditory Forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Auditory learning is a key component of vocal learning and communication. Neurons involved in auditory learning are typically examined as single encoders, but there is increasing evidence that the coincident activity of groups of neurons, or ensembles, is important for the processing and transmission of sensory information. In songbirds, a forebrain region analogous to mammalian secondary auditory cortex, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), is crucial for representing and learning auditory signals. In the awake state, NCM neurons exhibit stimulus-specific adaptation in response to repeated presentation of song stimuli, considered a form of auditory working memory. Yet, how complex stimuli like song are encoded by networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is essentially unknown. Using in-vivo single-unit electrophysiology, we systematically unveiled neuronal ensembles that operate at high temporal precision (< 10 ms) across the NCM of awake zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Our data show that multiple ensembles are concurrently activated by song with high temporal precision, and that their neuronal composition is heterogeneous, topographically proximate, and biased towards excitatory members. NCM ensembles adapt to song playback and, notably, become more stimulus selective over tens of minutes, accompanied by fast remodeling (membership gain and/or loss) during adaptation. Altogether, our results suggest that song representations in the forebrain can be conveyed by multiple, dynamic network ensembles in parallel. These findings advance our knowledge of the composition, dynamics, and neuronal network reorganization of ensembles as complex sensory stimuli become increasingly familiar.

">Brain Age in Conduct Disorder: A Mega-Analysis of the ENIGMA Antisocial Behavior Working Group</a></h4>

              
                Conduct disorder (CD) is the leading global cause of mental health burden in children and adolescents and has recently been hypothesized to be a neurodevelopmental disorder. Although prior research has identified neuroanatomical differences associated with CD, it remains unclear whether these differences reflect atypical brain development. Here, we investigated the difference between an individual's brain age and chronological age as a proxy for variations in brain maturation. Using a pretrained model, we estimated brain age from structural neuroimaging data obtained from 1,119 youth with CD and 1,183 typically developing controls across 14 international cohorts participating in the ENIGMA-Antisocial Behavior Working Group. Youth with CD exhibited a statistically robust but small acceleration in brain age compared to typically developing youth (around 0.50 years), which was restricted to the adolescence-onset subtype of the disorder. Our large-scale, coordinated analysis provides the first evidence of accelerated neurodevelopment as a potential mechanism underlying CD.

">Modelling ferroptosis in a human microglial line by sequential exposure to iron and GPX4 inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Excessive iron accumulation is a pathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and a growing body of evidence suggests that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death (RCD) driven by lipid peroxidation, is implicated in their pathogenesis. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, buffer iron overload but become susceptible to ferroptotic death, exacerbating neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. To uncover the molecular events leading to microglial ferroptosis, we established a human microglial ferroptosis model using the HMC3 cell line. This model recapitulates core features of ferroptosis, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxidation of lipids at the membrane, both rescued by Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). We used this model to perform integrated multi-omics profiling and identified significant dysregulation in lipid species, notably an accumulation of sterols, including oxysterols such as the 7-oxo-cholesterol, alongside the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) characteristic of ferroptosis. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses corroborated these findings, revealing the upregulation of genes and proteins involved in the mevalonate pathway and cholesterol metabolism. Importantly, the increased expression of some of these key metabolic genes was also reversed by Fer-1 treatment, indicating their role in a pre-ferroptotic signature. Our model provides a novel platform for investigating early molecular events in microglia ferroptosis. Integrating these findings into future investigations could uncover new protective mechanisms against microglia ferroptosis at the crossroad between ROS level mitigation and sterol metabolism.

">Pupil-DLC: an open-source deep learning pipeline for scalable, markerless tracking of pupil dynamics across conscious and unconscious states</a></h4>

              
                Pupil diameter provides a powerful, non-invasive biomarker of brain state, correlating with arousal, attention, cognitive processing, and level of consciousness. Despite its widespread use, pupillometry remains limited by software tools that lack scalability, robustness, and flexibility across experimental conditions. Here we introduce Pupil-DLC, an open-source, DeepLabCut-based pipeline for scalable, markerless tracking of pupil dynamics. Pupil-DLC is trained on 19,500 manually annotated frames selected from over 130 pupil videos of head-fixed mice spanning wakefulness to diverse drug-induced states of consciousness, including psychedelics, and anesthesia. The pipeline robustly captures state-dependent pupil dynamics, achieving high agreement with human-annotated ground truth data and outperforming an established automated method in both accuracy and detection reliability, while maintaining computational efficiency. Pupil-DLC incorporates a dual-model framework comprising a General Model (GM) for high-throughput analysis of infra-red recorded mice pupils and an Individual Model (IM) tailored for session-specific optimization, as well as interpretable confidence metrics that enable principled trade-offs between accuracy and data retention. Notably, the model generalizes, without retraining, to human infrared pupil recordings, supporting cross-species pupillometry. Pupil-DLC provides a flexible, reproducible platform for quantifying pupil-linked brain state dynamics across diverse experimental paradigms and species.

                Visual search requires flexible coordination of attention, memory, and category representations across distributed cortical networks. Using large-scale recordings from V4, IT, OFC, and LPFC, we identified distinct neural populations selective for attention and category. Population dynamics robustly represented visual categories during cue presentation, sustained cue information across delays, and differentiated categories and attentional states during search. Cue-related activity predicted subsequent search efficiency, linking pre-search processing to behavioral performance. The orthogonal subspace provided a crucial latent representational structure for encoding and maintaining task-relevant information across search stages. Foveal attention enhanced peripheral representations by both increasing pattern separation and reshaping representational geometry in a non-linear, context-dependent manner. Search dynamics further reflected fixation history and target detection, which modulated both response strength and representational structure. Finally, V4 and IT encoded the spatial geometry of the search array, preserving its layout. Together, these findings highlight population-level dynamics as critical mechanisms supporting goal-directed visual search.

">Visual Context Influences Lateral Balance While Walking on Winding Paths</a></h4>

              
                Effectively navigating daily environments necessitates achieving adaptability while maintaining stability. This requires integrating sensory feedback, primarily from the visual system, to maintain balance and maneuverability as we walk. This study examined the impact of visual information salience on lateral balance and stepping. Twenty-eight healthy adults (16F/12M; 26.16{+/-}4.23 years) participated. Participants walked along each of two virtual paths (Straight vs. Winding), having each of two path color contrasts (High vs. Low), in each of two environments with differing visual richness (Rich vs. Sparse). We quantified stepping errors as the percentage of steps landing outside designated path boundaries. We computed means () and standard deviations ({sigma}) of the minimum mediolateral margins of stability (MoSL), and we computed lateral Probability of Instability (PoIL) to assess participants' risk of taking unstable (MoSL < 0) steps. On Straight paths, participants made more stepping errors on Low (vs. High) contrast paths for both environments, and exhibited decreased{sigma} (MoSL) in Sparse (vs. Rich) environments on paths of both visual contrasts. On Winding paths, participants made the most stepping errors on Low Contrast paths in Sparse environments. They walked with smaller (MoSL) and exhibited higher PoIL on Low Contrast paths in both environments, and they exhibited higher PoIL in Sparse environments on paths of both visual contrasts. The effects of diminished visual information were far more pronounced on Winding paths (vs. Straight), hindering performance and balance maintenance, as these conditions challenged both mechanical and sensory mechanisms underlying balance control.

">Agomelatine drives sex-specific neuroprotection and reduced pathology in rat and human Alzheimer's models</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains without effective disease-modifying therapies, underscoring the need for interventions that target interconnected molecular and cellular processes driving cognitive decline. Leveraging a cross-species translational framework integrating a progressive rat model of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC-derived neurons carrying familial AD mutations, we identify agomelatine (AGO) as a disease-modifying candidate. A clinically used melatonergic agonist and 5-HT2C serotonergic antagonist, we found that AGO acts as a sex-selective modulator of AD-related neuronal and microglial dysfunction with therapeutic relevance across species. TgF344-AD rats and their wildtype littermates received chronic dietary AGO ({approx}10 mg/kg/day) from 5 to 11 months of age and underwent hippocampal-dependent spatial learning assessment, quantitative hippocampal histopathology, and bulk RNA sequencing to evaluate the therapeutic effect on cognition, pathology, and molecular mechanisms. Human isogenic iPSC-derived cortical neurons carrying PSEN2N141I or APPV717I mutations were treated with 20 M AGO followed by bulk RNA sequencing, to define AGO-driven transcriptional pathway modulation in AD neurons. In TgF344-AD rats, AGO produced robust female-specific benefits. AGO selectively restored hippocampal-dependent cognitive performance in female but not male transgenic rats. These improvements were independent of amyloid burden and instead aligned with reductions in microgliosis and pathogenic AT8-positive tau phosphorylation. Additionally, AGO normalized reactive and amoeboid microglial states exclusively in females and enhanced doublecortin-defined neurogenesis without altering mature NeuN neuronal density. This coordinated hippocampal stabilization highlights AGO's capacity to restore plasticity rather than simply suppress pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed sex-divergent mechanisms underlying these effects. In females, AGO activated metabolic, oxygen-handling, lipid-processing, neuroimmune, and CREB/IGF-1 signaling pathways while suppressing ER-stress, epigenetic, and ion-channel transcripts, changes consistent with resilience-promoting cellular reprogramming. In males, AGO preferentially modulated mitochondrial redox biology, transcriptional regulators, and extracellular matrix components. Despite these differences, both sexes showed AGO-induced engagement of conserved AD-relevant pathways, including shared induction of synaptic plasticity and hemoglobin/oxygen-transport related genes, suggesting a convergent neuroprotective molecular signature. To translate these findings to a human system, we examined AGO's effects in PSEN2N141I and APPV717I iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Both mutations produced convergent deficits in synaptic integrity, neuronal maturity, trophic signaling, proteostasis, metabolism, and excitability, alongside dysregulated developmental and ECM-remodeling programs. AGO partially reversed these pathogenic transcriptional changes, up-regulating synaptic, metabolic, vesicle-trafficking, and redox-stress resilience genes while suppressing pathological developmental and inflammatory pathways, demonstrating conserved engagement of neuronal recovery programs. Together, these results identify AGO as a promising non-amyloid therapeutic candidate capable of modulating AD-relevant pathways in rodents and human models. The sex-selective efficacy observed in vivo, combined with conserved transcriptional responses across species, underscores the translational relevance of AGO-driven molecular reprogramming in AD.

">EEG-Based Decoding of Color and Visual Category Representations Is Reliable Within and Across Sessions</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system represents stimuli in a rich and detailed manner. Traditional methods of studying visual representations in humans, such as event-related potentials (ERP), revealed numerous distinctions between the brain activity elicited by different categories of stimuli. However, these methods miss the information embedded in the spatial distributions of brain activity, or patterns, and are not always sensitive to study visual representations of different stimuli at the single participant or single trial level. Time-resolved multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA), or Decoding, efficiently extracts the visual representations of stimuli from the EEG topography without a-priori assumptions about the location of the effect in time and space at the single participant level. The rich information this method provides has increased its popularity dramatically in recent years. Yet, different participants show variable quality of decoding performance, and it is unclear if the accuracy of decoding is maintained within participants across multiple sessions, tasks, attentional conditions and visual features. In the current study, participants performed three visual tasks, over two sessions (1-7 days apart). We examined the correlation of decoding accuracy: within the cross-validation set, between sessions, between features (color and category) and to different measurements of the ERP signal and behavioral performance. We also examined how models generalized to different tasks and different attention conditions. We found that decoding accuracies varied substantially across participants, and that decoding accuracy was reliable within participant, over sessions, attention condition and task. This suggests the decodability behaves like an individual trait. Moreover, the spatial patterns underlying the decoding (classification weights) generalized across different tasks, attentional conditions and sessions. This suggests minimal representational drift at the resolution allowed by the EEG. We conclude that EEG decoding is a reliable method, and that visual representations are stable.

">Minimal Mimics and Maps of Natural Light for Mammals</a></h4>

              
                Light drives processes that include perception and the regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep, metabolism, and development. These processes are initiated by photopigment molecules, each preferentially absorbing particular wavelengths. Light of a given spectrum stimulates an animal's set of photopigments in a specific profile. Natural light and its variations produce stimulation profiles that promote normal physiology. To mimic these profiles using artificial light, we consider the thermally stable, photoconvertible states of relevant photopigments: ground states of rhodopsin and cone photopigments, and three states of melanopsin. This gives a high-dimensional representation of illumination. Nevertheless, we find that two wavelengths suffice to closely mimic the effects of natural light for mammals, including humans and mice. Adjusting the wavelength ratio allows mimicry of natural light's variations, such as those from twilight to noon. Ratio adjustments also compensate for light's filtering by elements like the eye's optics and laboratory cages. Adding a third wavelength makes natural light mimicry nearly perfect. By contrast, common artificial lighting--designed for low-dimensional, human color space--stimulates photopigments in unnatural proportions. We conclude by providing species-specific maps of photopigment stimulation profiles under natural and artificial illumination, which make our observations intuitive while providing insight into the diverse visual ecologies of mammals.

">Memory erasure by dopamine-gated retrospective learning</a></h4>

              
                Erasing outdated memories is crucial for adaptive behavior. Yet once a cue-outcome association is learned, repeated cue exposure without outcome suppresses conditioned behavior without erasing the underlying memory. This allows rapid behavioral recovery when outcomes are reintroduced. Here, we confirm this limitation for standard prospective extinction protocols that present cues without the associated outcome, but show that true memory erasure is achieved by inverting the paradigm: presenting outcomes without associated cues, i.e., retrospective extinction. We demonstrate that orbitofrontal cortex activity at outcome is necessary for the rapid behavioral recovery following prospective extinction, and that mesolimbic dopamine activity at outcome is necessary for retrospective extinction. These findings reconceptualize extinction mechanisms and suggest complementary strategies to mitigate relapse and erase maladaptive memories.

">Divergent excitatory and inhibitory signaling in a head direction circuit</a></h4>

              
                Neural cell types are often clustered into inhibitory, excitatory, or neuromodulatory populations. However, the signaling mechanism between two neurons ultimately depends on their neurotransmitter-receptor pairings. Here, we demonstrate an example of a glutamatergic population of neurons that appears to either excite or inhibit their downstream partners depending on the type of glutamate receptor expressed in the downstream cell type. The upstream population encodes a sinusoidal head direction signal. The downstream partners that are excited by glutamate encode the same signal while the downstream partners that are inhibited by glutamate encode a 180$^degree$ phase-shifted copy. The upstream population therefore appears to pass on two different phases of the same signal by making either excitatory or inhibitory connections to different downstream partners.

">From cognitive abstraction to adaptive behavior: neural bases of concept learning in autistic adolescents</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Learned knowledge does not consistently generalize to new contexts in autistic individuals, limiting potential for adapting to real-world demands. This challenge is hypothesized to stem from difficulties with forming abstract representations, potentially arising from perceptual processing that favors local details over the gestalt. We tested the prediction that generalization would be primarily based on exemplar-specific representations in autistic youth using computational modelling coupled with neuroimaging. METHODS: Sixty-four autistic adolescents without intellectual disability (69% males; ages 14-18 years) completed a category generalization task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at two time points. Computational models estimated abstract (prototype-based) and specific (exemplar-based) representations and underlying neural correlates. We further examined associations with adaptive functioning and moderation by autistic traits. RESULTS: Contrary to predictions, we observed a consistent prototype-dominant majority, a subgroup who generalized without consistent representational reliance, and a small minority who failed to acquire category structure. Prototypes were represented in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right frontal pole, and right lateral occipital cortex, while exemplars were represented in bilateral cuneus. Better generalization predicted better real-world adaptive functioning. Moreover, greater prototype-related activation in left IPL predicted better adaptive functioning in participants with higher autistic traits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the prevailing view that concept learning in autism relies primarily on hyper-specific perceptual processing, identify meaningful variability in representational strategies, and reveal neural pathways through which abstract representation may support real-world adaptive behavior.

">The amplitude and latency of the earliest signal in V1 encode bottom-up saliency by feature conjunction</a></h4>

              
                The neural origin of bottom-up saliency for exogenous attention remains highly controversial. In this study, we investigated whether the earliest activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) encodes saliency signals defined by the eye-of-origin and feature-conjunction information. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the human occipital cortex revealed early responses to eye-of-origin (E) and/or orientation (O) singletons, with larger response amplitudes to the double-feature (EO) singletons. The short onset latency (58-70 ms) and polarity reversal of the responses indicate a V1 origin. Importantly, the latency and amplitude of these responses predicted behavioral detection performance. Together, these findings suggest that the timing and amplitude of the earliest signals in V1 represent the saliency of combined feature contrasts for bottom-up attention. These signals unlikely originate from projections of other proposed source areas of saliency, due to the scarcity of necessary monocular neurons to process eye-of-origin information.

">How Visual Context Influences Lateral Stepping Regulation While Walking on Winding Paths</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed walking involves regulating foot placements to achieve specific tasks. This requires visuomotor integration. Perceptual, cognitive, and contextual salience guide attention and motor planning for navigation. Here, we quantified how perceptual salience informs lateral foot placement while walking. Participants walked along prescribed virtual paths (straight or winding), thus keeping contextual salience (the task itself) constant. We manipulated perceptual salience by systematically altering environment richness (rich vs. sparse) and path color contrast (high vs. low). We thus tested the extent to which stepping control is determined only by the walking path (i.e. its shape), or is also influenced by task-relevant salience of the paths (only), and/or the salience of the surrounding environment. We quantified head pitch angle to approximate gaze direction. We quantified lateral stepping regulation from a Goal Equivalent Manifold framework. On winding (vs. straight) paths, participants looked down more (lower mean head pitch) and more consistently (less variable head pitch). They took narrower, more variable steps and corrected stepping errors more strongly. This confirmed the predominant influence of task (contextual salience) on stepping control. On low (vs. high) contrast paths, participants looked down more and exhibited greater variability in lateral position on their path with weaker error correction. Higher contrast paths elicited stronger and more consistent stepping control. Walking in sparse (vs. rich) environments yielded somewhat less consistent, but still significant changes in head pitch and stepping regulation. Salience manipulations affected stepping differently on straight versus winding paths. Therefore, perceptual salience influences step-to-step control during naturalistic walking.

">Perceptual reaction times are coupled to the gastric electrical rhythm</a></h4>

              
                The gastric rhythm, a slow (0.05 Hz) electrical oscillation continuously generated by the stomach, phase-synchronises neural activity across all sensory and motor cortices. Yet the functional relevance of this coupling remains unknown. We measured in humans the gastric rhythm with electrogastrography in three independent, distinct experiments (total N = 90): a speeded supra-threshold tactile detection task, a self-paced visual exploration task, and an unspeeded near-threshold visual detection task. Leveraging Spline Generalized Linear Modelling to flexibly uncover higher-order phase-amplitude coupling modes, we found perceptual reaction times (RTs) to be coupled to gastric phase across all experiments. Coupling to gastric phase was independent from effects of cardiac and respiratory rhythms' rates and phases. By showing that the gastric rhythm contributes to the internal state shaping perceptual variability on a scale comparable to cardiac and respiratory rhythms, this work opens a new avenue for the understanding of the function of gastric-brain coupling.

">Impact of impaired endogenous neurosteroidogenesis on outcomes following chronic alcohol exposure.</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder is a major public health concern worldwide and there is a high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been implicated in both mood and alcohol use disorders; however, the mechanisms contributing to the shared pathophysiology remain unknown. Extensive evidence indicates that ethanol modulates GABAergic signaling in the BLA, including actions on neurosteroid-sensitive, extrasynaptic {delta} subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs), which has been suggested to mediate many of the behavioral effects. In fact, several studies have suggested that 5-reduced neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, may mediate some of the behavioral effects of alcohol. Here we demonstrate that chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure impairs endogenous neurosteroidogenesis via downregulation of key neurosteroidogenic enzymes, 5-reductase type 1 and type 2. To examine the impact of impaired endogenous neurosteroidogenesis of the behavioral consequences of chronic alcohol exposure, including withdrawal-induced anxiety and increased alcohol consumption, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockdown of 5-reductase in the BLA. Reduced expression of 5-reductase in the BLA did not impact post-CIE alcohol intake or anxiety-like behaviors during withdrawal, perhaps because endogenous neurosteroidogenesis is already impaired following CIE. Therefore, we examined the impact of enhancing neurosteroid levels, treating mice post-CIE with SGE-516, a synthetic GABAAR positive allosteric modulator, which increased voluntary alcohol intake. These findings implicate endogenous neurosteroidogenesis in behavioral outcomes associated with withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. Further, this study suggests that targeting endogenous neurosteroidogenesis may be a novel and useful therapeutic target.

">Afterimages drive a shared visual motion reversal illusion in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Illusions expose core computations in perception. In one visual apparent-motion illusion, perceptual direction is reversed when phase shifted gratings are interleaved with uniform frames. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila exhibits the same direction reversal reported in mammals. Combining behavior, targeted silencing, two photon imaging, and modeling, we localize the origin of this illusion to elementary motion pathways. Silencing direction selective T4/T5 neurons abolishes the reversal, and recordings reveal that downstream wide field neurons invert their directional preference as interleave duration increases. Replacing periodic gratings with random binary patterns preserves the reversal, implicating afterimages rather than spatial periodicity. Imaging neurons upstream of T4/T5 shows signatures of an afterimage, whose emergence depends on interleave luminance. Critically, dark interleaves suppress afterimages and eliminate both the neural and behavioral reversal, whereas light interleaves preserve or enhance it. Thus, afterimages are central to this shared illusion and explain a deficiency of canonical motion energy accounts. These results link a classic apparent motion phenomenon to identified circuit elements and reveal a simple stimulus manipulation that switches an illusion on and off.

">The core herpes simplex-1 fusion complex drives cell-to-cell spreading of pathological Tau</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by the pathological aggregation of the host-encoded protein Tau into amyloid fibrils. Pathologic protein aggregates composed of Tau are able to spread from cell-to-cell, thereby contributing to disease progression. The exact mechanisms of intercellular dissemination remain ill-defined. Mounting evidence links the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) to the aetiology of AD. HSV-1 is a prevalent neurotropic virus that replicates in epithelial cells at the site of infection, and subsequently establishes lifelong latency in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In the quiescent latent state, AD brains show elevated expression of structural viral proteins in the absence of virus production. We hypothesized that HSV-1 glycoproteins involved in viral attachment and fusion facilitate the intercellular spreading of proteopathic seeds. Using cellular models, we demonstrate that expression of the HSV-1 core fusion complex, essential for viral entry and direct cell-to-cell transmission, is sufficient to promote aggregate dissemination between cells. Moreover, anti-HSV-1 antibodies present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HSV-1 encephalitis efficiently neutralize viral infection, block viral cell-to-cell transmission, and inhibit propagation of pathological Tau. Thus, latent HSV-1 infection of the brain could contribute to neurodegenerative disease progression, and antiviral antibodies may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.

">Measurement of tau protein and Aβ amyloid plaques in postmortem human brains of Down syndrome and Alzheimers disease by using IBETA autoradiography</a></h4>

              
                The accumulation of tau tangles and A{beta} plaques are prominent neuropathologies that characterize Alzheimers disease (AD) and Down Syndrome (DS). Continuous developments of PET tracers as biomarkers can be supported by autoradiography to validate effectiveness and accuracy of binding properties that elucidate the pathophysiology of DSAD and AD. This in vitro comparative study evaluates [125I]IPPI binding to tau and [125I]IBETA binding to A{beta} plaques in the frontal cortex (FCX) and temporal cortex (TCX) of postmortem human brain slices of AD (n=5), DSAD (n=5), and cognitively normal (CN) (n=5) cases. With anti-tau and anti-A{beta} immunostains confirming the presence of tau and A{beta} plaques, [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA binding in autoradiographic images were significantly higher in DSAD and AD gray matter (GM) compared to CN. When comparing DSAD with AD, FCX and TCX GM binding was similar throughout DSAD and AD except in FCX GM where there was 48% more [125I]IPPI binding in DSAD than AD. In vitro drug inhibition studies revealed that [125I]IPPI binding was significantly inhibited with increasing harmine concentrations (IC50=115{+/-}40 nM) in DSAD FCX and TCX but KuFal194 minimally inhibited [125I]IPPI binding in the same cases. The GM/white matter ratios for DSAD ([125I]IPPI=4.1, [125I]IBETA=2.9) and AD ([125I]IPPI=4.2, [125I]IBETA=2.6) were significantly greater than CN ([125I]IPPI=1.3, [125I]IBETA=1.2). A positive correlation between [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA binding suggests a synergistic relationship between tau and A{beta} plaque in DSAD and AD pathology. This study demonstrates that [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA may serve as novel radiotracers in both DSAD and AD to continue diagnostic investigations in vivo.

">The Vesicular Glutamate Transporter Modulates Sex and Region-Specific Differences in Dopaminergic Neuron α-Synuclein Toxicity by Modifying Cytosolic Dopamine Levels</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease disproportionately affects males; however, the cause of this sex difference is unknown. We found that expressing mutant -synuclein A53T in Drosophila dopamine neurons recapitulates the sex differences observed in human Parkinson's disease patients. Male flies exhibited greater age-related motor impairment and more severe dopamine neuron degeneration than females. Selective masculinization of female dopamine neurons via knockdown of the sex determination gene Transformer eliminated the observed sex differences in locomotor ability and neurodegeneration by increasing the severity of motor defects and degeneration in females. Transformer knockdown in dopamine neurons also reduced total vesicular glutamate transporter staining in the brain. Direct knockdown of the vesicular glutamate transporter in female dopamine neurons expressing -synuclein A53T exacerbated motor dysfunction, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and accelerated dopamine neuron degeneration. Increasing cytosolic dopamine via knockdown of the vesicular monoamine transporter or increasing total dopamine levels via levodopa treatment phenocopied vesicular glutamate transporter knockdown; furthermore, reducing total dopamine via alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine treatment protected against vesicular glutamate transporter knockdown. These results support a model in which lower VGLUT levels in dopamine neurons result in higher levels of cytosolic dopamine, which leads to dopamine mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to -synuclein A53T toxicity.

                Functioning both as the site of cerebrospinal fluid production and as an interface between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system, the choroid plexus (ChP) modulates the gating of immune cells and signals from the periphery as they pass from the blood into cerebrospinal fluid. We generated a single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic atlas of the adult human ChP, in donors with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing transcriptionally and spatially distinct macrophage states. We identified a previously unrecognized population of titin-expressing (TTN+) tissue-resident macrophages characterized by coordinated activation of cytoskeletal remodeling, phagocytosis, autophagy, and inflammatory programs. Isoform-specific qPCR, protein immunofluorescence, and single-molecule FISH validated TTN expression in situ. In AD, TTN+ macrophages expand and undergo broad transcriptional rewiring, including activation of MEF2-linked mechanotransduction pathways, elevated senescence signatures, and a loss of ligand-receptor connectivity with epithelial, endothelial, and stromal partners. Collectively, our findings define a mechanosensitive macrophage program at the blood-CSF interface and uncover a TTN-associated shift in macrophage function and microenvironment integration in AD.

">Tonically active interneurons gate motor output in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Tonic inhibition and its transient removal are fundamental neural mechanisms for gating activity, suppressing out-of-phase excitation, and enhancing the temporal precision of behavior. However, their roles within locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs) remain poorly understood. Here, we identify A02l neurons - segmentally repeated excitatory interneurons in the Drosophila larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) - that regulate crawling behavior through tonic inhibition. A02l neurons exhibit high baseline activity and are transiently suppressed during motor output. They provide excitatory input to inhibitory premotor networks, enabling widespread silencing of motor neurons to maintain muscle relaxation. Optogenetic activation of A02l neurons reduced crawling frequency, whereas their inhibition induced transient whole-body contractions. Together, these findings reveal a cellular-resolution mechanism for tonic inhibition within the nerve cord and highlight its importance in gating motor output and maintaining motor quiescence.

">Enhancer-based AAV approach for selective AADC delivery reduces motor symptoms and dyskinesia in Parkinson's mouse models</a></h4>

              
                Profound degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons and reduced DA levels in the brain is recognized as an underlying cause of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The standard treatment for PD is levodopa (L-DOPA), but its effectiveness wanes over time and prolonged usage can lead to L-DOPA-induced-dyskinesia (LID). An adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based strategy to overexpress aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the striatum combined with L-DOPA therapy shows promise for symptomatic improvement but requires an invasive delivery approach. Here, we generated enhancer AAVs to drive AADC expression in key cell types and paired them with a blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant capsid. We characterized the AAVs in mouse following multiple routes of administration and found that cell-type specific viral treatment ameliorated motor deficits and LID in PD disease models. This cell type-specific viral rescue strategy showed similar or better phenotypic rescue compared to a ubiquitous targeting approach and improved mortality. Additionally, we characterized the expression of an AAV-AADC vector capable of mouse phenotypic rescue in non-human primate (NHP) following two routes of administration. This novel therapeutic strategy in combination with L-DOPA may enable a less invasive and better tolerated approach to treat motor deficits in PD patients.

">Integrating Acoustic, Prosodic, and Phonological Features for Automatic Alzheimer's Detection</a></h4>

              
                Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for effective intervention. While previous studies have explored speech-based biomarkers for AD, this paper presents the first systematic investigation of acoustic, prosodic, and phonological speech features for detecting this neurocognitive disorder. Our study has two main objectives: (1) to assess the individual impact of AD on a wide range of speech features, and (2) to identify the most informative feature subsets using a combination of four feature ranking methods and seven machine learning classifiers. We conducted our experiments using the publicly available ADReSS Challenge dataset, allowing for direct comparison with prior speech-based approaches. Our analysis focused on continuous acoustic and prosodic measures as well as discrete phonological features, both independently and in combination. The best performance, with an F1-score of 0.89, was achieved using the optimal subset of acoustic features with ensemble learning and by integrating all three feature types, suggesting that combining continuous and categorical speech features offers complementary diagnostic value. This approach surpasses all previous speech-only methods in the ADReSS Challenge and comes close to the best reported overall result from the campaign's dataset, even without using lexical information. The results were further validated through positive outcomes on the Delaware corpus (focused on MCI) and a set of speeches from President Ronald Reagan (who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's). These findings suggest that speech patterns, beyond just the content, are more indicative of Alzheimer's disease than previously thought, underscoring the potential of multi-layered speech analysis for non-invasive AD detection.

                This paper examines the complex interplay between urban land lease policy, state ownership, and neo-patrimonial practices in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. While Ethiopia’s urban land lease policy aims for equitable development, state ownership exacerbates neo-patrimonial dynamics, leading to distorted resource allocation and limited access for marginalized communities. Through key informant interviews and policy analysis, this study reveals how ethnic alignment and political loyalty influence land access, undermining the policy’s stated objectives. The findings highlight a disconnection between formal regulations and the lived experiences of urban residents, particularly those lacking political connections. Despite constitutional guarantees, a centralized decision-making process and limited accountability perpetuate inequality. The study concludes that institutional reforms are needed to decentralize power, enhance transparency, and integrate marginalized voices into land governance to realize equitable and sustainable urban development in Addis Ababa. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the challenges facing urban land management in neo-patrimonial contexts.

<p>In a mouse model of spinal cord injury, pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 with GSK-343 reduces tissue damage and neuronal demyelination. GSK-343 suppresses the EZH2/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to attenuation of neuroinflammation and innate immune activation. These effects promote early neuroprotection and improved locomotor recovery in vivo.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with limited therapeutic options and a strong neuroinflammatory component that exacerbates tissue damage and impairs functional recovery. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase and core component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), has emerged as a key regulator of epigenetic modifications involved in neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of GSK-343, a selective EZH2 inhibitor, in a murine model of SCI induced by extradural compression. Female adult CD1 mice received intraperitoneal injections of GSK-343 (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) at 1- and 6-h post-injury. After 24 h, spinal cord tissues were collected and analyzed. GSK-343 treatment significantly reduced histological damage, neuronal demyelination, and the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, likely through modulation of the TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, EZH2 inhibition attenuated innate immune responses, as evidenced by the reduction in mast cell infiltration, microglial activation, and MCP-1 levels. These findings support the therapeutic potential of EZH2 inhibition as a novel epigenetic strategy to counteract neuroinflammation and promote early neuroprotection following SCI.</p>

<p>This study investigated if the epididymal amyloid CRES (cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic) is present in the male and female mammalian brain. CRES is expressed by hippocampal astrocytes, CA2 and CA3 neurons, and exhibits amyloid properties in the extracellular matrix. These data suggest CRES contributes to brain ECM function as a biological amyloid.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>CRES is the defining member of a reproductive subgroup of family 2 cystatins of cysteine protease inhibitors. We previously showed that CRES and other subgroup members are part of a highly plastic amyloid-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) with host defense functions in the mouse epididymal lumen. Based on parallels between the epididymis and the brain, we hypothesized that CRES and CRES amyloids might also function within the brain including the ECM. Here we show that CRES is produced by hippocampal neurons and astrocytes in the male and female mouse and human brain. Further, approximately 50% of hippocampal astrocytes from aged mice, like the aged human donor samples, had significantly reduced levels of CRES compared to younger mice, suggesting an age-related decline in CRES could contribute to altered brain function. Immunofluorescence experiments showed CRES colocalized with the ECM markers phosphacan and <i>wisteria floribunda</i> agglutinin indicating that CRES is part of the ECM. CRES monomer and high molecular weight SDS-resistant forms were found in insoluble fractions of the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and midbrain and bound to the protein aggregation disease (PAD) ligand, which preferentially binds amyloids but not protein monomers, suggesting a population of CRES normally exists in the brain as an amyloid structure. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that CRES/CRES amyloid is present in the mammalian brain and may contribute to ECM structure and function.</p>

                Background Second-order linear boundary value problems arise in many applications of science and engineering and are commonly treated by reducing them to first-order systems, which increases the computational cost. Direct high-order methods that preserve the second-order structure are therefore of interest. Methods This study proposes fixed-step, high-order diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta–Nyström (DIRKN) methods for the direct numerical solution of special second-order linear boundary value problems. Two schemes, DIRKN(3,4) and DIRKN(4,5), are constructed and combined with a linear shooting technique to handle both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions without transforming the problem into a first-order system. Results The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using benchmark test problems and application models, including rod heat conduction and reaction–diffusion equations. Numerical results demonstrate that both schemes achieve high accuracy and good efficiency, with DIRKN(4,5) generally producing smaller errors for a comparable number of function evaluations. A linear stability analysis shows absolute stability intervals of (−1.96, 0) for DIRKN(3,4) and (−7.24, 0) for DIRKN(4,5). Conclusions The proposed DIRKN methods provide accurate and efficient solvers for second-order linear boundary value problems with different types of boundary conditions, while preserving the original problem structure and reducing computational cost.

                Background Cash transfer programmes have emerged as a critical tool for addressing food insecurity and economic vulnerability for poor households in drought-prone regions. However, majority of such programmes rely on standardized, flat-rate payments that fail to account for household-level variation in needs, composition and local context. This paper proposes a context specific model for determining cash transfer values tailored to household’s demographic and economic vulnerability, using minimum expenditure basket and household compositions. Approach Development of the model adopted the conceptual framework approach which helps to ensure that transfers are reasonable and responds to actual household needs, and is based on existing realities. The approach aims to support a more dignified and effective humanitarian response, reduce negative coping strategies and lay the foundation for long-term resilience-building in affected communities. Results A generic description of the model is presented alongside empirical scenarios for different household compositions and adequacy ratios demonstrating how cash values adjust according to household structure and coverage rates. The developed model provides a scalable and flexible framework for determining transfer amounts with the aim of improving targeting efficiency and equity. The developed model is useful to academicians, policy makers and social assistance practitioners. It offers methodological innovations including converting household members into adult equivalent units and incorporating economies of scale in devising equitable cash transfer values in a humanitarian context. However, future research is needed to explore hybrid models that combine needs-based approach with other income gap or geographical based approaches in order to facilitate administrative feasibility.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-93/v1?src=rss">Challenges and barriers to early detection of primary open-angle glaucoma at the primary health care level: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma, accounting for over 86% of cases globally. As a major cause of irreversible blindness, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent disease progression. However, POAG is often diagnosed at advanced stages, due to insufficient and inconsistent screening in primary healthcare settings, negatively influencing prognosis and complicating treatment and management. Methods The development and conduct of this scoping review were guided by the 2020 Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines for conducting scoping reviews, following the framework established by Arksey and O’Malley. In alignment with the published protocol, systematic searches were conducted across several databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Web of Science and MEDLINE platforms. These searches focused on peer-reviewed articles published in English from January 2000 to March 2025. Resources were included if they reported on individuals who had been screened and diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) for the first time. Results A total of twenty-one resources were included in this review, with eight sourced from SSA (Sub-Saharan Africa). Of these studies, four focused specifically on screening for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), while the remaining studies concentrated on its diagnosis. Most of the research was conducted at the secondary healthcare level (n=12), and in the majority of these studies, screening was performed by eye specialists. The most commonly used equipment included visual acuity charts, tonometers, slit lamps, ophthalmoscopes, and Humphrey field analysers. Conclusion There is a significant need for screening of POAG at the primary health care level, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This will improve early detection of POAG, and subsequently reduce the prevalence of avoidable blindness.

                Background Hemoglobin A1c is widely recognized as an indicator of long-term glucose control in patients with diabetes. Its measurement, however, can be influenced by several hemoglobin disorders, including the β-thalassemia trait, which is relatively common in the Middle East. Methods This work compared manual HbA1c testing procedures with an automated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique in diabetic patients carrying the β-thalassemia trait. Sixty diagnosed diabetic cases with confirmed β-thalassemia were included from Fallujah Teaching Hospital. HbA1c was analyzed by three procedures: Variant II HPLC, ion-exchange resin, and Turbidimetric immunoassay. Data were processed using ANOVA, t-test, and Pearson correlation in SPSS, considering p < 0.05 significant. Results Differences among the tested methods were clearly evident. Measurements obtained by the automated HPLC system were generally higher mean (9.2%) than those recorded with the Turbidimetric immunoassay (7.58%) and the ion-exchange resin technique (7.96%). The observed gap between automated and manual estimations, reaching 1.5% and 1.15% respectively, was found to be statistically significant. HbA1c values demonstrated a strong positive correlation with HbA values in all three analytical methods (r > 0.82, p < 0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that manual assays would be expected to erroneously underestimate HbA1c levels in β-thalassemia carriers, which could significantly affect its clinical interpretation. The NGSP-standardized HPLC method was the most reliable for the accurate measurement of HbA1c and reflects more precisely glycemic control in patients with variant haemoglobins.

                Objective This follow-up study had two primary aims: (1) to evaluate the sustainability of effects from Adoption-Specific Therapy (ADAPT) on adopted children’s behavioral problems and attachment security, and on adoptive parents’ stress, three months post-intervention; and (2) to investigate the mechanisms underlying these sustained changes through advanced mediation analysis. Method The study presents secondary analysis of three-month follow-up data from a randomized controlled trial. A sample of 25 Iranian adoptive families (12 in the ADAPT group, 13 in waitlist control) completed assessments at pre-test (T1), post-test (T2), and three-month follow-up (T3). Measures included the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Kinship Center Attachment Questionnaire (KCAQ), and the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF). Sustainability was tested using Repeated-Measures MANCOVA. To examine mechanisms, nine parallel and serial mediation models were tested using Hayes’ PROCESS macro, with T3 scores as mediators/outcomes, controlling for baseline scores. Results The RM-MANCOVA revealed a significant and large Group × Time interaction (Pillai’s Trace = .777, *p* = .001). Gains in the ADAPT group on all outcomes were maintained at T3 with no significant decay from T2 to T3, while the control group remained stable. Mediation analyses indicated that ADAPT exerted significant direct effects on all three T3 outcomes (behavior, attachment, stress). However, no single, linear mediation pathway (parallel or serial) was statistically significant. The pattern of results supports a reciprocal, systemic model of change, where improvements in child behavior, attachment security, and parental stress mutually reinforce one another to sustain treatment gains. Conclusion The findings confirm that the benefits of ADAPT are sustained three months after treatment. More importantly, they suggest that its efficacy stems not from a simple causal chain but from initiating a positive, reciprocal cycle of change within the adoptive family system. This underscores the value of integrated, family-system interventions in post-adoption support.

                Background Difficult-to-treat (difficult) asthma remains a significant public health challenge, with poor control leading to increased exacerbations, reduced quality of life (QoL), and greater healthcare use. Physical inactivity, obesity, breathing pattern disorders, and psychological distress contribute to symptom burden and exacerbation risk. Exercise training, breathing retraining, dietary intervention, behavioural change and emotional self-management have shown benefits in improving asthma control, fitness, and QoL. However, engagement remains a challenge. This study will evaluate whether a structured, community-based multimodal intervention integrating supervised exercise, breathing retraining, and behaviour change support can improve asthma control and patient outcomes in individuals with difficult asthma. Methods LIBERTY is a single-centre pilot study evaluating the delivery and preliminary impact of a structured, community-based multimodal intervention in patients with difficult asthma. Participants will undertake a 24-week programme incorporating supervised exercise, breathing retraining, dietary intervention, behavioural change and emotional self-management. Participants will be recruited from severe asthma clinics and research databases. The pilot study will assess key process outcomes, including recruitment and retention rates, adherence, safety, and acceptability of the intervention. The primary clinical outcome is change in the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) and will be assessed to inform the design and sample size calculations for a future definitive trial. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, exercise capacity, symptom burden, and emotional wellbeing. Exploratory outcomes include mechanistic biomarker analysis. Participants will be followed up for six months after the intervention, to a total study duration of 12 months. Conclusions The LIBERTY pilot trial will assess whether a structured, multimodal intervention incorporating exercise, breathing retraining, behavioural change, and emotional self-management support, is feasible and accpetable to patients, and can improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes in patients with severe asthma.

                Introduction Ramadan fasting is practiced by millions of people with epilepsy worldwide. However, evidence on seizure outcomes during fasting is sparse in South-East Asia (SEA), where dietary and sleep-wave patterns differ from Middle Eastern cohorts. This multicenter study evaluated seizure frequency changes and associated factors among Indonesian Muslim people with epilepsy (MPWE) who fast during Ramadan. Methods A prospective pre-post multicentered observational cohort study was initiated in March 2023 – May 2024 across five hospitals and three cities in Indonesia. Participants were MPWE aged over 18 years old. Data were collected from the same participants one month before and during Ramadan at outpatient neurology clinics. Demography and clinical characteristics, along with Ramadan observance status, medication adherence, sleep duration, and quality of life, were assessed through medical records and questionnaires. Associations with seizure frequency change were analyzed using bivariate analysis and logistic regression. Results Among 122 participants, 102 (83.6%) fasted during Ramadan; 25.9% reported increased seizures. All individuals who were seizure-free pre-Ramadan remained seizure free. Carbohydrate over consumption at iftar independently predicted seizure increase (OR 3.816;95% CI 1.364-10.675). Sleep duration during Ramadan was not significantly associated to changes of seizure frequency. Conclusion Ramadan fasting appears safe for MPWE with prior seizure freedom. Excessive carbohydrate intake at iftar may elevate seizure risk, representing a modifiable intervention target. This study provides the first multicenter Indonesian evidence to inform culturally tailored clinical guidance for fasting decisions in epilepsy.

                Background Monitoring childhood growth is essential for early identification of nutritional and health-related disparities. Age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES) are key determinants of physical development, yet region-specific data on their combined influence remain limited in South Asia. Thus, this study aimed to assess the impact of age, gender, and SES on anthropometric parameters—weight, height, and body mass index (BMI)—among primary school children in Bangladesh, and to explore disparities in growth patterns across different demographic groups. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 children (150 boys, 150 girls) from grades one to five in six purposively selected schools representing urban, suburban, and rural settings in Dhaka. Anthropometric data were collected using standardized procedures. SES was assessed through a structured questionnaire incorporating household income, parental education, and occupation. Statistical analyses included independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests, and Pearson correlation. Results Anthropometric measures increased progressively with age, with significant differences in BMI across grade levels (F(4, 295) = 17.879, p < 0.001). No statistically significant gender differences were observed in weight, height, or BMI (p > 0.05). SES significantly influenced physical development; children from higher SES backgrounds had greater mean weight and height than those from lower SES groups (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis revealed strong associations between SES and both weight (r ≈ 0.7) and height (r ≈ 0.6), while BMI was moderately associated with weight (r ≈ 0.6) and inversely with height (r ≈ –0.3). The study highlights age-related growth trends and significant SES-based disparities in physical development among Bangladeshi schoolchildren. Conclusion These findings underscore the need for targeted public health policies, nutritional interventions, and school-based monitoring programs to address inequalities in child growth and ensure equitable development opportunities.

The study uses an explanatory design with a quantitative approach through a survey method. Data were collected using structured questionnaires from 103 container ports throughout Indonesia with respondents being decision makers and core port function managers, namely General Managers or Operations Managers or Marketing Manag-ers if the General Manager was not available. Data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling with a Partial Least Squares approach through SmartPLS. The results of the study indicate that networking and transformational organizational capabilities have a significant effect on digital adoption, and digital adoption has a significant effect on port performance. This study also found that digital adoption significantly mediates the relationship between transformational organization and port performance. However, this study does not prove that digital adoption mediates the influence of net-working capability on port performance.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013896">Linking spatial drug heterogeneity to microbial growth dynamics in theory and experiment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhijian Hu, Yuzhen Wu, Tomas Freire, Erida Gjini, Kevin Wood</p>

Drugs play a central role in limiting bacterial population spread, yet laboratory studies typically assume well-mixed environments when assessing microbial drug responses. In contrast, bacteria in the human body often occupy spatially structured habitats where drug concentrations vary. Understanding how this heterogeneity shapes growth and decline is therefore essential for controlling infections and mitigating resistance evolution. Here, we developed a minimal robot-automated system to study how spatial drug heterogeneity affects short-term population dynamics in <i>E. faecalis</i>, a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen. This system was combined with a theoretical framework to interpret and explain the observed outcomes. We first recapitulated the classic critical-patch-size model result: in a spatially homogeneous environment, a population persists in a finite domain only when growth outpaces diffusive losses at the boundaries. In heterogeneous environments, we found certain conditions that population persistence can depend critically on the spatial arrangement of the drug, even when its total amount is fixed. Using theoretical and experimental approaches, we identified the arrangements that produce the strongest growth and the fastest decline, revealing the range of possible outcomes under drug heterogeneity. We further tested this framework in more complex environments, including ring-shaped communities, and observed consistent arrangement-dependent behavior. Overall, our results extend the classical growth-condition framework to general heterogeneous environments and demonstrate that spatial drug arrangement - not only total dose - can strongly influence bacterial population dynamics. These findings highlight the importance of spatially structured dosing strategies and motivate further theoretical and experimental investigation.
