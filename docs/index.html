              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11123">Sparse Autoencoders Bridge The Deep Learning Model and The Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

                arXiv:2506.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a convolution-based data assimilation method tailored to neuronal electrophysiology, addressing the limitations of traditional value-based synchronization approaches. While conventional methods rely on nudging terms and pointwise deviation metrics, they often fail to account for spike timing precision, a key feature in neural signals. Our approach applies a Gaussian convolution to both measured data and model estimates, enabling a cost function that evaluates both amplitude and timing alignment via spike overlap. This formulation remains compatible with gradient-based optimization. Through twin experiments and real hippocampal neuron recordings, we demonstrate improved parameter estimation and prediction quality, particularly in capturing sharp, time-sensitive dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11455">Voxel-Level Brain States Prediction Using Swin Transformer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11634">Differences in Neurovascular Coupling in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: Evidence from Simultaneous Resting-State EEG-fNIRS</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurovascular coupling (NVC) refers to the process by which local neural activity, through energy consumption, induces changes in regional cerebral blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of neurons. Event-related studies have shown that the hemodynamic response typically lags behind neural activation by 4-6 seconds. However, little is known about how NVC is altered in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and throughout the recovery process. In this study, we employed simultaneous resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor neural and hemodynamic signals. Twelve patients with MDD during the acute phase, ten patients in the maintenance or consolidation phase, and six healthy controls were involved. We calculated the differences in coherence and temporal delay between spontaneous peak electrophysiological activity and hemodynamic responses across groups during the resting state in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that the neural activity and its subsequent correlation with hemodynamic responses were significantly higher in patients during the maintenance phase. The rise time from the lowest to the highest point of correlation was shorter in healthy individuals than in patients in the acute phase, and gradually recovered during remission. By leveraging wearable neuroimaging techniques, this study reveals alterations in neurovascular coupling in depression and offers novel multimodal insights into potential biomarkers for MDD and its recovery process.

                arXiv:2506.11015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory -- systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval, error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological "schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and workforce training in the age of large language models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11654">Equivalence of stationary dynamical solutions in a directed chain and a Delay Differential Equation of neuroscientific relevance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.11654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While synchronized states, and the dynamical pathways through which they emerge, are often regarded as the paradigm to understand the dynamics of information spreading on undirected networks of nonlinear dynamical systems, when we consider directed network architectures, dynamical stationary states can arise. To study this phenomenon we consider the simplest directed network, a single cycle, and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. We show numerically that a stationary dynamical state emerges in the form of a self-sustained traveling wave, through a saddle-point bifurcation of limit cycles that does not destabilize the global fixed point of the system. We then formulate an effective model for the dynamical steady state of the cycle in terms of a single-neuron Delay Differential Equation (DDE) featuring an explicitly delayed feedback, demonstrating numerically the possibility of mapping stationary solutions between the two models. The DDE based model is shown to reproduce the entire bifurcation, which also in this case does not destabilize the global fixed point, even though global properties differ in general between the systems. The discrete nature of the cycle graph is revealed as the origin of these coordinated states by the parametric analysis of solutions, and the DDE effective model is shown to preserve this feature accurately. Finally, the scaling of the inter-site propagation times hints to a solitonic nature of the wave state in the limit of large chain size.

                arXiv:2506.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic signals propagating along chains are common in biology, for example in locomotion and peristalsis, and are also of interest for continuum robots. In previous work we constructed such networks as 'feedforward lifts' of a central pattern generator (CPG). When the CPG undergoes periodic oscillations, created by Hopf bifurcation or other mechanisms, it can then transmit periodic signals along one or more feedforward chains in a synchronous or phase-synchronous manner. We proved necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of these lifted periodic orbits, in several senses. Here we examine the implications of the resulting theory for chains of neurons, using several standard neuron models: FitzHugh-Nagumo, Morris-Lecar, Hindmarsh-Rose, and Hodgkin-Huxley. We compare different notions of transverse stability, and summarize some numerical simulations showing that for all these neuron models the propagating signal can be transversely Floquet stable. Finally we discuss implications for less idealized models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20309">Tensor formalism for predicting synaptic connections with ensemble modeling or optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.20309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical neuroscientists often try to understand how the structure of a neural network relates to its function by focusing on structural features that would either follow from optimization or occur consistently across possible implementations. Both optimization theories and ensemble modeling approaches have repeatedly proven their worth, and it would simplify theory building considerably if predictions from both theory types could be derived and tested simultaneously. Here we show how tensor formalism from theoretical physics can be used to unify and solve many optimization and ensemble modeling approaches to predicting synaptic connectivity from neuronal responses. We specifically focus on analyzing the solution space of synaptic weights that allow a threshold-linear neural network to respond in a prescribed way to a limited number of input conditions. For optimization purposes, we compute the synaptic weight vector that minimizes an arbitrary quadratic loss function. For ensemble modeling, we identify synaptic weight features that occur consistently across all solutions bounded by an arbitrary ellipsoid. We derive a common solution to this suite of nonlinear problems by showing how each of them reduces to an equivalent linear problem that can be solved analytically. Although identifying the equivalent linear problem is nontrivial, our tensor formalism provides an elegant geometrical perspective that allows us to solve the problem approximately in an analytical way or exactly using numeric methods. The final algorithm is applicable to a wide range of interesting neuroscience problems, and the associated geometric insights may carry over to other scientific problems that require constrained optimization. We conclude by applying and testing our ensemble modeling framework to whole-brain recordings of larval zebrafish performing optomotor and optokinetic responses.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20349">Naturalistic Computational Cognitive Science: Towards generalizable models and theories that capture the full range of natural behavior</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can cognitive science build generalizable theories that span the full scope of natural situations and behaviors? We argue that progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers timely opportunities for cognitive science to embrace experiments with increasingly naturalistic stimuli, tasks, and behaviors; and computational models that can accommodate these changes. We first review a growing body of research spanning neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI that suggests that incorporating a broader range of naturalistic experimental paradigms, and models that accommodate them, may be necessary to resolve some aspects of natural intelligence and ensure that our theories generalize. First, we review cases from cognitive science and neuroscience where naturalistic paradigms elicit distinct behaviors or engage different processes. We then discuss recent progress in AI that shows that learning from naturalistic data yields qualitatively different patterns of behavior and generalization, and discuss how these findings impact the conclusions we draw from cognitive modeling, and can help yield new hypotheses for the roots of cognitive and neural phenomena. We then suggest that integrating recent progress in AI and cognitive science will enable us to engage with more naturalistic phenomena without giving up experimental control or the pursuit of theoretically grounded understanding. We offer practical guidance on how methodological practices can contribute to cumulative progress in naturalistic computational cognitive science, and illustrate a path towards building computational models that solve the real problems of natural cognition, together with a reductive understanding of the processes and principles by which they do so.

                arXiv:2506.04536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

                arXiv:2506.11062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2506.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns, and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized healthcare systems.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are optimization methods that are inspired by real phenomena in nature or the behavior of living beings, e.g., animals, to be used for solving complex problems, as in engineering, energy optimization, health care, etc. One of them was the creation of the Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO) in 2019, which is based on bee-inspired swarm intelligence and provides efficient optimization. This paper aims to introduce a comprehensive review of FDO, including its basic concepts, main variations, and applications from the beginning. It systematically gathers and examines every relevant paper, providing significant insights into the algorithm's pros and cons. The objective is to assess FDO's performance in several dimensions and to identify its strengths and weaknesses. This study uses a comparative analysis to show how well FDO and its variations work at solving real-world optimization problems, which helps us understand what they can do. Finally, this paper proposes future research directions that can help researchers further enhance the performance of FDO.

                arXiv:2506.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale neuromorphic architectures consist of computing tiles that communicate spikes using a shared interconnect. The communication patterns in these systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized, as neural activity is characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of high traffic. These characteristics require optimized interconnects to handle high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Among the proposed interconnect solutions, the dynamic segmented bus has gained attention due to its structural simplicity, scalability, and energy efficiency. Since the benefits of a dynamic segmented bus stem from its simplicity, it is essential to develop a streamlined control plane that can scale efficiently with the network. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a scenario-aware control plane tailored to a segmented ladder bus, with the aim of minimizing control overhead and optimizing energy and area utilization. We evaluated our approach using a combination of FPGA implementation and software simulation to assess scalability. The results demonstrated that our design process effectively reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the data plane while maintaining scalability with network size.

                arXiv:2506.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the Loihi neuromorphic system.

                arXiv:2506.11864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart buildings are gaining popularity because they can enhance energy efficiency, lower costs, improve security, and provide a more comfortable and convenient environment for building occupants. A considerable portion of the global energy supply is consumed in the building sector and plays a pivotal role in future decarbonization pathways. To manage energy consumption and improve energy efficiency in smart buildings, developing reliable and accurate energy demand forecasting is crucial and meaningful. However, extending an effective predictive model for the total energy use of appliances at the building level is challenging because of temporal oscillations and complex linear and non-linear patterns. This paper proposes three hybrid ensemble predictive models, incorporating Bagging, Stacking, and Voting mechanisms combined with a fast and effective evolutionary hyper-parameters tuner. The performance of the proposed energy forecasting model was evaluated using a hybrid dataset comprising meteorological parameters, appliance energy use, temperature, humidity, and lighting energy consumption from various sections of a building, collected by 18 sensors located in Stambroek, Mons, Belgium. To provide a comparative framework and investigate the efficiency of the proposed predictive model, 15 popular machine learning (ML) models, including two classic ML models, three NNs, a Decision Tree (DT), a Random Forest (RF), two Deep Learning (DL) and six Ensemble models, were compared. The prediction results indicate that the adaptive evolutionary bagging model surpassed other predictive models in both accuracy and learning error. Notably, it achieved accuracy gains of 12.6%, 13.7%, 12.9%, 27.04%, and 17.4% compared to Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), GBM, LGBM, and Random Forest (RF).

                arXiv:2506.11043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across $n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as BERT, [6], etc.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper, we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

                arXiv:2506.11178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing development of secure and responsible AI systems.

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data. MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities, significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05; BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352), MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli (https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15111">Learnable Activation Functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.15111v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, they face challenges related to spectral bias (the tendency to learn low-frequency components while struggling with high-frequency features) and unstable convergence dynamics (mainly stemming from the multi-objective nature of the PINN loss function). These limitations impact their accuracy for problems involving rapid oscillations, sharp gradients, and complex boundary behaviors. We systematically investigate learnable activation functions as a solution to these challenges, comparing Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) using fixed and learnable activation functions against Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that employ learnable basis functions. Our evaluation spans diverse PDE types, including linear and non-linear wave problems, mixed-physics systems, and fluid dynamics. Using empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis and Hessian eigenvalue decomposition, we assess spectral bias and convergence stability of the models. Our results reveal a trade-off between expressivity and training convergence stability. While learnable activation functions work well in simpler architectures, they encounter scalability issues in complex networks due to the higher functional dimensionality. Counterintuitively, we find that low spectral bias alone does not guarantee better accuracy, as functions with broader NTK eigenvalue spectra may exhibit convergence instability. We demonstrate that activation function selection remains inherently problem-specific, with different bases showing distinct advantages for particular PDE characteristics. We believe these insights will help in the design of more robust neural PDE solvers.

                arXiv:2503.22224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In expensive multi-objective optimization, where the evaluation budget is strictly limited, selecting promising candidate solutions for expensive fitness evaluations is critical for accelerating convergence and improving algorithmic performance. However, designing an optimization strategy that effectively balances convergence, diversity, and distribution remains a challenge. To tackle this issue, we propose a composite indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (CI-EMO) for expensive multi-objective optimization. In each generation of the optimization process, CI-EMO first employs NSGA-III to explore the solution space based on fitness values predicted by surrogate models, generating a candidate population. Subsequently, we design a novel composite performance indicator to guide the selection of candidates for real fitness evaluation. This indicator simultaneously considers convergence, diversity, and distribution to improve the efficiency of identifying promising candidate solutions, which significantly improves algorithm performance. The composite indicator-based candidate selection strategy is easy to achieve and computes efficiency. Component analysis experiments confirm the effectiveness of each element in the composite performance indicator. Comparative experiments on three benchmark test sets and real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms five state-of-the-art expensive multi-objective optimization algorithms.

                arXiv:2506.06374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-state spiking neurons such as the adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (AdLIF) neuron offer compelling alternatives to conventional deep learning models thanks to their sparse binary activations, second-order nonlinear recurrent dynamics, and efficient hardware realizations. However, such internal dynamics can cause instabilities during inference and training, often limiting performance and scalability. Meanwhile, state space models (SSMs) excel in long sequence processing using linear state-intrinsic recurrence resembling spiking neurons' subthreshold regime. Here, we establish a mathematical bridge between SSMs and second-order spiking neuron models. Based on structure and parametrization strategies of diagonal SSMs, we propose two novel spiking neuron models. The first extends the AdLIF neuron through timestep training and logarithmic reparametrization to facilitate training and improve final performance. The second additionally brings initialization and structure from complex-state SSMs, broadening the dynamical regime to oscillatory dynamics. Together, our two models achieve beyond or near state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances for reset-based spiking neuron models across both event-based and raw audio speech recognition datasets. We achieve this with a favorable number of parameters and required dynamic memory while maintaining high activity sparsity. Our models demonstrate enhanced scalability in network size and strike a favorable balance between performance and efficiency with respect to SSM models.

Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network storage capacity (pattern-to-neuron ratio around 0.14). We propose Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) learning. Unlike linear methods, KLR uses kernels to implicitly map patterns to high-dimensional feature space, enhancing separability. By learning dual variables, KLR dramatically improves storage capacity, achieving perfect recall even when pattern numbers exceed neuron numbers (up to ratio 1.5 shown), and enhances noise robustness. KLR demonstrably outperforms Hebbian and linear logistic regression approaches.

                arXiv:2505.18023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in developing spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a potential solution to the energy challenges posed by conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, our theoretical understanding of SNNs remains relatively limited compared to the ever-growing body of literature on ANNs. In this paper, we study a discrete-time model of SNNs based on leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, referred to as discrete-time LIF-SNNs, a widely used framework that still lacks solid theoretical foundations. We demonstrate that discrete-time LIF-SNNs with static inputs and outputs realize piecewise constant functions defined on polyhedral regions, and more importantly, we quantify the network size required to approximate continuous functions. Moreover, we investigate the impact of latency (number of time steps) and depth (number of layers) on the complexity of the input space partitioning induced by discrete-time LIF-SNNs. Our analysis highlights the importance of latency and contrasts these networks with ANNs employing piecewise linear activation functions. Finally, we present numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Auditory hypersensitivity is a well-established phenotype of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), but how it relates to neurobehavioral biomarkers remains poorly understood. To offer an integrated model, we propose a dual thalamic framework with hypo-lemniscal (LEM) and hyper-extralemniscal (EXLEM) thalamic models. Traditional FXS studies may have been conflating LEM and EXLEM systems, misrepresenting the origins of the hypersensitivity. We hypothesize that hyper-EXLEM pathology impacts FXS symptoms more. To test this hypothesis, we first review the dual thalamic systems and then demonstrate the hypo-LEM and hyper-EXLEM models in individuals with FXS. We use a 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ie LEM responses) paradigm with relatively long (1.5 to 3 s) stimulus and interstimulus intervals to evoke N1/P2 as Vertex Potentials (VPs, ie EXLEM responses) for onset and offset of the stimulus. We analyzed electroencephaogram (EEG) responses from 29 FXS and 33 healthy comparison individuals. Results showed lower intertrial coherence (ITC) in FXS, consistent with hypo-LEM predictions, and larger vertex potentials consistent with hyper-EXLEM predictions. Correlation analyses revealed that enhanced VPs classified FXS males more sensitively than ITC. These findings indicate that hyperreactivity of the EXLEM system is more dominantly related to FXS, which can provide a more accurate account for guiding diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</span>

">Multi-Scale Parcellation of Dynamic Causal Models of the Brain</a></h4>

              
                The hierarchical organization of the brain's distributed network has received growing interest from the neuroscientific community, largely because of its potential to enhance our understanding of the human cognition and behavior, in health and disease. While most multiscale connectivity analyses focus on structural and functional networks, characterizing the effective connectome across multiple scales has been somewhat overlooked - mostly for computational reasons. The difficulty of estimating large cyclic causal models on the one hand, and the scarcity of theoretical frameworks for systematically moving between scales on the other hand, have hindered progress in this direction. This technical note introduces a top-down multi-scale parcellation scheme for dynamic causal models, with application to neuroimaging data. The method is based on Bayesian model comparison, as a generalization to the well-known delta-BIC method. To facilitate the computations, recent developments in linear dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and Bayesian model reduction (BMR) are deployed. Specifically, a naive version of BMR is introduced, using which the parcellation scheme can be scaled up to hundreds or thousands of regions. Notably, the derivations reveal an analytical relationship between the model comparison score and the concept of cut size in graph theory. This duality puts the tools of graph theory at the service of model evidence optimization and significance testing. The proposed method was applied to simulated and empirical causal models, for face and construct validity. Notably, the large causal network (inferred from a neuroimaging dataset) showed scale-invariance in multiple measures. Future generalizations of this technique and its potential applications in systems and clinical neuroscience have been discussed.

">Automated 3D Segmentation of Human Vagus Nerve Fascicles and Epineurium from Micro-Computed Tomography Images Using Anatomy-Aware Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Precise segmentation and quantification of nerve morphology from imaging data are critical for designing effective and selective peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapies. However, prior studies on nerve morphology segmentation suffer from important limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. This study introduces a deep learning approach for robust and automated 3D segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) images. Methods. We developed a multi-class 3D U-Net to segment fascicles and epineurium that incorporates a novel anatomy-aware loss function to ensure that predictions respect nerve topology. We trained and tested the network using subject-level five-fold cross-validation with 100 microCT sub-volumes (11.4 [&mu]m isotropic resolution) from cervical and thoracic vagus nerves stained with phosphotungstic acid from five subjects. We benchmarked the 3D U-Net's performance against a 2D U-Net using both standard and anatomy-specific segmentation metrics. Results. Our 3D U-Net generated high-quality segmentations (average Dice similarity coefficient: 0.93). Compared to the 2D U-Net, our 3D U-Net yielded significantly better volumetric overlap, boundary delineation, and fascicle-level accuracy. The 3D approach reduced anatomical errors by 2.5-fold, provided more consistent inter-slice boundaries, and improved detection of fascicle splits/merges by nearly 6-fold. Significance. Our automated 3D segmentation pipeline provides anatomically accurate 3D maps of peripheral neural morphology from microCT data. The automation allows for high throughput, and the substantial improvement in segmentation quality and anatomical fidelity enhances the reliability of morphological analysis, vagal pathway mapping, and the implementation of realistic computational models. These advancements provide a foundation for understanding the functional organization of the vagus and other peripheral nerves and optimizing PNS therapies.

">Innervation of Retrodiscal Tissues in Patients with Temporomandibular Joint Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders (TMJDs) are a group of musculoskeletal conditions affecting the orofacial region and often associated with facial pain. Understanding the sensory innervation of TMJ structures, particularly the retrodiscal tissue, is essential for identifying pain mechanisms in TMJD because to study these mechanisms, we must first determine the sensory neuronal makeup of the TMJ. However, data on nerve types within TMJ tissues remain limited. This study examined the sensory and sympathetic nerve profiles in retrodiscal tissues from TMJD patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or condylar hyperplasia (CH) who underwent bilateral TMJ replacement (TMJR). Immunohistochemistry with specific nerve markers was used to visualize and quantify nerve subtypes. CH tissues had significantly lower densities of pgp9.5+ sensory fibers compared to RA and OA, which showed similar levels. Across all subtypes, the ratio of unmyelinated (pgp9.5+/NFH-) to myelinated (pgp9.5+/NFH+) fibers was approximately 70:30. Most sensory nerves were CGRP+ (peptidergic), while a smaller portion were CGRP- (non-peptidergic), some of which were parvalbumin-positive (PV+). Both myelinated and non-myelinated peptidergic as well as non-peptidergic fibers were present in the retrodiscal tissues. In addition to sensory innervation, all retrodiscal tissues contained tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH+) sympathetic fibers, primarily innervating blood vessels (alpha-smooth muscle actin+). These vessels were also predominantly innervated by unmyelinated sensory fibers, with limited input from myelinated sensory nerves. In summary, all TMJD subtypes shared similar nerve compositions, but CH tissues exhibited reduced sensory nerve density, a potential explanation for the lower association with pain compared to OA and RA. For all TMJD subtypes, retrodiscal tissue vasculature was mainly innervated by sympathetic and unmyelinated sensory nerves. These findings enhance understanding of the neural basis of TMJD related pain.

">Preventing Microglial Reactivity Protects from Acute and Progressive Neuronal Dysfunction, Motor Impairments and Sedation following Alcohol Abuse</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol abuse is the primary risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, characterized by systemic inflammation, multi-organ damage, and neurological impairments. While direct effects of alcohol on brain function are well-established, the role of microglia in acute and chronic neurological dysfunction in AUD remains unclear. Using longitudinal in vivo imaging in mice during acute and repeated alcohol abuse, we found that microglia exhibit dynamic morphological responses that precede but parallel ethanol-induced sedation. Ethanol also induced microglia-dependent synapse elimination and reduced neuronal activity and density. Genetic disruption of microglial MyD88 reversed these ethanol-associated changes in microglial reactivity, neuronal structure and function, while protecting against alcohol-induced intoxication and motor impairments. These findings identify microglia as cellular drivers of acute and chronic brain dysfunction following alcohol abuse, and highlight MyD88 as a critical therapeutic target for the detrimental neurological consequences of AUD.

">Effects of aging on upper body express visuomotor responses while reaching under varying postural demands</a></h4>

              
                Humans can react remarkably quickly to novel or displaced visual stimuli when time is of the essence. Such movements are thought to be initiated by a subcortical fast visuomotor network, but it is unclear how this network declines with age. Past work in the upper limb has detailed delayed reaching corrections to jumped visual stimuli in the elderly, but the underlying mechanisms contributing to these changes of the fast visuomotor network are poorly understood. Conversely, work in the lower limb has reported delayed muscle recruitment during obstacle avoidance, but such findings may be confounded by age-related challenges in postural control. The output of the fast visuomotor network can be quantified by measuring express visuomotor responses (EVRs), which are the earliest and very short-latency bursts of muscle activity that follow visual target presentation. Here, we compare the prevalence, latency, and magnitude of EVRs in elderly (58-80 years old) and younger (18-25 years old) participants performing visually-guided reaches. We also investigated the impact of postural stability by having participants reach either while seated on a stable chair, or on a wobble stool. Both the elderly and younger cohorts expressed EVRs, but EVRs in the elderly were comparatively less frequent, and had longer latencies and smaller magnitude. Postural instability had no effects on these outcomes. Our results suggest age-related declines in the fast visuomotor network, potentially resulting from deterioration of underlying circuits and a prioritization of stability over speed. This study serves as an important standard for future research investigating clinical populations.

">Proximity labelling reveals the compartmental proteome of murine sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the molecular architecture of peripheral sensory neurons is critical as we pursue novel drug targets against pain and neuropathy. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) show extensive compartmentalization, thus understanding each compartment - from the peripheral to central terminals - is key to this effort. To systematically profile this spatial complexity, we generated a TurboIDfl/fl transgenic mouse line (ROSA26em1(TurboID)Bros), enabling targeted proximity labelling and deep proteomic profiling of DRG neuron compartments via AdvillinCre. Our data reveal distinct proteomic signatures across neuronal compartments that reflect specialized neuronal functions. We provide proteomic insights into previously inaccessible nerve terminals both in the periphery (innervating the skin) and in the spinal cord. Further, using a DRG explant model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), we uncovered novel and discrete proteome changes, highlighting neuronal vulnerability. Together, our findings provide a unique proteome atlas of the sensory neuron proteome across anatomical domains and demonstrate the utility of proximity labelling proteomics for detecting compartment-specific molecular alterations in a disease model. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for mechanistic studies of sensory neuron function and pathology.

">Unlocking the Neuropeptidome using a Novel Endogenous Peptidomics Framework</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous peptides have garnered increasing attention over the past decade driven by the development of advanced analytical methods. However, large-scale investigations of peptides as potential disease biomarkers or drug candidates are still hindered by their challenging biochemical properties and the scarcity of specialized analytical tools. Among these, neuropeptides are particularly challenging to study due to their low in vivo concentration, rapid turnover rate, and high structural variability. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great ability in profiling low-abundance ions. Nevertheless, most available DIA analytical tools are designed for proteomics studies and are not suitable for endogenous peptides, as there is no set enzymatic cleavage for these peptides. Here, we introduce the novel EndoGenius platform, paired with DIA-NN, to achieve high-confidence neuropeptide identification using an updated spectral library for DIA MS analysis. By employing orthogonal offline fractionation, ion mobility instrumentation, and an optimized database searching algorithm specifically for neuropeptides, we have constructed the largest crustacean neuropeptide spectral library to date. With this library, in combination with neural networking technology, we report a 100-fold increase in the number of neuropeptides identified in all Cancer borealis tissues analyzed. We also cross-validated these findings with transcriptomics data to enhance identification confidence. This workflow presents a novel analytical framework for DIA peptidomics analysis, offering a robust approach to studying neuropeptides and other endogenous peptides.

">LSD Restores Synaptic Plasticity in VTA of Morphine-Treated Mice and Disrupts Morphine-Conditioned Place Preference</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics are emerging as a promising treatment option for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. One potential mechanism underlying their therapeutic benefits may involve a reversal of maladaptive plasticity induced by drug exposure. Here, we identify physiological, behavioral, and epigenetic impacts of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on morphine-treated male and female mice. Morphine was selected due to the high leverage capacity to address the opioid epidemic. A single treatment of LSD, or 4 microdoses of LSD, cause accelerated extinction of morphine-induced conditioned place preference. Whole-cell electrophysiology revealed that excitatory synaptic plasticity, which was eliminated in VTA GABA neurons following morphine exposure, was restored 24 hours after a single high dose of LSD. To explore the impact of LSD treatment on potential epigenetic changes, whole-brain DNA methylation analysis in morphine-treated mice that received either saline or LSD post-morphine treatment revealed significant differences in methylation profiles associated with LSD treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that LSD may reverse or prevent morphine-induced changes in reward circuit plasticity and attenuate measures of morphine-preference.

">Effects of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation on pupil dilation are dependent on sensory matching</a></h4>

              
                Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a promising non-invasive method to modulate motivation, cognition, and affect. According to a recent meta-analysis, pulsed taVNS induces larger pupil dilation (vs. sham), but sensory aspects of the stimulation may contribute to these differences. Moreover, included studies were often small and stimulation was only applied to the left ear, so that questions about the robustness and generalization remain. Here, we investigated the effects of pulsed taVNS (1s, 20Hz, 400s pulse width) at the right ear on phasic pupil dilation using a randomized crossover design in 94 participants (47 women). We initially calibrated the stimulation amplitude to match the perceived sensation across conditions and tracked sensation over time. Contrary to our hypothesis, taVNS did not elicit greater pupil dilation versus sham (b = -0.42, 95% CI [-1.30; 0.46], p = .35). However, taVNS effects were larger if sham was perceived as less intense despite the initial matching (b = 3.39, 95% CI [0.62; 6.17], p = .017). Differences in intensity ratings were mainly associated with sham-induced pupil dilation (r = -.25, 95% CI [-.43; -.05], p = .013). To summarize, our results recapitulate the findings of other studies using fixed amplitudes by showing that right-sided pulsed taVNS only induced larger pupil dilation against sham if differences in sensation arose. These findings highlight the challenge of establishing a suitable sham condition since both taVNS and sham affect sensory nerves, potentially leading to confounding effects.

">Glutaminolysis Fuels Reactive Astrocytes, Exacerbating Amyloid Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques with progressively increasing reactive astrocytes characterize Alzhemer's disease (AD). Reactive astrocytes are regulated by cellular and molecular mechanisms that are known to progress A{beta} pathology. However, the metabolic adaptation and metabolites required to fuel these molecular changes in reactive astrocytes remain unknown. Using human AD samples, in vivo amyloid mouse models, and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that reactive astrocytes utilize glutamine to fuel anaplerosis and meet their metabolic demands, thereby progressing amyloidosis. We show that reactive astrocytes increase Na+-coupled neutral amino acid transporters for glutamine uptake that are interdependent on Na+/K+ ATPase. Furthermore, increasing brain-glutamine levels with a high-glutamine diet exacerbated reactive astrocytes, increasing A{beta} burden in an amyloid mouse model. We demonstrate that glutamine undergoes glutaminolysis via glutaminase-2/glutamate dehydrogenase-1 enzymes to be incorporated into TCA metabolites for anaplerosis. Pharmacologically or genetically blocking glutaminolysis reduces reactive astrocytes and decreases A{beta} pathology in an amyloid mouse. Our findings reveal the first glutamine-dependent metabolic adaptation of reactive astrocytes affecting A{beta} pathology, which may be harnessed for AD therapeutic strategies.

">Canagliflozin reprograms the aging hippocampus in genetically diverse UM-HET3 mice and attenuates Alzheimer's-like pathology</a></h4>

              
                Aging is the strongest risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the mechanisms underlying brain aging and their modulation by pharmacological interventions remain poorly defined. The hippocampus, essential for learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable to metabolic stress and inflammation. Canagliflozin (Cana), an FDA-approved sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) for type 2 diabetes, extends lifespan in male but not female mice, but its impact on brain aging is unknown. Here, we used a multi-omics strategy integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to investigate how chronic Cana treatment reprograms brain aging in genetically diverse UM-HET3 mice. In males, Cana induced mitochondrial function, insulin and cGMP-PKG signaling, and suppressed neuroinflammatory networks across all molecular layers, resulting in improved hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. In females, transcriptional activation of neuroprotective pathways did not translate to protein or metabolite-level changes and failed to rescue cognition. In the 5xFAD AD model, Cana reduced amyloid plaque burden, microgliosis, and memory deficits in males only, despite comparable peripheral glucose improvements in both sexes. Our study reveals sex-specific remodeling of hippocampal aging by a clinically available SGLT2i, with implications for AD pathology and lifespan extension, and highlights Cana's potential to combat brain aging and AD through sex-specific mechanisms.

">A Reappraisal of the Role of the Mammillothalamic Tract in Memory Deficits Following Stroke in the Thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus, traditionally viewed as a sensory relay station, is now recognized for its critical role in higher-order cognitive functions, including memory. While most research has focused on its distinct nuclei, the thalamus also contains crucial white matter tracts, such as the mammillothalamic tract (MTT), part of the Papez circuit. Despite its established role in memory, the MTT remains underappreciated in studies on the cognitive role of the thalamus, increasing the risk of misattributing memory functions to nearby thalamic nuclei. This study investigates the memory impact of thalamic strokes by considering disruption to the MTT. We examined 40 patients with chronic ischemic thalamic lesions and 45 healthy controls using neuropsychological assessments, focusing on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and high-resolution structural neuroimaging. Advanced imaging techniques, such as symptom mapping and disconnectome analyses, were employed to analyze the relationships between lesion sites, tract disconnections and cognitive outcomes. Additionally, the expression of calbindin-rich matrix cells and parvalbumin-rich core cells was examined to assess how the connectivity property of thalamic cells, and its disruption, can relate to cognitive deficits following a thalamic stroke. Patients with left-sided thalamic lesions, especially those involving the MTT, showed significant memory impairments. Symptom mapping identified a specific cluster of lesioned voxels in the left anterior-lateral thalamus, including the MTT, as being strongly associated with poorer memory performance. Disconnectome analysis confirmed that verbal memory deficits were associated with disruption of the MTT. Furthermore, a striking overlap was observed between the critical regions linked to memory deficits and calbindin-rich thalamic areas. However, this calbindin-rich region was also disrupted in patients without memory impairment, revealing that MTT disruption, and not lesions to this region, induced memory deficits in these patients. The identified FCSRT deficit cluster overlapped with brain regions consistently linked to memory processes following fMRI meta-analytic mapping of memory-related keywords. These findings challenge the traditional focus on thalamic nuclei and connector hubs, indicating a need to reappraise the importance of the MTT in memory impairment after a thalamic stroke. This study advocates for a shift in thalamic research, emphasizing the need to investigate tract-specific contributions and disruptions of the MTT but also of other tracts such as the interthalamic adhesion or amygdalo-fugal pathway, rather than holding only to a "nuclei-centric" view of the thalamus.

">Two Specialized Intrinsic Cardiac Neuron Types Safeguard Heart Homeostasis and Stress Resilience</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS), often referred to as 'the little brain on the heart', plays a central role in heart-brain communication and is increasingly recognized as both a contributor to cardiac disorders, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, and a growing target for therapeutic intervention. Despite its clinical relevance, the molecular and functional organization of the ICNS remains poorly understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, high-resolution imaging, and cell-specific genetic tools in mice, we identified two molecularly distinct intrinsic cardiac neuron (ICN) subtypes marked by Npy and Ddah1, each exhibiting unique anatomical innervation patterns. Npy ICNs function as parasympathetic postganglionic neurons essential for maintaining coronary perfusion and cardiac homeostasis during routine physiological activity. In contrast, Ddah1 ICNs are crucial for preserving cardiac electrical stability and preventing sudden death under extreme stress. These findings uncover specialized ICNS pathways that support cardiac homeostasis and resilience, providing a foundation for developing targeted neurocardiac therapies for autonomic dysfunction in human heart disease.

">Increased Synapse Elimination by Inflammatory Cells Contributes to Long-lasting Post-Stroke Memory Dysfunction in Old Mice</a></h4>

              
                Old patients are more likely to experience memory dysfunction than young patients after a stroke. It has been reported that brain astrocytes and microglia cause excessive removal of synapses at the acute and subacute stages of stroke, and inhibition of their phagocytosis improved neurobehavioral outcomes. We hypothesized that memory dysfunction in old subjects is associated with increased synapse removal by inflammatory cells. Ischemic stroke was induced in young (2-month-old) and old (15-18-month-old) mice. Memory functions were analyzed by the Y-maze test weekly for 8 weeks and the novel object recognition (NOR) test at 7 days before and 8 weeks post-stroke. We have also created a tibia fracture 6 hours before stroke injury in young mice, to test if the activation of 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchRs) reduces inflammatory cells and synapse elimination. Brains were collected 8 weeks after the induction of ischemic stroke. Transcriptome changes, neuronal injuries, neuroinflammation, synapse removal, and neurite outgrowth were analyzed. We found that old mice developed long-term memory dysfunction after ischemic stroke, which was not seen in young mice. Old mice showed larger infarct volume, higher neuroinflammation, and more synapses engulfed by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the peri-atrophic region and hippocampi than young mice. More synapse-engulfing astrocytes than microglia/macrophages were present in the peri-atrophic region and the ipsilateral hippocampi, suggesting that reactive astrocytes contributed more than activated microglia/macrophages in synapse removal. Activation of 7-nAchRs in mice subjected to tibia fracture 6 hours before ischemic injury reduced synapse removal by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the hippocampi. Our study indicated that an increase in synaptic elements by inflammatory cells contributes to the long-lasting memory deficit after stroke in old mice. Astrocytes may contribute more than microglia/macrophages in synapse removal. Inhibition of neuroinflammation by activating 7-nAchRs can reduce synapse loss and thus may improve post-stroke memory function.

">The vagus nerve promotes memory via septo-hippocampal acetylcholine: Implications for obesity-induced cognitive dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                The vagus nerve relays critical metabolic information between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the brain. Recent findings highlight a role for vagus nerve-mediated gut-brain signaling in regulating higher-order cognitive processes, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that nutrient consumption promotes hippocampal-dependent memory function via vagus nerve-mediated acetylcholine (ACh) release in the dorsal hippocampus (HPCd) from medial septum (MS) neurons. In vivo analyses reveal that HPCd ACh release is engaged during nutrient consumption, and that this response is abolished in animals that received MS cholinergic neuron ablation, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV), or early-life Western Diet (WD) maintenance. MS cholinergic neuron ablation, SDV, and early-life WD also impaired memory for meal location, suggesting that this gut-brain pathway functions to encode memories for eating events. Collectively, results identify a neurobiological mechanism whereby nutrient consumption promotes memory function, and reveal that disruption of this vagal-brain signaling system mediates WD-associated memory impairments.

">Sex-dependent effects of maternal high-fat diet during lactation in adult THY-Tau22 mice offspring</a></h4>

              
                The perinatal environment has been suggested to participate to the development of tauopathies and Alzheimer's disease but the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved remain contradictory and under-investigated. Here, we evaluated the effects of a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) during lactation on the development of tauopathy in the THY-Tau22 mouse strain, a model of progressive tau pathology associated with cognitive decline. During lactation, dams were fed either a chow diet (13.6% of fat) or a HFD (58% of fat). At weaning, offspring was fed a chow diet until sacrifice at 4 months of age (the onset of tau pathology) or 7 months of age (the onset of cognitive impairment). During lactation, maternal HFD increased body weight gain in offspring. At 3 months of age, maternal HFD led to a mild glucose intolerance only in male offspring. Moreover, it impaired spatial memory in both male and female 6-month-old offspring, with males being more impacted. These cognitive deficits were associated with increased phosphorylation of hippocampal tau protein-observed at 4 months in males and at 7 months in females, highlighting a sex-specific temporal shift. Additionally, maternal HFD modified adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), leading to an increase of mature neuronal cells number in females and of dendritic arborization length in males. Synaptic analysis further revealed that maternal HFD led to synaptic loss only in males. Finally, multi-omics approaches showed that maternal HFD has long-term consequences on both transcriptome, proteome and regulome, this effect being also sex-dependent with mitochondrial pathways, ribosomal activity, cilium and the extracellular matrix predominantly impacted in males, while gliogenesis, myelination and synaptic plasticity were primarily affected in females. Regulome analysis suggested that this sex-dependent phenotype was more related to a temporal shift rather than distinct sex-specific alterations. Collectively, our data suggest that maternal malnutrition accelerates the development of tauopathy in THY-Tau22 offspring, with sex-dependent effects, males being impacted earlier than females. These findings highlight the critical role of the perinatal environment as a key window of opportunity for interventions aimed at preventing the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

                The basal ganglia and midbrain dopaminergic systems are critical for motor control, reward processing, and reinforcement learning, with dysfunction in these systems implicated in numerous neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. To enable precise genetic targeting of key neuronal populations, we generated and characterized five knock-in mouse lines: Drd1-Cre, Adora2a-Cre, Drd1-FlpO, Adora2a-FlpO, and DAT-FlpO. These lines allow for Cre- or FlpO-mediated recombination in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs), adenosine A2a receptor-expressing SPNs, and dopamine transporter (DAT)-expressing neurons in the midbrain. Histological analyses confirmed recombinase activity in expected brain regions, and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings validated the intrinsic excitability profiles of each neuronal subpopulation. These tools provide high specificity and reliability for studying basal ganglia circuitry and dopaminergic neurons. By enabling targeted manipulations, these openly available knock-in lines will advance research into the neural mechanisms underlying motor control, reward, and neuropsychiatric diseases.

">Structurally Constrained Functional Connectivity Reveals Efficient Visuomotor Decision-Making Mechanisms in Action Video Gamers</a></h4>

              
                Long-term action video game (AVG) playing has been linked to improved response times (~190 ms) without accuracy tradeoffs in time-sensitive visuomotor decisions, but how it reshapes neural circuits is unclear. In this study, Cognitive Resource Reallocation (CRR) is introduced as a candidate mechanism for how sustained engagement with AVGs drives behaviorally relevant neuroplasticity through neuroplastic refinement. Using the AAL3 structural connectivity atlas, we apply structural constraints to functional connectivity (SC-FC) and directed functional connectivity (SC-dFC) in gamers and non-gamers. Our results provide strong support for the CRR hypothesis and demonstrate that the brain plausibly reallocates cognitive resources over time to optimize task-relevant networks in high-demand environments like AVGs, enhancing the integration of contextual information and refining motion processing, which may be a key mechanism in explaining more efficient visuomotor decision-making. These findings position action video games as powerful tools for studying experience-driven neuroplasticity, with implications for cognitive training, rehabilitation, and optimizing real-world visuomotor decisions.

">Semantics across the globe: A universal neurocognitive semantic structure adaptive to climate</a></h4>

              
                Thousands of languages are used worldwide as the primary means of human thought communications. While both similarities and variations in word meaning (semantics) across different languages are well recognized, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic without a coherent theoretical model for semantic representation. Given that semantic representation is a product of the human brain, we address this issue through the lens of neurocognitive theories, with the consensus framework that semantics are derived from sensory experiences, with a set of dimensions being identified as biologically salient in neuroscientific studies. We operationalized word semantic representations with this set of specific dimensions, using computational models (53 languages' word embedding data; Study 1), human behavioral ratings (253 subjects, 8 languages; Study 2), and brain activity data (86 subjects, 45 languages; Study 3), and analyzed the similarity and variation patterns of concepts across different languages. These three approaches converge on the finding that, across diverse language samples, word semantic representations along the neurocognitive dimensional structures exhibit strong commonalities, with variations along this structure being significantly and uniquely explained by climate, beyond sociocultural-centered variables. These results present a universal, biologically constrained semantic structure that is adaptive to environmental inputs, reconciling the classical universality and relativity debate.

">Supervised white matter bundle segmentation in glioma patients with transfer learning</a></h4>

              
                In clinical settings, the virtual dissection of white matter tracts represents an informative source of information for monitoring neurological conditions or to support the planning of a treatment. The automation of this task using data-driven approaches, and in particular deep learning models, provides promising evidence of good accuracy when carried out on healthy individuals. However, the lack of large clinical datasets and the profound differences between healthy and clinical populations hinder the translation of these results to patients. Here, we investigated for the first time the effectiveness of transfer learning in adapting a deep learning architecture trained on a healthy population to glioma patients. Importantly, we provided the first thorough characterization of domain shift and its complexity, distinguishing systematic (i.e. measurement and pre-processing related) from tumor specific components. Our results suggest that (i) models trained on a large normative healthy population have a significant performance drop when the inference is carried out on patients; (ii) transfer learning can be an effective strategy to overcome the shortage of clinical data and to manage the systematic shift; (iii) fine tuning of the learning model cannot accommodate large white matter deformations induced by the tumor. The results were coherent across the five white matter bundles and three different input modalities tested, highlighting their robustness and generalizability. Our work provides valuable insights for advancing automated white matter segmentation in clinical populations and enhancing clinical transfer learning applications.

">Post-translational modifications distinguish amyloid-β isoform patterns extracted from vascular deposits and parenchymal plaques</a></h4>

              
                Deposition of amyloid-beta (AB) aggregates is a core pathological hallmark of both cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and extracellular parenchymal plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD). While both disease processes share progressive, decades-long deposition of fibrillar AB peptide, they differ in isoform composition. We hypothesized that post-translational modifications (PTMs) on AB would also differ between CAA and parenchymal plaques. Using Lys-N enzymatic digestion followed by quantitative mass spectrometry, we profiled AB isoforms and N-terminus PTMs (aspartic acid isomerization and pyroglutamate formation) across CAA severity and compared them to parenchymal plaque AB in AD. Moderate to severe CAA primarily featured intact N-terminus (AB1-x) (~95%) with minimal N-truncated species (AB2-x, AB3pGlu-x, AB4-x), whereas parenchymal plaques displayed diverse N-terminus truncations and PTMs. Increasing CAA severity correlated with a shift from longer, hydrophobic C-terminal isoforms (AB41, AB42, AB43) to shorter, less hydrophobic C-terminal isoforms (AB37, AB38, AB39, AB40). Importantly, moderate and severe CAA displayed minimal isomerization of Asp-1 and Asp-7 residues, which correlated significantly (r > 0.9) with shorter C-terminal isoforms (AB37, AB38, AB39, AB40). These patterns suggest distinct AB aggregation mechanisms in CAA versus parenchymal plaques. We propose that the intact N-terminus found in CAA with limited Asp isomerization is due to its inclusion within the protofibril structure (less disordered and inaccessible to PTMs), unlike the parenchymal plaques, where the N-terminus is more disordered and accessible to PTMs. These biochemical differences may reflect distinct protofibril architectures with potential implications for biomarker development for early CAA detection and therapeutic targeting of vascular and parenchymal AB.

">Directed cell-type recruitment during consolidation of a remote memory</a></h4>

              
                Memories are consolidated into a distributed neocortical network for long-term storage. Long-term memory retrieval relies on cells that are active during learning and undergo necessary plasticity. However, remote memory retrieval activates a broader circuit, with learning-activated cells representing only a small subset. What are the rules and cell-types governing memory trace reorganization? We identified a class of prefrontal projection neurons that are gradually recruited to a memory trace through synaptic activity of learning-activated cells. This population, which projects to the temporal association area (TEa), progressively strengthens its encoding of memory-induced behaviors, mirroring increases in TEa activity. Notably, the prefrontal-TEa pathway is required for remote but not recent memory retrieval. Our findings reveal a cell type-specific mechanism underlying memory trace reorganization during consolidation.

">Astrocytes control motor neuronal mitochondrial axonal transport deficits in C9ORF72 ALS.</a></h4>

              
                Disrupted axonal transport and astrocyte dysfunction are implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we show these are intrinsically linked: human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes carrying the C9ORF72 mutation disrupt axonal transport and mitochondrial function in motor neurons (MNs). Conversely, either isogenic gene-corrected astrocytes or selectively boosting C9ORF72-astrocyte mitochondrial bioenergetics rescue axonal transport deficits in C9ORF72-MNs. Thus, astrocytes have a dominant effect on axonal mitochondrial transport in the context of ALS.

">Problem-solving without a cortex: inferior lobe drives goal-directed object manipulation in cichlid fish</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed object manipulation and problem-solving, which are necessary to evolve tool use behaviors, have long been linked to the expansion of the telencephalon in mammals and birds. Here, we show that goal-directed object manipulation in cichlid fish is driven by a non-telencephalic brain structure, the inferior lobe. Using manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) on an ultra-high field 17.2 Tesla MRI system, we show that the inferior lobe is activated during a puzzle-box opening task. Furthermore, magnetic resonance (MR)-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) lesions profoundly impair fine motor coordination during this task without affecting general locomotion or motivation. These results reveal that cortex-like cognitive functions can arise from non-telencephalic brain structures in teleosts. With no homolog in tetrapods, the inferior lobe is a critical hub for flexible behavior in teleost fish. Our findings highlight the existence of alternative neural architectures for the emergence of complex cognition.

">Challenges in Replay Detection by TDLM in Post-Encoding Resting State</a></h4>

              
                We investigated, using temporally delayed linear modelling (TDLM) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), whether items associated with an underlying graph structure are replayed during a post-learning resting state. In these same data, we have previously provided evidence for replay during on-line (non-rest) memory retrieval. Despite successful decoding of brain activity during a localizer task, and contrary to predictions, we did not detect evidence for replay during a post-learning resting state. To better understand this, we performed a hybrid simulation analysis in which we inserted synthetic replay events into a control resting state recorded prior to the actual experiment. This simulation revealed that replay detection using our current pipeline requires extremely high replay densities to reach significance (>1 replay sequence per second, with "replay" defined as a sequence of reactivations within a certain time lag). Furthermore, when scaling the number of replay events with a behavioural measure we were unable to experimentally induce a strong correlation between sequenceness and this measure. We infer that even if replay was present at plausible rates in our resting state dataset we would lack statistical power to detect it with TDLM. We discuss ways for optimizing the analysis approach and how to find boundary conditions under which TDLM can be expected to detect replay successfully. We conclude that solving these methodological constraints is likely to be crucial to optimise measuring replay non-invasively using MEG in humans.

">Dynamic respiration-neural coupling in substantia nigra across sleep and anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Respiration is increasingly recognized as a coordinator of neural activity across widespread brain regions and behavioral states. Even during sleep, respiration rhythms modulate sleep-related oscillations. While the basal ganglia are known to play roles in both sleep and respiratory regulation, their interaction with respiration rhythms remains poorly understood. Here, we examined respiration-neural couplings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the primary motor cortex (M1) across multiple states in mice, including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, quiet wakefulness, and anesthesia. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) from M1 and SNr along with diaphragm muscle activities revealed state-dependent, region specific patterns of respiration-neural coupling. Coupling strength in both SNr and M1 was attenuated during NREM sleep compared to REM sleep and quiet wakefulness. However, under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, coupling was markedly enhanced in the SNr, but not in M1, indicating region-specific sensitivity to arousal and anesthesia state. Notably, respiration-neural coupling was systematically related to delta sub-band power; coupling strength was reduced with increased slow delta (0.5-2 Hz) and decreased fast delta (2.5-4 Hz) powers. In addition, slow delta was associated with SNr-M1 synchronization, suggesting that inter-regional communication during deep sleep may suppress respiration locking. Together, these findings highlight dynamic, state-dependent modulation of respiration-neural couplings in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, underscoring its potential role in coordinating body-brain interactions during sleep and anesthesia.

">Mapping of individual somatosensory representations - comparison of fMRI and TMS</a></h4>

              
                Invasive brain mapping, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) results indicate that somatosensory representations vary between individuals. However, it is unknown how well somatosensory representations determined using nTMS and fMRI correspond. Here, we used single-pulse nTMS and fMRI in 17 right-handed subjects to determine the S1 representation of the tip of the right index finger stimulated mechanically with a Braille device. In an nTMS mapping experiment, the S1 site at which tactile sensation was blocked by nTMS, was considered the S1 representation site (S1HS) of the fingertip. The location of S1HS varied up to 36 mm between subjects. In the fMRI experiment, passive and oddball tactile tasks were employed. The location of the somatosensory peak fMRI activation varied up to 39 mm between subjects in the passive condition and up to 84 mm in the oddball condition. Within subjects, the mean distance between the S1HS and the peak fMRI activation was 10 + 2 mm (S.E.M.) in the passive condition and 14 + 3 mm in the oddball task. Taken together, our findings underscore the importance of multimodal approaches to brain mapping in future studies.

">Action observation responses in macaque frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons that are active during action execution and action observation (i.e. Action Observation/Execution Neurons, AOENs) are distributed across the brain in a network of parietal, motor, and prefrontal areas. In a previous study, we showed that most AOENs in ventral premotor area F5c, where they were discovered three decades ago, responded in a highly phasic way during the observation of a grasping action, did not require the perception of causality or a meaningful action, and even responded to static frames of the action videos. To assess whether these characteristics are shared with AOENs in other areas of the AOE network, we performed the first large-scale neural recordings during action execution and action observation in multiple frontal areas including dorsal premotor (PMd) area F2, primary motor (M1) cortex, ventral premotor area F5p, frontal eye field (FEF) and 45B. In all areas, AOENs displayed highly phasic responses during specific epochs of the action video and strong responses to simple movements of an object, similar to F5c. In addition, the population dynamics in PMv, PMd and M1 showed a shared representation between action execution and action observation, with an overlap that was as large as the overlap between action execution and passive viewing of simple translation movements. These results pose important constraints on the interpretation of action observation responses in frontal cortical areas.

">Modulation of SLP-2 expression protects against alpha-synuclein neuropathology by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn)-rich aggregates known as Lewy bodies. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key contributor to PD pathology, and mitochondrial defects are part of the pathogenic mechanisms induced by aSyn. Stomatin-Like protein 2 (SLP-2) is a mitochondrial scaffold protein that regulates mitochondrial integrity and function. Here, we investigated whether SLP-2 induction can counteract aSyn-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We found that SLP-2 levels were reduced in human PD brains and an A53T aSyn mouse model. Mild overexpression of SLP-2 improved mitochondrial function, reduced oxidative stress, and prevented aSyn-mitochondria interactions in human iPSC-derived neurons. In vivo, SLP-2 overexpression protected dopaminergic neurons and motor function, while its depletion exacerbated degeneration and motor deficits in both mouse and Drosophila models. These findings suggest SLP-2 as a key regulator of mitochondrial resilience and a potential therapeutic target for PD and alpha-synucleinopathies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In men and women, sex steroid hormones have been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We aimed to investigate the influence of midlife testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels on later-life in vivo markers of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition in clinically healthy older men.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This time-lagged study includes participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation cohort. One hundred fifty-nine men (mean age<sub>PET-scan</sub> = 58 [±/9] years) underwent blood (hormones) collection in 2002 to 2005, and then a single Aβ <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET scan in 2016 to 2020. Linear regressions examined sex-stratified associations among total testosterone, and SHBG with Aβ-PET, and tau-PET after adjusting for age. Separate models examined the moderating effect of Aβ-PET and <i>APOE</i>ε4.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In men, the elevated SHBG level was associated with lower tau-PET in entorhinal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0005], <i>p</i> = 0.007), inferior temporal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.04), and rostral middle frontal regions (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.02). These findings were largely driven by <i>APOE</i>ε4 non-carriers. Testosterone levels were not associated with the Aβ-PET or tau-PET signal.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report a potential protective effect of SHBG levels on tau-PET burden in men. Higher levels of SHBG have been associated with lower risk of vascular-related comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, and is regulated by modifiable lifestyle factors. Given mounting evidence of a link between vascular injury and tauopathy in preclinical AD, our findings suggest an intriguing protective cardiovascular pathway for men against higher tau burden later in life.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Several lines of evidence implicate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in cognitive functions, in mood- and anxiety-related behaviors, and in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants. Augmenting α5-γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor function has shown neurotrophic effects in stress and aged models, but its impact on mouse AHN remains unknown. Adult male 129S6/SvEvTac mice (<i>n</i> = 30 total) were treated for 6 weeks with GL-II-73, an α5-GABAA-R-positive allosteric modulator (α5-PAM) [30 mg/kg, per os, (P.O.)] or fluoxetine, a prototypical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor known to increase AHN (18 mg/kg, P.O.). Proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) was assessed by the level of Ki67, a marker of dividing cells; survival of the young neurons was assessed by retention of the 5-Bromo-2´-Deoxyuridine (BrdU) nucleotide analog injected 2 weeks before sacrifice. Finally, maturation of young adult-born neurons was evaluated by measuring the fraction of BrdU-positive cells that are also DCX and/or NeuN-positive, capturing overall maturation and speed of maturation. Similarly to fluoxetine, a chronic treatment with GL-II-73 stimulated all stages of AHN, significantly increasing neuronal progenitor proliferation, survival of adult-born granule cells, and maturation of young neurons in the DG of the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with GL-II-73, a α5-GABAA-R-positive allosteric modulator, increased AHN, including cellular proliferation, survival, and maturation of newborn neurons, to levels comparable to fluoxetine.</p>

                Mitotic proteins are traditionally studied for their role in chromosome segregation during cell division. However, research increasingly highlights the important non-canonical roles of mitotic proteins beyond mitosis, particularly in the mammalian cerebral cortex. Alterations in the expression levels or mutations of mitotic proteins are increasingly linked to brain disorders such as primary microcephaly and Alzheimer’s disease. A central, unresolved question remains: how do mitotic proteins contribute to neuronal pathogenesis? Here, we review emerging literature on the non-canonical roles of mitotic proteins in mature neurons. Additionally, we discuss how these contribute to the complex mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We also discuss their potential for identifying therapeutic strategies and as biomarkers in brain pathologies.

                Ward and Crawford et al. demonstrate that IL-33 is lost from malignant skin epithelia and that its receptor, ST2, is predominantly expressed on skin Tregs. IL-33/ST2 signals tissue damage to skin Tregs, which promote de novo epithelial development and thus decrease the mutational load and restrain carcinogenesis upon exposure to environmental carcinogens.

                Nasal staphylococci cluster into two stable community state types, dominated by either S. aureus or S. epidermidis, in a Danish and a German cohort. Each type included distinct subclusters defined by co-colonizing staphylococci. S. aureus was reduced when co-occurring with Dolosigranulum and Corynebacterium, highlighting microbial interactions relevant to infection prevention.

                Traveling waves represent patterns of neural activity in the brain. Haigh et al. demonstrate that motor excitability measured with EEG-controlled TMS is dependent on both the location of stimulation and the phase of the neural oscillation. This reveals an important functional relationship between motor excitability and endogenous traveling waves.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Smartphones have become integral to daily life, and their overuse can lead to various maladaptive behaviors and decision-making patterns. This study investigated the neural and computational mechanisms underlying smartphone addiction, focusing on its impact on loss-aversion decision-making. We combined computational models, such as the Drift Diffusion Model, with a novel analytic approach, intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA). Behavioral results showed that higher smartphone addiction symptom (SAS) scores were correlated with reduced loss-aversion (lnλ), while the drift rate was positively associated with SAS. Furthermore, the drift rate mediated the relationship between SAS and lnλ. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that SAS was associated with increased gain-related activity in the occipital pole (OP) but decreased activity in the precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. Additionally, reduced activity was observed in the angular gyrus and superior temporal gyrus during loss processing. IS-RSA further identified brain activation patterns in the default mode network, frontoparietal network, visual network, and sensorimotor network, which corresponded to intersubject variations in SAS, particularly during gain processing but not during loss processing. These patterns were also observed when gains and losses were processed simultaneously. Mediation analyses indicated that brain activation strengths in the OP, precuneus, and MFG during gain processing mediated the relationship between SAS and lnλ and drift rate. Similar mediation effects were observed for intersubject variations in SAS and computational process patterns (eg decision threshold, drift rate, and nondecision time) within these networks. These findings provide novel insights into the neural and computational mechanisms of loss aversion in smartphone addiction, with implications for understanding cognitive biases and informing interventions for addictive behaviors.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two kinds of serious psychiatric disorders. Despite different diagnostic criteria, the patients have significant biologic and clinical overlaps, challenging for the early identification, diagnosis, intervention, and management of these two diseases. Given the limited research on interhemispheric functional connectivity (FC) differences between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, we included 38 schizophrenia patients, 34 bipolar disorder patients and 57 HCs from a publicly available fMRI dataset to investigate it across the whole brain by using voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Correlation analyses were also performed to examine the associations between VMHC values, clinical symptoms, and neuropsychological tests. Our findings revealed that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder shared the functional alteration in the insula, exhibiting decreased VMHC compared to HCs, but the specific regions differed: bipolar disorder demonstrated alternations in the inferior occipital gyrus, while schizophrenia showed changes in the postcentral gyrus. Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showed decreased VMHC relative to HCs. These alterations correlated with clinical symptoms, underscoring the importance of these brain regions in mental diseases. Our research provides new insights into the similarities and differences between the two diseases, suggesting that interhemispheric functional disconnection might critically contribute to the development and maintenance of these psychiatric disorders.</span>

                Background Uterine rupture (UR) remains a major cause of maternal morbidity, especially in low-resource settings. While typically detected during labor, some cases are clinically silent, discovered incidentally during imaging/surgery, highlighting a knowledge gap in risk assessment. In Tunisia, 1.5% of pregnancies involve UR, mostly scar-related. The study aim was to identify factors associated with the development of complete UR in cases that were incidentally found during pregnancy or delivery. Methods This was retrospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted over an eleven-year period, from January 2014 to December 2024, at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics department B, Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. Asymptomatic UR cases (complete/incomplete) were analysed to compare clinical profiles, identify risk factors, and assess maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results A total of 41 cases of asymptomatic UR were included, which accounted for an average of 50% of the UR cases. In a cohort comparing complete UR cases (N=27) and incomplete UR cases (N=14), significant differences in duration of pregnancy and labor were found. The mean gestational age was longer in the incomplete UR group (p=0.03), and the duration of labor was also significantly longer (p=0.006). No significant differences were observed in sociodemographic characteristics, quality of prenatal care, or complications such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. Nonsignificant factors included pregnancy interval, scars number and labor stagnation. The analysis showed two significant predictors of complete UR outcomes. Prolonged labor (>220 minutes) was strongly associated with increased odds of complete UR (OR=45.231, 95% CI=2.591-789.486, p=0.009) and lower maternal weight (<68 kg) correlated with reduced odds of incomplete UR (OR=0.033, 95% CI=0.001–0.837, p=0.039), suggesting a protective effect per kilogram decrease. Conclusion Findings redefine UR as part of a broader clinical spectrum, not just an acute complication, enabling tailored surveillance and improved prevention in high-risk pregnancies.

                Background Many graduates are unprepared for the workforce because of the abysmal increase in unemployment rates. While academics have tried to incorporate employable skills into curricula, graduates must understand social and humanitarian principles to meet globalization demands. This study investigated how service-learning influences the prosocial skills of economics undergraduate pre-service teachers and its impact on their future employment prospects. Method We adopted a mixed-method design of the sequential explanatory approach. A purposive random sampling technique was used to select 150 pre-service teachers (300 and 400 level) from five departments in the Faculty of Education at the University of Ibadan offering economics. A convenience sampling technique was used to sample 10 students for focus group discussions, who served as team leaders in service-learning courses. The Students’ Prosocial and Professional Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.79) and a Focus Group Discussion Guide were used for data collection. Quantitative data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and paired sample t-test at significance level of 0.05, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The mean scores for the constructs were communication skills (2.61), teamwork (2.45), empathy (2.35), culture (2.30) and social responsibility (2.50). The mean for communication skills increased significantly from 2.61 before the intervention to 3.35. The reduction in the standard deviation indicates that the communication skills of pre-service teachers have become more consistent and prominent (F=24.87), confirming the statistical significance of these improvements. Similar improvements were observed in teamwork skills, with the mean score rising from 2.62 before intervention to 3.36 and statistically significant (F=9.71). Conclusion The undergraduate students had low overall prosocial ability scores, indicating a lack of prosocial competencies essential for effective teaching and professional success in education. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the value of service learning and support its integration into teacher education programs through funding, resources, and institutional encouragement.

                Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease of high prevalence worldwide. It usually coexists with chondyslipidemia, obesity and hypertension and can present complications such as peripheral neuropathy and nephropathy. Method Retrospective cohort study of 441 patients with diabetes mellitus 2. Medical records were reviewed to obtain the variables under study. All patients of both sexes treated between July 2023 and November 2024 in a primary care hospital were included and patients on predialysis or dialysis, total or partial lower limb amputation, and sequelae of cerebrovascular disease were excluded. Logistic regression analysis was used. Results Among the signs of DN, anhidrosis and mycosis predominated in patients of both sexes, and among the symptoms, burning, prickling and leg pain when walking. The majority of patients with neuropathy are between 60 and 79 years of age, female, have hypertension, have a disease duration of 12.83 ± 8.73 years, Hb1Ac of 7.67% ±1.69, glucose of 153.93 ± 66.17 and hemoglobin of 12.98 ± 1.39. Most patients have CKD G1 and G2. The Chi-square test indicates only relationship between age group, sex and stages. In the quantitative analysis, the Krustall Wallis test indicates that there are significant differences in patient stages according to age, time of disease and HbA1c. Conclusions G1 and G2 stages, female sex and hypertension predominated in patients with CKD. The older the patient and the longer the time with diabetes, the higher the CKD stage. There is a relationship with age group, sex and CKD stages. Age < 79 years and the absence of hypertension are protective factors for the progression of CKD and male sex is considered a risk factor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-582/v1?src=rss">The Limits of AI in Understanding Emotions: Challenges in Bridging Human Experience and Machine Perception [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This article explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace the human factor in the analysis of emotions within financial decision-making contexts. The background of this study is as follows: growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence for text analysis, understanding its capacity to detect emotional patterns is particularly relevant in fields where emotional dynamics significantly influence behavior, such as trading. Method Our research method is based on a three-day trading experiment involving students, during which participants made decisions under conditions of uncertainty. At the end of the experiment, each participant wrote a free-form report describing their emotional experience. We applied four different Artificial Intelligence tools to analyze these texts and compared the results with those obtained through a traditional lexical analysis method. AI tools provided relatively consistent and coherent assessments of the general emotional tone in the texts. Results Our results suggest that they successfully identified dominant emotions such as fear, disappointment, and hope. However, the ability of Artificial Intelligence to detect more nuanced or mixed emotional states was limited. In contrast, traditional lexical analysis offered greater sensitivity to emotional complexity. Although both approaches converged on broad emotional tendencies, divergences appeared when addressing subtle or context-specific emotional shifts. Our findings suggest that AI can serve as a useful preliminary tool in the analysis of emotions in written texts, especially for identifying dominant patterns. Conclusion In conclusion, according to us, due to its limitations in detecting emotional nuances, Artificial Intelligence should be integrated into a hybrid analytical approach. Combining Artificial Intelligence with traditional or human-led analysis enhances both the precision and depth of interpretation. We argue that a hybrid model avoids the oversimplification of emotional data and better reflects the complexity of emotional dynamics in decision-making under uncertainty.

                The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) is a modulator of lipid metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCD1 plays in health and disease can provide novel insides in therapeutic targets, a process that would be facilitated by the availability of high-quality antibodies. Here we have characterized nine SCD1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                <p>by Ismael Jaras, Marcos E. Orchard, Pedro E. Maldonado, Rodrigo C. Vergara</p>

Understanding the intricate interplay between neural dynamics and metabolic constraints is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of the brain. Despite the significance of this relationship, specific details concerning the impact of metabolism on neuronal dynamics and neural network architecture remain elusive, creating a notable gap in the existing literature. This study employs an energy-dependent neuron and plasticity model to analyze the role of local metabolic constraints in shaping both the dynamics and structure of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Specifically, an energy-dependent version of the leaky integrate-and-fire model is utilized, along with a three-factor learning rule that incorporates postsynaptic available energy as the third factor. These models allow for fine-tuning sensitivity in the presence of energy imbalances. Analytical expressions predicting the network’s activity and structure are derived, and a fixed point analysis reveals the emergence of attractor states characterized by neuronal and synaptic sensitivity to energy imbalances. Analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations using an excitatory-inhibitory network. Furthermore, these simulations enable the study of SNN activity and structure under conditions simulating metabolic impairment. In conclusion, by employing energy-dependent models with adjustable sensitivity to energy imbalances, our study advances the understanding of how metabolic constraints shape SNN dynamics and structure. Moreover, in light of compelling evidence linking neuronal metabolic impairment to neurodegenerative diseases, the incorporation of local metabolic constraints into the investigation of neuronal network structure and activity opens an intriguing avenue for inspiring the development of therapeutic interventions.

                <p>by Wentao Ma, Chunwu Yu</p>

Modern cell membranes are primarily composed of phospholipids, while primitive cell membranes in the beginning of life are believed to have formed from simpler lipids (such as fatty acids) synthesized in the prebiotic environment. An attractive experimental study suggested that the corresponding “membrane-takeover” (as an evolutionary process) is likely to have occurred very early (e.g., in the RNA world) due to some simple physical effects, and might have subsequently triggered some other evolutionary processes. Here, via computer modeling on a system of RNA-based protocells, we convinced the plausibility of such a scenario and elaborated on relevant mechanisms. It is shown that in protocells with a fatty-acid membrane, because of the benefit of phospholipid content (i.e., stabilizing the membrane), a ribozyme favoring the synthesis of phospholipids may emerge; subsequently, due to the reduced membrane permeability on account of the phospholipid content, two other functional RNA species could arise: a ribozyme exploiting more fundamental materials (thus more permeable) for nucleotide synthesis and a species favoring across-membrane transportation. This case exemplifies a combination of experimental and theoretical efforts regarding early evolution, which may shed light on that notoriously complicated problem: the origin of life.

Using cross-species epigenomic profiling and rodent models, they show that astrocytic ZBTB7A reshapes neuronal activity and behavior following stress, revealing a glial-mediated epigenetic mechanism of depression vulnerability.

                Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) are rarely elicited in HIV-1 infection. Transient deletion of glycans surrounding the CD4bs in simian-human immunodeficiency viruses markedly enhanced the induction of CD4bs bNAbs in infected macaques by immunofocusing early B cell responses and guiding their affinity maturation.

                Davidson et al. show that cohesin negatively supercoils DNA. In vitro, this process depends on the same DNA-binding sites and co-factors as cohesin’s loop-extrusion activity, and a cohesin mutant defective in negative supercoiling forms shorter loops in cells. These results indicate that cohesin supercoils DNA during loop extrusion.

Although this speed limit appears to hold for high-level cognitive functions, we argue that unconscious processing for real-time control of movement, which occupies a majority of neurons in the central nervous system and accounts for most of the information throughput of humans, substantially exceeds this limit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89616">Fingertip viscoelasticity enables human tactile neurons to encode loading history alongside current force</a></h4>

              
                Human skin and its underlying tissues constitute a viscoelastic medium, implying that any deformation depends not only on the currently applied force, but also on the recent loading history. The extent to which this physical memory influences the signaling of first-order tactile neurons during natural hand use is not well understood. Here, we examined the effect of past loading on the responses of fast-adapting (FA-1) and slowly-adapting (SA-1 and SA-2) first-order tactile neurons innervating the human fingertip to loadings applied in different directions representative of object manipulation tasks. We found that variation in the preceding loading affected neurons’ overall signaling of force direction. Some neurons kept signaling the current direction, while others signaled both the current and preceding direction, or even primarily the preceding direction. In addition, ongoing impulse activity in SA-2 neurons between loadings signaled information related to the fingertip’s viscoelastic deformation state. We conclude that tactile neurons at the population level signal continuous information about the fingertip’s viscoelastic deformation state, which is shaped by both its recent history and current loading. Such information might be sufficient for the brain to correctly interpret current force loading and help in computing accurate motor commands for interactions with objects in manipulation and haptic tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98469">Artificial intelligence approaches for tumor phenotype stratification from single-cell transcriptomic data</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with robust computational analysis facilitates the characterization of phenotypic heterogeneity within tumors. Current scRNA-seq analysis pipelines are capable of identifying a myriad of malignant and non-malignant cell subtypes from single-cell profiling of tumors. However, given the extent of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, it is challenging to assess the risk associated with individual cell subpopulations, primarily due to the complexity of the cancer phenotype space and the lack of clinical annotations associated with tumor scRNA-seq studies. To this end, we introduce SCellBOW, a scRNA-seq analysis framework inspired by document embedding techniques from the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). SCellBOW is a novel computational approach that facilitates effective identification and high-quality visualization of single-cell subpopulations. We compared SCellBOW with existing best practice methods for its ability to precisely represent phenotypically divergent cell types across multiple scRNA-seq datasets, including our in-house generated human splenocyte and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) dataset. For tumor cells, SCellBOW estimates the relative risk associated with each cluster and stratifies them based on their aggressiveness. This is achieved by simulating how the presence or absence of a specific cell subpopulation influences disease prognosis. Using SCellBOW, we identified a hitherto unknown and pervasive AR−/NE<sub>low</sub> (androgen-receptor-negative, neuroendocrine-low) malignant subpopulation in metastatic prostate cancer with conspicuously high aggressiveness. Overall, the risk-stratification capabilities of SCellBOW hold promise for formulating tailored therapeutic interventions by identifying clinically relevant tumor subpopulations and their impact on prognosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90387">Precise spatial tuning of visually driven alpha oscillations in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillations at about 10 Hz, called alpha oscillations, are often thought to arise from synchronous activity across the occipital cortex and are usually largest when the cortex is inactive. However, recent studies measuring visual receptive fields have reported that local alpha power increases when cortex is excited by visual stimulation. This contrasts with the expectation that alpha oscillations are associated with cortical inactivity. Here, we used intracranial electrodes in human patients to measure alpha oscillations in response to visual stimuli whose location varied systematically across the visual field. We hypothesized that stimulus-driven local increases in alpha power result from a mixture of two effects: a reduction in alpha oscillatory power and a simultaneous increase in broadband power. To test this, we implemented a model to separate these components. The two components were then independently fit by population receptive field (pRF) models. We find that the alpha pRFs have similar center locations to pRFs estimated from broadband power but are several times larger and exhibit the opposite effect: alpha oscillatory power decreases in response to stimuli within the receptive field, reinforcing the link between alpha oscillations and cortical inactivity, whereas broadband power increases. The results demonstrate that alpha suppression in the human visual cortex can be precisely tuned, but that to measure these effects, it is essential to separate the oscillatory signal from broadband power changes. Finally, we show how the large size and the negative valence of alpha pRFs can explain key features of exogenous visual attention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98777">A multiplex of connectome trajectories enables several connectivity patterns in parallel</a></h4>

              
                Complex brain function comprises a multitude of neural operations in parallel and often at different speeds. Each of these operations is carried out across a network of distributed brain regions. How multiple distributed processes are facilitated in parallel is largely unknown. We postulate that such processing relies on a multiplex of dynamic network patterns emerging in parallel but from different functional connectivity (FC) timescales. Given the dominance of inherently slow fMRI in network science, it is unknown whether the brain leverages such multi-timescale network dynamics. We studied FC dynamics concurrently across a breadth of timescales (from infraslow to γ-range) in rare, simultaneously recorded intracranial EEG and fMRI in humans, and source-localized scalp EEG-fMRI data in humans. We examined spatial and temporal convergence of connectome trajectories across timescales. ‘Spatial convergence’ refers to spatially similar EEG and fMRI connectome patterns, while ‘temporal convergence’ signifies the more specific case of spatial convergence at corresponding timepoints in EEG and fMRI. We observed spatial convergence but temporal divergence across FC timescales; connectome states (recurrent FC patterns) with partial spatial similarity were found in fMRI and all EEG frequency bands, but these occurred asynchronously across FC timescales. Our findings suggest that hemodynamic and frequency-specific electrophysiological signals, while involving similar large-scale networks, represent functionally distinct connectome trajectories that operate at different FC speeds and in parallel. This multiplex is poised to enable concurrent connectivity across multiple sets of brain regions independently.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100497">BCAS2 promotes primitive hematopoiesis by sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2), a core component of the hPrP19 complex, plays crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. However, whether BCAS2 has functions other than being a key RNA-splicing regulator within the nucleus remains unknown. Here, we show that BCAS2 is essential for primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish and mouse embryos. The activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is required for hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, is significantly decreased upon depletion of <i>bcas2</i> in zebrafish embryos and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, BCAS2 deﬁciency has no obvious impact on the splicing efficiency of β-catenin pre-mRNA, while significantly attenuating β-catenin nuclear accumulation. Moreover, we find that BCAS2 directly binds to β-catenin via its coiled-coil domains, thereby sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus. Thus, our results uncover a previously unknown function of BCAS2 in promoting Wnt signaling by enhancing β-catenin nuclear retention during primitive hematopoiesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91582">Neural substrates of cold nociception in Drosophila larva</a></h4>

              
                Metazoans detect and differentiate between innocuous (non-painful) and/or noxious (harmful) environmental cues using primary sensory neurons, which serve as the first node in a neural network that computes stimulus-specific behaviors to either navigate away from injury-causing conditions or to perform protective behaviors that mitigate extensive injury. The ability of an animal to detect and respond to various sensory stimuli depends upon molecular diversity in the primary sensors and the underlying neural circuitry responsible for the relevant behavioral action selection. Recent studies in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae have revealed that somatosensory class III multidendritic (CIII md) neurons function as multimodal sensors regulating distinct behavioral responses to innocuous mechanical and nociceptive thermal stimuli. Recent advances in circuit bases of behavior have identified and functionally validated <i>Drosophila</i> larval somatosensory circuitry involved in innocuous (mechanical) and noxious (heat and mechanical) cues. However, central processing of cold nociceptive cues remained unexplored. We implicate multisensory integrators (Basins), premotor (Down-and-Back), and projection (A09e and TePns) neurons as neural substrates required for cold-evoked behavioral and calcium responses. Neural silencing of cell types downstream of CIII md neurons led to significant reductions in cold-evoked behaviors, and neural co-activation of CIII md neurons plus additional cell types facilitated larval contraction (CT) responses. Further, we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of CIII md neurons evokes calcium increases in these neurons. Finally, we characterize the premotor to motor neuron network underlying cold-evoked CT and delineate the muscular basis of CT response. Collectively, we demonstrate how <i>Drosophila</i> larvae process cold stimuli through functionally diverse somatosensory circuitry responsible for generating stimulus-specific behaviors.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The prevailing irregular pattern of field potentials is little used due to the uncertain origin and identity of the source populations. After recovering clean source-specific dynamics (field potential-generators) in multiple brain areas of anesthetized rats we explored if they contain temporal identity features and to what extent they remain upon blending in the volume (raw field potentials). Relevant factors and mechanisms were further explored through a feed-forward model of field potentials. Signals were characterized with a multivariate set of statistical, spectral and nonlinear measures and explored with machine-learning classifiers. Despite the strong variability of electrographic patterns, field potential generators exhibit unique temporal signatures that allow their discrimination. Signatures are contained in 1 to 5 s segments in any given brain region and are robust across groups of animals. In contrast, the spatial overlap of sources and the contribution by remote potentials cause indeterminacy of raw field potentials, making them approach a noisy behavior. The so revealed source-specific signatures contain spectral and nonlinear features, thus overcoming the traditional notion of waves and frequency bands. We propose that besides upstream dynamics cytoarchitectural factors of the source population contribute to these unique signatures. These findings pave the way to utilize the vast reserve of information contained in irregular field potentials.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Adaptive decision-making requires consideration of risks and rewards associated with each option, as well as subjective preference for risky/safe alternatives. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) contributes to both reward and punishment processing as well as cost/benefit decision-making, but its role in punishment-driven risky decision-making remains unclear. To address this, we trained male rats in the Risky Decision-making Task, wherein subjects chose between a small, safe reward and a large reward with either 0% or 50% risk of foot shock punishment. We then recorded single unit activity in LOFC during task performance to determine how LOFC activity signals risky vs. safe options and choices. We observed that lOFC activity encodes risk in the environment prior to decision-making, then encodes reward magnitude independent of risk during action selection. Machine learning models revealed that lOFC activity accurately predicts risk but less effectively predicts impending choice, although integrating the outcome of the previous trial improved the accuracy of choice prediction. Finally, risk-preferring subjects demonstrated reduced encoding of risk and increased encoding of reward magnitude. This suggests that lOFC serves as a central hub wherein environmental information about risk and reward converges with internal, subjective information to guide risky decision-making.</span>

                <p>Regardless of discipline, quantitative literacy is a critical component of any scientist's skill set. A recent push from the NINDS has focused on enhancing and maintaining this expertise in trainees to enhance scientific fluency and to combat the reproducibility crisis. T32-funded programs often include off-campus retreats, providing opportunities to integrate a quantitative literacy component, or thematic focus. Here we will discuss the lessons and considerations learned from organizing a retreat focused on quantitative aspects of diagnostics for spinal cord injury. Survey results regarding retreat events and workshops reveal elements that were perceived to be successful by attendees. Events developed with active learning that focused on collaborative problem-solving and cross-discipline quantitative measures were well received by trainees. On the other hand, lectures and panel discussions were found to be less effective in boosting long-lasting improvements in quantitative literacy. Taken as a whole, these experiences from incorporating quantitative literacy into a T32 retreat offer strategies to consider when designing coursework or events focusing on this topic.</p>

                <p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) receive synaptic input from a diverse range of neurons in the developing and adult brain. Understanding whether the neuronal populations that synapse with OPCs in the healthy brain is altered by demyelination and/or remyelination may support the advancement of neuroprotective or myelin repair strategies being developed for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. To explore this possibility, we employed cre-lox transgenic technology to facilitate the infection of OPCs by a modified rabies virus, enabling the retrograde monosynaptic tracing of neuron-&gt;OPC connectivity. In the healthy adult mouse, OPCs in the corpus callosum primarily received synaptic input from ipsilateral cortical neurons. Of the cortical neurons, ~50% were layer V pyramidal cells. Cuprizone demyelination reduced the total number of labeled neurons. However, the frequency/kinetics of mini-excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded from OPCs appeared preserved. Of particular interest, demyelination increased the number of labeled layer II/III pyramidal neurons and also increased at the expense of layer V pyramidal neurons, a change that was largely ameliorated by remyelination. These data suggest that in the healthy adult mouse brain, callosal OPCs primarily receive synaptic input from cortical layer V pyramidal neurons. However, callosal demyelination is associated with a population switch and OPCs equally synapse with layer II/III and V pyramidal neurons to synapse with OPCs, until myelin is restored.</p>

                Background Writing a medication prescription is a multifaceted skill expected of all junior doctors. However, many medical students feel a lack of preparedness and confidence after graduation. Separating the teaching of practical and clinical components may enhance understanding of the practical skills prior to integrating clinical knowledge to complete a prescription. This study aimed to: (1) assess whether pharmacist-led multimodal education interventions change the prescribing skills of Australian final-year medical students, (2) evaluate knowledge retention a year later in the same participants as junior doctors, and (3) determine whether there is an association between self-perceived confidence to prescribe and their practical ability to write safe and legal prescriptions. This manuscript details the methods used in this novel longitudinal study. Methods This non-randomised pre-post longitudinal study will be conducted in two phases. The control group received standard curriculum-based education. The intervention was pharmacist-led multimodal education on prescription writing skills for final-year medical students. The intervention group completed the pre-post and follow-up tests. This study was approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H9114). Discussion This paper presents the methods and protocol of an approved and funded non-randomised longitudinal study to investigate the potential of pharmacist educators to improve prescribing knowledge and skills among final-year medical students in Australia. Prescribing skills education for medical students may reduce the probability of potentially incorrect or unsafe prescribing habits as junior doctors. Education standards do not acknowledge adherence to local legal regulations when prescribing and do not recommend mandatory teaching or assessment criteria. This study will review the effectiveness of and need for additional education on the practical skill of writing a medication prescription. If positive, the findings of this study will have practical and policy impacts that may result in long-term improvement in safe medicine practice and ultimately benefit patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-458/v2?src=rss">Internal and external risk factors analysis on pilot precondition in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Pilot errors and preconditions are major concerns that affected by multiple factors physiologically, psychologically and psychosocially. This study aimed to analyse the correlation between the internal and external risk factors, and pilot preconditions in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with purposive sampling, directed to male pilots who had flight duty in the past seven days, underwent medical examination at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, August 12–16, 2024. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire, Trail Making Test A and B, laboratory tests (plasma lipid, fasting blood glucose), and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure). The independent variables divided into internal factors (Age, Burnout, Metabolic Syndrome parameters); and external factors (Flight Time, Duty Time, Unscheduled Flight Duty, Number of Sectors, Sleep Duration). The dependent variables were pilot preconditions based on the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Results A total of 122 participants participated and 28.7% had an Unscheduled Flight Duty in the last 30 days. Significant correlations were found between Adverse Mental State and HDL-Cholesterol (95%CI=1.52–5.80), Adverse Physiological State and Burnout [Personal (95%CI=0.005–0,04), Work-Related (95%CI=0.009–0.042)], Physical Mental Limitation and Fasting Blood Glucose (95%CI=(-0.479)–(-0.071)), Number of Sectors (95%CI=0.022–3.001). For Personal Readiness (PR), significant correlation was found between PR-Psychological Demand and Flight-Time One Year (95%CI=(0.000–0.001), Sleep Duration (95%CI=(-0.137)–(-0.013)), Waist Circumference (95%CI=(-0.014)–(-0.002)), PR-Social Support and Sleep Duration (95%IK=0.018–0.207), Client-Related Burnout (95%IK=(-0.011)–(-0.002)). Conclusions The internal factors that correlated with pilot preconditions in Indonesia were Waist Circumference, HDL-Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Glucose, Personal Burnout, Work, and Client-related burnout. External factors that correlated with pilot preconditions were the Number of Sectors, Flight-Time One Year and Sleep duration. These findings emphasize the need to address physical and mental health aspects of pilots to enhance aviation safety.

                <p>by Nuray Sogunmez Erdogan, Deniz Eroglu</p>

Mapping cell distributions across spatial locations with whole-genome coverage is essential for understanding cellular responses and signaling However, current deconvolution models aim to estimate the proportions of distinct cell types in each spatial transcriptomics spot by integrating reference single-cell data. These models often assume strong overlap between the reference and spatial datasets, neglecting biology-grounded constraints such as sparsity and cell-type variations, as well as technical sparsity. As a result, these methods rely on over-permissive algorithms that ignore given constraints leading to inaccurate predictions, particularly in heterogeneous or unmatched datasets. We introduce Weight-Induced Sparse Regression (WISpR), a machine learning algorithm that integrates spot-specific hyperparameters and sparsity-driven modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that neglect biology-grounded constraints, WISpR accurately predicts cell-type distributions while preserving biological coherence, i.e., spatially and functionally consistent cell-type localization, even in unmatched datasets. Benchmarking against five alternative methods across ten datasets, WISpR consistently outperformed competitors and predicted cellular landscapes in both normal and cancerous tissues. By leveraging sparse cell-type arrangements, WISpR provides biologically informed, high-resolution cellular maps. Its ability to decode tissue organization in both healthy and diseased states highlights WISpR’s practical utility for spatial transcriptomics, particularly in challenging settings involving noise, sparsity, or reference mismatches.

The success of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases such as COVID-19 has opened new avenues for their application in oncology. In cancer immunotherapy, mRNA vaccines—typically encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) 100–200 nm in size—enable delivery of tumor-specific antigens to activate immune responses. Here, we investigated the efficacy of mRNA vaccines in cancer by modeling tumor-immune interactions and tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics to identify predictive biomarkers. Using a mechanistic mathematical model, we simulated tumor growth, immune cell dynamics, and vaccine pharmacokinetics in virtual cohorts of 1,635 patients generated via Latin hypercube sampling. Our simulations demonstrated a 45% average tumor size reduction and a 60% increase in CD8 + T cell infiltration in responsive tumors. Multiple regression analyses validated the predictive power of both pre- and on-treatment biomarkers. Key predictors of vaccine efficacy included antigen-presenting cell (APC) density and cytotoxic T cell fraction. Specifically, an APC density above 500 cells/mm³ in lymph nodes correlated with a 55% increase in vaccine response rates, while a cytotoxic T cell fraction above 20% in tumors was associated with a 60% reduction in tumor volume. A reduced M2/M1 macrophage ratio further improved treatment outcomes by 50%, highlighting the role of reprograming immunosuppressive macrophages. TME characteristics significantly influenced vaccine efficacy. Low extracellular matrix (ECM) density—modeled as a 5–10 × increase in hydraulic conductivity—combined with medium cytokine levels (IL-2 and TNF-α at 10–50 pg/ml), created optimal conditions for immune activation. Under these conditions, vaccine uptake improved by 35% and cytotoxic T cell infiltration increased by 65%, resulting in up to a 50% improvement in therapeutic outcomes. Model predictions aligned with pre-clinical data from melanoma and breast cancer models. These findings provide a framework for optimizing mRNA vaccine strategies and advancing personalized cancer immunotherapy.

                <p>by Karoline Horgmo Jæger, Aslak Tveito</p>

During each heartbeat, a voltage wave propagates through the cardiac muscle, triggering action potentials in approximately two billion cardiomyocytes. This electrical activity ensures the coordinated contraction of the heart, which is essential for its pumping function. A key event in this process is the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the cell membrane, allowing calcium ions to enter the cardiac dyad and triggering a large-scale release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. This process is fundamental to cardiac function because calcium subsequently binds to troponin, initiating the conformational changes necessary for myofilament contraction. The cardiac dyad is characterized by a very small volume with steep ionic concentration gradients, which is challenging for detailed mathematical modeling. Traditionally, the dyadic calcium concentration has been approximated using spatially averaged values or modeled with reaction-diffusion equations. However, at the nanometer (nm) and nanosecond (ns) scales, such approximations may be insufficient. At this resolution, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system provides a detailed continuous representation of the underlying electrodiffusion dynamics. Here, we present a nano-scale computational model, representing dyad dynamics using the PNP system. Potassium, sodium, and calcium channels are incorporated in the cell membrane, along with the sodium-calcium exchanger. We demonstrate the formation of the Debye layer in the resting state and highlight how both diffusive and electrical effects are required to maintain this equilibrium. Additionally, we show that cross-species ion interactions in the dyad are electrical, and that diffusion models fail to capture this effect. Finally, we illustrate how the dyad width and diffusion coefficient influence local ionic concentrations and the timing of calcium arrival at the ryanodine receptors. These results provide new insights into the electrodiffusive properties of the dyad and clarify when solving the full PNP system is necessary for accurate modeling.

Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) is a versatile tool to quantify cell-exerted forces by imaging and tracking fiduciary markers embedded in elastic substrates. The computations involved in TFM are often ill-conditioned, and data smoothing or regularization is required to avoid overfitting the noise in the tracked displacements. Most TFM calculations depend critically on the heuristic selection of regularization (hyper-) parameters affecting the balance between overfitting and smoothing. However, TFM methods rarely estimate or account for measurement errors in substrate deformation to adjust the regularization level accordingly. Moreover, there is a lack of tools for uncertainty quantification (UQ) to understand how these errors propagate to the recovered traction stresses. These limitations make it difficult to interpret the TFM readouts and hinder comparing different experiments. This manuscript presents an uncertainty-aware TFM technique that estimates the variability in the magnitude and direction of the traction stress vector recovered at each point in space and time of each experiment. In this technique, a non-parametric bootstrap method perturbs the cross-correlation functional of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to assess the uncertainty of the measured deformation. This information is passed on to a hierarchical Bayesian TFM framework with spatially adaptive regularization that propagates the uncertainty to the traction stress readouts (TFM-UQ). We evaluate TFM-UQ using synthetic datasets with prescribed image quality variations and demonstrate its application to experimental datasets. These studies show that TFM-UQ bypasses the need for subjective regularization parameter selection and locally adapts smoothing, outperforming traditional regularization methods. They also illustrate how uncertainty-aware TFM tools can be used to objectively choose key image analysis parameters like PIV window size. We anticipate that these tools will allow for decoupling biological heterogeneity from measurement variability and facilitate automating the analysis of large datasets by parameter-free, input data-based regularization.

Understanding synaptic dynamics during the sleep–wake cycle in the cortex is crucial yet remains controversial. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY) suggests synaptic depression during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while other studies report synaptic potentiation or synaptic changes during NREM sleep depending on activities in wakefulness. To find boundary conditions between these contradictory observations, we focused on learning rules and firing patterns that contribute to the synaptic dynamics. Using computational models considering mammalian cortical neurons, we found that under Hebbian and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), wake-like firing patterns decrease synaptic weights, while sleep-like patterns strengthen synaptic weights. We refer to this tendency as Wake Inhibition and Sleep Excitation (WISE). Conversely, under Anti-Hebbian and Anti-STDP, synaptic depression during NREM sleep was observed, aligning with the conventional synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. Moreover, synaptic changes depended on firing rate differences between NREM sleep and wakefulness. We provide a unified framework that could explain synaptic homeodynamics under the sleep–wake cycle.

Diffuse large B cell lymphomas and follicular lymphomas show recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators; among these are loss-of-function mutations in KMT2D and gain-of-function mutations in EZH2. To systematically explore the effects of these mutations on the wiring of the epigenetic network, we applied a single-cell approach to probe a wide array of histone modifications. We show that mutant-EZH2 elicits extensive effects on the epigenome of lymphomas, beyond alterations to H3K27 methylations, and is epistatic over KMT2D mutations. Utilizing the single-cell data, we present computational methods to measure epigenetic heterogeneity. We identify an unexpected characteristic of mutant-EZH2, but not KMT2D, in increasing heterogeneity, shedding light on a novel oncogenic mechanism mediated by this mutation. Finally, we present tools to reconstruct known interactions within the epigenetic network, as well as reveal potential novel cross talk between various modifications, supported by functional perturbations. Our work highlights novel roles for mutant-EZH2 in lymphomagenesis and establishes new concepts for measuring epigenetic heterogeneity and intra-chromatin connectivity in cancer cells.

Bacteria produce a plethora of natural products that are in clinical, agricultural and biotechnological use. Genome mining has uncovered millions of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode their biosynthesis, the vast majority of them lacking a clear product or function. Thus, a major challenge is to predict the bioactivities of the molecules these BGCs specify, and how to elicit their expression. Here, we present an innovative strategy whereby we harness the power of regulatory networks combined with global gene expression patterns to predict BGC functions. Bioinformatic analysis of all genes predicted to be controlled by the iron master regulator DmdR1 combined with co-expression data, led to identification of the novel operon <i>desJGH</i> that plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the iron overload drug desferrioxamine (DFO) B in <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>. Deletion of either <i>desG</i> or <i>desH</i> strongly reduces the biosynthesis of DFO B, while that of DFO E is enhanced. DesJGH most likely act by changing the balance between the DFO precursors. Our work shows the power of harnessing regulation-based genome mining to functionally prioritize BGCs, accelerating the discovery of novel bioactive molecules.

Defining the subset of cellular factors governing SARS-CoV-2 replication can provide critical insights into viral pathogenesis and identify targets for host-directed antiviral therapies. While a number of genetic screens have previously reported SARS-CoV-2 host dependency factors, most of these approaches relied on utilizing pooled genome-scale CRISPR libraries, which are biased toward the discovery of host proteins impacting early stages of viral replication. To identify host factors involved throughout the SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle, we conducted an arrayed genome-scale siRNA screen. Resulting data were integrated with published functional screens and proteomics data to reveal (i) common pathways that were identified in all OMICs datasets—including regulation of Wnt signaling and gap junctions, (ii) pathways uniquely identified in this screen—including NADH oxidation, or (iii) pathways supported by this screen and proteomics data but not published functional screens—including arachionate production and MAPK signaling. The identified proviral host factors were mapped into the SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle, including 32 proteins that were determined to impact viral replication and 27 impacting late stages of infection, respectively. Additionally, a subset of proteins was tested across other coronaviruses revealing a subset of proviral factors that were conserved across pandemic SARS-CoV-2, epidemic SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and the seasonal coronavirus OC43-CoV. Further studies illuminated a role for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and found that inhibition of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway through targeting of BIRC2 restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication both in vitro and in vivo. These studies provide critical insight into the landscape of virus–host interactions driving SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as valuable targets for host-directed antivirals.

     alt="Neural Repertoire Behind the World's Most Complex Retina: Neuroanatomy of the Stomatopod Lamina"/>
<p>The lamina behind the complex retina of mantis shrimp is highly conserved between eye regions and species and is similar to crustaceans and distinct from insects. Midband cartridges connect along columns, providing a neural basis for the unique scanning behavior of stomatopods.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The lamina is the first optic neuropil and visual information integration station in crustaceans and insects, containing synaptic connections between photoreceptors and first-order interneurons. The lamina circuitry in mantis shrimp (stomatopods) is both interesting and complex, as there are 16 different types of photoreceptors contained within the mid-band region of the eye. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we have reconstructed photoreceptor terminals and lamina interneurons in two major superfamilies with different visual ecologies. Neurons follow the same general pattern as other crustaceans but with notable differences in gross anatomy from insects. The photoreceptors form bulbous terminals in the lamina, following the same overall connectivity pattern in all lamina cartridges across species examined and eye regions. The photoreceptor terminals themselves appear to be complex, with many large mitochondria, a notable difference between insects and stomatopods. Connectivity between photoreceptors and interneurons, as well as cross-cartridge connections, is estimated based on neuronal overlap. Lamina monopolar cells follow previous research in stomatopods and crustaceans, with a set of common neuron types that may provide the beginning of an opponency circuit. Additionally, neurons that extend beyond their parent cartridge in the midband show a preference for branching between rows within the same visual column of cells, as well as some connections within the same row. This added complexity suggests that the stomatopod lamina performs a unique processing of visual signals versus other crustaceans and insects and provides further evidence for the emerging hypotheses around the processing of information by the scanning visual system of stomatopods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27292?af=R">α‐Synuclein‐Related Mitochondria‐Nrf2 Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease Olfactory Mucosa</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to outline the dynamics of the mitochondrial network and cytoprotective response in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)-derived olfactory mucosa neurons (ONs) at different disease stages.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ONs obtained by nasal brush from 41 well-phenotyped patients with PD (n = 24 PD de novo [PD<sup>dn</sup>] and n = 17 under treatment [PD<sup>tr</sup>]) and 29 healthy controls were examined through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and Western blot. An integrative set of experiments using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells was also performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD ONs accumulated α-synuclein oligomers in association with an aberrant subcellular distribution of mitochondrial markers COX IV and HSP60. DJ-1 ONs expression was permanently reduced in PD, revealing the mitochondrial dysfunction and justifying the defective Nrf2-mediated cytoprotective response. The Nrf2/SOD-1 pathway was indeed downregulated in PD ONs, although with stage-specific differences. In PD<sup>dn</sup> ONs, Nrf2 mostly presented in the inactive cytosolic localization with a major reduction of SOD-1 expression, whereas in PD<sup>tr</sup>, the Nrf2 active nuclear fraction increased, and the SOD-1 expression raised. In SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrated that dopamine administration increases the Nrf2 nuclear fraction, acting as a possible pathway's inducer.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Human-derived ONs may recapitulate PD pathogenic milestones, exhibiting stage-specific interactions among α-synuclein oligomers, mitochondrial metabolism, and cytoprotective response. These findings highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction as a primary target for therapeutic interventions and a potential axis for the biological stratification of patients. Moreover, they supported the translational value of ONs, as a source of biomarkers or models, which is critical in the current changing paradigm of PD toward a biological-based approach.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27280?af=R">Carotid Revascularization Versus Medical Management for Ischemic Stroke with Ipsilateral Carotid Web: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Carotid artery web is an underrecognized cause of ischemic stroke and is associated with a high risk of recurrent events. It is uncertain whether medical management or carotid revascularization is beneficial for patients with ischemic stroke and ipsilateral carotid web. In the absence of large randomized clinical trials and observational studies, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing medical management and carotid revascularization in this population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024485069). We searched five databases: Embase, Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We included observational studies that studied the association between recurrent stroke in patients with ipsilateral carotid web receiving medical management (antiplatelet and anticoagulation) and carotid revascularization. Random effects modeling was performed, and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals were reported.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 17 studies (16 published and 1 institutional study). In the medical management group, 32% (90/281) of patients experienced recurrent ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the carotid web. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of recurrent ischemic stroke with carotid revascularization (relative risk 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.06–0.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>I</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 14.5%). Both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting were equally effective in reducing recurrent stroke risk (relative risk 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.11–1.76, <i>p</i> = 0.99).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Carotid revascularization is associated with reduced recurrence rates, with no difference between revascularization subtypes (carotid endarterectomy vs carotid artery stenting). However, given the small, heterogeneous cohorts and the uncertain natural history of carotid artery web under medical management, these findings should be interpreted with caution until prospective, controlled comparative effectiveness studies are performed.
