	<p>Healthy aging is characterized by macrostructural sleep changes and alterations of regional electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep features. However, the spatiotemporal EEG pattern of the wake-sleep transition has never been described in the elderly. The present study aimed to assess the topographical and temporal features of the EEG during the sleep onset (SO) in a group of 36 older participants (59–81 years). The topography of the 1 Hz bins’ EEG power and the time course of the EEG frequency bands were assessed. Moreover, we compared the delta activity and delta/beta ratio between the older participants and a group of young adults. The results point to several peculiarities in the elderly: (a) the generalized post-SO power increase in the slowest frequencies did not include the 7 Hz bin; (b) the alpha power revealed a frequency-specific pattern of post-SO modifications; (c) the sigma activity exhibited only a slight post-SO increase, and its highest bins showed a frontotemporal power decrease. Older adults showed a generalized reduction of delta power and delta/beta ratio in both pre- and post-SO intervals compared to young adults. From a clinical standpoint, the regional EEG activity may represent a target for brain stimulation techniques to reduce SO latency and sleep fragmentation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The perirhinal (PER) and postrhinal (POR) cortices, structures in the medial temporal lobe, are implicated in learning and memory. The PER is understood to process object information and the POR to process spatial or contextual information. Whether the medial temporal lobe is dedicated to memory, however, is under debate. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that the PER and POR are also involved in non-mnemonic cognitive functions. Rats with PER or POR damage and SHAM surgical controls were shaped, trained, and tested on the five-choice serial reaction time (5CSRT) task, which assesses attention and executive function. Rats with PER damage were impaired in acquiring the task and at asymptote, although processing information about objects was not relevant to the task. When confronted with attentional challenges, rats with PER damage showed a pattern consistent with decreased attentional capacity, increased response errors, and increased impulsive behavior. Rats with POR damage showed intact acquisition and normal asymptotic performance. They also exhibited faster latencies in the absence of speed accuracy trade-off suggesting enhanced response readiness. We suggest this increased response readiness results from decreased automatic monitoring of the local environment, which might normally compete with response readiness. Our findings are consistent with a role for PER in controlled attention and a role for POR in stimulus-driven attention providing evidence that the PER and POR cortices have functions that go beyond memory for objects and memory for scenes and contexts, respectively. These findings provide new evidence for functional specialization in the medial temporal lobe.</p>

                Background: Diabetes is a disease that affects people worldwide, including in Indonesia. The prevalence of diabetes in Indonesia is increasing from year to year. One of the most devastating complications of diabetes mellitus is diabetic ulcers, which is a limb-threatening complication. Over the past few decades, ozone generated using plasma medical technology has been investigated as an agent that helps wound healing. This study aims to evaluate the effects of topical ozonated virgin coconut oil (VCO) in a diabetic wound mouse model. Methods: This study was an experimental study with a post-test control design. An ulcer wound model was made in 50 diabetic male Wistar mice, divided into five groups, and a control group of 10 non-diabetic mice. The control groups were given conventional therapy only and the treatment groups were also given topical ozonated VCO with different flow durations (0 min, 90 min, 7 h, 14 h). Macroscopic appearance and wound contraction were observed. HSP90β, VEGF-A, EGF, bFGF, and CD34 levels were measured from the immunostained slices of wound margins. Results: The reduction of wound length was proportionally related to the duration of ozone flow. Ozonated VCO with a longer duration of ozone flow healed the wound more quickly and had the shortest wound length. VCO with ozone flow for 14 hours (16837.10 µm) had the biggest reduction in wound length compared to other groups. The wounds treated with ozonated VCO showed an increase in HSP90β, VEGF-A, EGF, bFGF, and CD34 levels that correlated to improved wound healing. A longer period of treatment resulted in higher levels of wound healing biomarkers compared to shorter therapeutic durations. Conclusions: Topical ozonated VCO improved the wound healing process in a diabetic ulcer mouse model by improving macroscopic wound appearance and increasing levels of wound healing biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The in vitro direct mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) for the early evaluation of TB vaccine candidates and assessment of protective immunity: a protocol for non-human primate cells [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The only currently available approach to early efficacy testing of tuberculosis (TB) vaccine candidates is in vivo preclinical challenge models. These typically include mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHPs), which must be exposed to virulent M.tb in a ‘challenge’ experiment following vaccination in order to evaluate protective efficacy. This procedure results in disease development and is classified as ‘Moderate’ in severity under EU legislation and UK ASPA licensure. Furthermore, experiments are relatively long and animals must be maintained in high containment level facilities, making them relatively costly. We describe an in vitro protocol for the direct mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) for use in the macaque model of TB vaccine development with the aim of overcoming some of these limitations. Importantly, using an in vitro assay in place of in vivo M.tb challenge represents a significant refinement to the existing procedure for early vaccine efficacy testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell and autologous serum samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated control animals are co-cultured with mycobacteria in a 48-well plate format for 96 hours. Adherent monocytes are then lysed to release intracellular mycobacteria which is quantified using the BACTEC MGIT system and colony-forming units determined relative to an inoculum control and stock standard curve. We discuss related optimisation and characterisation experiments, and review evidence that the direct NHP MGIA provides a biologically relevant model of vaccine-induced protection. The potential end-users of the NHP MGIA are academic and industry organisations that conduct the assessment of TB vaccine candidates and associated protective immunity using the NHP model. This approach aims to provide a method for high-throughput down-selection of vaccine candidates going forward to in vivo efficacy testing, thus expediting the development of a more efficacious TB vaccine and offering potential refinement and reduction to the use of NHPs for this purpose.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neighbor-enhanced diffusivity in dense, cohesive cell populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hyun Gyu Lee, Kyoung J. Lee</p>

The dispersal or mixing of cells within cellular tissue is a crucial property for diverse biological processes, ranging from morphogenesis, immune action, to tumor metastasis. With the phenomenon of ‘contact inhibition of locomotion,’ it is puzzling how cells achieve such processes within a densely packed cohesive population. Here we demonstrate that a proper degree of cell-cell adhesiveness can, intriguingly, enhance the super-diffusive nature of individual cells. We systematically characterize the migration trajectories of crawling MDA-MB-231 cell lines, while they are in several different clustering modes, including freely crawling singles, cohesive doublets of two cells, quadruplets, and confluent population on two-dimensional substrate. Following data analysis and computer simulation of a simple cellular Potts model, which faithfully recapitulated all key experimental observations such as enhanced diffusivity as well as periodic rotation of cell-doublets and cell-quadruplets with mixing events, we found that proper combination of active self-propelling force and cell-cell adhesion is sufficient for generating the observed phenomena. Additionally, we found that tuning parameters for these two factors covers a variety of different collective dynamic states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Experimental and computational investigation of enzyme functional annotations uncovers misannotation in the EC 1.1.3.15 enzyme class</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elzbieta Rembeza, Martin K. M. Engqvist</p>

Only a small fraction of genes deposited to databases have been experimentally characterised. The majority of proteins have their function assigned automatically, which can result in erroneous annotations. The reliability of current annotations in public databases is largely unknown; experimental attempts to validate the accuracy within individual enzyme classes are lacking. In this study we performed an overview of functional annotations to the BRENDA enzyme database. We first applied a high-throughput experimental platform to verify functional annotations to an enzyme class of S-2-hydroxyacid oxidases (EC 1.1.3.15). We chose 122 representative sequences of the class and screened them for their predicted function. Based on the experimental results, predicted domain architecture and similarity to previously characterised S-2-hydroxyacid oxidases, we inferred that at least 78% of sequences in the enzyme class are misannotated. We experimentally confirmed four alternative activities among the misannotated sequences and showed that misannotation in the enzyme class increased over time. Finally, we performed a computational analysis of annotations to all enzyme classes in the BRENDA database, and showed that nearly 18% of all sequences are annotated to an enzyme class while sharing no similarity or domain architecture to experimentally characterised representatives. We showed that even well-studied enzyme classes of industrial relevance are affected by the problem of functional misannotation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Drug-induced resistance evolution necessitates less aggressive treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Teemu Kuosmanen, Johannes Cairns, Robert Noble, Niko Beerenwinkel, Tommi Mononen, Ville Mustonen</p>

Increasing body of experimental evidence suggests that anticancer and antimicrobial therapies may themselves promote the acquisition of drug resistance by increasing mutability. The successful control of evolving populations requires that such biological costs of control are identified, quantified and included to the evolutionarily informed treatment protocol. Here we identify, characterise and exploit a trade-off between decreasing the target population size and generating a surplus of treatment-induced rescue mutations. We show that the probability of cure is maximized at an intermediate dosage, below the drug concentration yielding maximal population decay, suggesting that treatment outcomes may in some cases be substantially improved by less aggressive treatment strategies. We also provide a general analytical relationship that implicitly links growth rate, pharmacodynamics and dose-dependent mutation rate to an optimal control law. Our results highlight the important, but often neglected, role of fundamental eco-evolutionary costs of control. These costs can often lead to situations, where decreasing the cumulative drug dosage may be preferable even when the objective of the treatment is elimination, and not containment. Taken together, our results thus add to the ongoing criticism of the standard practice of administering aggressive, high-dose therapies and motivate further experimental and clinical investigation of the mutagenicity and other hidden collateral costs of therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Phenotypic-dependent variability and the emergence of tolerance in bacterial populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by José Camacho Mateu, Matteo Sireci, Miguel A. Muñoz</p>

Ecological and evolutionary dynamics have been historically regarded as unfolding at broadly separated timescales. However, these two types of processes are nowadays well-documented to intersperse much more tightly than traditionally assumed, especially in communities of microorganisms. Advancing the development of mathematical and computational approaches to shed novel light onto eco-evolutionary problems is a challenge of utmost relevance. With this motivation in mind, here we scrutinize recent experimental results showing evidence of rapid evolution of tolerance by lag in bacterial populations that are periodically exposed to antibiotic stress in laboratory conditions. In particular, the distribution of single-cell lag times—i.e., the times that individual bacteria from the community remain in a dormant state to cope with stress—evolves its average value to approximately fit the antibiotic-exposure time. Moreover, the distribution develops right-skewed heavy tails, revealing the presence of individuals with anomalously large lag times. Here, we develop a parsimonious individual-based model mimicking the actual demographic processes of the experimental setup. Individuals are characterized by a single phenotypic trait: their intrinsic lag time, which is transmitted with variation to the progeny. The model—in a version in which the amplitude of phenotypic variations grows with the parent’s lag time—is able to reproduce quite well the key empirical observations. Furthermore, we develop a general mathematical framework allowing us to describe with good accuracy the properties of the stochastic model by means of a macroscopic equation, which generalizes the Crow-Kimura equation in population genetics. Even if the model does not account for all the biological mechanisms (e.g., genetic changes) in a detailed way—i.e., it is a phenomenological one—it sheds light onto the eco-evolutionary dynamics of the problem and can be helpful to design strategies to hinder the emergence of tolerance in bacterial communities. From a broader perspective, this work represents a benchmark for the mathematical framework designed to tackle much more general eco-evolutionary problems, thus paving the road to further research avenues.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A unified mechanism for innate and learned visual landmark guidance in the insect central complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roman Goulard, Cornelia Buehlmann, Jeremy E. Niven, Paul Graham, Barbara Webb</p>

Insects can navigate efficiently in both novel and familiar environments, and this requires flexiblity in how they are guided by sensory cues. A prominent landmark, for example, can elicit strong innate behaviours (attraction or menotaxis) but can also be used, after learning, as a specific directional cue as part of a navigation memory. However, the mechanisms that allow both pathways to co-exist, interact or override each other are largely unknown. Here we propose a model for the behavioural integration of innate and learned guidance based on the neuroanatomy of the central complex (CX), adapted to control landmark guided behaviours. We consider a reward signal provided either by an innate attraction to landmarks or a long-term visual memory in the mushroom bodies (MB) that modulates the formation of a local vector memory in the CX. Using an operant strategy for a simulated agent exploring a simple world containing a single visual cue, we show how the generated short-term memory can support both innate and learned steering behaviour. In addition, we show how this architecture is consistent with the observed effects of unilateral MB lesions in ants that cause a reversion to innate behaviour. We suggest the formation of a directional memory in the CX can be interpreted as transforming rewarding (positive or negative) sensory signals into a mapping of the environment that describes the geometrical attractiveness (or repulsion). We discuss how this scheme might represent an ideal way to combine multisensory information gathered during the exploration of an environment and support optimal cue integration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A model of naturalistic decision making in preference tests</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John Ksander, Donald B. Katz, Paul Miller</p>

Decisions as to whether to continue with an ongoing activity or to switch to an alternative are a constant in an animal’s natural world, and in particular underlie foraging behavior and performance in food preference tests. Stimuli experienced by the animal both impact the choice and are themselves impacted by the choice, in a dynamic back and forth. Here, we present model neural circuits, based on spiking neurons, in which the choice to switch away from ongoing behavior instantiates this back and forth, arising as a state transition in neural activity. We analyze two classes of circuit, which differ in whether state transitions result from a loss of hedonic input from the stimulus (an “entice to stay” model) or from aversive stimulus-input (a “repel to leave” model). In both classes of model, we find that the mean time spent sampling a stimulus decreases with increasing value of the alternative stimulus, a fact that we linked to the inclusion of depressing synapses in our model. The competitive interaction is much greater in “entice to stay” model networks, which has qualitative features of the marginal value theorem, and thereby provides a framework for optimal foraging behavior. We offer suggestions as to how our models could be discriminatively tested through the analysis of electrophysiological and behavioral data.

Early Endosomal Antigen 1 (EEA1) is a key protein in endosomal trafficking and is implicated in both autoimmune and neurological diseases. The C-terminal FYVE domain of EEA1 binds endosomal membranes, which contain phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P). Although it is known that FYVE binds PI(3)P specifically, it has not previously been described of how FYVE attaches and binds to endosomal membranes. In this study, we employed both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic (AT) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine how FYVE binds to PI(3)P-containing membranes. CG-MD showed that the dominant membrane binding mode resembles the crystal structure of EEA1 FYVE domain in complex with inositol-1,3-diphospate (PDB ID 1JOC). FYVE, which is a homodimer, binds the membrane via a hinge mechanism, where the C-terminus of one monomer first attaches to the membrane, followed by the C-terminus of the other monomer. The estimated total binding energy is ~70 kJ/mol, of which 50–60 kJ/mol stems from specific PI(3)P-interactions. By AT-MD, we could partition the binding mode into two types: (i) adhesion by electrostatic FYVE-PI(3)P interaction, and (ii) insertion of amphipathic loops. The AT simulations also demonstrated flexibility within the FYVE homodimer between the C-terminal heads and coiled-coil stem. This leads to a dynamic model whereby the 200 nm long coiled coil attached to the FYVE domain dimer can amplify local hinge-bending motions such that the Rab5-binding domain at the other end of the coiled coil can explore an area of 0.1 μm<sup>2</sup> in the search for a second endosome with which to interact.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Local field potentials in a pre-motor region predict learned vocal sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daril E. Brown II, Jairo I. Chavez, Derek H. Nguyen, Adam Kadwory, Bradley Voytek, Ezequiel M. Arneodo, Timothy Q. Gentner, Vikash Gilja</p>

Neuronal activity within the premotor region HVC is tightly synchronized to, and crucial for, the articulate production of learned song in birds. Characterizations of this neural activity detail patterns of sequential bursting in small, carefully identified subsets of neurons in the HVC population. The dynamics of HVC are well described by these characterizations, but have not been verified beyond this scale of measurement. There is a rich history of using local field potentials (LFP) to extract information about behavior that extends beyond the contribution of individual cells. These signals have the advantage of being stable over longer periods of time, and they have been used to study and decode human speech and other complex motor behaviors. Here we characterize LFP signals presumptively from the HVC of freely behaving male zebra finches during song production to determine if population activity may yield similar insights into the mechanisms underlying complex motor-vocal behavior. Following an initial observation that structured changes in the LFP were distinct to all vocalizations during song, we show that it is possible to extract time-varying features from multiple frequency bands to decode the identity of specific vocalization elements (syllables) and to predict their temporal onsets within the motif. This demonstrates the utility of LFP for studying vocal behavior in songbirds. Surprisingly, the time frequency structure of HVC LFP is qualitatively similar to well-established oscillations found in both human and non-human mammalian motor areas. This physiological similarity, despite distinct anatomical structures, may give insight into common computational principles for learning and/or generating complex motor-vocal behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Leveraging vibration of effects analysis for robust discovery in observational biomedical data science</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Braden T. Tierney, Elizabeth Anderson, Yingxuan Tan, Kajal Claypool, Sivateja Tangirala, Aleksandar D. Kostic, Arjun K. Manrai, Chirag J. Patel</p>

Hypothesis generation in observational, biomedical data science often starts with computing an association or identifying the statistical relationship between a dependent and an independent variable. However, the outcome of this process depends fundamentally on modeling strategy, with differing strategies generating what can be called “vibration of effects” (VoE). VoE is defined by variation in associations that often lead to contradictory results. Here, we present a computational tool capable of modeling VoE in biomedical data by fitting millions of different models and comparing their output. We execute a VoE analysis on a series of widely reported associations (e.g., carrot intake and eyesight) with an extended additional focus on lifestyle exposures (e.g., physical activity) and components of the Framingham Risk Score for cardiovascular health (e.g., blood pressure). We leveraged our tool for potential confounder identification, investigating what adjusting variables are responsible for conflicting models. We propose modeling VoE as a critical step in navigating discovery in observational data, discerning robust associations, and cataloging adjusting variables that impact model output.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Social foraging in vampire bats is predicted by long-term cooperative relationships</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simon P. Ripperger, Gerald G. Carter</p>

Stable social bonds in group-living animals can provide greater access to food. A striking example is that female vampire bats often regurgitate blood to socially bonded kin and nonkin that failed in their nightly hunt. Food-sharing relationships form via preferred associations and social grooming within roosts. However, it remains unclear whether these cooperative relationships extend beyond the roost. To evaluate if long-term cooperative relationships in vampire bats play a role in foraging, we tested if foraging encounters measured by proximity sensors could be explained by wild roosting proximity, kinship, or rates of co-feeding, social grooming, and food sharing during 21 months in captivity. We assessed evidence for 6 hypothetical scenarios of social foraging, ranging from individual to collective hunting. We found that closely bonded female vampire bats departed their roost separately, but often reunited far outside the roost. Repeating foraging encounters were predicted by within-roost association and histories of cooperation in captivity, even when accounting for kinship. Foraging bats demonstrated both affiliative and competitive interactions with different social calls linked to each interaction type. We suggest that social foraging could have implications for social evolution if “local” within-roost cooperation and “global” outside-roost competition enhances fitness interdependence between frequent roostmates.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does standard cosmology really predict the cosmic microwave background? [version 6; peer review: 2 approved, 3 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                In standard Big Bang cosmology, the universe expanded from a very dense, hot and opaque initial state. The light that was last scattered about 380,000 years later, when the universe had become transparent, has been redshifted and is now seen as thermal radiation with a temperature of 2.7 K, the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, since light escapes faster than matter can move, it is prudent to ask how we, made of matter from this very source, can still see the light. In order for this to be possible, the light must take a return path of the right length. A curved return path is possible in spatially closed, balloon-like models, but in standard cosmology, the universe is “flat” rather than balloon-like, and it lacks a boundary surface that might function as a reflector. Under these premises, radiation that once filled the universe homogeneously cannot do so permanently after expansion, and we cannot see the last scattering event. It is shown that the traditional calculation of the CMB temperature is inappropriate and that light emitted by any source inside the Big Bang universe earlier than half its “conformal age” can only become visible to us via a return path. Although often advanced as the best evidence for a hot Big Bang, the CMB actually tells against a formerly smaller universe and so do also distant galaxies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The association of socio-demographic and environmental factors on childhood diarrhea in Cambodia [version 5; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diarrhea diseases remain the leading cause of death among children under-five in lower and lower-middle-income countries. This study was conducted to investigate the factors related to diarrhea among children aged 12 to 35 months in Cambodia. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014 using a combination of household and children’s datasets. A generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze the determinant factors of diarrhea. Results: The survey included 2,828 children aged 12 to 35 months. The prevalence of diarrhea in the last 2 weeks was 16.44% (95% CI: 14.72%-18.31%). Factors significantly associated with childhood diarrhea were: maternal unemployment (AOR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.14-1.78); the child being male (AOR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.02-1.53); the presence of unimproved toilet facilities (AOR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.05-1.31); and unhygienic disposal of children’s stools (AOR = 1.32; 95%CI: 1.06-1.64) when controlling for other covariates. Both maternal age (one year older; AOR = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.78– 0.93) and child age (one month older; AOR = 0.86; 95%CI: 0.78-0.94) had significant negative associations with the occurrence of childhood diarrhea. Conclusion: Childhood diarrhea remains a public health concern in Cambodia. Intervention programs should focus on reducing diarrheal diseases by constructing improved toilet facilities and promoting behavior to improve hygiene, specifically targeting younger mothers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A whole genome atlas of 81 Psilocybe genomes as a resource for psilocybin production. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Psilocybe genus is well known for the synthesis of valuable psychoactive compounds such as Psilocybin, Psilocin, Baeocystin and Aeruginascin. The ubiquity of Psilocybin synthesis in Psilocybe has been attributed to a horizontal gene transfer mechanism of a ~20Kb gene cassette. A recently published highly contiguous reference genome derived from long read single molecule sequencing has underscored interesting variation in this Psilocybin synthesis gene cassette. This reference genome has also enabled the shotgun sequencing of spores from many Psilocybe strains to better catalog the genomic diversity in the Psilocybin synthesis pathway. Here we present the de novo assembly of genomes of 81 Psilocybe genomes compared to the P.envy reference genome. Surprisingly, the genomes of Psilocybe galindoi, Psilocybe tampanensis and Psilocybe azurescens lack sequence coverage over the previously described Psilocybin synthesis pathway but do demonstrate amino acid sequence homology to an alternative pathway and may illuminate previously proposed convergent evolution of Psilocybin synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neuronal pericellular baskets: neurotransmitter convergence and regulation of network excitability</a></h4>

              
                A pericellular basket is a presynaptic configuration of numerous axonal boutons outlining a target neuron soma and its proximal dendrites. Recent studies show neurochemical diversity of pericellular baskets and suggest that neurotransmitter usage together with the dense, soma-proximal boutons may permit strong input effects on different timescales. Here we review the development, distribution, neurochemical phenotypes, and possible functions of pericellular baskets. As an example, we highlight pericellular baskets formed by projections of certain Pet1/Fev neurons of the serotonergic raphe nuclei.

                Nanometer-scale properties of the extracellular matrix influence many biological processes, including cell motility. While much information is available for single-cell migration, to date, no knowledge exists on how the nanoscale presentation of extracellular matrix receptors influences collective cell migration. In wound healing, basal keratinocytes collectively migrate on a fibronectin-rich provisional basement membrane to re-epithelialize the injured skin. Among other receptors, the fibronectin receptor integrin α5β1 plays a pivotal role in this process. Using a highly specific integrin α5β1 peptidomimetic combined with nanopatterned hydrogels, we show that keratinocyte sheets regulate their migration ability at an optimal integrin α5β1 nanospacing. This efficiency relies on the effective propagation of stresses within the cell monolayer independent of substrate stiffness. For the first time, this work highlights the importance of extracellular matrix receptor nanoscale organization required for efficient tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Common host variation drives malaria parasite fitness in healthy human red cells</a></h4>

              
                The replication of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites within red blood cells (RBCs) causes severe disease in humans, especially in Africa. Deleterious alleles like hemoglobin S are well-known to confer strong resistance to malaria, but the effects of common RBC variation are largely undetermined. Here we collected fresh blood samples from 121 healthy donors, most with African ancestry, and performed exome sequencing, detailed RBC phenotyping, and parasite fitness assays. Over one third of healthy donors unknowingly carried alleles for G6PD deficiency or hemoglobinopathies, which were associated with characteristic RBC phenotypes. Among non-carriers alone, variation in RBC hydration, membrane deformability, and volume was strongly associated with <i>P. falciparum </i>growth rate. Common genetic variants in<i> PIEZO1</i>, <i>SPTA1/SPTB</i>, and several <i>P. falciparum</i> invasion receptors were also associated with parasite growth rate. Interestingly, we observed little or negative evidence for divergent selection on non-pathogenic RBC variation between Africans and Europeans. These findings suggest a model in which globally widespread variation in a moderate number of genes and phenotypes modulates <i>P. falciparum</i> fitness in RBCs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiscale analysis reveals that diet-dependent midgut plasticity emerges from alterations in both stem cell niche coupling and enterocyte size</a></h4>

              
                The gut is the primary interface between an animal and food, but how it adapts to qualitative dietary variation is poorly defined. We find that the <i>Drosophila </i>midgut plastically resizes following changes in dietary composition. A panel of nutrients collectively promote gut growth, which sugar opposes. Diet influences absolute and relative levels of enterocyte loss and stem cell proliferation, which together determine cell numbers. Diet also influences enterocyte size. A high sugar diet inhibits translation and uncouples ISC proliferation from expression of niche-derived signals but, surprisingly, rescuing these effects genetically was not sufficient to modify diet's impact on midgut size. However, when stem cell proliferation was deficient, diet's impact on enterocyte size was enhanced, and reducing enterocyte-autonomous TOR signaling was sufficient to attenuate diet-dependent midgut resizing. These data clarify the complex relationships between nutrition, epithelial dynamics, and cell size, and reveal a new mode of plastic, diet-dependent organ resizing.

                Universities and research institutions have to assess individuals when making decisions about hiring, promotion and tenure, but there are concerns that such assessments are overly reliant on metrics and proxy measures of research quality that overlook important factors such as academic rigor, data sharing and mentoring. These concerns have led to calls for universities and institutions to reform the methods they use to assess research and researchers. Here we present a new tool called SPACE that has been designed to help universities and institutions implement such reforms. The tool focuses on five core capabilities and can be used by universities and institutions at all stages of reform process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Task-specific roles of local interneurons for inter- and intraglomerular signaling in the insect antennal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Local interneurons (LNs) mediate complex interactions within the antennal lobe, the primary olfactory system of insects, and the functional analog of the vertebrate olfactory bulb. In the cockroach <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, as in other insects, several types of LNs with distinctive physiological and morphological properties can be defined. Here, we combined whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of individual LNs to analyze the role of spiking and nonspiking LNs in inter- and intraglomerular signaling during olfactory information processing. Spiking GABAergic LNs reacted to odorant stimulation with a uniform rise in <i>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub></i> in the ramifications of all innervated glomeruli. In contrast, in nonspiking LNs, glomerular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were odorant specific and varied between glomeruli, resulting in distinct, glomerulus-specific tuning curves. The cell type-specific differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics support the idea that spiking LNs play a primary role in interglomerular signaling, while they assign nonspiking LNs an essential role in intraglomerular signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fluctuations in Neural Complexity During Wakefulness Relate To Conscious Level and Cognition</a></h4>

              
                There has been considerable recent progress in measuring conscious level using neural complexity measures. For instance, such measures can reliably distinguish healthy awake from asleep subjects and vegetative state patients. However, this line of research has never explored the dynamics of conscious level during normal wakefulness. Being able to capture meaningful differences in conscious level during wakefulness may provide a vital new insight into the nature of consciousness, by demonstrating what biological, behavioural and cognitive factors relate to such differences. Here we take advantage of a large MEG and fMRI dataset of healthy adults, to examine within-subject conscious level fluctuations during resting state and tasks, by using a range of complexity measures. We first establish the validity of this approach in both neuroimaging domains by relating neural complexity measures to pre-existing techniques for capturing transitions of consciousness from full wakefulness into drowsiness and the earliest stages of sleep, finding decreased complexity as participants become increasingly drowsy. We further demonstrate that neural complexity measures in both MEG and fMRI change both within and between tasks, and relate to performance on an executive task, with higher complexity associated with better performance and faster reaction times. This approach provides a powerful new route to further explore the cognitive and neural underpinnings of consciousness.

                Satellite glia are the major glial cells in sympathetic ganglia, enveloping neuronal cell bodies. Despite this intimate association, how satellite glia contribute to sympathetic functions remain unclear. Here, we show that satellite glia are critical for metabolism, survival, and activity of sympathetic neurons and modulate autonomic behaviors in mice. Adult ablation of satellite glia results in impaired mTOR signaling, soma atrophy, reduced noradrenergic enzymes, and loss of sympathetic neurons. However, persisting neurons have elevated activity, and satellite glia-ablated mice show increased pupil dilation and heart rate, indicative of enhanced sympathetic tone. Satellite glia-specific deletion of Kir4.1, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, largely recapitulates the cellular defects observed in glia-ablated mice, suggesting that satellite glia act in part via extracellular K+ buffering. These findings highlight neuron-satellite glia as functional units in regulating sympathetic output, with implications for disorders linked to sympathetic hyper-activity such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Discoidin domain receptor regulates ensheathment, survival, and caliber of peripheral axons</a></h4>

              
                Invertebrate axons and small caliber axons in mammalian peripheral nerves are unmyelinated but still ensheathed by glia. How this type of ensheathment is controlled and its roles in supporting neuronal function remain unclear. We performed an in vivo RNAi screen in Drosophila to identify glial genes required for axon ensheathment and identified the conserved receptor tyrosine kinase Discoidin domain receptor (Ddr). In larval peripheral nerves, loss of Ddr resulted in incomplete ensheathment of axons. We found a strong dominant genetic interaction between Ddr and the fly type XV/XVIII collagen Multiplexin (Mp), suggesting Ddr functions a collagen receptor to drive wrapping of axons during development. Surprisingly, while ablation of glia that wrap axons severely impaired larval motor behavior, incomplete wrapping in Ddr mutants was sufficient to support basic circuit function. In adult nerves, loss of Ddr from glia decreased long-term survival of sensory neurons and significantly reduced axon caliber without overtly affecting ensheathment. Our data establish a crucial role for non-myelinating glia in peripheral nerve development and function across the lifespan, and identify Ddr as a key regulator of axon-glia interactions during ensheathment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysregulated coordination of MAPT exon 2 and exon 10 splicing underlies different tau pathologies in PSP and AD</a></h4>

              
                Understanding regulation of MAPT splicing is important to the etiology of many nerurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), in which different tau isoforms accumulate in pathologic inclusions. MAPT, the gene encoding the tau protein, undergoes complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing to generate six isoforms. Tauopathies can be categorized by the presence of tau aggregates containing either 3 (3R) or 4 (4R) microtubule binding domain repeats (determined by inclusion/exclusion of exon 10), but the role of the N terminal domain of the protein, determined by inclusion/exclusion of exons 2 and 3 has been less well studied. Using an unbiased correlational screen in human brain tissue, we observed coordination of MAPT exons 2 and 10 splicing. Expression of exon 2 splicing regulators and subsequently exon 2 inclusion are differentially disrupted in PSP and AD brain, resulting in the accumulation of 1N4R isoforms in PSP and 0N isoforms in AD temporal cortex. Furthermore, we identified different N-terminal isoforms of tau present in neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites and tufted astrocytes, indicating a role for differential N-terminal splicing in the development of disparate tau neuropathologies. We conclude that N-terminal splicing and combinatorial regulation with exon 10 inclusion/exclusion is likely to be important to our understanding of tauopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The structural basis of huntingtin (Htt) fibril polymorphism, revealed by cryo-EM of exon 1 Htt fibrils</a></h4>

              
                The lack of detailed insight into the structure of aggregates formed by the huntingtin protein has hampered efforts to develop therapeutics and diagnostics targeting pathology formation in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the structural properties of in vitro generated fibrils from exon1 of the huntingtin protein by electron cryo-microscopy and single- particle analysis. We show that wildtype and mutant exon1 of the huntingtin protein form non-helical fibrils with a polygultamine amyloid core composed of {beta}-hairpins with unique characteristics that have not been previously observed with other amyloid filaments. The stacks of {beta}-hairpins form long planar {beta}- sheets (protofilaments) with variable stacking angle and occasional out-of-register state of individual {beta}-hairpins. These features and the propensity of protofilament to undergo lateral association results in a high degree of fibril polymorphism, including fibrils composed of varying numbers of protofilaments. Our results also represent the first direct observation of how the flanking domains are organized around the polyglutamine core of the fibril and provide insight into how they might affect huntingtin fibril structure, polymorphism, and stacking of {beta}-hairpins within its core structure. Removal of the first 17 amino acids at the N-terminus resulted in surprising intra-fibril structural heterogeneity and reduced fibril's propensity to lateral associations. Overall, this work provides valuable insights that could guide future mechanistic studies to elucidate the sequence and structural determinants of huntingtin aggregation, as well as cryo- EM and structural studies of fibrils derived from huntingtin proteins and other disease-associated polyglutamine-containing proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute Ketamine Modulated Functional Brain Coupling and Dissociative and Affective States in Human Subjects: Interim Analyses</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor that is both a drug of abuse and an FDA-approved anesthetic used off-label for treatment-resistant depression. Despite its growing clinical use for depression and pain, the relationships between the acute dissociative and affective effects of ketamine that contribute to its abuse liability and therapeutic potential, along with the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, are not well established. To address this need, we have implemented a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, within-subjects mechanistic trial. Healthy adult subjects undergo infusion with two fixed doses of subanesthetic racemic intravenous (IV) ketamine and placebo and their acute responses are assessed with self-report questionnaires, behavioral measures, hormone levels, and neuroimaging. As planned in our analysis strategy, we present interim results for the first 7 subjects of our study, focusing on dissociative and affective states and resting functional brain coupling signatures of these states. The first key finding was that ketamine induced dose-dependent increases in dissociation and related intoxication. Ketamine also altered affective states, reducing emotional insensitivity but increasing stress assessed by cortisol. Second, ketamine had an effect on altering brain connectivity, particularly for specific connections between regions of the reward and negative affect circuits and involving thalamic sub-regions. Third, regarding brain-response associations, ketamine-induced increases in amygdala-anteroventral thalamus coupling were correlated with greater dissociation and intoxication, whereas decreases in the coupling of the anteromedial thalamus and posterior parietal thalamus were correlated with increased sensory aspects of reward responsiveness. Additional specific correlations were observed between affective measures relevant to reward responsiveness or its absence and drug-altered changes in localized functional connections involving the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and thalamic sub-regions. We also discovered a consistent profile of negative associations between ketamine altered connectivity involving the NAcc and specific thalamic sub-regions and effects of anxiety. Further, drug-altered increases in the coupling of the amygdala and anteroventral thalamus were associated with increases in cortisol, an indicator of biochemical stress. The findings highlight the utility of integrating self-reports, objective measures, and functional neuroimaging to disentangle the brain states underlying specific acute responses induced by ketamine. With the likely continued expansion of FDA indications for ketamine, understanding acute responses and underlying neural mechanisms is important for maximizing the therapeutic potential of ketamine while minimizing the risk of promoting misuse or abuse of this substance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emotion Down- and Up-Regulation Act on Spatially Distinct Brain Areas:Interoceptive Regions to Calm Down and Other Affective Regions to Amp Up</a></h4>

              
                Prior studies on emotion regulation identified a set of brain regions specialized for generating and controlling affect. Researchers generally agree that when up- and down-regulating emotion, control regions in the prefrontal cortex turn up or down activity in affect-generating areas. However, the assumption that turning up and down emotions produces opposite effects in the same affect-generating regions is untested. We call this assumption the 'affective dial hypothesis.' Our study tested this hypothesis by examining the overlap between the sets of regions activated during up-regulation and those deactivated during down-regulation in a large number of participants (N=105). We found that up- and down-regulation both recruit regulatory regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus but act on distinct affect-generating regions. While up-regulation increases BOLD signal in regions associated with emotion such as the amygdala, anterior insula, striatum and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as in regions associated with sympathetic vascular activity such as periventricular white matter, down-regulation decreases signal in regions receiving interoceptive input such as the posterior insula and postcentral gyrus. These findings indicate that up- and down-regulation do not generally exert opposing effects on the same affect-generating regions. Instead, they target different brain circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of RALBP1 in Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                The purpose of our study is to understand the role of the Ralbp1 gene in oxidative stress (OS), mitochondrial dysfunction and cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The Ralbp1 gene encodes the 76 kDa protein Rlip (aka RLIP76). Previous studies have revealed its role in OS-related cancer. However, Rlip is transcriptionally regulated by EP300, a CREB-binding protein that is important for synaptic plasticity in the brain. Rlip functions as a stress-responsive/protective transporter of glutathione conjugates (GS-E) and xenobiotic toxins. OS causes rapid cellular accumulation of Rlip and its translocation from a tubulin-bound complex to the plasma membrane, mitochondria and nucleus. Therefore, Rlip may play an important role in maintaining cognitive function in the face of OS-related injury. This study is aimed to determine whether Rlip deficiency in mice is associated with AD-like cognitive and mitochondrial dysfunction. Brain tissue obtained from cohorts of wildtype and Rlip+/- mice were analyzed for OS markers, expression of genes that regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion, and synaptic integrity. We also examined mitochondrial ultrastructure in mouse brains obtained from these mice and further analyzed the impact of Rlip deficiency on gene networks of AD, aging, inhibition of stress-activated gene expression, mitochondrial function, and CREB signaling. Our studies revealed a significant increase in the levels of OS markers and alterations in the expression of genes and proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and synapses in brain tissues of these mice. Furthermore, we compared the cognitive function of wildtype and Rlip+/- mice. Behavioral, basic motor and sensory function tests in Rlip+/- mice revealed cognitive decline, similar to AD. Gene network analysis indicated dysregulation of stress-activated gene expression, mitochondrial function, and CREB signaling genes in the Rlip+/- mouse liver. Our results suggest that the Rlip deficiency-associated increase in OS and mitochondrial dysfunction could contribute to the development of OS-related AD processes. Therefore, the restoration of Rlip activity and endogenous cytoprotective mechanisms by pharmacological interventions is a novel approach to protect against AD.

                In the human visual system, cerebral cortex combines left- and right-eye retinal inputs, enabling single, comfortable binocular vision. In visual cortex, the signals from each eye inhibit one another (interocular suppression). While this mechanism may be disrupted by e.g. traumatic brain injury, clinical assessments of interocular suppression are subjective, qualitative, and lack reliability. EEG is a potentially useful clinical tool for objective, quantitative assessment of binocular vision. In a cohort of normal participants, we measured occipital, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to dichoptically-presented vertical and/or horizontal sine-wave gratings. Response amplitudes to orthogonal gratings were greater than that of parallel gratings, which were in turn greater than that of monocular gratings. Our results indicate that interocular suppression is (normally) balanced, orientation-tuned, and that suppression per se is reduced for orthogonal gratings. This objective measure of suppression may have application in clinical settings.

                Retinal degenerative diseases (RDD) such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) have no treatment. Stem cell-based therapies could provide promising opportunities to repair the damaged retina and restore vision. We investigated a novel approach in which human retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) derived from primitive mesenchymal stem cells (pMSCs) were examined to treat retinal degeneration in an rd12 mouse model of RP. Intravitreally transplanted cells improved retinal function and significantly increased retinal thickness. Transplanted cells homed, survived, and integrated to various retinal layers. They also induced anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses and upregulated neurogenesis genes. We found that RPCs were more efficacious than pMSCs in improving the retinal structure and function. RNA analyses suggest that RPCs promote neuroprotection and neuronal differentiation by activating JAK/STAT and MAPK, and inhibiting BMP signaling pathways. These promising results provide the basis for clinical studies to treat RDD using RPCs derived from pMSCs.

                In addition to its well-known contributions to motor control and motor learning, the cerebellum is involved in language, emotional regulation, anxiety, and affect1-4. We found that suppressing the firing of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) rapidly excites forebrain areas that could contribute to such functions, including the amygdala, basal forebrain, and septum, but that the classic cerebellar outputs, the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), do not project to these regions. Here we show that parabrachial nuclei (PBN) neurons that receive direct PC input, project to and influence all of these forebrain regions and many others. Furthermore, the function of this pathway is distinct from the canonical pathway: suppressing PC to PBN activity is aversive, whereas suppressing the PC to DCN pathway is rewarding. Therefore, the PBN pathway allows the cerebellum to influence the entire spectrum of valence, modulate the activity of forebrain regions known to regulate diverse nonmotor behaviors, and may be the substrate for many nonmotor disorders related to cerebellar dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning about threat from friends and strangers is equally effective: an fMRI study on observational fear conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Humans often benefit from social cues when learning about the world. For instance, learning about threats from others can save the individual from dangerous first-hand experiences. Familiarity is believed to increase the effectiveness of social learning, but it is not clear whether it plays a role in learning about threats. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we undertook a naturalistic approach and investigated whether there was a difference between observational fear learning from friends and strangers. Participants (observers) witnessed either their friends or strangers (demonstrators) receiving aversive (shock) stimuli paired with colored squares (observational learning stage). Subsequently, participants watched the same squares, but without receiving any shocks (direct-expression stage). We observed a similar pattern of brain activity in both groups of observers. Regions related to threat responses (amygdala, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex) and social perception (fusiform gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus) were activated during the observational phase, reflecting the fear contagion process. The anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex were also activated during the subsequent stage, indicating the expression of learned threat. Because there were no differences between participants observing friends and strangers, we argue that social threat learning is independent of the level of familiarity with the demonstrator.

                With smartphone-based mobile electroencephalography (EEG), we can investigate sound perception beyond the lab. To understand sound perception in the real world, we need to relate naturally occurring sounds to EEG data. For this, EEG and audio information need to be synchronized precisely, only then it is possible to capture fast and transient evoked neural responses and relate them to individual sounds. We have developed Android applications (AFEx and Record-a) that allow for the concurrent acquisition of EEG data and audio features, i.e., sound onsets, average signal power (RMS) and power spectral density (PSD) on smartphone. In this paper, we evaluate these apps by computing event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by everyday sounds. One participant listened to piano notes (played live by a pianist) and to a home-office soundscape. Timing tests showed that the temporal precision of the system is very good. We calculated ERPs to sound onsets and observed the typical P1-N1-P2 complex of auditory processing. Furthermore, we show how to relate information on loudness (RMS) and spectra (PSD) to brain activity. In future studies, we can use this system to study sound processing in everyday life.

                Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows non-invasive stimulation of the cortex. In multi-locus TMS (mTMS), the stimulating electric field (E-field) is controlled electronically without coil movement by adjusting currents in the coils of a transducer. Objective: To develop an mTMS system that allows adjusting the location and orientation of the E-field maximum within a cortical region. Methods: We designed and manufactured a planar 5-coil mTMS transducer to allow controlling the maximum of the induced E-field within a cortical region approximately 30 mm in diameter. We developed electronics with a design consisting of independently controlled H-bridge circuits to drive up to six TMS coils. To control the hardware, we programmed software that runs on a field-programmable gate array and a computer. To induce the desired E-field in the cortex, we developed an optimization method to calculate the currents needed in the coils. We characterized the mTMS system and conducted a proof-of-concept motor-mapping experiment on a healthy volunteer. In the motor mapping, we kept the transducer placement fixed while electronically shifting the E-field maximum on the precentral gyrus and measuring electromyography from the contralateral hand. Results: The transducer consists of an oval coil, two figure-of-eight coils, and two four-leaf-clover coils stacked on top of each other. The technical characterization indicated that the mTMS system performs as designed. The measured motor evoked potential amplitudes varied consistently as a function of the location of the E-field maximum. Conclusion: The developed mTMS system enables electronically targeted brain stimulation within a cortical region.

                Quantifying the population sizes of distinct neuron types in different anatomical regions is an essential step towards establishing a brain cell census. Although estimates exist for the total neuronal populations in different species, the number and definition of each specific neuron type are still intensively investigated. Hippocampome.org is an open-source knowledge base with morphological, physiological, and molecular information for 122 neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. While such framework identifies all known neuron types in this system, their relative abundances remain largely unknown. This work quantitatively estimates the counts of all Hippocampome.org neuron types by literature mining and numerical optimization. We report the number of neurons in each type identified by main neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA) and axonal-dendritic patterns throughout 26 subregions and layers of the dentate gyrus, Ammons horn, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. We produce by sensitivity analysis reliable numerical ranges for each type and summarize the amounts across broad neuronal families defined by biomarkers expression and firing dynamics. Study of density distributions indicates that the number of dendritic-targeting interneurons, but not of other neuronal classes, is independent of anatomical volumes. All extracted values, experimental evidence, and related software code are released on Hippocampome.org.

	<p>Introduction: Melanoma brain metastases remain a devastating disease process with poor prognosis. Recently, there has been a surge in studies demonstrating the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy for brain tumor treatment. Given their specificity and amenability to genetic modification, the authors explore the possible role of oncolytic virotherapy as a potential treatment option for patients with melanoma brain metastases. Methods: A comprehensive literature review including both preclinical and clinical evidence of oncolytic virotherapy for the treatment of melanoma brain metastasis was performed. Results: Oncolytic virotherapy, specifically T-VEC (Imlygic™), was approved for the treatment of melanoma in 2015. Recent clinical trials demonstrate promising anti-tumor changes in patients who have received T-VEC; however, there is little evidence for its use in metastatic brain disease based on the existing literature. To date, only two single cases utilizing virotherapy in patients with metastatic brain melanoma have been reported, specifically in patients with treatment refractory disease. Currently, there is not sufficient data to support the use of T-VEC or other viruses for intracranial metastatic melanoma. In developing a virotherapy treatment paradigm for melanoma brain metastases, several factors must be considered, including route of administration, need to bypass the blood–brain barrier, viral tumor infectivity, and risk of adverse events. Conclusions: Evidence for oncolytic virotherapy treatment of melanoma is limited primarily to T-VEC, with a noticeable paucity of data in the literature with respect to brain tumor metastasis. Given the promising findings of virotherapy for other brain tumor types, oncolytic virotherapy has great potential to offer benefits to patients afflicted with melanoma brain metastases and warrants further investigation.</p>

	<p>Sleep is a universal, highly preserved process, essential for human and animal life, whose complete functions are yet to be unravelled. Familial recurrence is acknowledged for some sleep disorders, but definite data are lacking for many of them. Genetic studies on sleep disorders have progressed from twin and family studies to candidate gene approaches to culminate in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Several works disclosed that sleep-wake characteristics, in addition to electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, have a certain degree of heritability. Notwithstanding, it is rare for sleep disorders to be attributed to single gene defects because of the complexity of the brain network/pathways involved. Besides, the advancing insights in epigenetic gene-environment interactions add further complexity to understanding the genetic control of sleep and its disorders. This narrative review explores the current genetic knowledge in sleep disorders in children, following the International Classification of Sleep Disorders—Third Edition (ICSD-3) categorisation.</p>

	<p>Correct in vivo diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) helps to avoid administration of disease-modifying treatments in non-AD patients, and allows the possible use of such treatments in clinically atypical AD patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers offer a tool for AD diagnosis. A reduction in CSF β-amyloid (marker of amyloid plaque burden), although compatible with Alzheimer’s pathological change, may also be observed in other dementing disorders, including vascular cognitive disorders due to subcortical small-vessel disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Thus, for the diagnosis of AD, an abnormal result of CSF β-amyloid may not be sufficient, and an increase in phospho-tau (marker of tangle pathology) is also required in order to confirm AD diagnosis in patients with a typical amnestic presentation and reveal underlying AD in patients with atypical or mixed and diagnostically confusing clinical presentations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of BiP as a CB1 Receptor-Interacting Protein That Fine-Tunes Cannabinoid Signaling in the Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cannabinoids, the bioactive constituents of cannabis, exert a wide array of effects on the brain by engaging Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<SUB>1</SUB>R). Accruing evidence supports that cannabinoid action relies on context-dependent factors, such as the biological characteristics of the target cell, suggesting that cell population-intrinsic molecular cues modulate CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-dependent signaling. Here, by using a yeast two-hybrid-based high-throughput screening, we identified BiP as a potential CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-interacting protein. We next found that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R and BiP interact specifically <I>in vitro</I>, and mapped the interaction site within the CB<SUB>1</SUB>R <I>C</I>-terminal (intracellular) domain and the BiP <I>C</I>-terminal (substrate-binding) domain-&alpha;. BiP selectively shaped agonist-evoked CB<SUB>1</SUB>R signaling by blocking an "alternative" G<SUB>q/11</SUB> protein-dependent signaling module while leaving the "classical" G<SUB>i/o</SUB> protein-dependent inhibition of the cAMP pathway unaffected. <I>In situ</I> proximity ligation assays conducted on brain samples from various genetic mouse models of conditional loss or gain of CB<SUB>1</SUB>R expression allowed to map CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes selectively on terminals of GABAergic neurons. Behavioral studies using cannabinoid-treated male BiP<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice supported that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes modulate cannabinoid-evoked anxiety, one of the most frequent undesired effects of cannabis. Together, by identifying BiP as a CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-interacting protein that controls receptor function in a signaling pathway- and neuron population-selective manner, our findings may help to understand the striking context-dependent actions of cannabis in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cannabis use is increasing worldwide, so innovative studies aimed to understand its complex mechanism of neurobiological action are warranted. Here, we found that cannabinoid CB<SUB>1</SUB> receptor (CB<SUB>1</SUB>R), the primary molecular target of the bioactive constituents of cannabis, interacts specifically with an intracellular protein called BiP. The interaction between CB<SUB>1</SUB>R and BiP occurs selectively on terminals of GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons, and induces a remarkable shift in the CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-associated signaling profile. Behavioral studies conducted in mice support that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes act as fine-tuners of anxiety, one of the most frequent undesired effects of cannabis use. Our findings open a new conceptual framework to understand the striking context-dependent pharmacological actions of cannabis in the brain.</p>

                <p>Microglia maintain brain health and play important roles in disease and injury. Despite the known ability of microglia to proliferate, the precise nature of the population or populations capable of generating new microglia in the adult brain remains controversial. We identified Prominin-1 (Prom1; also known as CD133) as a putative cell surface marker of committed brain myeloid progenitor cells. We demonstrate that Prom1-expressing cells isolated from mixed cortical cultures will generate new microglia <I>in vitro</I>. To determine whether Prom1-expressing cells generate new microglia <I>in vivo</I>, we used tamoxifen inducible fate mapping in male and female mice. Induction of Cre recombinase activity at 10 weeks in Prom1-expressing cells leads to the expression of TdTomato in all Prom1-expressing progenitors and newly generated daughter cells. We observed a population of new TdTomato-expressing microglia at 6 months of age that increased in size at 9 months. When microglia proliferation was induced using a transient ischemia/reperfusion paradigm, little proliferation from the Prom1-expressing progenitors was observed with the majority of new microglia derived from Prom1-negative cells. Together, these findings reveal that Prom1-expressing myeloid progenitor cells contribute to the generation of new microglia both <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate the existence of an undifferentiated myeloid progenitor population in the adult mouse brain that expresses Prom1. We conclude that Prom1-expressing myeloid progenitors contribute to new microglia genesis in the uninjured brain but not in response to ischemia/reperfusion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, can divide to slowly generate new microglia throughout life. Newly generated microglia may influence inflammatory responses to injury or neurodegeneration. However, the origins of the new microglia in the brain have been controversial. Our research demonstrates that some newly born microglia in a healthy brain are derived from cells that express the stem cell marker Prominin-1. This is the first time Prominin-1 cells are shown to generate microglia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oligodendrocyte HCN2 Channels Regulate Myelin Sheath Length</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oligodendrocytes generate myelin sheaths vital for the formation, health, and function of the CNS. Myelin sheath length is a key property that determines axonal conduction velocity and is known to be variable across the CNS. Myelin sheath length can be modified by neuronal activity, suggesting that dynamic regulation of sheath length might contribute to the functional plasticity of neural circuits. Although the mechanisms that establish and refine myelin sheath length are important determinants of brain function, our understanding of these remains limited. In recent years, the membranes of myelin sheaths have been increasingly recognized to contain ion channels and transporters that are associated with specific important oligodendrocyte functions, including metabolic support of axons and the regulation of ion homeostasis, but none have been shown to influence sheath architecture. In this study, we determined that hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, typically associated with neuronal and cardiac excitability, regulate myelin sheath length. Using both <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> approaches, we show that oligodendrocytes abundantly express functional, predominantly HCN2 subunit-containing ion channels. These HCN ion channels retain key pharmacological and biophysical features and regulate the resting membrane potential of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Further, reduction of their function via pharmacological blockade or generation of transgenic mice with two independent oligodendrocyte-specific HCN2 knock-out strategies reduced myelin sheath length. We conclude that HCN2 ion channels are key determinants of myelin sheath length in the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin sheath length is a critical determinant of axonal conduction velocity, but the signaling mechanisms responsible for determining sheath length are poorly understood. Here we find that oligodendrocytes express functional hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated 2 (HCN2) ion channels that regulate the length of myelin sheaths formed by oligodendrocytes in myelinating cultures and in the mouse brain and spinal cord. These results suggest that the regulation of HCN2 channel activity is well placed to refine sheath length and conduction along myelinated axons, providing a potential mechanism for alterations in conduction velocity and circuit function in response to axonal signals such as those generated by increased activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{mu}-Opioid Receptor (Oprm1) Copy Number Influences Nucleus Accumbens Microcircuitry and Reciprocal Social Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>The &mu;-opioid receptor regulates reward derived from both drug use and natural experiences, including social interaction, through actions in the nucleus accumbens. Here, we studied nucleus accumbens microcircuitry and social behavior in male and female mice with heterozygous genetic knockout of the &mu;-opioid receptor (Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup>). This genetic condition models the partial reduction of &mu;-opioid receptor signaling reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders. We first analyzed inhibitory synapses in the nucleus accumbens, using methods that differentiate between medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. Inhibitory synaptic transmission was increased in D2-MSNs of male mutants, but not female mutants, while the expression of gephyrin mRNA and the density of inhibitory synaptic puncta at the cell body of D2-MSNs was increased in mutants of both sexes. Some of these changes were more robust in Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mutants than Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants, demonstrating that partial reductions of &mu;-opioid signaling can have large effects. At the behavioral level, social conditioned place preference and reciprocal social interaction were diminished in Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> and Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants of both sexes. Interaction with Oprm1 mutants also altered the social behavior of wild-type test partners. We corroborated this latter result using a social preference task, in which wild-type mice preferred interactions with another typical mouse over Oprm1 mutants. Surprisingly, Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice preferred interactions with other Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants, although these interactions did not produce a conditioned place preference. Our results support a role for partial dysregulation of &mu;-opioid signaling in social deficits associated with neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activation of the &mu;-opioid receptor plays a key role in the expression of normal social behaviors. In this study, we examined brain function and social behavior of female and male mice, with either partial or complete genetic deletion of &mu;-opioid receptor expression. We observed abnormal social behavior following both genetic manipulations, as well as changes in the structure and function of synaptic input to a specific population of neurons in the nucleus accumbens, which is an important brain region for social behavior. Synaptic changes were most robust when &mu;-opioid receptor expression was only partially lost, indicating that small reductions in &mu;-opioid receptor signaling can have a large impact on brain function and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneous Multimodal Neural Transmission Suggests That Adult Spinal Networks Maintain an Intrinsic State of Readiness to Execute Sensorimotor Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spontaneous action potential discharge (spAP) is both ubiquitous and functionally relevant during neural development. spAP remains a prominent feature of supraspinal networks in maturity, even during unconsciousness. Evidence suggests that spAP persists in mature spinal networks during wakefulness, and one function of spAP in this context could be maintenance of a "ready state" to execute behaviors. The extent to which spAP persists in mature spinal networks during unconsciousness remains unclear, and its function(s), if any, are likewise unresolved. Here, we attempt to reconcile some of the questions and contradictions that emerge from the disintegrated picture of adult spinal spAP currently available. We recorded simultaneously from large populations of spinal interneurons <I>in vivo</I> in male rats, characterizing the spatial distribution of spAP in the lumbar enlargement and identifying subgroups of spontaneously active neurons. We find (1) concurrent spAP throughout the dorsoventral extent of the gray matter, with a diverse yet strikingly consistent mixture of neuron types across laminae; (2) the proportion of neurons exhibiting spAP in deeper, sensorimotor integrative regions is comparable to that in more superficial, sensory-dominant regions; (3) firing rate, but not spike train variability, varies systematically with region; and (4) spAP includes multimodal neural transmission consistent with executing a spinally-mediated behavior. These findings suggest that adult spAP may continue to support a state of readiness to execute sensorimotor behaviors even during unconsciousness. Such functionality has implications for our understanding of how perception is translated into action, of experience-dependent modification of behavior, and (mal)adaptative responses to injury or disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons often discharge action potentials (APs) seemingly spontaneously, that is, in the absence of ongoing behaviors or overt stimuli. This phenomenon is particularly evident during neural development, where spontaneous AP discharge (spAP) is ubiquitous in the central nervous system and is crucial to establishing connectivity among functionally related groups of neurons. The function(s) of spAP in adult spinal networks, if any, have remained enigmatic, especially during unconsciousness. Here, we report evidence that one such function could be to support an intrinsic state of readiness to execute sensorimotor behaviors. This finding has implications for our understanding of how perception is translated into action, of experience-dependent modification of behavior, and (mal)adaptative responses to injury or disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency Selectivity of Persistent Cortical Oscillatory Responses to Auditory Rhythmic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical oscillations have been proposed to play a functional role in speech and music perception, attentional selection, and working memory, via the mechanism of neural entrainment. One of the properties of neural entrainment that is often taken for granted is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. We tested the existence of this phenomenon by studying cortical neural oscillations during and after presentation of melodic stimuli in a passive perception paradigm. Melodies were composed of ~60 and ~80 Hz tones embedded in a 2.5 Hz stream. Using intracranial and surface recordings in male and female humans, we reveal persistent oscillatory activity in the high- band in response to the tones throughout the cortex, well beyond auditory regions. By contrast, in response to the 2.5 Hz stream, no persistent activity in any frequency band was observed. We further show that our data are well captured by a model of damped harmonic oscillator and can be classified into three classes of neural dynamics, with distinct damping properties and eigenfrequencies. This model provides a mechanistic and quantitative explanation of the frequency selectivity of auditory neural entrainment in the human cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been proposed that the functional role of cortical oscillations is subtended by a mechanism of entrainment, the synchronization in phase or amplitude of neural oscillations to a periodic stimulation. One of the properties of neural entrainment that is often taken for granted is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. Using intracranial and surface recordings of humans passively listening to rhythmic auditory stimuli, we reveal consistent oscillatory responses throughout the cortex, with persistent activity of high- oscillations. On the contrary, neural oscillations do not outlast low-frequency acoustic dynamics. We interpret our results as reflecting harmonic oscillator properties, a model ubiquitous in physics but rarely used in neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">History Modulates Early Sensory Processing of Salient Distractors</a></h4>

              
                <p>To find important objects, we must focus on our goals, ignore distractions, and take our changing environment into account. This is formalized in models of visual search whereby goal-driven, stimulus-driven, and history-driven factors are integrated into a priority map that guides attention. Stimulus history robustly influences where attention is allocated even when the physical stimulus is the same: when a salient distractor is repeated over time, it captures attention less effectively. A key open question is how we come to ignore salient distractors when they are repeated. Goal-driven accounts propose that we use an active, expectation-driven mechanism to attenuate the distractor signal (e.g., predictive coding), whereas stimulus-driven accounts propose that the distractor signal is attenuated because of passive changes to neural activity and inter-item competition (e.g., adaptation). To test these competing accounts, we measured item-specific fMRI responses in human visual cortex during a visual search task where trial history was manipulated (colors unpredictably switched or were repeated). Consistent with a stimulus-driven account of history-based distractor suppression, we found that repeated singleton distractors were suppressed starting in V1, and distractor suppression did not increase in later visual areas. In contrast, we observed signatures of goal-driven target enhancement that were absent in V1, increased across visual areas, and were not modulated by stimulus history. Our data suggest that stimulus history does not alter goal-driven expectations, but rather modulates canonically stimulus-driven sensory responses to contribute to a temporally integrated representation of priority.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual search refers to our ability to find what we are looking for in a cluttered visual world (e.g., finding your keys). To perform visual search, we must integrate information about our goals (e.g., "find the red keychain"), the environment (e.g., salient items capture your attention), and changes to the environment (i.e., stimulus history). Although stimulus history impacts behavior, the neural mechanisms that mediate history-driven effects remain debated. Here, we leveraged fMRI and multivariate analysis techniques to measure history-driven changes to the neural representation of items during visual search. We found that stimulus history influenced the representation of a salient "pop-out" distractor starting in V1, suggesting that stimulus history operates via modulations of early sensory processing rather than goal-driven expectations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Processing of Arithmetic and Simple Sentences in an Auditory Attention Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical processing of arithmetic and of language rely on both shared and task-specific neural mechanisms, which should also be dissociable from the particular sensory modality used to probe them. Here, spoken arithmetical and non-mathematical statements were employed to investigate neural processing of arithmetic, compared with general language processing, in an attention-modulated cocktail party paradigm. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded from 22 human subjects listening to audio mixtures of spoken sentences and arithmetic equations while selectively attending to one of the two speech streams. Short sentences and simple equations were presented diotically at fixed and distinct word/symbol and sentence/equation rates. Critically, this allowed neural responses to acoustics, words, and symbols to be dissociated from responses to sentences and equations. Indeed, the simultaneous neural processing of the acoustics of words and symbols was observed in auditory cortex for both streams. Neural responses to sentences and equations, however, were predominantly to the attended stream, originating primarily from left temporal, and parietal areas, respectively. Additionally, these neural responses were correlated with behavioral performance in a deviant detection task. Source-localized temporal response functions (TRFs) revealed distinct cortical dynamics of responses to sentences in left temporal areas and equations in bilateral temporal, parietal, and motor areas. Finally, the target of attention could be decoded from MEG responses, especially in left superior parietal areas. In short, the neural responses to arithmetic and language are especially well segregated during the cocktail party paradigm, and the correlation with behavior suggests that they may be linked to successful comprehension or calculation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural processing of arithmetic relies on dedicated, modality independent cortical networks that are distinct from those underlying language processing. Using a simultaneous cocktail party listening paradigm, we found that these separate networks segregate naturally when listeners selectively attend to one type over the other. Neural responses in the left temporal lobe were observed for both spoken sentences and equations, but the latter additionally showed bilateral parietal activity consistent with arithmetic processing. Critically, these responses were modulated by selective attention and correlated with task behavior, consistent with reflecting high-level processing for speech comprehension or correct calculations. The response dynamics show task-related differences that were used to reliably decode the attentional target of sentences or equations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">VTA and Anterior Hippocampus Target Dissociable Neocortical Networks for Post-Novelty Enhancements</a></h4>

              
                <p>The detection of novelty indicates changes in the environment and the need to update existing representations. In response to novelty, interactions across the VTA-hippocampal circuit support experience-dependent plasticity in the hippocampus. While theories have broadly suggested plasticity-related changes are also instantiated in the cortex, research has also shown evidence for functional heterogeneity in cortical networks. It therefore remains unclear how the hippocampal-VTA circuit engages cortical networks, and whether novelty targets specific cortical regions or diffuse, large-scale cortical networks. To adjudicate the role of the VTA and hippocampus in cortical network plasticity, we used fMRI to compare resting-state functional coupling before and following exposure to novel scene images in human subjects of both sexes. Functional coupling between right anterior hippocampus and VTA was enhanced following novelty exposure. However, we also found evidence for a double dissociation, with anterior hippocampus and VTA showing distinct patterns of post-novelty functional coupling enhancements, targeting task-relevant regions versus large-scale networks, respectively. Further, significant correlations between these networks and the novelty-related plasticity in the anterior hippocampal-VTA functional network suggest that the central hippocampal-VTA network may facilitate the interactions with the cortex. These findings support an extended model of novelty-induced plasticity, in which novelty elicits plasticity-related changes in both local and global cortical networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Novelty detection is critical for adaptive behavior, signaling the need to update existing representations. By engaging the bidirectional hippocampal-VTA circuit, novelty has been shown to induce plasticity-related changes in the hippocampus. However, it remains an open question how novelty targets such plasticity-related changes in cortical networks. We show that anterior hippocampus and VTA target cortical networks at different spatial scales, with respective enhancements in post-novelty functional coupling with a task-relevant cortical region and a large-scale memory network. The results presented here support an extended model of novelty-related plasticity, in which engaging the anterior hippocampal-VTA circuit through novelty exposure propagates cortical plasticity through hippocampal and VTA functional pathways at distinct scales, targeting specific or diffuse cortical networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dorsolateral Striatal Task-initiation Bursts Represent Past Experiences More than Future Action Plans</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is involved in learning and executing procedural actions. Cell ensembles in the DLS, but not the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), exhibit a burst of firing at the start of a well-learned action sequence ("task-bracketing"). However, it is currently unclear what information is contained in these bursts. Some theories suggest that these bursts should represent the procedural action sequence itself (that they should be about future action chains), whereas others suggest that they should contain representations of the current state of the world, taking into account primarily past information. In addition, the DLS local field potential shows transient bursts of power in the 50 Hz range (50) around the time a learned action sequence is initiated. However, it is currently unknown how bursts of activity in DLS cell ensembles and bursts of 50 power in the DLS local field potential are related to each other. We found that DLS bursts at lap initiation in rats represented recently experienced reward locations more than future procedural actions, indicating that task-initiation DLS bursts contain primarily retrospective, rather than prospective, information to guide procedural actions. Furthermore, representations of past reward locations increased during periods of increased 50 power in the DLS. There was no evidence of task-initiation bursts, increased 50 power, or retrospective reward location information in the neighboring dorsomedial striatum. These data support a role for the DLS in model-free theories of procedural decision-making over planned action-chain theories, suggesting that procedural actions derive from representations of the current and recent past.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While it is well-established that the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) plays a critical role in procedural decision-making, open questions remain about the kinds of representations contained in DLS ensemble activity that guide procedural actions. We found that DLS, but not DMS, cell ensembles contained nonlocal representations of past reward locations that appear moments before task-initiation DLS bursts. These retrospective representations were temporally linked to a rise in 50 power that also preceded the characteristic DLS burst at task-initiation. These results support models of procedural decision-making based on associations between available actions and the current state of the world over models based on planning over action-chains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Role of Inferior Frontal Junction (IFJ) in the Control of Feature versus Spatial Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Feature-based visual attention refers to preferential selection and processing of visual stimuli based on their nonspatial attributes, such as color or shape. Recent studies have highlighted the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) as a control region for feature but not spatial attention. However, the extent to which IFJ contributes to spatial versus feature attention control remains a topic of debate. We investigated in humans of both sexes the role of IFJ in the control of feature versus spatial attention in a cued visual spatial (attend-left or attend-right) and feature (attend-red or attend-green) attention task using fMRI. Analyzing cue-related fMRI using both univariate activation and multivoxel pattern analysis, we found the following results in IFJ. First, in line with some prior studies, the univariate activations were not different between feature and spatial attentional control. Second, in contrast, the multivoxel pattern analysis decoding accuracy was above chance level for feature attention (attend-red vs attend-green) but not for spatial attention (attend-left vs attend-right). Third, while the decoding accuracy for feature attention was above chance level during attentional control in the cue-to-target interval, it was not during target processing. Fourth, the right IFJ and visual cortex (V4) were observed to be functionally connected during feature but not during spatial attention control, and this functional connectivity was positively associated with subsequent attentional selection of targets in V4, as well as with behavioral performance. These results support a model in which IFJ plays a crucial role in top-down control of visual feature but not visual spatial attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Past work has shown that the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), a prefrontal structure, is activated by both attention-to-feature (e.g., color) and attention-to-location, but the precise role of IFJ in the control of feature- versus spatial-attention is debated. We investigated this issue in a cued visual spatial (attend-left or attend-right) and feature (attend-red or attend-green) attention task using fMRI, multivoxel pattern analysis, and functional connectivity methods. The results show that (1) attend-red versus attend-green can be decoded in single-trial cue-evoked BOLD activity in IFJ but not attend-left versus attend-right and (2) only right IFJ modulates V4 to enhance task performance. This study sheds light on the function and hemispheric specialization of IFJ in the control of visual attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anterior Cingulate Cortex Ablation Disrupts Affective Vigor and Vigilance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite many observations of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity related to cognition and affect in humans and nonhuman animals, little is known about the causal role of the ACC in psychological processes. Here, we investigate the causal role of the ACC in affective responding to threat in rhesus monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>), a species with an ACC largely homologous to humans in structure and connectivity. Male adult monkeys received bilateral ibotenate axon-sparing lesions to the ACC (sulcus and gyrus of areas 24, 32, and 25) and were tested in two classic tasks of monkey threat processing: the human intruder and object responsiveness tasks. Monkeys with ACC lesions did not significantly differ from controls in their overall mean reactivity toward threatening or novel stimuli. However, while control monkeys maintained their reactivity across test days, monkeys with ACC lesions reduced their reactivity toward stimuli as days advanced. Critically, this attenuated reactivity was found even when the stimuli presented each day were novel, suggesting that ACC lesions did not simply cause accelerated adaptation to stimuli as they became less novel over repeated presentations. Rather, these results imply that the primate ACC is necessary for maintaining appropriate affective responses toward potentially harmful and/or novel stimuli. These findings therefore have implications for mood disorders in which responding to threat and novelty is disrupted.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decades of research in humans and nonhuman animals have investigated the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in a huge number and variety of psychological processes spanning cognition and affect, as well as in psychological and neurologic diseases. The structure is broadly implicated in psychological processes and mental and neurologic health, yet its causal role in these processes has largely gone untested, particularly in primates. Here we demonstrate that when anterior cingulate cortex is completely eliminated, rhesus monkeys are initially responsive to threats, but these responses attenuate rather than persist, resembling a pattern of behavior commonly seen in patients diagnosed with mood disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">C-Boutons and Their Influence on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease with progressive motor neuron death, where patients usually die within 5 years of diagnosis. Previously, we showed that the C-boutons, which are large cholinergic synapses to motor neurons that modulate motor neuron activity, are necessary for behavioral compensation in <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice, a mouse model for ALS. We reasoned that, since the C-boutons likely increase the excitability of surviving motor neurons to compensate for motor neuron loss during ALS disease progression, then amplitude modulation through the C-boutons likely increases motor neuron stress and worsens disease progression. By comparing male and female <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice to <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice with genetically silenced C-boutons [<I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I>; <I>Dbx1::cre</I>; <I>ChAT<sup>fl/fl</sup></I> (<I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>/C<sup>off</sup></I>)], we show that the C-boutons do not influence the humane end point of <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice; however, our histologic analysis shows that C-bouton silencing significantly improves fast-twitch muscle innervation over time. Using immunohistology, we also show that the C-boutons are active in a task-dependent manner, and that symptomatic <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice show significantly higher C-bouton activity than wild-type mice during low-intensity walking. Last, by using behavioral analysis, we provide evidence that C-bouton silencing in combination with swimming is beneficial for the behavioral capabilities of <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice. Our observations suggest that manipulating the C-boutons in combination with a modulatory-targeted training program may therefore be beneficial for ALS patients and could result in improved mobility and quality of life.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite decades of research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there have been little improvements in treatments and therapies. We sought to better understand how the activation of C-boutons, which are large cholinergic modulatory synapses on motor neurons, change and affect the disease as it progresses. When these C-boutons are genetically silenced and exercises designed to otherwise activate the C-boutons are frequently performed in ALS model mice, the mice perform better than their untreated counterparts over time. C-bouton-targeted therapies could therefore be beneficial for ALS patients and could result in improved mobility and quality of life.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">University-Industry R&D Alliances – An Exploration of Alliance Capabilities Measures [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alliance capabilities studies have long emerged since the 1990s, focusing mainly on firm-to-firm collaboration. However, research on university-industry alliances only emerged from the 2000s. Alliance capabilities are portrayed as a crucial condition to achieve the targeted collaboration outcomes and sustainable relationships. As most alliance capabilities studies focus on firm-to-firm collaboration, research on university-industry R&D alliance is still scarce. Thus, the measurement items for alliance capabilities in the university-industry R&D context are still under-developed. Thus, to investigate how alliance capabilities affect university-industry R&D performance in Malaysia, the relevant measures must first be defined. This paper intends to properly define the measurement items for alliance capabilities in the context of university-industry R&D alliances. Methodology: The alliance capabilities measures are adapted from various literature to accommodate both university and industry perspectives. In finalizing the measurement, in-depth pre-testing was conducted by five strategic management subject matter experts in ensuring face and content validity. Results: There are three alliance capability dimensions. The first dimension is alliance management capability which includes goal setting, process configuration, alliance structure, coordination, management support, and alliance evaluation. The second dimension is alliance integration capability which incorporates relational capabilities, inter-organizational communication, relational capital, and project team effectiveness. The third is alliance learning capability which measures alliance experience, knowledge articulation, knowledge sharing, knowledge codification, internalization, and relationship learning. Although this study successfully develops a set of measurement items for alliance capabilities in university-industry R&D, further statistical analysis is required to test this scale. Conclusion: To date, quantitative measurement items for alliance capabilities in the context of university-industry R&D alliances are still at the infancy stage. Although the measurements are yet to be statistically analyzed, they can be used as a benchmark for future university-industry R&D alliances studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors related to depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in two coastal regions of Peru: An analytical cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and their aggravation have been studied extensively in the general population. However, there are few studies on depression in older adults and the few existing results may be contradictory, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with depression in older adults in two coastal regions of Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study uses an analytical cross-sectional design in a population of older adults, who participated in a non-governmental ambulatory social support program in Callao and Ica, two coastal regions of Peru. We administered an on-site structured questionnaire to record sociodemographic data, the Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage to measure depression, and the Barthel Index to assess physical function. In order to determine cognitive impairment as an exclusion criterion, the MEC-30 was used. The association between variables was assessed through contingency tables, using the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI) and the X2 test. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Out of the 244 older adults surveyed, 39% had depressive symptoms, of which 28.3% (n=69) and 10.7% (n=26) were moderately and severely depressive, respectively. The findings significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms were being 76 years old or older [p=0.005, OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29-4.20], not participating in weekly recreational activities [p=0.004, OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.31-3.99] and the presence of comorbidities [p=0.026, OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.29]. Conclusion: There are few studies exploring depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic; this research shows the importance of mental health care in this population and, particularly, of those who are 76 or older because they suffer from comorbid conditions and have interrupted recreational activities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hygienic knowledge and practices of milk vending machine handlers in the informal settlements of Nairobi, Kenya [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Poor milk handling practices due to lack of knowledge or deliberate adulteration compromises the safety of milk and that of the consumer. With the increase of milk vending machines in informal settlements, the knowledge and practices of vendors concerning milk hygiene are critical in determining milk safety. The operation of milk vending machines is guided by strict regulations that aim at ensuring proper practices among milk handlers, but the level of implementation among milk vendors is questionable. This study sought to establish hygienic knowledge and handling practices of vendors operating milk vending machines in Nairobi’s informal settlements of Kibra and Dagoretti North. Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, 37 milk vendors were interviewed at the study setting with the aid of questionnaires. Data was then recorded in datasheets and analyzed using frequencies, correlation, and t-test with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. Results: The mean percentage score for knowledge and practices was 68.83% and 54.05%, respectively. The knowledge and practices of vendors significantly improved with the increase in their level of education (p=0.04 and p=0.02). There was a significantly positive correlation between knowledge and practices (r=0.626, p=0.000). Conclusions: There is a low level of hygienic knowledge and poor practices among vendors operating milk vending machines in the study area. The efforts by the regulator to ensure proper implementation of the regulations was also not sufficient. Training is required to improve the hygienic knowledge and practices of milk vending machine handlers in informal settlements. Frequent inspections should also be carried out in the informal settlements to ensure proper implementation of regulations on the operation of milk vending machines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nutrient loading and farm characteristics of giant gourami fish aquaculture systems in Lake Maninjau, Indonesia: basic knowledge of production performance [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Aquaculture systems for giant gourami, Osphronemus goramy Lacepède (1801), have significantly improved fish production yields and food security in Indonesia. However, these systems also cause serious problems in terms of eutrophication in waterbodies. This study analysed the nutrient loading and farm characteristics of giant gourami in floating cages in Lake Maninjau. Method A total of 20 floating cages were used to record these nutrients in feed supply, female and male juvenile fish, dead fish and harvested fish to estimate nutrient loading. Data on the harvested fish, production cycle, stock number and cage capacity were used to estimate the stocking density, feeding rate, feed efficiency, and net fish yield, and the relationship between feed supply and nutrient loading and farm characteristics was analysed by least squares regression methods. Results A total of 20 floating cages released nutrients into waterbodies at an average rate of 236.27±60.44 kg/cycle for C, 84.52±20.86 kg/cycle for N and 8.70±3.63 kg/cycle for P. On average, fish production for each floating cage (±SD) was 1226±282 kg wet weight/cycle, and the net fish yield was 12.63±2.82 kg/m3/cycle. Survival rates ranged from 86.33 to 95.27%/cycle. The production cycles varied from 160 to 175 days with feed conversion ratios between 1.60 and 1.75, feed conversion efficiencies were between 0.58 and 0.63. The production parameters that had strong relationships with the net fish yield were feed supply (r2=0.960), stocking rates (r2=0.924) and feeding rates (r2=0.961). In contrast, the length of the production cycle was not strongly related to the net fish yield (r2=0.187). Conclusion Nutrient loading from the supplied feed was greater than that from the harvested fish, juvenile fish and dead fish. Increasing the net fish yield in floating cages was better predicted by the stocking densities and feeding levels than by the other factors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Physical rehabilitation versus no physical rehabilitation after total hip and knee arthroplasties: Protocol for a pragmatic, randomized, controlled, superiority trial (The DRAW1 trial) [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Following total hip- and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA), post-discharge physical rehabilitation is common practice, but varies significantly regarding content, duration, intensity and mode of delivery. Recent systematic reviews have found home-based rehabilitation to be as good as outpatient rehabilitation in terms of pain and physical function. We therefore wonder if physical rehabilitation “works” at all when compared to no physical rehabilitation after THA and TKA – “no rehabilitation” defined as no prescribed therapeutic rehabilitation exercises. The purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness of home-based telerehabilitation, home-based rehabilitation and no physical rehabilitation following THA and TKA.  Methods: This pragmatic, randomized controlled trial will include 168 patients following discharge after THA or TKA, in Bornholm Denmark. Patients will be randomized into one of the three 6-week rehabilitation strategies: home-based telerehabilitation, home-based rehabilitation or no physical rehabilitation. The trial is designed as a superiority trial to test the hypothesis that rehabilitation (home-based telerehabilitation and home-based rehabilitation) is superior to no physical rehabilitation. The primary outcome will be the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS)/ the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS)-subscale: function of daily living at first follow-up (end of the 6-weeks' intervention). Additional follow-ups are scheduled at 3 and 12 months. Outcome assessors and data analysts are blinded to group allocation. Conclusions: Knowledge about the effectiveness of the three investigated rehabilitation strategies will help guide the future organization of post-discharge rehabilitation after THA and TKA.

                Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a widely distributed human pathogen that is known for its ulcerative lesions at the infection site. HSV can cause persistent infection in the host that is often followed by a period of latency within the neurons. Considering the high rate of HIV infection in South Africa, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of HSV with a focus to determine the epidemiological association between HSV-DNA and HIV-1 in the population. Methods: A total of 44 sera samples were screened for HSV and HIV-1 using the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA positive samples were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the positivity of both viruses and to further differentiate HSV into HSV-1 and -2. Thereafter, the samples were analysed for relatedness using phylogenetic analysis. Results: Of the 44 samples, 36 (81.8%) were positive for HIV-1, while 35 (79.5%) were positive for HSV when screened with ELISA kits. The PCR results, with the use of type specific primers, showed that 4/35 (11.4%) samples were specific for HSV-1 while 30/35 (85.7%) were specific for HSV-2. Statistical analysis performed using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test showed that there is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 transmission. Conclusions: The prevalence of HSV in the population is high with an increased HSV-2 infection in women. Our study shows that some of the HSV-2 isolates are not related to the clinical isolate SD90e from South Africa, suggesting diversity in HSV-2 viral transmission.

Recent neuroscience studies demonstrate that a deeper understanding of brain function requires a deeper understanding of behavior. Detailed behavioral measurements are now often collected using video cameras, resulting in an increased need for computer vision algorithms that extract useful information from video data. Here we introduce a new video analysis tool that combines the output of supervised pose estimation algorithms (e.g. DeepLabCut) with unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods to produce interpretable, low-dimensional representations of behavioral videos that extract more information than pose estimates alone. We demonstrate this tool by extracting interpretable behavioral features from videos of three different head-fixed mouse preparations, as well as a freely moving mouse in an open field arena, and show how these interpretable features can facilitate downstream behavioral and neural analyses. We also show how the behavioral features produced by our model improve the precision and interpretation of these downstream analyses compared to using the outputs of either fully supervised or fully unsupervised methods alone.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Emergent spatiotemporal population dynamics with cell-length control of synthetic microbial consortia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James J. Winkle, Bhargav R. Karamched, Matthew R. Bennett, William Ott, Krešimir Josić</p>

The increased complexity of synthetic microbial biocircuits highlights the need for distributed cell functionality due to concomitant increases in metabolic and regulatory burdens imposed on single-strain topologies. Distributed systems, however, introduce additional challenges since consortium composition and spatiotemporal dynamics of constituent strains must be robustly controlled to achieve desired circuit behaviors. Here, we address these challenges with a modeling-based investigation of emergent spatiotemporal population dynamics using cell-length control in monolayer, two-strain bacterial consortia. We demonstrate that with dynamic control of a strain’s division length, nematic cell alignment in close-packed monolayers can be destabilized. We find that this destabilization confers an emergent, competitive advantage to smaller-length strains—but by mechanisms that differ depending on the spatial patterns of the population. We used complementary modeling approaches to elucidate underlying mechanisms: an agent-based model to simulate detailed mechanical and signaling interactions between the competing strains, and a reductive, stochastic lattice model to represent cell-cell interactions with a single rotational parameter. Our modeling suggests that spatial strain-fraction oscillations can be generated when cell-length control is coupled to quorum-sensing signaling in negative feedback topologies. Our research employs novel methods of population control and points the way to programming strain fraction dynamics in consortial synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Learning, visualizing and exploring 16S rRNA structure using an attention-based deep neural network</a></h4>

Recurrent neural networks with memory and attention mechanisms are widely used in natural language processing because they can capture short and long term sequential information for diverse tasks. We propose an integrated deep learning model for microbial DNA sequence data, which exploits convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and attention mechanisms to predict taxonomic classifications and sample-associated attributes, such as the relationship between the microbiome and host phenotype, on the read/sequence level. In this paper, we develop this novel deep learning approach and evaluate its application to amplicon sequences. We apply our approach to short DNA reads and full sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) marker genes, which identify the heterogeneity of a microbial community sample. We demonstrate that our implementation of a novel attention-based deep network architecture, Read2Pheno, achieves read-level phenotypic prediction. Training Read2Pheno models will encode sequences (reads) into dense, meaningful representations: learned embedded vectors output from the intermediate layer of the network model, which can provide biological insight when visualized. The attention layer of Read2Pheno models can also automatically identify nucleotide regions in reads/sequences which are particularly informative for classification. As such, this novel approach can avoid pre/post-processing and manual interpretation required with conventional approaches to microbiome sequence classification. We further show, as proof-of-concept, that aggregating read-level information can robustly predict microbial community properties, host phenotype, and taxonomic classification, with performance at least comparable to conventional approaches. An implementation of the attention-based deep learning network is available at https://github.com/EESI/sequence_attention (a python package) and https://github.com/EESI/seq2att (a command line tool).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Incorporating metadata in HIV transmission network reconstruction: A machine learning feasibility assessment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sepideh Mazrouee, Susan J. Little, Joel O. Wertheim</p>

HIV molecular epidemiology estimates the transmission patterns from clustering genetically similar viruses. The process involves connecting genetically similar genotyped viral sequences in the network implying epidemiological transmissions. This technique relies on genotype data which is collected only from HIV diagnosed and in-care populations and leaves many persons with HIV (PWH) who have no access to consistent care out of the tracking process. We use machine learning algorithms to learn the non-linear correlation patterns between patient metadata and transmissions between HIV-positive cases. This enables us to expand the transmission network reconstruction beyond the molecular network. We employed multiple commonly used supervised classification algorithms to analyze the San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium (PIRC) cohort dataset, consisting of genotypes and nearly 80 additional non-genetic features. First, we trained classification models to determine genetically unrelated individuals from related ones. Our results show that random forest and decision tree achieved over 80% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score by only using a subset of meta-features including age, birth sex, sexual orientation, race, transmission category, estimated date of infection, and first viral load date besides genetic data. Additionally, both algorithms achieved approximately 80% sensitivity and specificity. The Area Under Curve (AUC) is reported 97% and 94% for random forest and decision tree classifiers respectively. Next, we extended the models to identify clusters of similar viral sequences. Support vector machine demonstrated one order of magnitude improvement in accuracy of assigning the sequences to the correct cluster compared to dummy uniform random classifier. These results confirm that metadata carries important information about the dynamics of HIV transmission as embedded in transmission clusters. Hence, novel computational approaches are needed to apply the non-trivial knowledge collected from inter-individual genetic information to metadata from PWH in order to expand the estimated transmissions. We note that feature extraction alone will not be effective in identifying patterns of transmission and will result in random clustering of the data, but its utilization in conjunction with genetic data and the right algorithm can contribute to the expansion of the reconstructed network beyond individuals with genetic data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Interplay between the EMT transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2 regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation and hematopoietic lineage fidelity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jueqiong Wang, Carlos Farkas, Aissa Benyoucef, Catherine Carmichael, Katharina Haigh, Nick Wong, Danny Huylebroeck, Marc P. Stemmler, Simone Brabletz, Thomas Brabletz, Christian M. Nefzger, Steven Goossens, Geert Berx, Jose M. Polo, Jody J. Haigh</p>

The ZEB2 transcription factor has been demonstrated to play important roles in hematopoiesis and leukemic transformation. ZEB1 is a close family member of ZEB2 but has remained more enigmatic concerning its roles in hematopoiesis. Here, we show using conditional loss-of-function approaches and bone marrow (BM) reconstitution experiments that ZEB1 plays a cell-autonomous role in hematopoietic lineage differentiation, particularly as a positive regulator of monocyte development in addition to its previously reported important role in T-cell differentiation. Analysis of existing single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of early hematopoiesis has revealed distinctive expression differences between <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i> in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) differentiation, with <i>Zeb2</i> being more highly and broadly expressed than <i>Zeb1</i> except at a key transition point (short-term HSC [ST-HSC]➔MPP1), whereby <i>Zeb1</i> appears to be the dominantly expressed family member. Inducible genetic inactivation of both <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i> using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated approach leads to acute BM failure at this transition point with increased long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cell numbers and an accompanying decrease in all hematopoietic lineage differentiation. Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data has revealed that ZEB2 acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor involved in restraining mature hematopoietic lineage gene expression programs from being expressed too early in HSPCs. ZEB1 appears to fine-tune this repressive role during hematopoiesis to ensure hematopoietic lineage fidelity. Analysis of Rosa26 locus–based transgenic models has revealed that <i>Zeb1</i> as well as <i>Zeb2</i> cDNA-based overexpression within the hematopoietic system can drive extramedullary hematopoiesis/splenomegaly and enhance monocyte development. Finally, inactivation of <i>Zeb2</i> alone or <i>Zeb1/2</i> together was found to enhance survival in secondary MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models attesting to the oncogenic role of ZEB1/2 in AML.

                Objective: To evaluate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration safety and efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a literature search on PubMed/MEDLINE, medRxiv, EBSCOhost/CINAHL, ProQuest, and Scopus with keywords adjusted to each search engine’s specifications on February 12, 2021. Interventional studies that reviewed MSC efficacy (mortality, hospitalization duration, need for mechanical ventilators, and inflammation markers) and/or safety (adverse events) in COVID-19 patients who were 18 years old or more were included in this study. Study eligibility, data extraction, and study quality assessment were conducted independently by each author. Results: A total of five studies of moderate to high quality with a total of 193 patients were included. One of the three randomized studies included did not apply blinding to either participants or medical professionals. Pooled OR (Odd Ratio) for mortality risk, adverse events incidence, and use of mechanical ventilators for patients on MSC therapy were 0.13 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.68], 0.91 [95% CI: 0.45, 1.86], and 0.42 [95% CI: 0.12, 1.47], respectively. Pooled mean difference for hospitalization duration in the MSC group versus the control was -3.54 [CI 95%: -4.68, -2.40] with 7% heterogeneity. All studies agreed that there was an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decrease of anti-inflammatory markers that were statistically different in the MSC group. Conclusion: Mesenchymal stem cell administration to COVID-19 patients is safe and effective in reducing mortality and hospitalization duration. Furthermore, a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed.

                Background: The increase in aged populations in Malaysia has brought unprecedented challenges to families, policy makers, scholars, and business organisations.  This paper adapted the WHO 2007 framework of features of age-friendly cities to examine age-friendly environment constructs and their linkages with social connectedness from the perspective of Malaysian middle-aged and older adults caring for themselves. Methods: A face-to-face cross-sectional survey was conducted on 402 middle-aged and older adults caring for themselves across selected states in west Malaysia, selected via purposive sampling. Firstly, features of age-friendly cities were explored through exploratory factor analysis involving 82 respondents. Subsequently, structural equation modelling was performed, involving 320 respondents. Results: The results indicated that the constructs of an age-friendly environment were built environment, community support and health services, civic participation, and employment as well as communication and information. The structural model provided evidence that implementing age-friendly initiatives relating to built environment, community support and health services, civic participation and employment as well as communication and information enables the ageing population to improve their connectedness with society. These findings supported the ecological theories, agreeing that age-friendly environments help middle-aged and older adults caring for themselves to increase their adaptability and reduce perceived pressure from the environment. This result was in line with the current literature in which an age-friendly environment is a form of support and an enabling environment to cultivate positive social relationships and connectivity. Conclusions: Creating an age-friendly environment that supports active and healthy living for middle-aged and older adults caring for themselves allows them to continue to share their experiences, knowledge, and wisdom. This is helpful and beneficial for societal well-being and economic development as well as for the future generations.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">The nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound</a></h4>

              
                Hearing is thought to exist only in vertebrates and some arthropods, but not other animal phyla. Here, Xu and colleagues report that the earless nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound and engages in phonotaxis. Thus, hearing might have evolved multiple times independently in the animal kingdom, suggesting convergent evolution.

                He et al. find that DREADD-mediated silencing of CA2 decreases the temporal and informational precision of hippocampal replay. Ripples are less coordinated across CA1 and CA3, and cell assemblies show increased co-activity, both in and out of SWRs. CA2 plays a role in filtering information to be reactivated during replay.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A zebrafish screen reveals Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as neuroprotective via mitochondrial restoration in dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder without effective disease-modifying therapeutics. Here, we establish a chemogenetic dopamine (DA) neuron ablation model in larval zebrafish with mitochondrial dysfunction and robustness suitable for high-content screening. We use this system to conduct an in vivo DA neuron imaging-based chemical screen and identify the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors as significantly neuroprotective. Knockdown of the angiotensin receptor 1 (<i>agtr1</i>) in DA neurons reveals a cell-autonomous mechanism of neuroprotection. DA neuron-specific RNA-seq identifies mitochondrial pathway gene expression that is significantly restored by RAAS inhibitor treatment. The neuroprotective effect of RAAS inhibitors is further observed in a zebrafish Gaucher disease model and <i>Drosophila pink1</i>-deficient PD model. Finally, examination of clinical data reveals a significant effect of RAAS inhibitors in delaying PD progression. Our findings reveal the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of targeting the RAAS pathway for neuroprotection and demonstrate a salient approach that bridges basic science to translational medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Circadian regulation of vertebrate cone photoreceptor function</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotes generally display a circadian rhythm as an adaption to the reoccurring day/night cycle. This is particularly true for visual physiology that is directly affected by changing light conditions. Here we investigate the influence of the circadian rhythm on the expression and function of visual transduction cascade regulators in diurnal zebrafish and nocturnal mice. We focused on regulators of shut-off kinetics such as <i>recoverins, arrestins, opsin kinases, </i>and<i> GTPase-accelerating protein</i> that have direct effects on temporal vision. Transcript as well as protein levels of most analyzed genes show a robust circadian rhythm dependent regulation, which correlates with changes in photoresponse kinetics. Electroretinography demonstrates that photoresponse recovery in zebrafish is delayed in the evening and accelerated in the morning. This physiological rhythmicity is mirrored in visual behaviors, such as optokinetic and optomotor responses. Functional rhythmicity persists in continuous darkness, it is reversed by an inverted light cycle and disrupted by constant light. This is in line with our finding that orthologous gene transcripts from diurnal zebrafish and nocturnal mice are often expressed in an anti-phasic daily rhythm.

                Introduction Huntingtons disease (HD) is a genetic incurable lethal disease. Biomarkers are needed for objective assessment of disease progression. Evidence supports both complex protein aggregation and astrocyte activation in HD. This study assesses the 42 amino acid long amyloid beta (A{beta}42) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as potential biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HD mutation carriers. Methods CSF was obtained from manifest HD patients (ManHD), premanifest HD-gene-expansion carriers (PreHD) and gene-negative controls (controls). Disease Burden Score (DBS) and Total Functional Capacity (TFC) were calculated. Protein concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and intergroup differences were analysed using Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman correlations were calculated to assess disease stage association. Age-adjustment was included in the statistical tests. Results The study enrolled 27 ManHD and 13 PreHD subjects. The number of controls differed in the analysis of A{beta}42 and GFAP (n = 19, and 8 respectively). A{beta}42 levels were higher in ManHD (mean 741 ng/l, SD 361) compared with PreHD (mean 468 ng/l, SD 184) (p= 0.025). Likewise GFAP concentration was higher in ManHD (mean 435 ng/l, SD 255) compared with both PreHD (mean 266 ng/l, SD 92.4)(p = 0.040) and controls (mean 208 ng/l, SD 83.7)(p = 0.011). GFAP correlated with DBS (r = 0.361, p = 0.028), TFC (r = -0.463, p = 0.005), and 5-year risk of onset in PreHD (r = 0.694, p = 0.008). In contrast, there was no correlation between A{beta}42 concentration and DBS, TFC or 5-year risk of onset. Conclusion CSF A{beta}42 levels did not correlate with disease stage suggesting no A{beta}aggregation in HD. GFAP is a potential biomarker in HD with association to disease stage. Validation in larger HD cohorts and potential correlations with clinical phenotype would be of interest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1 mediates β-amyloid-induced tau mislocalization and synaptotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Pathological interactions between beta-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau drive the synapse loss that underlies neural circuit disruption and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reactive astrocytes, displaying altered functions, are also a prominent feature of AD brain. This large and heterogeneous population of cells are increasingly recognised as contributing to early phases of disease. However, the contribution of astrocytes to A{beta}-tau interactions in AD is not well understood. Here we stimulated mouse and human astrocytes with concentrations and species of human A{beta} that mimic those in human AD brain. Astrocyte conditioned medium was collected and immunodepleted of A{beta} before being added to rodent and human neuron cultures. Cytokines, identified in unbiased screens, were also applied to neurons, including following the pre-treatment of neurons with chemokine receptor antagonists. Tau mislocalisation, synaptic markers and dendritic spine numbers were measured in cultured neurons and organotypic brain slice cultures. Conditioned medium from astrocytes stimulated with A{beta} induced tau mislocalisation and exaggerated synaptotoxicity that is recapitulated following spiking of neuron culture medium with recombinant C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1 (CXCL1), a chemokine we show to be upregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain. Antagonism of neuronal C-X-C motof chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), prevented tau mislocalisation and synaptotoxicity in response to CXCL1 and A{beta}-stimulated astrocyte secretions. Our data indicate that astrocytes exacerbate tau mislocalisation and the synaptotoxic effects of A{beta} via interactions of astrovyctic CXCL1 and the neuronal CXCR2 receptor, highlighting this chemokine-receptor pair as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in AD.

                To study how the 22q11.2 deletion predisposes to psychiatric disease, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from deletion carriers and controls, as well as utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce the heterozygous deletion into a control cell line. Upon differentiation into neural progenitor cells, we found the deletion acted in trans to alter the abundance of transcripts associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder. In more differentiated excitatory neurons, altered transcripts encoded presynaptic factors and were associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia, including common (per-SNP heritability p ({tau}_c)= 4.2 x 10-6) and rare, loss of function variants (p = 1.29x10-12). These findings suggest a potential relationship between cellular states, developmental windows and susceptibility to psychiatric conditions with different ages of onset. To understand how the deletion contributed to these observed changes in gene expression, we developed and applied PPItools, which identifies the minimal protein-protein interaction network that best explains an observed set of gene expression alterations. We found that many of the genes in the 22q11.2 interval interact in presynaptic, proteasome, and JUN/FOS transcriptional pathways that underlie the broader alterations in psychiatric risk gene expression we identified. Our findings suggest that the 22q11.2 deletion impacts genes and pathways that may converge with risk loci implicated by psychiatric genetic studies to influence disease manifestation in each deletion carrier.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of touch neurons underlying dopaminergic pleasurable touch and sexual receptivity</a></h4>

              
                Pleasurable touch during social behavior is the key to building familial bonds and meaningful connections. One form of social touch occurs during sex. Although sexual behavior is initiated in part by touch, and touch is ongoing throughout copulation, the identity and role of sensory neurons that transduce sexual touch remain completely unknown. A population of sensory neurons labeled by the G-protein coupled receptor Mrgprb4 detect stroking touch in mice. Here, we study the social relevance of this population by genetically engineering mice to allow activation or ablation of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons and reveal that these neurons are required for sexual receptivity and sufficient to activate reward circuitry. Even in social isolation, optogenetic stimulation of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons through the back skin is sufficient to induce a conditioned place preference and a striking lordosis-like copulatory posture in females. In the absence of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons, female mice no longer find male mounts rewarding: sexual receptivity is supplanted by aggression and a coincident decline in dopaminergic release in the mesolimbic reward pathway. In addition to sexual behavior, Mrgprb4-lineage neurons are also required for social postures induced by female-to-female back touch. Together, these findings reveal a skin-to-brain circuit encoding the rewarding quality of social touch.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-resolution imaging and manipulation of endogenous AMPA receptor surface mobility during synaptic plasticity and learning</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of synaptic neurotransmitter receptor content is a fundamental mechanism for tuning synaptic efficacy during experience-dependent plasticity and behavioral adaptation. However, experimental approaches to track and modify receptor movements in integrated experimental systems are limited. Exploiting AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) as a model, we generated a knock-in mouse expressing the biotin acceptor peptide (AP) tag on the GluA2 extracellular N-terminus. Cell-specific introduction of biotin ligase allows the use of monovalent or tetravalent avidin variants to respectively monitor or manipulate the surface mobility of endogenous AMPAR containing biotinylated AP-GluA2 in neuronal subsets. AMPAR immobilization precluded the expression of long-term potentiation and formation of contextual fear memory, allowing for target-specific control of the expression of synaptic plasticity and animal behavior. The AP tag knock-in model offers unprecedented access to resolve and control the spatiotemporal dynamics of endogenous receptors, and opens new avenues to study the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Educational Attainment Polygenic Scores, Socioeconomic Factors, and Cortical Structure in Children and Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Genome-wide polygenic scores for educational attainment (PGS-EA) and socioeconomic factors, which are correlated with each other, have been consistently associated with academic achievement and general cognitive ability in children and adolescents. Yet, the independent associations of PGS-EA and socioeconomic factors with specific underlying factors at the neural and neurocognitive levels are not well understood. The goal of this study was to examine the unique contributions of PGS-EA and parental education to cortical thickness (CT), cortical surface area (SA), and neurocognitive skills in children and adolescents. Methods: Participants were typically developing children and adolescents (3-21 years of age; 53% male; N = 391). High-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired. PGS-EA were computed based on the most recent genome-wide association study of educational attainment. Sustained attention, inhibitory control, working memory, vocabulary, and episodic memory were measured. Results: PGS-EA and parental education were independently and significantly associated with SA, vocabulary, and attention outcomes but were not associated with CT. Vertex-wise analyses indicated that higher PGS-EA was significantly associated with greater SA in the left medial orbitofrontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus after accounting for parental education. Higher parental education was significantly associated with greater SA in the left parahippocampal gyrus after accounting for PGS-EA. Conclusions: These findings suggest that education-linked genetics may influence SA, particularly in certain frontal regions, leading to variability in academic achievement. Results suggested genetic confounding in associations between parental education and SA in children and adolescents, with these associations remaining significant after controlling for PGS-EA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring neural correlates of behavioral and academic resilience among children in poverty</a></h4>

              
                Children in poverty must contend with systems that do not meet their needs. We explored what, at a neural level, helps explain children's resilience in these contexts. Lower coupling between lateral frontoparietal network (LFPN) and default mode network (DMN)--linked, respectively, to externally- and internally-directed thought--has previously been associated with better cognitive performance. However, we recently found the opposite pattern for children living in poverty. Here, we investigated trajectories of network coupling over ages 9-13, and their relation to academic achievement and attention problems. Critically, we explored if these relations differed meaningfully between children above and below poverty. In a pre-registered study, we analyzed longitudinal data from the first three yearly timepoints of the ABCD Study (N = 8366 children at baseline; 1303 below poverty). As predicted, higher LFPN-DMN connectivity was linked to worse grades and more attentional problems for children living above poverty, while children below poverty showed the opposite tendencies. Moreover, this interaction between LFPN-DMN connectivity and poverty status at baseline was associated with children's grades one year later, even controlling for baseline grades. Together, these findings suggest that network connectivity is differentially predictive of academic performance and attention problems for children above and below poverty.

	<p>Attachment security priming effects therapeutic change in people with depression and anxiety. Preliminary studies indicate that visualising secure attachment memories also reduces paranoia in non-clinical and clinical groups, probably due to a decrease in cognitive fusion. Benefits to clinical populations depend on the sustainability of these effects and the impact on help-seeking behaviours. The combination of paranoia and an insecure-avoidant attachment style is likely to be a particular barrier to help seeking. We used a longitudinal experimental design to test the impact of repeated attachment priming on paranoia, mood and help-seeking intentions and whether cognitive fusion mediates these effects (pre-registration: https://osf.io/5yebw). Seventy-nine people with high levels of non-clinical paranoia, aged 18–50 years (M = 20.53, SD = 4.57), were randomly assigned to a secure or insecure-avoidant priming condition. Participants rehearsed the visualisation prime on four consecutive days and were assessed on standardised measures of paranoia, positive and negative affect, help-seeking intentions and cognitive fusion. A series of mixed-model analyses of variance showed that security priming decreases paranoia, negative affect and cognitive fusion and increases positive affect and help seeking, compared to insecure-avoidant priming. Examining the impact of primed attachment (rather than measured attachment style) allows us to draw conclusions about the causal processes involved; mediation analyses showed indirect effects of the primes on paranoia and negative affect through cognitive fusion. With a growing understanding of (1) the impact of security priming on paranoia, affect and help-seeking behaviours, (2) causal mechanisms and (3) sustainability of effects, security priming may be developed into a viable intervention for clinical populations.</p>

	<p>Anti-contagion measures restricting individual freedom, such as social distancing and wearing a mask, are crucial to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision-making patterns and attitudes about uncertainty can highly influence the adherence to these restrictive measures. Here we investigated the relationship between risky behavior and individual preferences for immediate vs. delayed reward, as indexed by temporal discounting (TD), as well as the association between these measures and confidence in the future, perceived risk and confidence in the containment measures. These measures were collected through an online survey administered on 353 participants at the end of the more restrictive phase of the first Italian lockdown. The results showed an unexpected inverse relationship between the individual pattern of choice preferences and risky behavior, with an overall greater adherence to containment measures in more discounter participants. These findings were interpreted in terms of a reframing process in which behaviors aimed at protecting oneself from contagion turn into immediate gains rather than losses. Interestingly, an excessive confidence in a better future was correlated with a higher tendency to assume risky behavior, thereby highlighting the downside of an overly and blindly optimistic view.</p>

	<p>Adult rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) related to their affective states, potentially providing information about their subjective experiences during behavioral neuroscience experiments. If so, USVs might provide an important link between invasive animal preclinical studies and human studies in which subjective states can be readily queried. Here, we induced USVs in male and female Long Evans rats using acute amphetamine (2 mg/kg), and asked how reversibly inhibiting nucleus accumbens neurons using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) impacts USV production. We analyzed USV characteristics using “Deepsqueak” software, and manually categorized detected calls into four previously defined subtypes. We found that systemic administration of the DREADD agonist clozapine-n-oxide, relative to vehicle in the same rats, suppressed the number of frequency-modulated and trill-containing USVs without impacting high frequency, unmodulated (flat) USVs, nor the small number of low-frequency USVs observed. Using chemogenetics, these results thus confirm that nucleus accumbens neurons are essential for production of amphetamine-induced frequency-modulated USVs. They also support the premise of further investigating the characteristics and subcategories of these calls as a window into the subjective effects of neural manipulations, with potential future clinical applications.</p>

	<p>Pain management necessitates assessment of pain; the gold standard being self-report. Among individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), self-report may be limited and therefore indirect methods for pain assessment are required. A new, internationally agreed upon and user-friendly observational tool was recently published—the Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition (PAIC-15). The current study’s aims were: to test the use of the PAIC-15 in assessing pain among people with IDD and to translate the PAIC-15 into Arabic for dissemination among Arabic-speaking professionals. Pain behavior following experimental pressure stimuli was analyzed among 30 individuals with IDD and 15 typically developing controls (TDCs). Translation of the PAIC followed the forward–backward approach; and reliability between the two versions and between raters was calculated. Observational scores with the PAIC-15 exhibited a stimulus–response relationship with pressure stimulation. Those of the IDD group were greater than those of the TDC group. The overall agreement between the English and Arabic versions was high (ICC = 0.89); single items exhibited moderate to high agreement levels. Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC = 0.92). Both versions of the PAIC-15 are feasible and reliable tools to record pain behavior in individuals with IDD. Future studies using these tools in clinical settings are warranted.</p>

	<p>West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most common mosquito borne cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. Physical and neuro-cognitive recovery from WNND may be prolonged or incomplete leading to chronic cognitive inefficiencies and functional decline. There continues to be no effective treatment of WNV and current management is primarily supportive. The objective of this review is to evaluate the functional outcomes and role of rehabilitation services in subjects with WNND. The charts of five subjects admitted to an acute inpatient brain injury rehabilitation facility from June to December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. (Mean, Range)-Age (64.8, 43–78 years), Admission Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (45.2, 14–63), Discharge FIM (82.2, 61–100), FIM score gain (37, 24–60), Cognitive FIM gain (7, 1–18), Mobility FIM gain (17.4, 13–20), ADL FIM gain (12.6, 4–23); acute brain injury inpatient rehabilitation facility length of stay (LOS) (17.8, 14–21 days); acute hospital LOS (15, 10–22 days). Of the five subjects, three were discharged home, one was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, and one was discharged to an assisted living facility. Subjects with WNND have significant functional decline across all FIM subcategories and may benefit from a course of brain injury-specific acute inpatient rehabilitation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The distribution patterns of a set of conserved brain developmental regulatory transcription factors were analyzed in the forebrain of the basal actinopterygian fish <i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>, consistent with the prosomeric model. In the telencephalon, the pallium was characterized by ventricular expression of Pax6. In the subpallium, the combined expression of Nkx2.1/Islet-1 (Isl1) allowed to propose ventral and dorsal areas, as the septo-pallidal (Nkx2.1/Isl1+) and striatal derivatives (Isl1+) respectively, and a dorsal portion of the striatal derivatives, ventricularly rich in Pax6 and devoid of Isl1 expression. Dispersed Orthopedia (Otp) cells were found in the supracommissural and posterior nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, related to the medial portion of the amygdaloid complex. The preoptic area was identified by the Nkx2.1/Isl1 expression. In the alar hypothalamus, an Otp-expressing territory, lacking Nkx2.1/Isl1, was identified as the paraventricular domain. The adjacent subparaventricular domain was subdivided in a rostral territory expressing Nkx2.1 and an Isl1+ caudal one. In the basal hypothalamus, the tuberal region was defined by the Nkx2.1/Isl1 expression and a rostral Otp-expressing domain was identified. Moreover, the Otp/Nkx2.1 combination showed an additional zone lacking Isl1, tentatively identified as the mamillary area. In the diencephalon, both Pax6 and Isl1 defined the prethalamic domain, and within the basal prosomere 3 scattered Pax6- and Isl1-expressing cells were observed in the posterior tubercle. Finally, a small group of Pax6 cells was observed in the pretectal area. These results improve the understanding of the forebrain evolution and demonstrate that its basic bauplan is present very early in the vertebrate lineage.</p>

                Elevated levels of MUC5AC, one of the major gel-forming mucins in the lungs, are closely associated with chronic obstructive lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis and asthma. It is not known, however, how the structure and/or gel-making properties of MUC5AC contribute to innate lung defense in health and drive the...

                Enzymes possessing the nickel-pincer nucleotide (NPN) cofactor catalyze C2 racemization or epimerization reactions of α-hydroxyacid substrates. LarB initiates synthesis of the NPN cofactor from nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) by performing dual reactions: pyridinium ring C5 carboxylation and phosphoanhydride hydrolysis. Here, we show that LarB uses carbon dioxide, not bicarbonate,...

                Skeletal ciliopathies (e.g., Jeune syndrome, short rib polydactyly syndrome, and Sensenbrenner syndrome) are frequently associated with nephronophthisis-like cystic kidney disease and other organ manifestations. Despite recent progress in genetic mapping of causative loci, a common molecular mechanism of cartilage defects and cystic kidneys has remained elusive. Targeting two ciliary chondrodysplasia...
