	<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can objectively reflect a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional state and have been widely studied in emotion recognition. However, the effective feature fusion and discriminative feature learning from EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS data is challenging. In order to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition, a graph convolution and capsule attention network model (GCN-CA-CapsNet) is proposed. Firstly, EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS signals are collected from 50 subjects induced by emotional video clips. And then, the features of the EEG and fNIRS are extracted; the EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS features are fused to generate higher-quality primary capsules by graph convolution with the Pearson correlation adjacency matrix. Finally, the capsule attention module is introduced to assign different weights to the primary capsules, and higher-quality primary capsules are selected to generate better classification capsules in the dynamic routing mechanism. We validate the efficacy of the proposed method on our emotional EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS dataset with an ablation study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GCN-CA-CapsNet method achieves a more satisfactory performance against the state-of-the-art methods, and the average accuracy can increase by 3&amp;amp;ndash;11%.</p>

	<p>This study investigated relations between a measure of early-stage visual function and self-reported visual anomalies in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Eleven individuals at CHR identified via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS) were recruited from a CHR-P research program in NYC. The sample was ~36% female, ranging from 16 to 33 years old (M = 23.90, SD = 6.14). Participants completed a contrast sensitivity task on an iPad with five spatial frequencies (0.41&amp;amp;ndash;13 cycles/degree) and completed the self-report Audio-Visual Abnormalities Questionnaire. Higher contrast sensitivity (better performance) to low spatial frequencies was associated with higher perceptual (r = 0.616, p = 0.044) and visual disturbances (r = 0.667, p = 0.025); lower contrast sensitivity to a middle spatial frequency was also associated with higher perceptual (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.604, p = 0.049) and visual disturbances (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.606, p = 0.048). This relation between the questionnaire and contrast sensitivity to low spatial frequency may be indicative of a reduction in lateral inhibition and &amp;amp;ldquo;flooding&amp;amp;rdquo; of environmental stimuli. The association with middle spatial frequencies, which play a critical role in face processing, may result in a range of perceptual abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that self-reported perceptual anomalies occur in these individuals and are linked to performance on a measure of early visual processing.</p>

                Background In Australia, we are not meeting our goals in relation to breastfeeding overall, and in particular, promoting and supporting breastfeeding rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies especially breastfeeding to at least six months. The WHO has recognised the importance of exclusively breastfeeding a baby for a minimum of six months to ensure a healthy start to life. Breastfeeding has been shown to be a protective factor against asthma and allergy development, ear disease, infections, respiratory illness and gastrointestinal issues. This study aims to improve predominant breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies in the Perth Metropolitan area (Western Australia, Australia). Methods and analysis We will use an interrupted time series design to determine the effectiveness of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program delivered over 6 months by selected community health staff. The intervention will be delivered at two community health regions and the remaining 17 community health regions will be the control group. The primary outcomes will be predominant breastfeeding rates at two and four months, and secondary outcomes will include any breastfeeding at two and four months, and hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and immunisation data at 6 months. Discussion The study will allow us to determine the breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal babies, identify the barriers and enablers to initiating and maintaining breastfeeding and determine whether a CQI program can achieve improvements in breastfeeding rates.

                <p>by Scott L. Nuismer, Andrew J. Basinski, Courtney L. Schreiner, Evan A. Eskew, Elisabeth Fichet-Calvet, Christopher H. Remien</p>

Reducing spillover of zoonotic pathogens is an appealing approach to preventing human disease and minimizing the risk of future epidemics and pandemics. Although the immediate human health benefit of reducing spillover is clear, over time, spillover reduction could lead to counterintuitive negative consequences for human health. Here, we use mathematical models and computer simulations to explore the conditions under which unanticipated consequences of spillover reduction can occur in systems where the severity of disease increases with age at infection. Our results demonstrate that, because the average age at infection increases as spillover is reduced, programs that reduce spillover can actually increase population-level disease burden if the clinical severity of infection increases sufficiently rapidly with age. If, however, immunity wanes over time and reinfection is possible, our results reveal that negative health impacts of spillover reduction become substantially less likely. When our model is parameterized using published data on Lassa virus in West Africa, it predicts that negative health outcomes are possible, but likely to be restricted to a small subset of populations where spillover is unusually intense. Together, our results suggest that adverse consequences of spillover reduction programs are unlikely but that the public health gains observed immediately after spillover reduction may fade over time as the age structure of immunity gradually re-equilibrates to a reduced force of infection.

                <p>by Rachael Stentiford, James C. Knight, Thomas Nowotny, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

The central complex of insects contains cells, organised as a ring attractor, that encode head direction. The ‘bump’ of activity in the ring can be updated by idiothetic cues and external sensory information. Plasticity at the synapses between these cells and the ring neurons, that are responsible for bringing sensory information into the central complex, has been proposed to form a mapping between visual cues and the heading estimate which allows for more accurate tracking of the current heading, than if only idiothetic information were used. In Drosophila, ring neurons have well characterised non-linear receptive fields. In this work we produce synthetic versions of these visual receptive fields using a combination of excitatory inputs and mutual inhibition between ring neurons. We use these receptive fields to bring visual information into a spiking neural network model of the insect central complex based on the recently published Drosophila connectome. Previous modelling work has focused on how this circuit functions as a ring attractor using the same type of simple visual cues commonly used experimentally. While we initially test the model on these simple stimuli, we then go on to apply the model to complex natural scenes containing multiple conflicting cues. We show that this simple visual filtering provided by the ring neurons is sufficient to form a mapping between heading and visual features and maintain the heading estimate in the absence of angular velocity input. The network is successful at tracking heading even when presented with videos of natural scenes containing conflicting information from environmental changes and translation of the camera.

Enteric pathogens navigate distinct regional microenvironments within the intestine that cue important adaptive behaviors. We investigated the response of <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>, a model of human pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection in mice, to regional gastrointestinal pH. We found that small intestinal pH (4.4–4.8) triggered virulence gene expression and altered cell morphology, supporting initial intestinal attachment, while higher pH, representative of <i>C</i>. <i>rodentium</i>’s replicative niches further along the murine intestine, supported pathogen growth. Gastric pH, a key barrier to intestinal colonization, caused significant accumulation of intra-bacterial reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting growth of <i>C</i>. <i>rodentium</i> and related human pathogens. Within-host adaptation increased gastric acid survival, which may be due to a robust acid tolerance response (ATR) induced at colonic pH. However, the intestinal environment changes throughout the course of infection. We found that murine gastric pH decreases postinfection, corresponding to increased serum gastrin levels and altered host expression of acid secretion-related genes. Similar responses following <i>Salmonella</i> infection may indicate a protective host response to limit further pathogen ingestion. Together, we highlight interlinked bacterial and host adaptive pH responses as an important component of host–pathogen coevolution.

                <p>by Alex E. Yuan, Wenying Shou</p>

In disciplines from biology to climate science, a routine task is to compute a correlation between a pair of time series and determine whether the correlation is statistically significant (i.e., unlikely under the null hypothesis that the time series are independent). This problem is challenging because time series typically exhibit autocorrelation and thus cannot be properly analyzed with the standard iid-oriented statistical tests. Although there are well-known parametric tests for time series, these are designed for linear correlation statistics and thus not suitable for the increasingly popular nonlinear correlation statistics. There are also nonparametric tests that can be used with any correlation statistic, but for these, the conditions that guarantee correct false positive rates are either restrictive or unclear. Here, we describe the truncated time-shift (TTS) test, a nonparametric procedure to test for dependence between 2 time series. We prove that this test correctly controls the false positive rate as long as one of the time series is stationary, a minimally restrictive requirement among current tests. The TTS test is versatile because it can be used with any correlation statistic. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that this test performs correctly even while other tests suffer high false positive rates. In simulation examples, simple guidelines for parameter choices allow high statistical power to be achieved with sufficient data. We apply the test to datasets from climatology, animal behavior, and microbiome science, verifying previously discovered dependence relationships and detecting additional relationships.

Horizontal mitochondrial transfer (HMT) has emerged as a novel phenomenon in cell biology, but it is unclear how this process of intercellular movement of mitochondria is regulated. A new study in <i>PLOS Biology</i> reports that ADP released by stressed cells is a signal that triggers HMT.

                <p>by Kevin Gross, Carl T. Bergstrom</p>

Scientific research requires taking risks, as the most cautious approaches are unlikely to lead to the most rapid progress. Yet, much funded scientific research plays it safe and funding agencies bemoan the difficulty of attracting high-risk, high-return research projects. Why don’t the incentives for scientific discovery adequately impel researchers toward such projects? Here, we adapt an economic contracting model to explore how the unobservability of risk and effort discourages risky research. The model considers a hidden-action problem, in which the scientific community must reward discoveries in a way that encourages effort and risk-taking while simultaneously protecting researchers’ livelihoods against the vicissitudes of scientific chance. Its challenge when doing so is that incentives to motivate effort clash with incentives to motivate risk-taking, because a failed project may be evidence of a risky undertaking but could also be the result of simple sloth. As a result, the incentives needed to encourage effort actively discourage risk-taking. Scientists respond by working on safe projects that generate evidence of effort but that don’t move science forward as rapidly as riskier projects would. A social planner who prizes scientific productivity above researchers’ well-being could remedy the problem by rewarding major discoveries richly enough to induce high-risk research, but in doing so would expose scientists to a degree of livelihood risk that ultimately leaves them worse off. Because the scientific community is approximately self-governing and constructs its own reward schedule, the incentives that researchers are willing to impose on themselves are inadequate to motivate the scientific risks that would best expedite scientific progress.

                <p>by Jessica E. Buddle, Lucy M. Thompson, Anne S. Williams, Rosanna C. T. Wright, William M. Durham, Claire E. Turner, Roy R. Chaudhuri, Michael A. Brockhurst, Robert P. Fagan</p>

<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> is an important human pathogen, for which there are very limited treatment options, primarily the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. In recent years, vancomycin resistance has emerged as a serious problem in several gram-positive pathogens, but high-level resistance has yet to be reported for <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>, although it is not known if this is due to constraints upon resistance evolution in this species. Here, we show that resistance to vancomycin can evolve rapidly under ramping selection but is accompanied by fitness costs and pleiotropic trade-offs, including sporulation defects that would be expected to severely impact transmission. We identified 2 distinct pathways to resistance, both of which are predicted to result in changes to the muropeptide terminal D-Ala-D-Ala that is the primary target of vancomycin. One of these pathways involves a previously uncharacterised D,D-carboxypeptidase, expression of which is controlled by a dedicated two-component signal transduction system. Our findings suggest that while <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> is capable of evolving high-level vancomycin resistance, this outcome may be limited clinically due to pleiotropic effects on key pathogenicity traits. Moreover, our data identify potential mutational routes to resistance that should be considered in genomic surveillance.

Protein import and genome replication are essential processes for mitochondrial biogenesis and propagation. The J-domain proteins Pam16 and Pam18 regulate the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the protozoan <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, their counterparts are TbPam16 and TbPam18, which are essential for the procyclic form (PCF) of the parasite, though not involved in mitochondrial protein import. Here, we show that during evolution, the 2 proteins have been repurposed to regulate the replication of maxicircles within the intricate kDNA network, the most complex mitochondrial genome known. TbPam18 and TbPam16 have inactive J-domains suggesting a function independent of heat shock proteins. However, their single transmembrane domain is essential for function. Pulldown of TbPam16 identifies a putative client protein, termed MaRF11, the depletion of which causes the selective loss of maxicircles, akin to the effects observed for TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover, depletion of the mitochondrial proteasome results in increased levels of MaRF11. Thus, we have discovered a protein complex comprising TbPam18, TbPam16, and MaRF11, that controls maxicircle replication. We propose a working model in which the matrix protein MaRF11 functions downstream of the 2 integral inner membrane proteins TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover, we suggest that the levels of MaRF11 are controlled by the mitochondrial proteasome.

                Purpose To explore how principles of social justice and equity are integrated into research concerning accessibility to public buildings for individuals with mobility disabilities. Methods Utilising a scoping review methodology to assess literature based on the criteria set by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were screened. Studies were selected using the framework: “persons with mobility disabilities” AND “accessibility” AND “public buildings”. A theoretical framework helped to extract codes and develop themes through an inductive-deductive analysis method. The results are presented descriptively. Results The examination of 84 studies uncovered a complex interplay between agencies, systemic challenges, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes perpetuating marginalisation of individuals with mobility disabilities in their access to public buildings. The recommendations emphasize importance of practical measures, research imperatives, and policy developments to promote inclusivity. We present a ‘Ten-step approach’ to integrate social justice and equity into research on accessibility in public buildings for people with mobility disabilities. Conclusion Integrating diversity, active participation, and inclusive methodologies are essential to address systemic issues, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes that hinder accessibility and inclusion. Collaborations with diverse stakeholders are crucial for policy changes, resource allocation, and advancing social justice and equity in accessibility research and practice.

                Background Food security’s multidimensional nature poses challenges in measurement and policy targeting. This comprehensive study explores the nexus between small-scale irrigation and household food security in Raya Kobo Woreda, Ethiopia, in a cross-sectional data. Methods Employing a two-stage sampling technique, the research examines 152 irrigation participants and 196 non-participants. Utilizing descriptive and econometric models, including a binary logit model and propensity score matching. Results The study reveals that 15% of participants and 12% of non-participants are food secure. Descriptive analysis reveals positive correlations between irrigation participation and household food security, dietary diversity, and food consumption scores. Econometric analysis identifies factors influencing participation, such as the age of the household head, family size and tropical livestock units have negative relationship with irrigation participation while the importance of agriculture is found to be positively associated with irrigation participation. Propensity score matching reveals a substantial positive impact on household expenditure, reaffirmed through sensitivity analysis. Conclusion The findings contribute to understanding the complexities of small-scale irrigation in enhancing rural livelihoods and emphasize the importance of targeted interventions for sustained positive outcomes.

                Background Cataracts are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness globally, with a particularly high incidence in diabetic patients due to the complex interplay of metabolic dysregulation and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Diabetic cataract development is influenced by several modifiable risk factors including smoking and hypertension, which may exacerbate lens opacity through various biological mechanisms. This study aims to determine the effects of smoking and hypertension on cataract development in diabetic patients. Methods Conducted from December 2022 to November 2023, this cross-sectional study at a specialized diabetes and ophthalmology healthcare facility involved 60 diabetic patients. The participants were divided into two groups: those with cataracts (n=32) and those without (n=28). Data collection focused on demographics, smoking history, hypertension status, and cataract presence, using structured interviews and medical record reviews. Logistic regression was employed to analyze the association between cataracts and potential risk factors, adjusting for age, diabetes duration, and glycemic control. Results Age and genderfi were not significantly different between the two groups, with mean ages of 50.21±14.34 years in the cataract group and 49.41±12.15 years in the non-cataract group (P=0.087). The prevalence of smoking was similar between those with cataracts (14.3%) and without (15.6%), showing no significant association (P=0.885). Hypertension was more prevalent in the cataract group (71.4%) compared to the non-cataract group (53.1%), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.146). Logistic regression analysis indicated that smoking had a minimal effect on cataract development (OR=1.187; 95% CI=0.264-5.33; P=0.823), and while hypertension showed a stronger association (OR=2.277; 95% CI=0.749-6.92), it also lacked statistical significance (P=0.147). Conclusion Neither smoking nor hypertension showed significant associations with cataract development. These findings suggest that the influence of these factors on cataract progression may differ in diabetic individuals due to the complex interplay of metabolic and vascular changes associated with the condition.

Other biomarkers such as CK-MB have lower sensitivity and specificity. Platelets play a major role in thrombosis, which is a causative factor for most acute coronary syndromes. In our study, we attempted to analyze the effectiveness of platelet indices (mean platelet volume, platelet count, and platelet distribution width) as diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndromes. Our data suggest that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are potential diagnostic markers, and plateletcrits can serve as prognostic markers. Methods A total of 290 subjects were recruited for the study, including 145 cases and 145 controls matched for sex and age. Cases presented with the first episode of acute coronary syndrome. Controls are those without acute coronary syndrome during present admission or in the past. Results MPV and plateletcrit correlated with both troponin T and pro-BNP, whereas PDW showed a positive correlation only with troponin T. The only significant correlation was between the plateletcrit and pro-BNP levels. The plateletcrit showed a positive correlation with other parameters (degree of ventricular dysfunction, severity of coronary artery disease, and presence of arrhythmia). On comparing platelet indices with risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, MPV showed a positive correlation with HbA1c and the entire lipid profile, whereas PDW showed a positive correlation only with HbA1c and triglycerides. The plateletcrit was positively correlated with HbA1c and total cholesterol levels. Conclusions Our data suggest that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are potential diagnostic markers, whereas plateletcrits can serve as prognostic markers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-479/v3?src=rss">Effects of electroacupuncture on cognitive symptoms in major depressive disorder: a pilot study and randomized controlled trial [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research. Trial registration NCT06239740, February 2, 2024, ClinicalTrials.gov.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-924/v1?src=rss">Incentivizing green building technology: A financial perspective on sustainable development in India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Future viability depends on ensuring a sustainable society because green energy methods may efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, stakeholders, consumers, and developers continue to be notably ignorant of the financial incentives connected to green technology. Moreover, there is still a dearth of studies on the range of financial incentives offered by different authorities in India. Monetary incentives, such as tax breaks, indirect tax exemptions, and refunds, are crucial in encouraging the use of green technology in the modern world. This study explores the importance of financial incentives for green building technologies in India, which also looks at the wide range of incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. Furthermore, the study highlights various state government programs such as goods subsidies, exemptions from local taxes, and fee waivers. Notably, several incentives aimed at consumers, developers, and other stakeholders have been implemented by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). This review study emphasizes the effectiveness of financial incentives in green construction projects and draws attention to a clear knowledge gap regarding the adoption of green technology. This study also provides insights into potential future directions. Studies and research results emphasize the importance of spreading the word about financial incentives as a key factor in determining the adoption of green technologies. Many parties, including governmental organizations, municipal governments, developers, and clients engaged in green building technology projects, stand to gain increased awareness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-844/v2?src=rss">Geographic distribution of conversion therapy prevalence in Canada. Findings from a national cross-sectional survey, 2020 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Conversion therapy practices (CTPs) are discredited efforts that target lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, Two-Spirit, or other (LGBTQ2S+) people and seek to change, deny, or discourage their sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of CTPs across Canadian provinces and territories and identify whether CTP bans reduce the prevalence of CTPs. Methods: We collected 119 CTPs from 31 adults (18+) in Canada who have direct experience with CTPs, know people who have gone to CTPs, or know of conversion therapy practitioners using a 2020 anonymous online survey. Mapping analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Online. CTP prevalence was compared between provinces/territories with and without bans using chi-square tests. Results: Three provinces and eleven municipalities had CTP bans. The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories with bans was 2.34 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI 1.65, 3.31). The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories without bans was 4.13 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI 3.32, 5.14). Accounting for the underlying population, provinces/territories with the highest prevalence of CTPs per 1,000,000 population were New Brunswick (6.69), Nova Scotia (6.50), and Saskatchewan (6.37). Conclusions: Findings suggest only 55% of Canadians were protected under CTP bans. The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories without bans was 1.76 times greater than provinces/territories with bans. CTPs are occurring in most provinces/territories, with higher prevalence in the west and the Atlantic. These findings and continued efforts to monitor CTP prevalence can help inform policymakers and legislators as society is increasingly acknowledging CTPs as a threat to the health and well-being of LGBTQ2S+ people.

                Abstract* Background Uncaria nervosa Elmer is an Indonesian herbal plant that is traditionally used for breast cancer. The results of phytochemical screening contained alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the ethanol extract of this plant. Based on literature searches, reports regarding the bioactive compounds responsible for breast cancer have not been found. Further research is needed to understand the potential of Uncaria nervosa Elmer as a breast cancer treatment and to identify the specific compounds responsible for its effects Methods This study aims to determine the metabolite profiling of ethanol extract, the isolation, characterization of bioactive compounds, and their bioactivity in T47D breast cancer cells. The research began by extracting the leaves by maceration using 70% ethanol, and then solid phase extraction was carried out using the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. In this study, the sorbent used was polyamide. The extract was analyzed using a tandem analysis technique based on LCMS using the MZmine and SIRIUS platforms. Isolation was carried out using column chromatography, and preparative recycling HPLC. Bioactive compounds were characterized using UV, HPLC, NMR, and 2D NMR, as well as bioactivity tests using the MTT method. Results The results show that the extract contained N-[(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7-prop-2-ynylpurin-8-yl) amino] formamide, N-(3-phenylbutyl)hexan-2-amine, 1,1-Dichloro-1-nitrosopropane, ceratodictyol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, 7-methyl-N-[6-[(7-methyl-6-oxooctanoyl) amino] hexyl]-6-oxononanamide, Nervisterol and 3,5,10-tris (acetyloxy)-2-hydroxy-4,14,16,16-tetramethyl-8-methylidene-13-oxo-15oxatetracyclo [9.4.1.01,14.04,9] hexadecan-7-yl 3-phenylprop-2-enoate. The ethanol extract of Uncaria nervosa Elmer leaves contains nine compounds consisting of alkaloids, terpenoids, and fatty acid. The bioactive compounds that were successfully isolated were betulinic acid, and ursolic acid, with IC50 values of ˃100 and 14,70±4,50 μg/ml, respectively. These compounds were reported in this plant for the first time. Conclusion Betulinic acid, and ursolic acid have been successfully isolated from leaves Uncaria nervosa Elmer, and ursolic acid have moderate cytotoxic activity on T47D breast cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23631?af=R">Differential role of NMDA receptors in hippocampal‐dependent spatial memory and plasticity in juvenile male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early life, or juvenility, stands out as the most pivotal phase in neurodevelopment due to its profound impact over the long-term cognition. During this period, significant changes are made in the brain's connections both within and between different areas, particularly in tandem with the development of more intricate behaviors. The hippocampus is among the brain regions that undergo significant postnatal remodeling, including dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, the formation of complex spines and neuron proliferation. Given the crucial role of the hippocampus in spatial memory processing, it has been observed that spatial memory abilities continue to develop as the hippocampus matures, particularly before puberty. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor channel is crucial for the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation in both rodents and humans. Although extensive evidence shows the role of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity, the studies addressing the role of NMDAr in spatial memory of juveniles are sparse and mostly limited to adult males. In the present study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMDAr blockade by the MK-801 on spatial memory (novel object location memory, OLM) and hippocampal plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of both male and female juvenile rats. Our results show the sex-dimorphic role of NMDAr in spatial memory and plasticity during juvenility, as systemic NMDAr blockade impairs the OLM and LTP in juvenile males without an effect on juvenile females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity are NMDAr-dependent in juvenile males and NMDAr-independent in juvenile females. These sex-specific differences in the mechanisms of spatial memory and plasticity may imply gender-specific treatment for spatial memory disorders even in children.</p>

                Jipp et al. emphasize the significance of cell-substrate distance fluctuations together with adequate traction forces during collective monolayer motility, caused by basal contractility through actin stress fibers and myosin motors. Imbalances in apical and basal contractility in ZO-1/2 KO cells disrupt persistent, active shape fluctuations and therefore monolayer motility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97327">RGS10 deficiency facilitates distant metastasis by inducing epithelial–mesenchymal transition in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Distant metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Regulator of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins modulates metastasis in various cancers. This study identified a novel role for RGS10 in EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues, and deficiency in RGS10 protein predicted a worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were lower in the highly aggressive cell line MDA-MB-231 than in the poorly aggressive, less invasive cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3. Silencing <i>RGS10</i> in SKBR3 cells enhanced EMT and caused SKBR3 cell migration and invasion. The ability of RGS10 to suppress EMT and metastasis in breast cancer was dependent on lipocalin-2 and <i>MIR539-5p</i>. These findings identify RGS10 as a tumor suppressor, prognostic biomarker, and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93223">OpenNucleome for high-resolution nuclear structural and dynamical modeling</a></h4>

              
                The intricate structural organization of the human nucleus is fundamental to cellular function and gene regulation. Recent advancements in experimental techniques, including high-throughput sequencing and microscopy, have provided valuable insights into nuclear organization. Computational modeling has played significant roles in interpreting experimental observations by reconstructing high-resolution structural ensembles and uncovering organization principles. However, the absence of standardized modeling tools poses challenges for furthering nuclear investigations. We present OpenNucleome—an open-source software designed for conducting GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of the human nucleus. OpenNucleome offers particle-based representations of chromosomes at a resolution of 100 KB, encompassing nuclear lamina, nucleoli, and speckles. This software furnishes highly accurate structural models of nuclear architecture, affording the means for dynamic simulations of condensate formation, fusion, and exploration of non-equilibrium effects. We applied OpenNucleome to uncover the mechanisms driving the emergence of ‘fixed points’ within the nucleus—signifying genomic loci robustly anchored in proximity to specific nuclear bodies for functional purposes. This anchoring remains resilient even amidst significant fluctuations in chromosome radial positions and nuclear shapes within individual cells. Our findings lend support to a nuclear zoning model that elucidates genome functionality. We anticipate OpenNucleome to serve as a valuable tool for nuclear investigations, streamlining mechanistic explorations and enhancing the interpretation of experimental observations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97107">A dynamic generative model can extract interpretable oscillatory components from multichannel neurophysiological recordings</a></h4>

              
                Modern neurophysiological recordings are performed using multichannel sensor arrays that are able to record activity in an increasingly high number of channels numbering in the 100s to 1000s. Often, underlying lower-dimensional patterns of activity are responsible for the observed dynamics, but these representations are difficult to reliably identify using existing methods that attempt to summarize multivariate relationships in a post hoc manner from univariate analyses or using current blind source separation methods. While such methods can reveal appealing patterns of activity, determining the number of components to include, assessing their statistical significance, and interpreting them requires extensive manual intervention and subjective judgment in practice. These difficulties with component selection and interpretation occur in large part because these methods lack a generative model for the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics. Here, we describe a novel component analysis method anchored by a generative model where each source is described by a bio-physically inspired state-space representation. The parameters governing this representation readily capture the oscillatory temporal dynamics of the components, so we refer to it as oscillation component analysis. These parameters – the oscillatory properties, the component mixing weights at the sensors, and the number of oscillations – all are inferred in a data-driven fashion within a Bayesian framework employing an instance of the expectation maximization algorithm. We analyze high-dimensional electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography recordings from human studies to illustrate the potential utility of this method for neuroscience data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95009">Exploring the role of the immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma: Implications for immunotherapy and drug resistance</a></h4>

              
                Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver tumor, is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and the incidence of liver cancer is still increasing worldwide. Curative hepatectomy or liver transplantation is only indicated for a small population of patients with early-stage HCC. However, most patients with HCC are not candidates for radical resection due to disease progression, leading to the choice of the conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug sorafenib as first-line treatment. In the past few years, immunotherapy, mainly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized the clinical strategy for HCC. Combination therapy with ICIs has proven more effective than sorafenib, and clinical trials have been conducted to apply these therapies to patients. Despite significant progress in immunotherapy, the molecular mechanisms behind it remain unclear, and immune resistance is often challenging to overcome. Several studies have pointed out that the complex intercellular communication network in the immune microenvironment of HCC regulates tumor escape and drug resistance to immune response. This underscores the urgent need to analyze the immune microenvironment of HCC. This review describes the immunosuppressive cell populations in the immune microenvironment of HCC, as well as the related clinical trials, aiming to provide insights for the next generation of precision immunotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80622">Plasticity-induced actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft regulates intracellular AMPA receptor trafficking</a></h4>

              
                AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs) are rapidly inserted into synapses undergoing plasticity to increase synaptic transmission, but it is not fully understood if and how AMPAR-containing vesicles are selectively trafficked to these synapses. Here, we developed a strategy to label AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed from their endogenous loci in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and characterized the motion of GluA1-containing vesicles using single-particle tracking and mathematical modeling. We find that GluA1-containing vesicles are confined and concentrated near sites of stimulation-induced structural plasticity. We show that confinement is mediated by actin polymerization, which hinders the active transport of GluA1-containing vesicles along the length of the dendritic shaft by modulating the rheological properties of the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization also facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1-containing vesicles to exocytic sites. We conclude that neurons utilize F-actin to increase vesicular GluA1 reservoirs and promote exocytosis proximal to the sites of synaptic activity.

                Environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming an increasingly important tool in diverse scientific fields from ecological biomonitoring to wastewater surveillance of viruses. The fundamental challenge in eDNA analyses has been the bioinformatical assignment of reads to taxonomic groups. It has long been known that full probabilistic methods for phylogenetic assignment are preferable, but unfortunately, such methods are computationally intensive and are typically inapplicable to modern Next-Generation Sequencing data. We here present a fast approximate likelihood method for phylogenetic assignment of DNA sequences. Applying the new method to several mock communities and simulated datasets, we show that it identifies more reads at both high and low taxonomic levels more accurately than other leading methods. The advantage of the method is particularly apparent in the presence of polymorphisms and/or sequencing errors and when the true species is not represented in the reference database.

                Class-B1 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are an important family of clinically relevant drug targets that remain difficult to investigate via high-throughput screening and in animal models. Here, we engineered PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, a novel genetically encoded sensor based on a class-B1 GPCR (the human PAC1 receptor, hmPAC1R) endowed with high dynamic range (Δ<i>F</i>/<i>F</i><sub>0</sub> = 1100%), excellent ligand selectivity, and rapid activation kinetics (<i>τ</i><sub>ON</sub> = 1.15 s). To showcase the utility of this tool for in vitro applications, we thoroughly characterized and compared its expression, brightness and performance between PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-transfected and stably expressing cells. Demonstrating its use in animal models, we show robust expression and fluorescence responses upon exogenous ligand application ex vivo and in vivo in mice, as well as in living zebrafish larvae. Thus, the new GPCR-based sensor can be used for a wide range of applications across the life sciences empowering both basic research and drug development efforts.

                Activities of daily living rely on our ability to acquire new motor skills composed of precise action sequences. Early learning of a new sequential skill is characterized by steep performance improvements that develop predominantly during rest intervals interspersed with practice, a form of rapid consolidation. Here, we ask if the millisecond level neural representation of an action performed at different locations within a skill sequence contextually differentiates or remains stable as learning evolves. Optimization of machine learning decoders to classify sequence-embedded finger movements from MEG activity reached approximately 94% accuracy. The representation manifolds of the same action performed in different sequence contexts progressively differentiated during rest periods of early learning, predicting skill gains. We conclude that sequence action representations contextually differentiate during early skill learning, an issue relevant to brain-computer interface applications in neurorehabilitation.

">Microglia morphology in the developing primate amygdala and effects of early life stress</a></h4>

              
                A unique pool of immature glutamatergic neurons in the primate amygdala, known as the paralaminar nucleus (PL), are maturing between infancy and adolescence. The PL is a potential substrate for the steep growth curve of amygdala volume during this developmental period. A microglial component is also embedded among the PL neurons, and likely supports local neuronal maturation and emerging synaptogenesis. Microglia may alter neuronal growth following environmental perturbations such as stress. Using multiple measures, we first found that microglia in the infant primate PL had relatively large somas, and a small arbor size. In contrast, microglia in the adolescent PL had a smaller soma, and a larger dendritic arbor. We then examined microglial morphology in the PL after a novel maternal separation protocol, to examine the effects of early life stress. After maternal separation, the microglia had increased soma size, arbor size and complexity. Surprisingly, strong effects were seen not only in the infant PL, but also in the adolescent PL from subjects who had experienced the separation many years earlier. We conclude that under maternal-rearing conditions, PL microglia morphology tracks PL neuronal growth, progressing to a more mature phenotype by adolescence. Maternal separation has long-lasting effects on microglia, altering their normal developmental trajectory, and resulting in a hyper-ramified phenotype that persists for years. We speculate that these changes have consequences for neuronal development in young primates.

">Whole-brain dynamics of articulatory, acoustic and semantic speech representations</a></h4>

              
                Speech production is a complex process that traverses several representations, from the meaning of spoken words (semantic), through the movement of articulatory muscles (articulatory) and, finally, to the produced audio waveform (acoustic). In our study, we aimed to identify how these different representations of speech are spatially and temporally distributed throughout the depth of the brain. By considering multiple representations from the same exact data, we can limit potential con-founders to better understand the different aspects of speech production and acquire crucial complementary information for speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Intracranial speech production data was collected of 15 participants, recorded from 1647 electrode contacts, while they overtly spoke 100 unique words. The electrodes were distributed across the entire brain, including sulci and subcortical areas. We found a bilateral spatial distribution for all three representations, although there was a stronger tuning in the left hemisphere with a more widespread and temporally dynamic distribution than in the right hemisphere. The articulatory and acoustic representations share a similar spatial distribution surrounding the Sylvian fissure, while the semantic representation appears to be widely distributed across the brain in a mostly distinct network. These results highlight the distributed nature of the speech production process and the potential of non-motor representations for speech BCIs.

">Working memory processing boosts the retrieval of existing long-term memory representations</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the interaction between short-term and long-term memory systems is essential for advancing our knowledge of human memory and learning. The current study examines whether processing in working memory, specifically attentional prioritization (Experiments 1 and 2) and testing (Experiment 2), can enhance the retrieval of recently encoded long-term memories. Eighty-six participants completed a three-phase task across two experiments. In the first phase, they learned object-location associations. In the second phase, using a retro-cue paradigm, these pairs reappeared with either informative (Experiments 1 and 2) or uninformative (Experiment 2) cues for a subsequent match-no-match test. In the final retrieval phase, participants recalled the locations associated with each object. Behavioral performance and electroencephalogram data recorded during this final retrieval phase of Experiment 1 revealed that attentional prioritization improved long-term memory retrieval. Experiment 2 indicated that prioritization and testing jointly enhance retrieval. These findings suggest that working memory does not only serve as a temporary store but has the capacity to actively strengthen long-term memory representations.

">The effect of microsaccades in the primary visual cortex: a two-phase modulation in the absence of visual stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Our eyes are never still. Even when we attempt to fixate, the visual gaze is never motionless, as we continuously perform miniature oculomotor movements termed as fixational eye movements. The fastest eye movements during the fixation epochs are termed microsaccades (MSs), that are leading to continual motion of the visual input, affecting mainly neurons in the fovea. Yet our vision appears to be stable. To explain this gap, previous studies suggested the existence of an extra-retinal input (ERI) into the visual cortex that can account for the motion and produce visual stability. Here, we investigated the existence of an ERI to V1 fovea in behaving monkeys while they performed spontaneous MSs, during fixation. We used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to measure and characterize at high spatio-temporal resolution the influence of MSs on neural population activity, in the foveal region of the primary visual cortex (V1). In the absence of a visual stimulus, MSs induced a two-phase response modulation: an early suppression transient followed by an enhancement transient. A correlation analysis revealed an increase in neural synchronization around ~100 ms after MS onset. Next, we investigated the MS effects in the presence of a small visual stimulus, and found that this modulation was different from the non-stimulated condition yet both modulations co-existed in the fovea. Finally, the VSD response to an external motion of the fixation point could not explain the MS modulation. These results support an ERI that may be involved in visual stabilization already at the level of V1.

">Male and female mice respectively form stronger social aversive memories with same and different sex conspecifics</a></h4>

              
                Mice offer a wealth of opportunities for investigating brain circuits regulating multiple behaviors, largely due to their genetic tractability. Social behaviors are of translational relevance, considering both mice and humans are highly social mammals, and disruptions in human social behavior are key symptoms of myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. Stresses related to social experiences are particularly influential in the severity and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders, and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Yet, induction and study of social stress in mice is disproportionately focused on males, influenced heavily by their natural territorial nature. Conspecific-elicited stress (i.e., defeat), while ethologically relevant, is quite variable and predominantly specific to males, making rigorous and sex-inclusive studies challenging. In pursuit of a controllable, consistent, high throughput, and sex-inclusive paradigm for eliciting social stress, we have discovered intriguing sex-specific social aversions that are dependent upon the sex of both experimental and conspecific mice. Specifically, we trained male and female F1 129S1/SvlmJ x C57BL/6J to associate (via classical conditioning) same or different sex C57BL/6J conspecifics with a mild, aversive stimulus. Upon subsequent testing for social interaction 24 h later, we found that males socially conditioned better to male conspecifics by exhibiting reduced social interaction, whereas females socially conditioned better to male conspecifics. Serum corticosterone levels inversely corresponded to social avoidance after different sex, but not same sex, conditioning, suggesting corticosterone-mediated arousal could influence cross sex interactions. While our paradigm has further optimization ahead, these current findings reveal why past pursuits to develop same sex female social stress paradigms may have met with limited success. Future research should expand investigation of utilizing male mouse conspecifics to instigate social stress across sexes.

">Explicitly Nonlinear Connectivity-Matrix Independent Component Analysis in Resting fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used data-driven technique for investigating brain structure and function to extract intrinsic networks. However, the ability of ICA, a linear mixing model, to capture nonlinear relationships is inherently limited. While nonlinear ICA can be used to estimate nonlinear+ linear mixtures, it can be useful to study the degree to which there is nonlinearity above and beyond the widely studied linear resting networks. Here, we propose a way to divide the data into sources exhibiting linear-only or explicitly nonlinear dependencies in resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Such an approach can be very informative as it allows us to evaluate the degree to which a given network might be linear, nonlinear, or both linear and nonlinear. Here, we present an enhanced connectivity-domain ICA approach, connectivity-matrix ICA, incorporating normalized mutual information (NMI) after canceling the linear effects to measure explicitly nonlinear (EN) relationships within voxel connectivity. This integration enables the identification of brain spatial maps that exhibit pronounced explicitly nonlinear dependencies while excluding linear relationships. By eliminating linear dependencies and utilizing NMI, we discover highly structured resting networks that conventional functional connectivity methods would typically overlook. The results indicate that several maps show only linear or EN relationships, and the rest of the components display both linear and nonlinear patterns. We categorized these maps as linear-only, EN-only, and linear-EN maps. We also evaluate differences in the identified networks in a schizophrenia dataset. A significant global difference has been discovered between schizophrenia and controls in some linear-EN maps, such as the frontal lobe. Moreover, the temporal lobe and thalamus display linear group differences, while the visual and motor cortex display global differences in nonlinear relationships as their primary driver of these disparities. In sum, our findings emphasize the significance of accounting for explicitly nonlinear dependencies in functional connectivity analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the extended cmICA approach in revealing previously unrecognized brain dynamics.

">Age-Related Cerebral Ventriculomegaly occurs in Patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia</a></h4>

              
                Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disorder causing motile ciliary dysfunction primarily affecting the respiratory and reproductive systems. However, the impact of PCD on the central nervous system, through dysfunction of motile cilia in multiciliated ependymal cells, remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that patients with PCD exhibit sub-clinical ventriculomegaly due to ependymal ciliary dysfunction, which may influence neuropsychiatric diagnoses. We demonstrated highly specific expression levels of known PCD-related genes in human brain ependymal cells (p<0.0001), supporting their potential role in regulating ependymal ciliary function. Computed tomography sinus images from patients with PCD (n=33) and age/sex-matched controls (n=64) were analysed. Patients with PCD displayed significantly larger ventricular areas (p<0.0001) and Evans index (p<0.01), indicating ventriculomegaly that was consistent across all genetic subgroups. Ventricular enlargement correlated positively with increasing age in patients with PCD compared to controls (p<0.001). Chart review demonstrated a high prevalence (39%) of neuropsychiatric/neurological disorders in adult PCD patients that did not correlate with degree of ventriculomegaly. Our findings suggest that patients with PCD may have unrecognized, mild ventriculomegaly potentially due to ependymal ciliary dysfunction which correlates with ageing. Further study is required to determine if ventricular enlargement contributes to neuropsychiatric/neurological or other morbidity in PCD.

">qPRF: A system to accelerate population receptive field decoding</a></h4>

              
                Patterns of BOLD response can be decoded using the population receptive field (PRF) model to reveal how visual input is represented on the cortex (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008). The time cost of evaluating the PRF model is high, often requiring days to decode BOLD signals for a small cohort of subjects. We introduce the qPRF, an efficient method for decoding that reduced the computation time by a factor of 1436 when compared to another widely available PRF decoder (Kay,Winawer, Mezer andWandell, 2013) on a benchmark of data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP; Van Essen, Smith, Barch, Behrens, Yacoub and Ugurbil, 2013). With a specially designed data structure and an efficient search algorithm, the qPRF optimizes the five PRF model parameters according to a least-squares criterion. To verify the accuracy of the qPRF solutions, we compared them to those provided by Benson, Jamison, Arcaro, Vu, Glasser, Coalson, Van Essen, Yacoub, Ugurbil, Winawer and Kay (2018). Both hemispheres of the 181 subjects in the HCP data set (a total of 10,753,572 vertices, each with a unique BOLD time series of 1800 frames) were decoded by qPRF in 15.2 hours on an ordinary CPU. The absolute difference in 2 reported by Benson et al. and achieved by the qPRF was negligible, with a median of 0.39% (2 units being between 0% and 100%). In general, the qPRF yielded a slightly better fitting solution, achieving greater 2 on 99.7% of vertices. The qPRF may facilitate the development and computation of more elaborate models based on the PRF framework, as well as the exploration of novel clinical applications.

">Rapid Parallel Visual Presentation Provides a New Perspective on Relative Clause Processing in Mandarin Chinese</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental question in language processing research is the degree to which the acceptability and ease of interpretation of a sentence are affected by the moment-by-moment memory encoding and retrieval processes needed to process it in time, vs. the properties of the linguistic representation itself, such as syntactic complexity. This manuscript investigates relative clauses, a crucial testing ground for theories of language processing, using parallel presentation, a technique in which the key elements of the target syntactic dependency are displayed to the visual system at the same time. Compared to serial presentation, parallel presentation mitigates the extent to which complex memory operations must be deployed to process the structure word-by-word. We report on an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment in Mandarin Chinese. Participants were presented with sentences which contained either a subject- or object-modifying subject- or object-extracted relative clause. Sentence presentation was split across two separate screens, with each screen being displayed only for 166ms on average. We find a behavioral preference for subject-extracted relative clauses and distinct EEG signatures for subject- and object-extracted relative clauses. Together, these results - on account of the parallel presentation scheme applied here - provide support for the independent contribution of linguistic representation in processing difficulty and the perspective that relative clause processing involves more than the factors that word by word accounts of this phenomenon would suggest. Further, the EEG result contributes to a growing body of electrophysiology literature attempting to illuminate the processing mechanisms deployed in the context of parallel presentation.

">Hierarchical Working Memory and a New Magic Number</a></h4>

              
                The extremely limited working memory span, typically around four items, contrasts sharply with our everyday experience of processing much larger streams of sensory information concurrently. This disparity suggests that working memory can organize information into compact representations such as chunks, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we propose a recurrent neural network model for chunking within the framework of the synaptic theory of working memory. We showed that by selectively suppressing groups of stimuli, the network can maintain and retrieve the stimuli in chunks, hence exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding the on-the-fly organization of information in the brain that is crucial for cognition.

">Cell type-specific dysregulation of gene expression due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency during mouse cortical development</a></h4>

              
                Disruptive variants in the chromodomain helicase CHD8, which acts as a transcriptional regulator during neurodevelopment, are strongly associated with risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Loss of CHD8 function is hypothesized to perturb gene regulatory networks in the developing brain, thereby contributing to ASD etiology. However, insight into the cell type-specific transcriptional effects of CHD8 loss of function remains limited. We used single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to globally profile gene expression and identify dysregulated genes in the embryonic and juvenile wild type and Chd8+/- mouse cortex, respectively. Chd8 and other ASD risk-associated genes showed a convergent expression trajectory that was largely conserved between the mouse and human developing cortex, increasing from the progenitor zones to the cortical plate. Genes associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and genes involved in neuron projection development, chromatin remodeling, signaling, and migration were dysregulated in Chd8+/- embryonic day (E) 12.5 radial glia. Genes implicated in synaptic organization and activity were dysregulated in Chd8+/- postnatal day (P) 25 deep- and upper-layer excitatory cortical neurons, suggesting a delay in synaptic maturation or impaired synaptogenesis due to CHD8 loss of function. Our findings reveal a complex pattern of transcriptional dysregulation in Chd8+/- developing cortex, potentially with distinct biological impacts on progenitors and maturing neurons in the excitatory neuronal lineage.

">Peripubertal antagonism of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 results in sustained, sex-specific changes in behavioral plasticity and the transcriptomic profile of the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Peripuberty is a significant period of neurodevelopment with long-lasting effects on the brain and behavior. Blocking type 1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptors (CRFR1) in neonatal and peripubertal rats attenuates detrimental effects of early-life stress on neural plasticity, behavior, and stress hormone action, long after exposure to the drug has ended. CRFR1 antagonism can also impact neural and behavioral development in the absence of stressful stimuli, suggesting sustained alterations under baseline conditions. To investigate this further, we administered a CRFR1 antagonist (CRFR1a), R121919, to young adolescent male and female rats across 4 days. Following each treatment, rats were tested for locomotion, social behavior, mechanical allodynia, or PPI of the acoustic startle reflex. Acute CRFR1 blockade immediately reduced PPI in peripubertal males, but not females. In adulthood, each assay was repeated without CRFR1a exposure to test for long-term effects of the adolescent treatment, with males continuing to experience deficits in PPI, while females displayed altered locomotion, PPI, and social behavior. The amygdala was collected to measure long-term effects on gene expression in pathways related to neural plasticity and neurodevelopmental disorders. Relative expression of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1R), which mediate sensorimotor and HPA function, was also measured. In the adult amygdala, peripubertal CRFR1a induced alterations in pathways related to neural plasticity and stress in males and lower expression of CB1R protein in females. Understanding how acute exposure to neuropharmacological agents can have sustained impacts on brain and behavior, in the absence of further exposures, has important clinical implications for adolescent psychiatric treatment protocols.

	<p>In recent years, EEG-based emotion recognition technology has made progress, but there are still problems of low model efficiency and loss of emotional information, and there is still room for improvement in recognition accuracy. To fully utilize EEG&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional information and improve recognition accuracy while reducing computational costs, this paper proposes a Convolutional-Recurrent Hybrid Network with a dual-stream adaptive approach and an attention mechanism (CSA-SA-CRTNN). Firstly, the model utilizes a CSAM module to assign corresponding weights to EEG channels. Then, an adaptive dual-stream convolutional-recurrent network (SA-CRNN and MHSA-CRNN) is applied to extract local spatial-temporal features. After that, the extracted local features are concatenated and fed into a temporal convolutional network with a multi-head self-attention mechanism (MHSA-TCN) to capture global information. Finally, the extracted EEG information is used for emotion classification. We conducted binary and ternary classification experiments on the DEAP dataset, achieving 99.26% and 99.15% accuracy for arousal and valence in binary classification and 97.69% and 98.05% in ternary classification, and on the SEED dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 98.63%, surpassing relevant algorithms. Additionally, the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficiency is significantly higher than other models, achieving better accuracy with lower resource consumption.</p>

	<p>Neurodegeneration occurs naturally as humans age, but the presence of additional pathogenic mechanisms yields harmful and consequential effects on the brain. Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a composite of such factors. Despite extensive research to identify the exact causes of AD, therapeutic approaches for treating the disease continue to be ineffective, indicating important gaps in our understanding of disease mechanisms. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an endogenous class of regulatory RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, involved in various regulatory networks, whose dysregulation is evident in several neural and extraneural diseases. LncRNAs are ubiquitously expressed across all tissues with a wide range of functions, including controlling cell differentiation and development, responding to environmental stimuli, and other physiological processes. Several lncRNAs have been identified as potential contributors in worsening neurodegeneration due to altered regulation during abnormal pathological conditions. Within neurological disease, lncRNAs are prime candidates for use as biomarkers and pharmacological targets. Gender-associated lncRNA expression is altered in a gender-dependent manner for AD, suggesting more research needs to be focused on this relationship. Overall, research on lncRNAs and their connection to neurodegenerative disease is growing exponentially, as commercial enterprises are already designing and employing RNA therapeutics. In this review we offer a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on the role of lncRNAs in AD and discuss the potential implications of lncRNA as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Most intracranial aneurysms (IAs) can be treated either with microsurgical clipping or endovascular techniques. In a few cases, simultaneous treatment utilizing both modalities in a hybrid operation room may be favorable. This study analyzes the indication and benefits of a true hybrid approach (tHA) that combines simultaneous endovascular and microsurgical procedures for treatment of IAs in one session. (2) Methods: All patients receiving a true hybrid procedure between 2010 and 2022 in our institution were included. Demographic characteristics, neurological symptoms, pre-interventional treatments, angiographic findings, and postoperative clinical and radiological outcomes were analyzed. Results are discussed in the light of a systematic literature review on reported true hybrid procedures for IA treatment. (3) Results: In total, 10 tHAs were performed. Of these, coiling and concomitant decompressive craniectomy or hematoma evacuation was performed on six occasions. In two patients, multiple IAs were treated with different modalities during the same procedure. In two patients, intraoperative conditions did not allow for complete IA clipping, and the remnant was coiled in the same session. The review of the literature revealed nine papers comprising 58 IAs treated with a tHA. (4) Conclusions: The need for a tHA for IA treatment is rare and limited to highly selective cases. In our experience, tHAs have been most valuable in an emergency setting concerning ruptured IAs. Furthermore, tHAs may also be considered in patients with multiple aneurysms in different vascular territories.</p>

	<p>Individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) experience severe face memory deficits that are often accompanied by impairments in face perception. Images of human facial features are better discriminated between when they are presented in the locations on the visual field that they typically appear in while viewing human faces in daily life, than in locations which they do not typically appear (i.e., better performance for eyes in the upper visual field, and better performance for mouths in the lower visual field). These feature-to-location tuning effects (FLEs) can be explained by a retinotopically organised visual statistical learning mechanism. We had a large group of DP participants (N = 64), a control group (N = 74) and a group of individuals with a mild form of DP (N = 58) complete a single-feature discrimination task to determine whether face perception deficits in DP can be accounted for by an impairment in face feature-to-location tuning. The results showed that individuals with DP did not have significant FLEs, suggesting a marked impairment in the underlying visual statistical learning mechanism. In contrast, the mild DP group showed normal FLE effects which did not differ from the control group. Both DP groups had impaired single-feature processing (SFP) as compared to the control group. We also examined the effects of age on FLEs and SFP.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal CA3 region plays an important role in learning and memory. CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) receive two prominent excitatory inputs&mdash;mossy fibers (MFs) from dentate gyrus (DG) and recurrent collaterals (RCs) from CA3 PNs&mdash;that play opposing roles in pattern separation and pattern completion, respectively. Although the dorsoventral heterogeneity of the hippocampal anatomy, physiology, and behavior has been well established, nothing is known about the dorsoventral heterogeneity of synaptic connectivity in CA3 PNs. In this study, we performed Timm's sulfide silver staining, dendritic and spine morphological analyses, and ex vivo electrophysiology in mice of both sexes to investigate the heterogeneity of MF and RC pathways along the CA3 dorsoventral axis. Our morphological analyses demonstrate that ventral CA3 (vCA3) PNs possess greater dendritic lengths and more complex dendritic arborization, compared with dorsal CA3 (dCA3) PNs. Moreover, using ChannelRhodopsin2 (ChR2)-assisted patch-clamp recording, we found that the ratio of the RC-to-MF excitatory drive onto CA3 PNs increases substantially from dCA3 to vCA3, with vCA3 PNs receiving significantly weaker MFs, but stronger RCs, excitation than dCA3 PNs. Given the distinct roles of MF versus RC inputs in pattern separation versus completion, our findings of the significant dorsoventral variations of MF and RC excitation in CA3 PNs may have important functional implications for the contribution of CA3 circuit to the dorsoventral difference in hippocampal function.</p>

                <p>The encoding of acoustic stimuli requires precise neuron timing. Auditory neurons in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and brainstem are&nbsp;well suited for accurate analysis of fast acoustic signals, given their physiological specializations of fast membrane time constants, fast axonal conduction, and reliable synaptic transmission. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons that provide efferent inhibition of the cochlea reside in the ventral brainstem and participate in these fast neural circuits. However, their modulation of cochlear function occurs over time scales of a slower nature. This suggests the presence of mechanisms that reduce MOC inhibition of cochlear function. To determine how monaural excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs integrate to affect the timing of MOC neuron activity, we developed a novel in vitro slice preparation ("wedge-slice"). The wedge-slice maintains the ascending auditory nerve root, the entire CN and projecting axons, while preserving the ability to perform visually guided patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings from genetically identified MOC neurons. The "in vivo-like" timing of the wedge-slice demonstrates that the inhibitory pathway accelerates relative to the excitatory pathway when the ascending circuit is intact, and the CN portion of the inhibitory circuit is precise enough to compensate for reduced precision in later synapses. When combined with machine learning PSC analysis and computational modeling, we demonstrate a larger suppression of MOC neuron activity when the inhibition occurs with in vivo-like timing. This delay of MOC activity may ensure that the MOC system is only engaged by sustained background sounds, preventing a maladaptive hypersuppression of cochlear activity.</p>

                <p>Humans are immensely curious and motivated to reduce uncertainty, but little is known about the neural mechanisms that generate curiosity. Curiosity is inversely associated with confidence, suggesting that it is triggered by states of low confidence (subjective uncertainty), but the neural mechanisms of this link, have been little investigated. Inspired by studies of sensory uncertainty, we hypothesized that visual areas provide multivariate representations of uncertainty, which are read out by higher-order structures to generate signals of confidence and, ultimately, curiosity. We scanned participants (17 female, 15 male) using fMRI while they performed a new task in which they rated their confidence in identifying distorted images of animals and objects and their curiosity to see the clear image. We measured the activity evoked by each image in the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) and devised a new metric of "OTC Certainty" indicating the strength of evidence this activity conveys about the animal versus object categories. We show that, perceptual curiosity peaked at low confidence and OTC Certainty negatively correlated with curiosity, establishing a link between curiosity and a multivariate representation of sensory uncertainty. Moreover, univariate (average) activity in two frontal areas&mdash;vmPFC and ACC&mdash;correlated positively with confidence and negatively with curiosity, and the vmPFC mediated the relationship between OTC Certainty and curiosity. The results reveal novel mechanisms through which uncertainty about an event generates curiosity about that event.</p>

                <p>The neocortex and striatum are topographically organized for sensory and motor functions. While sensory and motor areas are lateralized for touch and motor control, respectively, frontal areas are involved in decision-making, where lateralization of function may be less important. This study contrasted the topographic precision of cell-type&ndash;specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical projections while varying the injection site location in transgenic mice of both sexes. While sensory cortical areas had strongly topographic outputs to the ipsilateral cortex and striatum, they were weaker and not as topographically precise to contralateral targets. The motor cortex had somewhat stronger projections but still relatively weak contralateral topography. In contrast, frontal cortical areas had high degrees of topographic similarity for both ipsilateral and contralateral projections to the cortex and striatum. Corticothalamic organization is mainly ipsilateral, with weaker, more medial contralateral projections. Corticostriatal computations might integrate input outside closed basal ganglia loops using contralateral projections, enabling the two hemispheres to act as a unit to converge on one result in motor planning and decision-making.</p>

                <p>Synapses are fundamental to the function of the central nervous system and are implicated in a number of brain disorders. Despite their pivotal role, a comprehensive imaging resource detailing the distribution of synapses in the human brain has been lacking until now. Here, we employ high-resolution PET neuroimaging in healthy humans (17F/16M) to create a 3D atlas of the synaptic marker Synaptic Vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). Calibration to absolute density values (pmol/ml) was achieved by leveraging postmortem human brain autoradiography data. The atlas unveils distinctive cortical and subcortical gradients of synapse density that reflect functional topography and hierarchical order from core sensory to higher-order integrative areas&mdash;a distribution that diverges from SV2A mRNA patterns. Furthermore, we found a positive association between IQ and SV2A density in several higher-order cortical areas. This new resource will help advance our understanding of brain physiology and the pathogenesis of brain disorders, serving as a pivotal tool for future neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/33/e2012232024?rss=1">Conflicting Sensory Information Sharpens the Neural Representations of Early Selective Visuospatial Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive behaviors require the ability to resolve conflicting information caused by the processing of incompatible sensory inputs. Prominent theories of attention have posited that early selective attention helps mitigate cognitive interference caused by conflicting sensory information by facilitating the processing of task-relevant sensory inputs and filtering out behaviorally irrelevant information. Surprisingly, many recent studies that investigated the role of early selective attention on conflict mitigation have failed to provide positive evidence. Here, we examined changes in the selectivity of early visuospatial attention in male and female human subjects performing an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task, where they discriminated the shape of a visual target surrounded by congruent or incongruent distractors. We used the inverted encoding model to reconstruct spatial representations of visual selective attention from the topographical patterns of amplitude modulations in alpha band oscillations in scalp EEG (~8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz). We found that the fidelity of the alpha-based spatial reconstruction was significantly higher in the incongruent compared with the congruent condition. Importantly, these conflict-related modulations in the reconstruction fidelity occurred at a much earlier time window than those of the lateralized posterior event-related potentials associated with target selection and distractor suppression processes, as well as conflict-related modulations in the frontocentral negative-going wave and midline-frontal theta oscillations (~3&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz), thought to track executive control functions. Taken together, our data suggest that conflict resolution is supported by the cascade of neural processes underlying early selective visuospatial attention and frontal executive functions that unfold over time.</p>

                <p>An economic choice entails computing and comparing the values of individual offers. Offer values are represented in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)&mdash;an area that participates in value comparison&mdash;but it is unknown where offer values are computed in the first place. One possibility is that this computation takes place in OFC. Alternatively, offer values might be computed upstream of OFC. For choices between edible goods, a primary candidate is the gustatory region of the anterior insula (gustatory cortex, GC). Here we recorded from the GC of male rhesus monkeys choosing between different juice types. As a population, neurons in GC represented the flavor, the quantity, and the subjective value of the juice chosen by the animal. These variables were represented by distinct groups of cells and with different time courses. Specifically, chosen value signals emerged shortly after offer presentation, while neurons encoding the chosen juice and the chosen quantity peaked after juice delivery. Surprisingly, neurons in GC did not represent individual offer values in a systematic way. In a computational sense, the variables encoded in GC follow the process of value comparison. Thus our results argue against the hypothesis that offer values are computed in GC. At the same time, signals representing the subjective value of the expected reward indicate that responses in GC are not purely sensory. Thus neuronal responses in GC appear consummatory in nature.</p>

                <p>The simple act of viewing and grasping an object involves complex sensorimotor control mechanisms that have been shown to vary as a function of multiple object and other task features such as object size, shape, weight, and wrist orientation. However, these features have been mostly studied in isolation. In contrast, given the nonlinearity of motor control, its computations require multiple features to be incorporated concurrently. Therefore, the present study tested the hypothesis that grasp computations integrate multiple task features superadditively in particular when these features are relevant for the same action phase. We asked male and female human participants to reach-to-grasp objects of different shapes and sizes with different wrist orientations. Also, we delayed the movement onset using auditory signals to specify which effector to use. Using electroencephalography and representative dissimilarity analysis to map the time course of cortical activity, we found that grasp computations formed superadditive integrated representations of grasp features during different planning phases of grasping. Shape-by-size representations and size-by-orientation representations occurred before and after effector specification, respectively, and could not be explained by single-feature models. These observations are consistent with the brain performing different preparatory, phase-specific computations; visual object analysis to identify grasp points at abstract visual levels; and downstream sensorimotor preparatory computations for reach-to-grasp trajectories. Our results suggest the brain adheres to the needs of nonlinear motor control for integration. Furthermore, they show that examining the superadditive influence of integrated representations can serve as a novel lens to map the computations underlying sensorimotor control.</p>

                <p>The ability to make accurate and timely decisions, such as judging when it is safe to cross the road, is the foundation of adaptive behavior. While the computational and neural processes supporting simple decisions on isolated stimuli have been well characterized, decision-making in the real world often requires integration of discrete sensory events over time and space. Most previous experimental work on perceptual decision-making has focused on tasks that involve only a single, task-relevant source of sensory input. It remains unclear, therefore, how such integrative decisions are regulated computationally. Here we used psychophysics, electroencephalography, and computational modeling to understand how the human brain combines visual motion signals across space in the service of a single, integrated decision. To that purpose, we presented two random-dot kinematograms in the left and the right visual hemifields. Coherent motion signals were shown briefly and concurrently in each location, and healthy adult human participants of both sexes reported the average of the two motion signals. We directly tested competing predictions arising from influential serial and parallel accounts of visual processing. Using a biologically plausible model of motion filtering, we found evidence in favor of parallel integration as the fundamental computational mechanism regulating integrated perceptual decisions.</p>

                <p>To visualize the cellular and subcellular localization of neuromodulatory G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors in <I>Drosophila</I>, we implement a molecular strategy recently used to add epitope tags to ionotropic receptors at their endogenous loci. Leveraging evolutionary conservation to identify sites more likely to permit insertion of a tag, we generated constitutive and conditional tagged alleles for <I>Drosophila</I> <I>5-HT1A</I>, <I>5-HT2A</I>, <I>5-HT2B</I>, <I>Oct</I><I>&beta;</I><I>1R</I>, <I>Oct</I><I>&beta;</I><I>2R</I>, two isoforms of <I>OAMB</I>, and <I>mGluR</I>. The conditional alleles allow for the restricted expression of tagged receptor in specific cell types, an option not available for any previous reagents to label these proteins. We show expression patterns for these receptors in female brains and that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B localize to the mushroom bodies (MBs) and central complex, respectively, as predicted by their roles in sleep. By contrast, the unexpected enrichment of Oct&beta;1R in the central complex and of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A to nerve terminals in lobular columnar cells in the visual system suggest new hypotheses about their functions at these sites. Using an additional tagged allele of the serotonin transporter, a marker of serotonergic tracts, we demonstrate diverse spatial relationships between postsynaptic 5-HT receptors and presynaptic 5-HT neurons, consistent with the importance of both synaptic and volume transmission. Finally, we use the conditional allele of <I>5-HT1A</I> to show that it localizes to distinct sites within the MBs as both a postsynaptic receptor in Kenyon cells and a presynaptic autoreceptor.</p>

                <p>The sense of smell is tightly linked to emotions, a link that is thought to rely on the direct synaptic connections between the olfactory bulb (OB) and nuclei of the amygdala. However, there are multiple pathways projecting olfactory information to the amygdala, and their unique functions are unknown. The pathway via the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT) that receives input from olfactory regions and projects to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is among them. NLOT has been very little studied, and consequentially its function is unknown. Furthermore, formulation of informed hypotheses about NLOT function is at this stage limited by the lack of knowledge about its connectivity and physiological properties. Here, we used virus-based tracing methods to systematically reveal inputs into NLOT, as well as NLOT projection targets in mice of both sexes. We found that the NLOT is interconnected with several olfactory brain regions and with the BLA. Some of these connections were reciprocal, and some showed unique interhemispheric patterns. We tested the excitable properties of NLOT neurons and the properties of each of the major synaptic inputs. We found that the NLOT receives powerful input from the piriform cortex, tenia tecta, and the BLA but only very weak input from the OB. When input crosses threshold, NLOT neurons respond with calcium-dependent bursts of action potentials. We hypothesize that this integration of olfactory and amygdalar inputs serves behaviors that combine smell and emotion.</p>

                <p>by Christoph Koch, Ondrej Zika, Rasmus Bruckner, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Surprise is a key component of many learning experiences, and yet its precise computational role, and how it changes with age, remain debated. One major challenge is that surprise often occurs jointly with other variables, such as uncertainty and outcome probability. To assess how humans learn from surprising events, and whether aging affects this process, we studied choices while participants learned from bandits with either Gaussian or bi-modal outcome distributions, which decoupled outcome probability, uncertainty, and surprise. A total of 102 participants (51 older, aged 50—73; 51 younger, 19–30 years) chose between three bandits, one of which had a bimodal outcome distribution. Behavioral analyses showed that both age-groups learned the average of the bimodal bandit less well. A trial-by-trial analysis indicated that participants performed choice reversals immediately following large absolute prediction errors, consistent with heightened sensitivity to surprise. This effect was stronger in older adults. Computational models indicated that learning rates in younger as well as older adults were influenced by surprise, rather than uncertainty, but also suggested large interindividual variability in the process underlying learning in our task. Our work bridges between behavioral economics research that has focused on how outcomes with low probability affect choice in older adults, and reinforcement learning work that has investigated age differences in the effects of uncertainty and suggests that older adults overly adapt to surprising events, even when accounting for probability and uncertainty effects.

Translocation in protein synthesis entails the efficient and accurate movement of the mRNA-[tRNA]<sub>2</sub> substrate through the ribosome after peptide bond formation. An essential conformational change during this process is the swiveling of the small subunit head domain about two rRNA ‘hinge’ elements. Using iterative selection and molecular dynamics simulations, we derive alternate hinge elements capable of translocation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and describe their effects on the conformational trajectory of the EF-G-bound, translocating ribosome. In these alternate conformational pathways, we observe a diversity of swivel kinetics, hinge motions, three-dimensional head domain trajectories and tRNA dynamics. By finding alternate conformational pathways of translocation, we identify motions and intermediates that are essential or malleable in this process. These findings highlight the plasticity of protein synthesis and provide a more thorough understanding of the available sequence and conformational landscape of a central biological process.

                <p>by Jiayi Lin, Hrayer Aprahamian, George Golovko</p>

We study the problem of mass screening of heterogeneous populations under limited testing budget. Mass screening is an essential tool that arises in various settings, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of mass screening is to classify the entire population as positive or negative for a disease as efficiently and accurately as possible. Under limited budget, testing facilities need to allocate a portion of the budget to target sub-populations (i.e., proactive screening) while reserving the remaining budget to screen for symptomatic cases (i.e., reactive screening). This paper addresses this decision problem by taking advantage of accessible population-level risk information to identify the optimal set of sub-populations for proactive/reactive screening. The framework also incorporates two widely used testing schemes: Individual and Dorfman group testing. By leveraging the special structure of the resulting bilinear optimization problem, we identify key structural properties, which in turn enable us to develop efficient solution schemes. Furthermore, we extend the model to accommodate customized testing schemes across different sub-populations and introduce a highly efficient heuristic solution algorithm for the generalized model. We conduct a comprehensive case study on COVID-19 in the US, utilizing geographically-based data. Numerical results demonstrate a significant improvement of up to 52% in total misclassifications compared to conventional screening strategies. In addition, our case study offers valuable managerial insights regarding the allocation of proactive/reactive measures and budget across diverse geographic regions.

Grasslands are integral to maintaining biodiversity and key ecosystem services and are under threat from climate change. Plant and soil microbial diversity, and their interactions, support the provision of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality). However, it remains virtually unknown whether plant and soil microbial diversity explain a unique portion of total variation or shared contributions to supporting multifunctionality across global grasslands. Here, we combine results from a global survey of 101 grasslands with a novel microcosm study, controlling for both plant and soil microbial diversity to identify their individual and interactive contribution to support multifunctionality under aridity and experimental drought. We found that plant and soil microbial diversity independently predict a unique portion of total variation in above- and belowground functioning, suggesting that both types of biodiversity complement each other. Interactions between plant and soil microbial diversity positively impacted multifunctionality including primary production and nutrient storage. Our findings were also climate context dependent, since soil fungal diversity was positively associated with multifunctionality in less arid regions, while plant diversity was strongly and positively linked to multifunctionality in more arid regions. Our results highlight the need to conserve both above- and belowground diversity to sustain grassland multifunctionality in a drier world and indicate climate change may shift the relative contribution of plant and soil biodiversity to multifunctionality across global grasslands.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<p>Amyloid neuropathy is caused by deposition of insoluble β-pleated amyloid sheets in the peripheral nervous system. It is most common in: (1) light-chain amyloidosis, a clonal non-proliferative plasma cell disorder in which fragments of immunoglobulin, light or heavy chain, deposit in tissues, and (2) hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis, a disorder caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the <i>TTR</i> gene resulting in mutated protein that has a higher tendency to misfold. Amyloid fibrils deposit in the endoneurium of peripheral nerves, often extensive in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia, leading to atrophy of Schwann cells in proximity to amyloid fibrils and blood–nerve barrier disruption. Clinically, amyloid neuropathy is manifested as a length-dependent sensory predominant neuropathy associated with generalized autonomic failure. Small unmyelinated nerves are involved early and prominently in early-onset Val30Met ATTRv, whereas other ATTRv and light-chain amyloidosis often present with large- and small-fiber involvement. Nerve conduction studies, quantitative sudomotor axon testing, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density are useful tools to evaluate denervation. Amyloid deposition can be demonstrated by tissue biopsy of the affected organ or surrogate site, as well as bone-avid radiotracer cardiac imaging. Treatment of light-chain amyloidosis has been revolutionized by monoclonal antibodies and stem cell transplantation with improved 5-year survival up to 77%. Novel gene therapy and transthyretin stabilizers have revolutionized treatment of ATTRv, improving the course of neuropathy (less change in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 from baseline) and quality of life. With great progress in amyloidosis therapies, early diagnosis and presymptomatic testing for ATTRv family members has become paramount. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:423–440</p>

                <p>Despite the use of ‘high efficacy’ disease-modifying therapies, disease activity and clinical progression of different immune-mediated neurological diseases continue for some patients, resulting in accumulating disability, deteriorating social and mental health, and high economic cost to patients and society. Although autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective treatment modality, it is an intensive chemotherapy-based therapy with a range of short- and long-term side-effects. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell and other hematological malignancies, conferring long-term remission for otherwise refractory diseases. However, the toxicity of this treatment, particularly cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and the complexity of production necessitate the need for a high level of specialization at treating centers. Early-phase trials of CAR-T therapies in immune-mediated B cell driven conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myasthenia gravis, have shown dramatic clinical response with few adverse events. Based on the common physiopathology, CAR-T therapy in other immune-mediated neurological disease, including multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory polyradiculopathy, autoimmune encephalitis, and stiff person syndrome, might be an effective option for patients, avoiding the need for long-term immunosuppressant medications. It may prove to be a more selective immunoablative approach than autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with potentially increased efficacy and lower adverse events. In this review, we present the state of the art and future directions of the use of CAR-T in such conditions. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:441–452</p>

                <p>Brain iron deficiency (ID) and, to a degree, systemic ID have been implicated in restless leg syndrome (RLS) pathogenesis. Previously, we found increased ferritin in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) in RLS, suggesting a mechanism for depleting intracellular iron by secreting ferritin-loaded NDEVs. In this study, we hypothesized that increased NDEV ferritin occurs even in RLS accompanied by systemic ID and that neuronal intracellular iron depletion in RLS also manifests as NDEV abnormalities in other iron regulatory proteins, specifically, decreased transferrin receptor (TfR) and increased ferroportin. To address these hypotheses, we studied 71 women with ID anemia, 36 with RLS, and 35 without RLS. Subjects with RLS again showed higher NDEV ferritin and also decreased TfR, suggesting diminished neuronal capacity for iron uptake. Findings inform a more complete understanding of the pathogenic role of neuronal iron homeostasis and dissociate it from peripheral ID. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:560–564</p>

                <p>The life expectancy of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) has increased, yet we have noted that development of a typical Alzheimer disease dementia syndrome is uncommon. We hypothesized that Alzheimer disease pathology is uncommon in MS patients. In 100 MS patients, the rate of amyloid-β plasma biomarker positivity was approximately half the rate in 300 non-MS controls matched on age, sex, apolipoprotein E proteotype, and cognitive status. Interestingly, most MS patients who did have amyloid-β pathology had features atypical for MS at diagnosis. These results support that MS is associated with reduced Alzheimer disease risk, and suggest new avenues of research. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:453–459</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the clinical progression of the brain-/body-first categories within Lewy body disease (LBD): Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and PD dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to establish a population-based cohort of clinically diagnosed LBD. We used two definitions for differentiating between brain- and body-first LBD: a previously hypothesized body-first presentation in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior onset before motor symptoms onset; and an expanded definition of body-first LBD when a patient had at least 2 premotor symptoms between constipation, erectile dysfunction, rapid eye movement sleep behavior, anosmia, or neurogenic bladder.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Brain-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with PD (RR = 1.43, <i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas body-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with DLB (RR = 3.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Under the expanded definition, there was no difference in LBD diagnosis between brain-first and body-first patients (PD: RR = 1.03, <i>p</i> = 0.10; DLB: RR = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.58) There were no patterns between brain- or body-first presentation, PD dementia under either definition (original: <i>p</i> = 0.09, expanded: <i>p</i> = 0.97), and no significant difference in motor symptoms between brain-first and body-first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings do not support the dichotomous classification of body-first and brain-first LBD with the currently proposed definition. Biological exposures resulting in PD and DLB are unlikely to converge on a binary classification of top-down or bottom-up synuclein pathology. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:551–559</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be more common in African Americans (AA), but biomarker studies in AA populations are limited. This report represents the largest study to date examining cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers in AA individuals.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 3,006 cerebrospinal fluid samples from controls, AD cases, and non-AD cases, including 495 (16.5%) self-identified black/AA and 2,456 (81.7%) white/European individuals using cutoffs derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and using a data-driven multivariate Gaussian mixture of regressions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct effects of race were found in different groups. Total Tauand phospho181-Tau were lower among AA individuals in all groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and Aβ<sub>42</sub> was markedly lower in AA controls compared with white controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Gaussian mixture of regressions modeling of cerebrospinal fluid distributions incorporating adjustments for covariates revealed coefficient estimates for AA race comparable with 2-decade change in age. Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cutoffs, fewer AA controls were classified as biomarker-positive asymptomatic AD (8.0% vs 13.4%). After adjusting for covariates, our Gaussian mixture of regressions model reduced this difference, but continued to predict lower prevalence of asymptomatic AD among AA controls (9.3% vs 13.5%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although the risk of dementia is higher, data-driven modeling indicates lower frequency of asymptomatic AD in AA controls, suggesting that dementia among AA populations may not be driven by higher rates of AD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:463–475</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately half of ischemic strokes (IS) in cancer patients are cryptogenic, with many presumed cardioembolic. We evaluated whether there were specific miRNA and mRNA transcriptome architectures in peripheral blood of IS patients with and without comorbid cancer, and between cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic IS etiologies in comorbid cancer.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied patients with cancer and IS (CS; n = 42), stroke only (SO; n = 41), and cancer only (n = 28), and vascular risk factor-matched controls (n = 30). mRNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data, analyzed with linear regression models, identified differentially expressed genes in CS versus SO and in cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic CS, and miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs. Network-level analyses identified stroke etiology-specific responses in CS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 2,085 mRNAs and 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed between CS and SO. In CS, 122 and 35 miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs, and 5 and 3 coexpressed gene modules, were associated with cardioembolic and noncardioembolic CS, respectively. Complement, growth factor, and immune/inflammatory pathways showed differences between IS etiologies in CS. A 15-gene biomarker panel assembled from a derivation cohort (n = 50) correctly classified 81% of CS and 71% of SO participants in a validation cohort (n = 33). Another 15-gene panel correctly identified etiologies for 13 of 13 CS-cardioembolic and 11 of 11 CS-noncardioembolic participants upon cross-validation; 11 of 16 CS-cryptogenic participants were predicted cardioembolic.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We discovered unique mRNA and miRNA transcriptome architecture in CS and SO, and in CS with different IS etiologies. Cardioembolic and noncardioembolic etiologies in CS showed unique coexpression networks and potential master regulators. These may help distinguish CS from SO and identify IS etiology in cryptogenic CS patients. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:565–581</p>

     alt="Low-Dose Interleukin-2 Reverses Traumatic Brain Injury-Induced Cognitive Deficit and Pain in a Murine Model"/>
<p>This study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap – whether low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment long after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is still effective for chronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) and cognitive impairments. We have found that LD-IL-2 treatment preferentially expands meningeal regulatory T (Treg) cells, thereby abolishing PTH-related behaviors and memory deficit in mice with a wide therapeutic time window. This identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for mTBI with the potential of reducing polypharmacy. [Color figure can be viewed at <a target="_blank"

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced chronic headache and cognitive deficits are poorly understood and lack effective treatments. Low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment soon after mTBI or overexpressing IL-2 in brain astrocytes prior to injury protects mice from developing post-traumatic headache (PTH)-related behaviors and cognitive decline. The present study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap: whether LD-IL-2 treatment long after the initial injury is still effective for chronic PTH and cognitive deficits.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>mTBI was induced by a noninvasive closed-head weight drop method. LD-IL-2 was administered 4–6 weeks post-mTBI to assess its effects on chronic PTH-related facial mechanical hypersensitivity as well as mTBI-induced impairment in novel object recognition and object location tests. Endogenous regulatory T (Treg) cells were depleted to investigate the mechanism of action of LD-IL-2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Delayed LD-IL-2 treatment abolished chronic PTH-related behaviors. It also completely reversed mTBI-induced cognitive impairment in both male and female mice. Treg cell depletion not only prolonged PTH-related behaviors but also abolished the effects of LD-IL-2. Interestingly, LD-IL-2 treatment significantly increased the number of Treg cells in dura but not in brain tissues.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that the beneficial effects of LD-IL-2 treatment are mediated through the expansion of meningeal Treg cells. Collectively, our study identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for both chronic PTH and mTBI-induced cognitive impairment for both males and females, with a wide therapeutic time window and the potential of reducing polypharmacy in mTBI treatment.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neuron impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and if and how transplantation of healthy GABAergic neurons can improve AD, remain unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human-derived medial ganglionic eminence progenitors (hiMGEs) differentiated from programmed induced neural precursor cells (hiNPCs) were injected into the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus (HIP).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that grafts migrate to the whole brain and form functional synaptic connections in amyloid precursor protein gene/ presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) chimeric mice. Following transplantation of hiMGEs, behavioral deficits and AD-related pathology were alleviated and defective neurons were repaired. Notably, exosomes secreted from hiMGEs, which are rich in anti-inflammatory miRNA, inhibited astrocyte activation <i>invitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and the mechanism was related to regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that hiMGEs transplantation is an alternative treatment for neuronal loss in AD and demonstrate that exosomes with anti-inflammatory activity derived from hiMGEs are important factors for graft survival.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenesis of <i>CLCN6</i>-related disease and to assess whether its Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchange activity is crucial for the biological role of ClC-6.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed whole-exome sequencing on a girl with development delay, intractable epilepsy, behavioral abnormities, retinal dysfunction, progressive brain atrophy, suggestive of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). We generated and analyzed the first knock-in mouse model of a patient variant (p.E200A) and compared it with a <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model. Additional functional tests were performed with heterologous expression of mutant ClC-6.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a de novo heterozygous p.E200A variant in the proband. Expression of disease-causing ClC-6<sup>E200A</sup> or ClC-6<sup>Y553C</sup> mutants blocked autophagic flux and activated transcription factors EB (TFEB) and E3 (TFE3), leading to autophagic vesicle and cholesterol accumulation. Such alterations were absent with a transport-deficient ClC-6<sup>E267A</sup> mutant. <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>E200A/+</sup> mice developed severe neurodegeneration with typical features of NCLs. Mutant ClC-6<sup>E200A</sup>, but not loss of ClC-6 in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice, increased lysosomal biogenesis by suppressing mTORC1-TFEB signaling, blocked autophagic flux through impairing lysosomal function, and increased apoptosis. Carbohydrate and lipid deposits accumulated in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>E200A/+</sup> brain, while only lipid storage was found in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> brain. Lysosome dysfunction, autophagy defects, and gliosis were early pathogenic events preceding neuron loss.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CLCN6</i> is a novel genetic cause of NCLs, highlighting the importance of considering <i>CLCN6</i> mutations in the diagnostic workup for molecularly undefined forms of NCLs. Uncoupling of Cl<sup>−</sup> transport from H<sup>+</sup> countertransport in the E200A mutant has a dominant effect on the autophagic/lysosomal pathway.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether plasma phosphorylated-Tau181 (pTau181) could be used as a diagnostic biomarker of concurrent Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) or amyloidosis alone, as well as a prognostic, monitoring, and susceptibility/risk biomarker for clinical outcomes in Lewy body disease (LBD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 565 participants: 94 LBD with normal cognition, 83 LBD with abnormal cognition, 114 with Alzheimer's disease, and 274 cognitively normal. Plasma pTau181 levels were measured with the Lumipulse <i>G</i> platform. Diagnostic accuracy for concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis was assessed with Receiver Operating Characteristic curves in a subset of participants with CSF pTau181/Aβ42, and CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 or amyloid-β PET, respectively. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the associations between baseline and longitudinal plasma pTau181 levels and clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Plasma pTau181 predicted concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis in LBD with abnormal cognition with 87% and 72% accuracy, respectively. In LBD patients with abnormal cognition, higher baseline plasma pTau181 was associated with worse baseline MoCA and CDR-SB, as well as accelerated decline in CDR-SB. Additionally, in this group, rapid increases in plasma pTau181 over 3 years predicted a faster decline in CDR-SB and memory. In LBD patients with normal cognition, there was no association between baseline or longitudinal plasma pTau181 levels and clinical outcomes; however, elevated pTau181 at baseline increased the risk of conversion to cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that plasma pTau181 is a promising biomarker for concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis in LBD. Furthermore, plasma pTau181 holds potential as a prognostic, monitoring, and susceptibility/risk biomarker, predicting disease progression in LBD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:526–538</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27005?af=R">Cerebral Glucose Metabolism Is a Valuable Predictor of Survival in Patients with Lewy Body Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patients with Lewy body diseases have an increased risk of dementia, which is a significant predictor for survival. Posterior cortical hypometabolism on [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) precedes the development of dementia by years. We therefore examined the prognostic value of cerebral glucose metabolism for survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease with dementia, or dementia with Lewy bodies who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET. Regional cerebral metabolism of each patient was analyzed by determining the expression of the PD-related cognitive pattern (<i>Z</i>-score) and by visual PET rating. We analyzed the predictive value of PET for overall survival using Cox regression analyses (age- and sex-corrected) and calculated prognostic indices for the best model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Glucose metabolism was a significant predictor of survival in 259 included patients (n = 118 events; hazard ratio: 1.4 [1.2–1.6] per <i>Z</i>-score; hazard ratio: 1.8 [1.5–2.2] per visual PET rating score; both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Risk stratification with visual PET rating scores yielded a median survival of 4.8, 6.8, and 12.9 years for patients with severe, moderate, and mild posterior cortical hypometabolism (median survival not reached for normal cortical metabolism). Stratification into 5 groups based on the prognostic index revealed 10-year survival rates of 94.1%, 78.3%, 34.7%, 0.0%, and 0.0%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Regional cerebral glucose metabolism is a significant predictor of survival in Lewy body diseases and may allow an earlier survival prediction than the clinical milestone “dementia.” Thus, [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET may improve the basis for therapy decisions, especially for invasive therapeutic procedures like deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The benefits of intravenous thrombolysis are time-dependent, with maximum efficacy when administered within the first “golden” hour after onset. Nevertheless, the impact of golden hour thrombolysis has not been well quantified.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception to August 27, 2023. We included studies that reported safety and efficacy outcomes of ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis in the golden hour versus later treatment window. The primary outcome was an excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days. The secondary efficacy outcome was a good functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2). The main safety outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seven studies involving 78,826 patients met the selection criteria. Golden hour thrombolysis was associated with higher odds of 90-day excellent functional outcomes (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16–1.67) and 90-day good functional outcomes (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.13–1.69) compared with thrombolysis outside the golden hour. The number needed to treat to benefit for golden hour thrombolysis to reduce disability by at least 1 level on the modified Rankin Scale per patient was 2.6. Rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality were similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Golden hour thrombolysis significantly improved acute ischemic stroke outcomes. The findings provide rationale for intensive efforts aimed at expediting thrombolytic therapy within the golden hour window following the onset of acute ischemic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:582–590</p>

<p>Accuracy of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is compared between amyloid-PET visual reads and tau-PET visual reads with either medial temporal lobe binding (tau-MTL+) or with posterolateral temporal or extra-temporal cortical binding (tau-CTX+) as the minimum threshold for an AD tau positive scan. Amyloid- and tau-PET visual reads have similar sensitivity and specificity for detecting AD in cognitively impaired participants. Tau-CTX+ increases specificity for AD, but with significant loss of sensitivity for mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD). Tau-MTL+ increases sensitivity for AD, but there is lower specificity for MCI-AD. [Color figure can be viewed at <a target="_blank"

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We compared the accuracy of amyloid and [<sup>18</sup>F]Flortaucipir (FTP) tau positron emission tomography (PET) visual reads for distinguishing patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia with fluid biomarker support of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants with FTP-PET, amyloid-PET, and diagnosis of dementia-AD (n = 102), MCI-AD (n = 41), non-AD diseases (n = 76), and controls (n = 20) were included. AD status was determined independent of PET by cerebrospinal fluid or plasma biomarkers. The mean age was 66.9 years, and 44.8% were women. Three readers interpreted scans blindly and independently. Amyloid-PET was classified as positive/negative using tracer-specific criteria. FTP-PET was classified as positive with medial temporal lobe (MTL) binding as the minimum uptake indicating AD tau (tau-MTL+), positive with posterolateral temporal or extratemporal cortical binding in an AD-like pattern (tau-CTX+), or negative. The majority of scan interpretations were used to calculate diagnostic accuracy of visual reads in detecting MCI/dementia with fluid biomarker support for AD (MCI/dementia-AD).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sensitivity of amyloid-PET for MCI/dementia-AD was 95.8% (95% confidence interval 91.1–98.4%), which was comparable to tau-CTX+ 92.3% (86.7–96.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.67) and tau-MTL+ 97.2% (93.0–99.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.27). Specificity of amyloid-PET for biomarker-negative healthy and disease controls was 84.4% (75.5–91.0%), which was like tau-CTX+ 88.5% (80.4–94.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.34), and trended toward being higher than tau-MTL+ 75.0% (65.1–83.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.08). Tau-CTX+ had higher specificity than tau-MTL+ (<i>p</i> = 0.0002), but sensitivity was lower (<i>p</i> = 0.02), driven by decreased sensitivity for MCI-AD (80.5% [65.1–91.2] vs. 95.1% [83.5–99.4], <i>p</i> = 0.03).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Amyloid- and tau-PET visual reads have similar sensitivity/specificity for detecting AD in cognitively impaired patients. Visual tau-PET interpretations requiring cortical binding outside MTL increase specificity, but lower sensitivity for MCI-AD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:476–487</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27010?af=R">Metabolic Dysfunction in New‐Onset Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: Identification of Novel Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurometabolic disease with an increasing incidence. The pathophysiology is unknown, but improvement of diagnosis and management requires discovery of novel biomarkers. Our objective was to identify such candidate biomarkers in IIH, and secondarily, test for associations between identified metabolites and disease severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a prospective case–control study with collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, and clinical data from new-onset, treatment-naïve patients with IIH (n = 60). Patients were included consecutively from 2 tertiary headache centers in Denmark, and age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) -matched healthy controls (n = 35) were recruited. Clinical data were retrieved at ocular remission (n = 55). Samples were analyzed using non-targeted mass spectrometry.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Serum sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), adenosine, and glutamate were 0.46-fold (q &lt; 0.0001), 0.25-fold (q = 0.0048), and 0.44-fold (q &lt; 0.0001) lower, respectively, in IIH. CSF stearoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-18) and 2-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-16) were 0.42 (q = 0.0025) and 0.37 (q &lt; 0.001) -fold lower. LysoPC-18 was higher in patients with moderate–severe versus mild papilledema (<i>p</i> = 0.022). LysoPC-18 correlated positively with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (<i>p</i> = 0.0012, r = 0.42) and inversely with mean deviation on automated perimetry (<i>p</i> = 0.01, r = −0.35). Higher baseline serum S1P (<i>p</i> = 0.018) and lower CSF LysoPC-16 (<i>p</i> = 0.003) were associated with optic nerve atrophy at ocular remission. Pathway analysis suggests dysregulated lipid metabolism and redox disturbances in new-onset IIH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identify perturbed metabolism in new-onset IIH. S1P and LysoPC-16 demonstrate potential prognostic value due to association with subsequent optic nerve atrophy. This association between specific, differential metabolites and outcome provides substantial evidence for novel biomarkers of clinical significance that should be the focus of further targeted studies.

                <p>Medical school research faculty is increasingly required to complete more comprehensive and time consuming compliance steps for regulatory oversight. These relate to animal studies, information technology, biosafety, and human resources. For physician-scientists, the additional role in clinical care adds to these research areas with regulatory compliance in patient care and ever-growing web trainings. The sum of all these compliance regimes is a considerable time and cost burden, diminished research performance, and disengagement of faculty from colleagues, collaborations, and institutions. Many research and clinical compliance processes were put in place, often using legacy systems, in well-meaning attempts to address straightforward regulations in humane animal care, safe use of biological agents, and medical care delivery. However, their accumulation and negative impact on faculty performance demand time, energy, and resources that impact academic productivity. There are solutions to a relentlessly increasing regulatory load for research faculty, which involve vertical integration, convergence, and performance assessment in medical school and health system compliance regimes.

     alt="Morphological Characteristics of Retinal Ganglion Cells in the Retinas of Giant Pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)"/>
<p>A thorough morphological analysis demonstrates that the giant pandas’ visual system retains many typical characteristics of crepuscular carnivores, including forward-placed eyes, vertical slit pupils, cellular tapetum membranes, and an avascular retinal structure. In addition, for the first time, we observed a vertically oriented visual streak on the temporal retina. These results suggest that, to adapt to its habitat and special ecological niche, the giant panda evolved a unique way to process binocular information.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Vision plays a crucial role in the survival of animals, and the visual system has particularly selectively evolved in response to the visual environment, ecological niche, and species habitats in vertebrate species. To date, a horizontal streak of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) distribution pattern is observed across mammal species. Here, we report that the giant panda's vertically oriented visual streak, combined with current evidence of the animal's forward-placed eyes, ocular structure, and retinal neural topographic distribution patterns, presents the emergence of a well-adapted binocular visual system. Our results suggest that the giant panda may use a unique way to processing binocular visual information. Results of mathematical simulation are in favor of this hypothesis. The topographic distribution properties of RGCs reported here could be essential for understanding the visual adaptation and evolution of this living fossil.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The processing of rich synaptic information in the dentate gyrus (DG) relies on a diverse population of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons to regulate cellular and circuit activity, in a layer-specific manner. Metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) provide powerful inhibition to the DG circuit, on timescales consistent with behavior and learning, but their role in controlling the activity of interneurons is poorly understood with respect to identified cell types. We hypothesize that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs display cell type-specific heterogeneity in signaling strength, which will have direct ramifications for signal processing in DG networks. To test this, we perform <i>in vitro</i> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from identified DG principal cells and interneurons, followed by GABA<sub>B</sub>R pharmacology, photolysis of caged GABA, and extracellular stimulation of endogenous GABA release to classify the cell type-specific inhibitory potential. Based on our previous classification of DG interneurons, we show that postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated currents are present on all interneuron types albeit at different amplitudes, dependent largely on soma location and synaptic targets. GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs were coupled to inwardly-rectifying K+ channels that strongly reduced the excitability of those interneurons where large currents were observed. These data provide a systematic characterization of GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in the rat DG to provide greater insight into circuit dynamics.</p>

                The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in the dorsal pons responds to bodily threats and transmits alarm signals to the forebrain. Parabrachial neuron activity is enhanced during chronic pain, and inactivation of PBN neurons in mice prevents the establishment of neuropathic, chronic pain symptoms. Chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of all glutamatergic neurons in the PBN, or just the subpopulation that expresses the Calca gene, is sufficient to establish pain phenotypes, including long-lasting tactile allodynia, that scale with the extent of stimulation, thereby promoting nociplastic pain, defined as diffuse pain without tissue inflammation or nerve injury. This review focuses on the role(s) of molecularly defined PBN neurons and the downstream nodes in the brain that contribute to establishing nociplastic pain.

Exo70 transamidation can be repressed by LKB1 phosphorylation of TGM1/3 or the application of cantharidin, an FDA-approved drug.

LTA4H’s location defines its function, whereby it generates leukotriene B4 intracellularly but degrades proline-glycine-proline extracellularly. Airway extracellular LTA4H concentrations are governed by changes in vascular permeability and influx of blood-borne enzyme, which is in turn secreted by liver hepatocytes.

                Metal-ion-dependent nucleases play crucial roles in cellular defense and biotechnological applications. Time-resolved crystallography has resolved catalytic details of metal-ion-dependent DNA hydrolysis and synthesis, uncovering the essential roles of multiple metal ions during catalysis. The histidine-metal (His-Me) superfamily nucleases are renowned for binding one divalent metal ion and requiring a conserved histidine to promote catalysis. Many His-Me family nucleases, including homing endonucleases and Cas9 nuclease, have been adapted for biotechnological and biomedical applications. However, it remains unclear how the single metal ion in His-Me nucleases, together with the histidine, promotes water deprotonation, nucleophilic attack, and phosphodiester bond breakage. By observing DNA hydrolysis <i>in crystallo</i> with His-Me I-PpoI nuclease as a model system, we proved that only one divalent metal ion is required during its catalysis. Moreover, we uncovered several possible deprotonation pathways for the nucleophilic water. Interestingly, binding of the single metal ion and water deprotonation are concerted during catalysis. Our results reveal catalytic details of His-Me nucleases, which is distinct from multi-metal-ion-dependent DNA polymerases and nucleases.

                Antibodies are used in many areas of biomedical and clinical research, but many of these antibodies have not been adequately characterized, which casts doubt on the results reported in many scientific papers. This problem is compounded by a lack of suitable control experiments in many studies. In this article we review the history of the ‘antibody characterization crisis’, and we document efforts and initiatives to address the problem, notably for antibodies that target human proteins. We also present recommendations for a range of stakeholders – researchers, universities, journals, antibody vendors and repositories, scientific societies and funders – to increase the reproducibility of studies that rely on antibodies.

">Opto-CLIP reveals dynamic FMRP regulation of mRNAs upon CA1 neuronal activation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal diversity and function are intricately linked to the dynamic regulation of RNA metabolism, including splicing, localization, and translation. Electrophysiologic studies of synaptic plasticity, models for learning and memory, are disrupted in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is characterized by the loss of FMRP, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) known to bind and suppress translation of specific neuronal RNAs. Since molecular studies have demonstrated that synaptic plasticity in CA1 excitatory hippocampal neurons is protein-synthesis dependent, together these observations have suggested a potential role for FMRP in synaptic plasticity in FXS. To explore this model, we developed a new experimental platform, Opto-CLIP, to integrate optogenetics with cell-type specific FMRP CLIP and RiboTag in CA1 hippocampal neurons, allowing investigation of FMRP- regulated dynamics after neuronal activation. We tracked changes in FMRP binding and ribosome- associated RNA profiles 30 minutes after neuronal activation. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in FMRP-RNA binding to transcripts encoding nuclear proteins, suggesting FMRP translational inhibition may be de-repressed to allow rapid translational responses required for neuronal homeostasis. In contrast, FMRP binding to transcripts encoding synaptic targets were generally stable after activation, but all categories of targets demonstrated variability in FMRP translational control. Opto-CLIP revealed differential regulation of subsets of transcripts within CA1 neurons rapidly after depolarization, and offers promise as a generally useful platform to uncover mechanisms of RBP-mediated RNA regulation in the context of synaptic plasticity.

">Spatially organized striatal neuromodulator release encodes trajectory errors</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed navigation requires animals to continuously evaluate their current direction and speed of travel relative to landmarks to discern whether they are approaching or deviating from their goal. Striatal dopamine and acetylcholine are powerful modulators of goal-directed behavior, but it is unclear whether and how neuromodulator dynamics at landmarks incorporate relative motion for effective behavioral guidance. Using optical measurements in mice, we demonstrate that cue-evoked striatal dopamine release encodes bi-directional 'trajectory errors' reflecting relationships between ongoing speed and direction of locomotion and visual flow relative to optimal goal trajectories. Striatum-wide micro-fiber array recordings resolved an anatomical gradient of trajectory error signaling across the anterior-posterior axis, distinct from trajectory error independent cue signals. Dynamic regression modeling revealed that positive and negative trajectory error encoding emerges early and late respectively during learning and over different time courses in the medial and lateral striatum, enabling region specific contributions to learning. Striatal acetylcholine release also encodes trajectory errors, but encoding is more spatially restricted, opposite polarity, and delayed relative to dopamine, supporting distinct roles in modulating striatal output and behavior. Dopamine trajectory error signaling and task performance were reproduced in a reinforcement learning model incorporating a conjunctive state space representation, suggesting a potential neural substrate for trajectory error generation. Our results establish region specific neuromodulator signals positioned to guide the speed and direction of locomotion to reach goals based on environmental landmarks during navigation.

	<p>Women veterans (WVs) are more likely than men veterans to experience traumatic brain injury (TBI) from causes unrelated to deployment. Yet, current Veterans Health Administration (VHA) TBI screening focuses on deployment. This study examines the utility of the VHA TBI screening tool for WVs. Using the Boston Assessment for TBI-Lifetime (BAT-L) as the gold standard, sensitivity and specificity of the VHA screen were identified for deployment and non-deployment injuries. Injuries missed by the screen were thematically described. Sensitivity and specificity were compared by context (research, clinical). Ninety WVs were included; fifty-three (60.9%) met TBI criteria per the BAT-L. For TBIs occurring during deployment, sensitivity was higher in research (89.1%) compared to clinics (61.7%); specificity was lower in research (60.7%) compared to clinics (93.0%). The BAT-L identified 27 non-deployment TBIs not captured by the VHA screen, most frequently from physical assault or sports. The VHA screen does not include non-deployment events; thus, non-deployment sensitivity and specificity could not be calculated. For lifetime TBIs (deployment + non-deployment etiologies), sensitivity was higher in research (73.5%) compared to clinics (48.9%). Specificity was lower in research (60.0%) compared to clinics (100.0%). Findings can inform improvements to TBI screening among WVs, including expansion for interpersonal violence.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to examine the associations between specific sleep parameters and specific aspects of cognitive functioning in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared with healthy controls (HCs) by using cognitive, subjective, and objective sleep measures. A total of 179 participants were enrolled, all aged &amp;amp;ge; 65 years (mean age = 70.23; SD = 4.74) and with a minimum of six years of education (mean = 12.35; SD = 3.22). The sample included 46 HCs (36 females), 75 individuals with amnestic MCI (aMCI) (51 females), and 58 individuals with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) (39 females). Inhibition, cognitive flexibility as a combined application of inhibitory control and set shifting or task/rule switching, and planning were examined. The following D-KEFS subtests were administered for their evaluation: Verbal Fluency Test, Color&amp;amp;ndash;Word Interference Test, and Tower Test. Self-reported sleep questionnaires (Athens Insomnia Scale, Stop-Bang questionnaire, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index) were used for subjective sleep assessments. Actigraphy was used for objective sleep measurements. Mixed-measures ANOVA, MANOVA, and one-way ANOVA, as well as the Scheffe post hoc test, were applied to the data. The results showed that the three groups exhibited statistically significant differences in the Tower Test (total achievement score, total number of administered problems, and total rule violations). As regards objective sleep measurements, the total sleep time (TST) was measured using actigraphy, and indicated that there are significant differences, with the HC group having a significantly higher mean TST compared to the naMCI group. The relationships evaluated in the TST Tower Test were found to be statistically significant. The findings are discussed in the context of potential parameters that can support the connection between sleep duration, measured as TST, and cognitive planning, as measured using the Tower Test.</p>

                Background: The purpose of this study is to explore the trends and causes of established and emerging nations’ stock market integration with India. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) indices act as a counterweight to international market indices. This study investigates the sustained interest of foreign investors in the Indian stock market in the wake of capital market reforms, as well as whether it moves in tandem with other markets in Asia and the United States. Methods: Our study examined the possibility of cross-country cointegration between the largest economies and indices around the world using multiple financial econometric models, such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Unit Root, Correlation, and Johansen Cointegration. Results: The findings of this study significantly support the notion that Indian and international financial markets are highly integrated. Vector error correction model indicates that the Indian market (NSE) is highly cointegrated with the US market (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) and increased volatility signifies global contagion. Conclusion: A cursory examination of the data reveals distinct investment and portfolio diversification options for global investors. This could assist regulators in formulating more effective rules regarding price discovery processes.

The experimental study and transplantation of pancreatic islets requires their isolation from the surrounding tissue, and therefore, from the vasculature. Under these conditions, avascular islets rely on the diffusion of peripheral oxygen and nutrients to comply with the requirements of islet cells while responding to changes in body glucose. As a complement to the experimental work, computational models have been widely used to estimate how avascular islets would be affected by the hypoxic conditions found both in culture and transplant sites. However, previous models have been based on simplified representations of pancreatic islets which has limited the reach of the simulations performed. Aiming to contribute with a more realistic model of avascular human islets, in this work we used architectures of human islets reconstructed from experimental data to simulate the availability of oxygen for <i>α</i>, <i>β</i> and <i>δ</i>-cells, emulating culture and transplant conditions at different glucose concentrations. The modeling approach proposed allowed us to quantitatively estimate how the loss of cells due to severe hypoxia would impact interactions between islet cells, ultimately segregating the islet into disconnected subnetworks. According to the simulations performed, islet encapsulation, by reducing the oxygen available within the islets, could severely compromise cell viability. Moreover, our model suggests that even without encapsulation, only microislets composed of less than 100 cells would remain viable in oxygenation conditions found in transplant sites. Overall, in this article we delineate a novel modeling methodology to simulate detailed avascular islets in experimental and transplant conditions with potential applications in the field of islet encapsulation.

ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase 2 (Arl2) is crucial for controlling mitochondrial fusion and microtubule assembly in various organisms. Arl2 regulates the asymmetric division of neural stem cells in <i>Drosophila</i> via microtubule growth. However, the function of mammalian Arl2 during cortical development was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mouse Arl2 plays a new role in corticogenesis via regulating microtubule growth, but not mitochondria functions. Arl2 knockdown (KD) leads to impaired proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neuronal migration. Arl2 KD in mouse NPCs significantly diminishes centrosomal microtubule growth and delocalization of centrosomal proteins Cdk5rap2 and γ-tubulin. Moreover, Arl2 physically associates with Cdk5rap2 by in silico prediction using AlphaFold multimer, which was validated by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Remarkably, Cdk5rap2 overexpression significantly rescues the neurogenesis defects caused by Arl2 KD. Therefore, Arl2 plays an important role in mouse cortical development through microtubule growth via the centrosomal protein Cdk5rap2.

Rhoptries are specialized secretory organelles conserved across the Apicomplexa phylum, essential for host cell invasion and critical for subverting of host cellular and immune functions. They contain proteins and membranous materials injected directly into the host cells, participating in parasitophorous vacuole formation. <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> tachyzoites harbor 8 to 12 rhoptries, 2 of which are docked to an apical vesicle (AV), a central element associated with a rhoptry secretory apparatus prior to injection into the host cell. This parasite is also equipped with 5 to 6 microtubule-associated vesicles, presumably serving as AV replenishment for iterative rhoptry discharge. Here, we characterized a rhoptry protein, rhoptry discharge factor 3 (RDF3), crucial for rhoptry discharge and invasion. RDF3 enters the secretory pathway, localizing near the AV and associated with the rhoptry bulb. Upon invasion, RDF3 dynamically delocalizes, suggesting a critical role at the time of rhoptry discharge. Cryo-electron tomography analysis of RDF3-depleted parasites reveals irregularity in microtubule-associated vesicles morphology, presumably impacting on their preparedness to function as an AV. Our findings suggest that RDF3 is priming the microtubule-associated vesicles for rhoptry discharge by a mechanism distinct from the rhoptry secretory apparatus contribution.

                <p>by Alonso Felipe-Ruiz, Sara Zamora-Caballero, Shira Omer Bendori, José R. Penadés, Avigdor Eldar, Alberto Marina</p>

Bacterial interactions are vital for adapting to changing environments, with quorum sensing (QS) systems playing a central role in coordinating behaviors through small signaling molecules. The RRNPPA family is the prevalent QS systems in <i>Bacillota</i> and mediating communication through secreted oligopeptides, which are processed into active pheromones by extracellular proteases. Notably, in several cases the propeptides show the presence of multiple putative pheromones within their sequences, which has been proposed as a mechanism to diversify peptide-receptor specificity and potentially facilitate new functions. However, neither the processes governing the maturation of propeptides containing multiple pheromones, nor their functional significance has been evaluated. Here, using 2 Rap systems from bacteriophages infecting <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> that exhibit different types of pheromone duplication in their propeptides, we investigate the maturation process and the molecular and functional activities of the produced pheromones. Our results reveal that distinct maturation processes generate multiple mature pheromones, which bind to receptors with varying affinities but produce identical structural and biological responses. These findings add additional layers in the complexity of QS communication and regulation, opening new possibilities for microbial social behaviors, highlighting the intricate nature of bacterial interactions and adaptation.

                <p>by Clara Simon, Inka D. Brunke, Bastian Stielow, Ignasi Forné, Anna Mary Steitz, Merle Geller, Iris Rohner, Lisa Marie Weber, Sabrina Fischer, Lea Marie Jeude, Theresa Huber, Andrea Nist, Thorsten Stiewe, Magdalena Huber, Malte Buchholz, Robert Liefke</p>

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses a significant threat due to its tendency to evade early detection, frequent metastasis, and the subsequent challenges in devising effective treatments. Processes that govern epithelial—mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PDAC hold promise for advancing novel therapeutic strategies. SAMD1 (SAM domain-containing protein 1) is a CpG island-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the repression of its target genes. Here, we revealed that SAMD1 acts as a repressor of genes associated with EMT. Upon deletion of SAMD1 in PDAC cells, we observed significantly increased migration rates. SAMD1 exerts its effects by binding to specific genomic targets, including <i>CDH2</i>, encoding N-cadherin, which emerged as a driver of enhanced migration upon SAMD1 knockout. Furthermore, we discovered the FBXO11-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex as an interactor and negative regulator of SAMD1, which inhibits SAMD1 chromatin-binding genome-wide. High <i>FBXO11</i> expression in PDAC is associated with poor prognosis and increased expression of EMT-related genes, underlining an antagonistic relationship between SAMD1 and FBXO11. In summary, our findings provide insights into the regulation of EMT-related genes in PDAC, shedding light on the intricate role of SAMD1 and its interplay with FBXO11 in this cancer type.

                <p>by Madison F. Walker, Jingyi Zhang, William Steiner, Pei-I Ku, Ju-Fen Zhu, Zachary Michaelson, Yu-Chen Yen, Annabel Lee, Alyssa B. Long, Mattie J. Casey, Abhishek Poddar, Isaac B.

Myers</p>

During Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction in development and disease, the atypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) SMOOTHENED (SMO) communicates with GLI transcription factors by binding the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-C) and physically blocking its enzymatic activity. Here, we show that GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2) orchestrates this process during endogenous mouse and zebrafish Hh pathway activation in the primary cilium. Upon SMO activation, GRK2 rapidly relocalizes from the ciliary base to the shaft, triggering SMO phosphorylation and PKA-C interaction. Reconstitution studies reveal that GRK2 phosphorylation enables active SMO to bind PKA-C directly. Lastly, the SMO-GRK2-PKA pathway underlies Hh signal transduction in a range of cellular and in vivo models. Thus, GRK2 phosphorylation of ciliary SMO and the ensuing PKA-C binding and inactivation are critical initiating events for the intracellular steps in Hh signaling. More broadly, our study suggests an expanded role for GRKs in enabling direct GPCR interactions with diverse intracellular effectors.

                <p>by M. Elise Bullock, Thea Hogan, Cayman Williams, Sinead Morris, Maria Nowicka, Minahil Sharjeel, Christiaan van Dorp, Andrew J. Yates, Benedict Seddon</p>

Quantifying the kinetics with which memory T cell populations are generated and maintained is essential for identifying the determinants of the duration of immunity. The quality and persistence of circulating CD4 effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>) and central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) T cells in mice appear to shift with age, but it is unclear whether these changes are driven by the aging host environment, by cell age effects, or both. Here, we address these issues by combining DNA labelling methods, established fate-mapping systems, a novel reporter mouse strain, and mathematical models. Together, these allow us to quantify the dynamics of both young and established circulating memory CD4 T cell subsets, within both young and old mice. We show that that these cells and their descendents become more persistent the longer they reside within the T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> pools. This behaviour may limit memory CD4 T cell diversity by skewing TCR repertoires towards clones generated early in life, but may also compensate for functional defects in new memory cells generated in old age.

                Huntingtin encodes a 3144 amino acid protein, with a polyglutamine repeat tract at the N-terminus. Expansion of this repeat tract above a pathogenic threshold of 36 repeats is the causative mutation of Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons. Here we have characterized twenty Huntingtin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

<p>This review article provides a historical overview of enigmatic neuronal structures originally described in the late 1800s, neuronal intranuclear rodlets, and describes recent studies demonstrating that they belong to a family of recently described mesoscale assemblies of nucleotide-synthesizing enzymes called “cytoophidia” (Greek for “cellular snakes”). The implications for understanding their functional significance and their role in neuronal metabolism, health, and survival are discussed.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Despite myriad technological advances in neuroscience, the nervous system harbors morphological phenomena that continue to defy explanation. First described by the classical microscopists, including Santiago Ramon y Cajal, at the end of the 19th century, the neuronal intranuclear rodlet (INR) has mystified neurohistologists and microscopists for centuries. In this review article, we will provide an overview of the discovery of the INR as well as the subsequent attempts to elucidate its nature and functional significance. We outline our own studies of this structure over the past three decades, focusing on its elusive nature, its interactions with other nuclear organelles, and on disease-related quantitative changes in Alzheimer's disease. We then describe our somewhat serendipitous discovery that these structures are filamentous aggregates of the nucleotide-synthesizing metabolic enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. The filamentation of metabolic enzymes to form mesoscale cellular structures called “rods and rings” or “cytoophidia” (Greek for “cellular snakes”) is a recently described phenomenon that remains to be systematically investigated in the nervous system. Thus, this review provides an intriguing historical juxtaposition in neuroscience, inculcating the neuronal INR, once a mere morphological curiosity, into one of the most rapidly evolving fields in contemporary cell biology.</p>

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscripts’ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

                Abstract* Background Increased expression of signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 3 (SCUBE3) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) has been thought to influence the fibrosis process in many tissues. However, increased expression of these two factors has never been assessed in pleural fibrosis. Pleural fibrosis is a disease that usually results from various infectious processes, such as empyema. Fibrosis formation is recently known to be prevented by Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the most potent active substance found in Gambir (Uncaria gambir Roxb) leaves. Thus, further research is needed to determine the potential of EGCG to inhibit the process of pleural fibrosis caused by empyema. Methods An in vitro experimental study with post test-only controlled group was conducted on the pleural tissue of all patients who underwent decortication surgery due to empyema at Dr. M. Djamil Hospital, Padang, Indonesia between March 1st and April 30, 2024. Case samples were obtained by consecutive sampling, and three patients who met the inclusion criteria were obtained. Pleural tissue in each patient was then divided into several groups based on the treatment, namely the control group, 50 μg EGCG administration group, and 100 μg EGCG administration group. We used to determine SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression. Data were tested using ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests. Results There were significant differences in the SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression of 50 μg and 100 μg EGCG administration groups and the control groups in the 2 × 2 cm sample preparation (p=0.002) (p=0.014, respectively). Significant differences in TGF-β1 expression were also found between the groups treated with EGCG 50 μg and 100 μg and the control group in the 1 × 1 cm preparation (p=0.019). Conclusion EGCG can potentially decrease SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 expression in patients with pleural empyema.

                <p>Many antiseizure medications cause apoptotic cell death in developing brains. The newer antiseizure medication lacosamide is increasingly used in neonates and infants. Neurotoxicity of lacosamide and its combination with levetiracetam was studied in neonatal mice. Animals received single or repeat injections of saline, phenobarbital (75mg/kg), lacosamide (20–40mg/kg), levetiracetam (100mg/kg), lacosamide (40mg/kg) + levetiracetam (100mg/kg) and euthanized at 6 to 30 hours. Cells undergoing apoptosis were increased in the brains of phenobarbital-treated animals. Densities of apoptotic profiles following lacosamide and levetiracetam treatment did not differ from saline-treated controls. Findings suggest that lacosamide, levetiracetam and their combination do not cause apoptosis in developing mouse brains. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) offers a non-invasive approach to detect tumors based on water mobility differences from surrounding tissue. However, reliably discriminating malignancies from benign adipose remains challenging, especially in anatomical regions with abundant fat. The biophysical similarities between tumors and lipid signals create signal ambiguities that limit diagnostic accuracy using conventional reconstruction techniques. Methods We propose a novel low-rank reconstruction framework that combines accelerated diffusion data acquisition, structured low-rank regularization, and deep learning-assisted radiomic analysis to enhance fat-tumor discrimination in DWI. Simultaneous multi-slice imaging and controlled aliasing enable high spatiotemporal resolution while maintaining feasible scan times. A data-driven annihilating filter kernel is then learned from the undersampled data, imposing implicit low-rank constraints to suppress confounding fat signals while retaining tumor texture details during k-space reconstruction. Subsequent radiomic analysis extracts morphological imaging biomarkers from the reconstructed volumes to identify distinctive tumor signatures. Results Comprehensive validation on clinical DWI datasets demonstrates the improved fat-tumor discrimination capability of the proposed framework compared to conventional techniques. The method achieves qualitatively improved clarity and definition of the phantom that was tested which will help in achieving a mean Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUCs) exceeding 0.80 for distinguishing malignant lesions from adipose tissue. Case studies illustrate how better signal specificity enables more confident clinical decisions. Conclusions The integrated low-rank reconstruction and radiomic analysis framework offers a promising solution to the longstanding problem of fat-tumor ambiguity in diffusion MRI. By unleashing the full diagnostic potential of DWI, this methodology can enhance non-invasive cancer screening and monitoring across diverse patient populations and anatomical regions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93273">A hepatocyte-specific transcriptional program driven by Rela and Stat3 exacerbates experimental colitis in mice by modulating bile synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Hepatic factors secreted by the liver promote homeostasis and are pivotal for maintaining the liver-gut axis. Bile acid metabolism is one such example wherein, bile acid synthesis occurs in the liver and its biotransformation happens in the intestine. Dysfunctional interactions between the liver and the intestine stimulate varied pathological outcomes through its bidirectional portal communication. Indeed, aberrant bile acid metabolism has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these crosstalks that perpetuate intestinal permeability and inflammation remain obscure. Here, we identify a novel hepatic gene program regulated by Rela and Stat3 that accentuates the inflammation in an acute experimental colitis model. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of Rela and Stat3 reduces the levels of primary bile acids in both the liver and the gut and shows a restricted colitogenic phenotype. On supplementation of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), knock-out mice exhibit enhanced colitis-induced alterations. This study provides persuasive evidence for the development of multi-organ strategies for treating IBD and identifies a hepatocyte-specific Rela-Stat3 network as a promising therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/10006">Prominin 1 and Tweety Homology 1 both induce extracellular vesicle formation</a></h4>

              
                Prominin-1 (Prom1) is a five-transmembrane-pass integral membrane protein that associates with curved regions of the plasma membrane. Prom1 interacts with membrane cholesterol and actively remodels the plasma membrane. Membrane bending activity is particularly evident in photoreceptors, where Prom1 loss-of-function mutations cause failure of outer segment homeostasis, leading to cone-rod retinal dystrophy (CRRD). The Tweety Homology (Ttyh) protein family has been proposed to be homologous to Prominin, but it is not known whether Ttyh proteins have an analogous membrane-bending function. Here, we characterize the membrane-bending activity of human Prom1 and Ttyh1 in native bilayer membranes. We find that Prom1 and Ttyh1 both induce formation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cultured mammalian cells and that the EVs produced are physically similar. Ttyh1 is more abundant in EV membranes than Prom1 and produces EVs with membranes that are more tubulated than Prom1 EVs. We further show that Prom1 interacts more stably with membrane cholesterol than Ttyh1 and that this may contribute to membrane bending inhibition in Prom1 EVs. Intriguingly, a loss-of-function mutation in Prom1 associated with CRRD induces particularly stable cholesterol binding. These experiments provide mechanistic insight into Prominin function in CRRD and suggest that Prom and Ttyh belong to a single family of functionally related membrane-bending, EV-generating proteins.
