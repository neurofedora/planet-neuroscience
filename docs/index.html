              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18404">Saccade crossing avoidance as a visual search strategy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although visual search appears largely random, several oculomotor biases exist such that the likelihoods of saccade directions and lengths depend on the previous scan path. Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the longer path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection framework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second viewings of "Where's Waldo"?, we report a new memory-dependent effect that also varies significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing avoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in the scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show this by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless approximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model with a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood fitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last $\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known forms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric probabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to reproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also quantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six images viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants with a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and shorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal, vertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that the avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and complements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.

                arXiv:2508.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) dataset as part of the THINGS initiative, comprising over 1.6 million visual stimulus trials collected from 20 participants, and totaling more than twice the size of the most popular current benchmark dataset, THINGS-EEG2. Crucially, our data was recorded using a 32-channel consumer-grade wet electrode system costing ~$2.2k, around 27x cheaper than research-grade EEG systems typically used in cognitive neuroscience labs. Our work is one of the first open-source, large-scale EEG resource designed to closely reflect the quality of hardware that is practical to deploy in real-world, downstream applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We aim to explore the specific question of whether deep neural network-based BCI research and semantic decoding methods can be effectively conducted with such affordable systems, filling an important gap in current literature that is extremely relevant for future research. In our analysis, we not only demonstrate that decoding of high-level semantic information from EEG of visualized images is possible at consumer-grade hardware, but also that our data can facilitate effective EEG-to-Image reconstruction even despite significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to traditional benchmarks, we also conduct analyses of EEG-to-Image models that demonstrate log-linear decoding performance with increasing data volume on our data, and discuss the trade-offs between hardware cost, signal fidelity, and the scale of data collection efforts in increasing the size and utility of currently available datasets. Our contributions aim to pave the way for large-scale, cost-effective EEG research with widely accessible equipment, and position our dataset as a unique resource for the democratization and development of effective deep neural models of visual cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19048">Time Series Analysis of Spiking Neural Systems via Transfer Entropy and Directed Persistent Homology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15784">Emergent time-keeping mechanisms in a deep reinforcement learning agent performing an interval timing task</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.15784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes and frequencies corresponding to the target interval. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01571">Contraction Properties of the Global Workspace Primitive</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.01571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To push forward the important emerging research field surrounding multi-area recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we expand theoretically and empirically on the provably stable RNNs of RNNs introduced by Kozachkov et al. in "RNNs of RNNs: Recursive Construction of Stable Assemblies of Recurrent Neural Networks". We prove relaxed stability conditions for salient special cases of this architecture, most notably for a global workspace modular structure. We then demonstrate empirical success for Global Workspace Sparse Combo Nets with a small number of trainable parameters, not only through strong overall test performance but also greater resilience to removal of individual subnetworks. These empirical results for the global workspace inter-area topology are contingent on stability preservation, highlighting the relevance of our theoretical work for enabling modular RNN success. Further, by exploring sparsity in the connectivity structure between different subnetwork modules more broadly, we improve the state of the art performance for stable RNNs on benchmark sequence processing tasks, thus underscoring the general utility of specialized graph structures for multi-area RNNs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07481">Decoding Saccadic Eye Movements from Brain Signals Using an Endovascular Neural Interface</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.07481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18526">Quantifying The Limits of AI Reasoning: Systematic Neural Network Representations of Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.18526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic, tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning; e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly emulated by a NN.

                arXiv:2508.19019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets, including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for threat intelligence and cyber defense.

                arXiv:2411.15008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolution by natural selection, which is one of the most compelling themes of modern science, brought forth evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation, applying mechanisms of evolution in nature to various problems solved by computers. In this paper we concentrate on evolutionary automata that constitute an analogous model of evolutionary computation compared to well-known evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary automata provide a more complete dual model of evolutionary computation, similar like abstract automata (e.g., Turing machines) form a more formal and precise model compared to recursive algorithms and their subset - evolutionary algorithms. An evolutionary automaton is an automaton that evolves performing evolutionary computation perhaps using an infinite number of generations. This model allows for a direct modeling evolution of evolution, and leads to tremendous expressiveness of evolutionary automata and evolutionary computation. This also gives the hint to the power of natural evolution that is self-evolving by interactive feedback with the environment.

                arXiv:2504.11720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a known growing challenge for radio astronomy, intensified by increasing observatory sensitivity and prevalence of orbital RFI sources. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution for real-time RFI detection by exploiting the time-varying nature of radio observation and neuron dynamics together. This work explores the inclusion of polarisation information in SNN-based RFI detection, using simulated data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) instrument and provides power usage estimates for deploying SNN-based RFI detection on existing neuromorphic hardware. Preliminary results demonstrate state-of-the-art detection accuracy and highlight possible extensive energy-efficiency gains.

                arXiv:2302.00834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interpolation power of deep ReLU neural networks. Specifically, we consider the question of how efficiently, in terms of the number of parameters, deep ReLU networks can interpolate values at $N$ datapoints in the unit ball which are separated by a distance $\delta$. We show that $\Omega(N)$ parameters are required in the regime where $\delta$ is exponentially small in $N$, which gives the sharp result in this regime since $O(N)$ parameters are always sufficient. This also shows that the bit-extraction technique used to prove lower bounds on the VC dimension cannot be applied to irregularly spaced datapoints. Finally, as an application we give a lower bound on the approximation rates that deep ReLU neural networks can achieve for Sobolev spaces at the embedding endpoint.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.

                arXiv:2508.01175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.

">Where is the melody? Spontaneous attention orchestrates melody formation during polyphonic music listening</a></h4>

              
                Humans seamlessly process multi-voice music into a coherent perceptual whole. Yet the neural strategies supporting this experience remain unclear. One fundamental component of this process is the formation of melody, a core structural element of music. Previous work on monophonic listening has provided strong evidence for the neurophysiological basis of melody processing, for example indicating predictive processing as a foundational mechanism underlying melody encoding. However, considerable uncertainty remains about how melodies are formed during polyphonic music listening, as existing theories (e.g., divided attention, figure-ground model, stream integration) fail to unify the full range of empirical findings. Here, we combined behavioral measures with non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) to probe spontaneous attentional bias and melodic expectation while participants listened to two-voice classical excerpts. Our uninstructed listening paradigm eliminated a major experimental constraint, creating a more ecologically-valid setting. We found that attention bias was significantly influenced by both the high-voice superiority effect and intrinsic melodic statistics. We then employed transformer-based models to generate next-note expectation profiles and test competing theories of polyphonic perception. Drawing on our findings, we propose a weighted-integration framework in which attentional bias dynamically calibrates the degree of integration of the competing streams. In doing so, the proposed framework reconciles previous divergent accounts by showing that, even under free-listening conditions, melodies emerge through an attention-guided statistical integration mechanism.

">Contrasting patterns of interleukin signalling in LRRK2 and idiopathic Parkinson's</a></h4>

              
                Sporadic PD and LRRK2-associated Parkinson s Disease (PD) present with similar features although the familial form of disease is classically associated with less cognitive impairment, better REM sleep behaviour, and reduced incidence of hyposmia but more freezing gait and postural instability. Although being classified as the same disease from a clinical perspective there is an ongoing debate on whether these 2 conditions are linked to different causative molecular mechanisms. In this work we analysed the transcriptomics and proteomics profile of sporadic and LRRK2 PD patients to contrast and compare inflammatory markers in blood and CSF. Analyses showed molecular differences in the burden of inflammatory signals clearly differentiating the sporadic and the familial forms of disease. Finally, a cluster of closely connected proteins whose expression levels were changed in the familial forms of disease was highlighted. The levels of these inflammatory markers were associated with tau pathology suggesting this protein cluster might be a system model to evaluate the control of tau metabolism in the presence of LRRK2 mutations.

">Expanding canonical cortical cell type markers in the era of single-cell transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                Cell type markers have been instrumental to physiological and molecular investigation of the human brain and remain essential for annotating cell type clusters in single-cell expression data and for targeted validation studies. However, expression of canonical markers in the target cell type (which we termed as the expression fidelity) as well as expression in unrelated cell types (which we termed as the background expression) across cortical regions remains poorly characterized. Using nearly 500,000 high-quality single-nucleus profiles from 19 studies, we quantified marker fidelity, revealing substantial regional variability. We developed a statistical framework that aggregates annotated barcodes into pseudo-bulk profiles, applied rigorous performance metrics, and identified markers with improved fidelity, reduced background, and consistent expression across regions. This approach extended the canonical marker set for six major brain cell types and yielded superior subtype-specific markers. The resulting marker lists, and a user-friendly analysis interface, provide a valuable resource for cell type annotation and validation in neurological research.

">Robust representation and non-linear spectral integration of simple and complex harmonic sounds in layers 4 and 2/3 of primary auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sound harmonicity is foundational in complex auditory stimuli like music and vocalizations but it remains unclear how such spectrally complex stimuli are processed in the auditory cortex (ACtx). Subregions of the auditory cortex process are thought to process harmonic stimuli differently, and secondary ACtx (A2) layer (L) 2/3 is believed to be the most selective. Selective responses to sound features in ACtx are thought to emerge hierarchically starting from A1 L4. Since the spectral complexity of harmonic stacks can range from two to more than ten components, harmonic selectivity and sensitivity might also arise hierarchically across layers and areas. We studied responses to simple and complex harmonic stacks across A1 L4, A1 L2/3, and A2 L2/3 in adult mice using in vivo two-photon microscopy. We found harmonic-sensitive neurons (HN) responding only to harmonic stacks but not to their pure-tone components in all areas at similar proportions. HNs showed non-linear processing of component tones with onset-responsive HNs showing greater nonlinearity, which decreased with harmonic complexity. Co-tuned HNs in A1 L4 exhibited the highest signal correlation, regardless of harmonic complexity. A1 L4 HNs also showed the lowest noise correlation with other neurons. Moreover, A1 L4 HNs achieve robust spectral integration and harmonic sensitivity by receiving diverse inputs and maintaining high signal correlation, ensuring independent, strong responses to harmonic stimuli. Therefore, harmonic sensitivity is present in A1 L4 and is not a unique feature of A2. Thus, tuning to complex spectral sounds is a fundamental property of ACtx and is already established in A1 L4.

">Facial expression discrimination emerges from neural subspaces shared with detection and identity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the human brain decodes facial expressions remains a fundamental challenge, requiring computational models that tightly connect neural responses to behavior. Here, we demonstrate that rhesus macaques provide a unique and powerful animal model to uncover the neural computations behind human facial expression discrimination, bridging critical gaps between behavior, neural activity, and computational theory. Despite the challenges of establishing reliable behavioral paradigms in macaques, we developed a robust discrimination task spanning six emotional categories, yielding strong, image-by-image behavioral correspondence between macaques and humans. By systematically comparing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to macaque behavior and IT neural data, we found that traditional action unit-xbased models fail to capture image-level behavioral structure, while ANNs with IT-like internal representations outperform all others. Neural recordings showed that the specific IT population responses (70-100 ms) carried the strongest predictive power for facial expression discrimination, underscoring the primacy of feedforward codes in guiding behavior. Expression coding in IT was significantly shaped by face-selective neurons that also encoded identity. This convergence points to a shared functional subspace in IT, where stable (identity) and dynamic (expression) information coexist along overlapping dimensions. Such an architecture moves beyond the classical view of segregated pathways, revealing a general coding principle by which IT flexibly supports multiple socially relevant functions within a common representational geometry.

">Cannabidiol dampens propagation of hippocampal hyperactivity and differentially modulates feedforward and feedback inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD) decreases seizures in patients with severe pediatric-onset epilepsies including Dravet, Lennox-Gastaut, and Tuberous Sclerosis syndromes. However, the effects of CBD on neuronal activity and circuits remain obscure. In the mouse hippocampus, we found that CBD causes a GPR55-independent decrease in CA1 pyramidal neuron firing frequency and a GPR55-dependent reduction in CA3 to CA1 hippocampal activity propagation. CBD-mediated decrease in high-frequency activity was mimicked by GPR55 antagonism and prevented by GPR55 deletion and blockade of GABAergic transmission. Dampening high-frequency activity was accompanied by increased recruitment of parvalbumin+ (PV)-INs and reduced recruitment of somatostatin+ (SST)-INs, leveraging the inhibitory subcircuit to limit propagation of hyperactivity. CBD-induced attenuation of high frequency spike propagation was mimicked by pharmacological enhancement and optogenetic engagement of PV-INs. Such increased on-demand recruitment of PV-INs dampened propagation of high-frequency activity to hippocampal CA1 similarly to CBD. We predict that CBD potentially curbs propagation and perpetuation of seizure activity via these mechanisms.

                <p>by Michael Weldon, Christian Euler</p>

Modern chemical manufacturing, on which human quality of life depends, is unsustainable; alternative production routes must be developed. Electrochemical and biological processes offer promise for upgrading waste streams, including recalcitrant carbon dioxide and plastic-derived wastes. However, the inherent heterogeneity and high energy requirements of upcycling the chemical endpoints of the “take-make-waste" economy remain challenging. <i>Cupriavidus necator</i> is an emergent catalyst for complex feedstock valorization because of its extreme metabolic flexibility, which allows it to utilize a wide array of substrates, and its ability to use carbon dioxide via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. <i>C. necator</i> natively oxidizes hydrogen to power carbon utilization, but its flexibility offers an as-yet unexplored opportunity to couple waste stream oxidation with carbon dioxide utilization instead, potentially enabling carbon conservative waste upcycling. Here, we uncover the constraints on carbon conservative chemical transformation using <i>C. necator</i> as a model. We systematically examine the carbon yield and thermodynamic feasibility of mixotrophic scenarios combining waste-derived carbon sources with hydrogen oxidation to power carbon reassimilation. Then, we evaluate carbon-carbon mixotrophic scenarios, with one carbon source providing electrons in place of hydrogen oxidation. We show that both hydrogen and ethylene glycol are feasible electron sources to drive carbon-neutral or carbon-negative mixotrophic upgrading of waste streams such as acetate or butyrate. In contrast, we find that carbon conservation is likely infeasible for most other waste-derived carbon sources. This work provides a roadmap to establishing novel <i>C. necator</i> strains capable of carbon efficient waste upcycling.

                <p>by Olivia Macmillan-Scott, Mirco Musolesi</p>

The coevolution of signalling is a complex problem within animal behaviour, and is also central to communication between artificial agents. The Sir Philip Sidney game was designed to model this dyadic interaction from an evolutionary biology perspective, and was formulated to demonstrate the emergence of honest signalling. We use Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to show that in the majority of cases, the resulting behaviour adopted by agents is not that shown in the original derivation of the model. This paper demonstrates that MARL can be a powerful tool to study evolutionary dynamics and understand the underlying mechanisms of learning over generations; particularly advantageous is the interpretability of this type of approach, as well as that fact that it allows us to study emergent behaviour without the need to constrain the strategy space from the outset. Although it originally set out to exemplify honest signalling, we show that the game provides no incentive for such behaviour. In the majority of cases, the optimal outcome is one that does not require a signal for the resource to be given. This type of interaction is observed within animal behaviour, and is sometimes denoted proactive prosociality. High learning and low discount rates of the reinforcement learning model are shown to be optimal in order to achieve the outcome that maximises both agents’ reward, and proximity to the given threshold leads to suboptimal learning.

                <p>by A. Mouille, C. Gaillard, E. Astrand, C. Wardak, J.L. Amengual, S. Ben Hamed</p>

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in selecting, maintaining, and representing sensory information, and in its integration with our current internal goals and expectations, implementing such cognitive processes as executive functions, attention, decision-making, and working memory. Performing computation over all of these functional cognitive processes and dynamically shifting from one to the other based on task demands requires a complex functional organization and a high degree of coding flexibility. The PFC cells show a non-linear mixed selectivity characterized by specific tuning for multiple task- and behavior-related parameters. This non-linear mixed selectivity is thought to allow for a high-dimensional representation of information. Here, we asked if the PFC is mainly involved in the specific task-parameters representation, or if it additionally holds a higher-order representation for task-identity. We thus trained two macaques to perform three different tasks: A memory guided saccade task and two detection tasks involving different attention mechanisms. Multi-unit activity was recorded in the frontal eye field, bilaterally, while the monkeys performed these three tasks in the same session. Using demixed Principal Component Analysis, we found a two-dimensional neural state that characterized each of these tasks. The lower dimensional representations of the activity recorded during the performance of the two attentional tasks were more similar to each other than to the memory-guided saccade task. Furthermore, we report that task and spatial information are non-linearly mixed, a signature of a high-dimensional neural representation. Overall, this indicates that PFC encodes task-identity information and flexibly adjusts its sensory processes as a function of the specific ongoing task.

Nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitors (NRTTIs) are potent antiretroviral agents that block HIV replication. A comprehensive lead optimization campaign was undertaken to develop a novel long-acting NRTTI with the potential for extended-duration dosing for HIV prophylaxis. Broad exploration of nucleoside structure–activity relationship (SAR), leveraging ribose core, periphery, and nucleobase modifications, along with systematic progression of compounds of interest through key in vitro and in vivo studies led to the discovery of MK-8527. MK-8527 is a novel deoxyadenosine analog that is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active triphosphate (TP) form, which inhibits reverse transcription. Iron footprinting and primer extension assays demonstrated that MK-8527-TP inhibits translocation of reverse transcriptase on the primer and template, and this inhibition allows for both immediate and delayed chain termination of reverse transcription. MK-8527 inhibits viral replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.21 nM. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of MK-8527 in rats and rhesus monkeys was characterized by low-to-moderate clearance and volume of distribution, with good oral absorption (57% and 100% in rats and monkeys, respectively). Following oral administration of MK-8527 to monkeys, MK-8527-TP exhibited an intracellular half-life of approximately 48 h in PBMCs, significantly longer than the apparent plasma half-life of the parent compound (approximately 7 h). MK-8527 and MK-8527-TP demonstrated favorable in vitro off-target profiles, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of ≥95 µM against human DNA polymerases tested, and no off-target activities at 10 μM against a panel of 114 enzyme and receptor binding assays. Collectively, the potent antiretroviral activity and favorable preclinical PK and off-target profiles make MK-8527 an attractive clinical candidate, and it is currently in clinical trials for once-monthly oral HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis.

                <p>by Hao Wang, Lei Cao, Huan Zhang, Zhaoshan Zhong, Li Zhou, Chao Lian, Xiaocheng Wang, Hao Chen, Minxiao Wang, Xin Zhang, Chaolun Li</p>

The alvinellid worm <i>Paralvinella hessleri</i> is the only animal that colonizes the hottest part of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the west pacific. We found <i>P. hessleri</i> accumulates exceptionally high level of toxic element arsenic (>1% of wet weight) and tolerated elevated concentrations hydrogen sulphide. Using advanced microscopy, elementary analysis, and genomics and proteomics approaches, we identified a previously unrecognized arsenic-sulfide biomineralization process in <i>P. hessleri</i>. Our data suggest that arsenic accumulates within epithelial cell granules, where it likely reacts with sulphide diffused inward from the hydrothermal vent fluid, resulting in the intracellular formation of orpiment (As₂S₃) minerals. In this “fighting poison with poison” manner, the highly toxic arsenic and sulphide were simultaneously detoxified in the form of orpiment minerals within the intracellular granules of the single layer of epithelial cells. This process represents a remarkable adaptation to extreme chemical environments. Our study provides new insights into understanding animals’ environment adaptation mechanisms and the diversity and plasticity of biomineralization.

                <p>by Golnar Gharooni-Fard, Chethan Kavaraganahalli Prasanna, Orit Peleg, Francisco López Jiménez</p>

Honeybees are renowned for their skills in building intricate and adaptive combs that display notable variation in cell size. However, the extent of their adaptability in constructing honeycombs with varied cell sizes has not been thoroughly investigated. We use 3D-printing and X-ray microscopy to quantify honeybees’ capacity in adjusting the comb to different initial conditions. Our findings suggest three distinct comb construction modes in response to foundations with varying sizes of 3D-printed cells. For smaller foundations, bees occasionally merge adjacent cells to compensate for the reduced space. However, for larger cell sizes, the hive uses adaptive strategies such as tilting for foundations with cells up to twice the reference size and layering for cells that are three times larger than the reference cell. Our findings shed light on honeybees adaptive comb construction abilities, significant for the biology of self-organized collective behavior, as well as for bio-inspired engineered systems.

<p>This study demonstrates that intranasal Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell (WJ-MSC) administration at 3 or 10 days post-insult reduced the lesion size and sensorimotor impairment following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury in mice. WJ-MSCs expressed receptors for HI-upregulated chemokines and migrated from the nasal cavity into the meninges and brain parenchyma. WJ-MSCs inhibited neuroinflammation and boosted neuroregeneration via their secretome.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) caused by perinatal asphyxia is a primary cause of long-term neurological morbidity. Hypothermia is the sole available clinical intervention despite its limited efficacy. Intranasal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show promise for the treatment of HIBI. This study explores the efficacy, migration, treatment window, and therapeutic mechanisms of intranasally applied Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) in a neonatal HIBI mouse model, and assesses its therapeutic benefit in conjunction with hypothermia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nine-day-old C57BL/6 mice underwent hypoxia-ischemia (HI), with or without hypothermia, and were intranasally dosed with 0.1 to 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> WJ-MSCs, at 3 or 10 days post-HI. WJ-MSCs were traced using different techniques. Neurogenesis was examined 2 days post-treatment. Neuroinflammation, sensorimqotor outcome, and neuronal tissue loss was assessed 28 days post-HI. Additionally, anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative properties of WJ-MSCs were investigated in non-contact co-cultures with microglia and neural stem cells, and by secretome profiling.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intranasally delivered WJ-MSCs reduced HI-induced lesion size and sensorimotor impairments. WJ-MSCs expressed multiple receptors for upregulated chemokines in the HI-lesion, and migrated from the nasal cavity into the meninges and brain parenchyma. WJ-MSCs secreted a broad spectrum of immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative proteins, and inhibited neuroinflammation and boosted neuroregeneration <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. WJ-MSC potency was sustained across different donors. Importantly, intranasal WJ-MSCs augmented the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia following neonatal HIBI in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides new translational evidence that intranasal WJ-MSCs, either alone or in combination with hypothermia, mitigate the consequences of neonatal HIBI by resolving inflammation and boosting neurorepair through their secretome. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterize changes in candidate biomarkers in early multiple system atrophy (MSA) and identify baseline predictors of faster progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This 1-year, multicenter, prospective study assessed clinical, neuroimaging (3T-magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography [DaT-SPECT]), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) changes in patients with early MSA (&lt; 5 years from symptom onset) and healthy controls (HCs). Clinical and biomarker changes from baseline to 6 months (M6) and 12 months (M12) were analyzed. Survival status was collected at 24 months. Mixed linear regression analyzed repeated measures, whereas univariate regression identified biomarkers linked to progression. Sample size simulations were conducted for future trials.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-one patients with MSA and 20 HCs were included in this study. The Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS)-I + II scores worsened (mean percent change from baseline was 19.8% at M6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 13.3 to 26.4% and 31.1% 95% CI = 24.9 to 37.2% at M12). Patients with MSA showed increased cerebellar white matter and pons atrophy (M6 = −5.9 to −2.8% and M12 = −9 to −4.9%) and decreased striatal specific binding ratio (SBR; M6 = −15.8 to −7.9% and M12 = −24 to −10.4%). Patients with multiple system atrophy parkinsonian (MSA-P) exhibited greater striatal SBR reduction, whereas patients with multiple system atrophy cerebellar (MSA-C) had greater cerebellar and pons atrophy, evident at M6. Baseline brainstem and pons volume predicted clinical worsening at M6, whereas SBR predicted worsening at M12. Higher plasma NfL levels correlated with early dropout (14% at M12), worse UMSARS scores, lower SBR, and increased mortality risk within 24 months.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging changes occur within 6 months in early MSA. High plasma NfL levels are linked to increased mortality and dropout risk. Longitudinal biomarker assessments provide valuable insights into disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Zhu et al. determine three cryo-EM structures of human TMEM175 bound to synergistic agonists binding at two discrete sites and reveal its activation mechanisms. Through structure-based drug discovery, they develop TMEM175 agonists that enhance the clearance of pathological α-synuclein and rescue functional deficits of TMEM175 variants in PD patients.

                Xiao et al. show that brief bursts of hippocampal activity (ripples) help the brain link new experiences into an internal “mental map.” During rest, ripples engage a medial frontal brain region that organizes knowledge into structured forms, enabling people to make flexible inferences beyond what they directly learned.

                Chia et al. find that inflammatory NF-κB signaling serves distinct functions within HSCs vs. the bone marrow milieu: HSC-intrinsic NF-κB promotes HSC quiescence and limits function, while an inflamed milieu directs HSC epigenomic reprogramming toward myeloid bias. Omics signatures of both HSC-intrinsic and milieu inflammation occur in aged mice and humans.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 26 August 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02045-7">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-02045-7</a></p>When navigating through the world, we can predict our next location on the basis of an internal sense of our location and velocity, but we can also orient to external visual sensory cues to update and stabilize this sense of location and velocity. A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98775">Chronic hyperactivation of midbrain dopamine neurons causes preferential dopamine neuron degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the death of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neurons, but the pathophysiological mechanisms that precede and drive their death remain unknown. The activity of DA neurons is likely altered in PD, but we understand little about if or how chronic changes in activity may contribute to degeneration. To address this question, we developed a chemogenetic (DREADD) mouse model to chronically increase DA neuron activity and confirmed this increase using ex vivo electrophysiology. Chronic hyperactivation of DA neurons resulted in prolonged increases in locomotor activity during the light cycle and decreases during the dark cycle, consistent with chronic changes in DA release and circadian disturbances. We also observed early, preferential degeneration of SNc projections, recapitulating the PD hallmarks of selective vulnerability of SNc axons and the comparative resilience of ventral tegmental area axons. This was followed by the eventual loss of midbrain DA neurons. Continuous DREADD activation resulted in a sustained increase in baseline calcium levels, supporting a role for increased calcium in the neurodegeneration process. Finally, spatial transcriptomics from DREADD mice examining midbrain DA neurons and striatal targets, and cross-validation with human patient samples, provided insights into potential mechanisms of hyperactivity-induced toxicity and PD. Our results thus reveal the preferential vulnerability of SNc DA neurons to increased neural activity and support a potential role for increased neural activity in driving degeneration in PD.

                Neural responses evoked by a stimulus reduce upon repetition. While this adaptation allows the sensory system to attend to novel cues, does information about the recurring stimulus, particularly its intensity, get compromised? We explored this issue in the locust olfactory system. We found that locusts’ innate behavioral response to odorants varied with repetition and stimulus intensity. Counterintuitively, the stimulus-intensity dependent differences became significant only after adaptation had set in. Adaptation altered responses of individual neurons in the antennal lobe (neural network downstream to insect antenna). These response variations to repetitions of the same stimulus were unpredictable and inconsistent across intensities. Although both adaptation and intensity decrements resulted in an overall reduction in spiking activities across neurons, these changes could be disentangled, and information about stimulus intensity was robustly maintained by ensemble neural responses. In sum, these results show how information about odor intensity can be preserved in an adaptation-invariant manner.

">Precise Extraction of Neural Motifs Reveals Multiscale, Parallel Encoding Schemes in Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural population activity is often stereotyped into recurring activity patterns, i.e., neural motifs, which can be seen as the fundamental building blocks in sensory processing and cognition. In this work we study the codes carried by such neural motifs in primary auditory cortex A1, and analyze how they build on and complement traditional views of single-unit coding. In particular, we study, using two-photon calcium imaging (CI), how activity in A1 differentially represents both sensory stimuli and task and behavioral variables in each of the parallel single neuron and population motif scales. While CI enables the study of neural motifs by capturing the activity of large neural populations, identifying motifs in CI is hampered by the temporal imprecision of current motif-detection algorithms when applied to CI data. We thus developed a new algorithm for motif detection, which enabled us to identify widespread stimulus-encoding motifs as well as a small number of motifs jointly encoding stimulus and choice in Layer 2/3 of A1. These motifs consist of small groups of neurons that are neither clustered nor regularly ordered in space. Interestingly, active neurons within task-encoding motifs exhibit mixed encoding properties inconsistent with the motifs they participate in. Together, these results demonstrate how single unit activity and neural motifs in A1 L2/3 provide different levels of coding granularity containing different information in parallel within the greater neural population. Generally, our results indicate that downstream populations, by selecting which scale of a population drives them, can be selective in the information collected for later cognitive processing.

">Cerebral Organoids Uncover Mechanisms of Neural Activity Changes in Epileptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Neurological disorders often originate from progressive brain network dysfunctions that start years before symptoms ap- pear. How these changes emerge in the developing human brain remains elusive due to a lack of tractable model systems. Here, we show a cerebral organoid model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) that recapitulates hallmarks of epileptogenesis in vitro. We compare extracellular recordings of TSC organoids with intraoperative electrocorticography from TSC patients to reveal striking functional similarities, including high-frequency oscillations - an electrical biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. In TSC, a human-specific interneuron sub-type derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence drives network hyper-synchronization through increased spontaneous firing and altered excitability. Inhibiting overproliferation of its progenitors via long-term epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition prevented the onset of this pathological phenotype at functional and morphological levels. Our work shows that organoids allow mechanistic analysis of emerging neural network phenotypes, enabling anti-epileptogenic drug testing in a human brain development model.

">Goal-directed hippocampal theta sweeps during memory-guided navigation</a></h4>

              
                During navigation animals continuously sample their surrounding space and plan trajectories to distant goals. The brain mechanisms underlying these behaviors and how they coordinate to support memory-guided navigation in open environments is not understood. Using large scale recordings from behaving rats, we found two distinct types of place cell sequences within theta cycles that encoded trajectories sweeping beyond the animal's current location: stereotypic left-right alternating sweeps and learning-dependent goal-directed sweeps. Goal-directed sweeps predicted upcoming trajectories to remembered goal locations, were coordinated with prefrontal cortex activity and preferentially replayed during sharp-wave ripples. We describe a circuit mechanism for goal-directed theta sweeps involving an egocentric goal-direction signal in a subpopulation of CA1 cells together with reduced feedback inhibition. These results indicate a flexible mechanism to support different behavioral demands during navigation.

">Sensorimotor dynamics in the superior colliculus of the echolocating bat</a></h4>

              
                To successfully execute natural tasks, animals must continuously monitor and integrate dynamic sensory information to guide behavior. While this process, known as active sensing, is fundamental to goal-directed behavior, the mechanisms by which sensory information supports motor planning, particularly across different behavioral contexts, remains poorly understood. We investigated sensory and motor activity in the superior colliculus (SC) of echolocating bats, a powerful model system to study active sensing behaviors due to their reliance on self-generated sonar signals. We recorded multichannel SC activity while bats performed spatial navigation and target tracking behaviors. We hypothesized that changes in sensory signals (i.e., returning echoes) drive quantifiable adjustments in SC activity related to sonar call production, and that adaptive changes in SC sensorimotor processing are preserved across behavioral contexts. We examined pooled SC activity using a dimensionality reduction technique to isolate the largest changes in firing rates across multichannel SC recordings. We then examined the variation in SC activity from the time of echo arrival (sensory input) to call production (motor output). Our data show that increases in call rate are associated with shorter trajectory lengths in neural state space, reflecting reduced variability and increased efficiency in population activity. Strikingly, when bats cluster calls into sonar sound groups (SSGs, which are rapid bursts of calls to increase sensory sampling), SC activity is distinct from times when bats produce isolated calls. Notably, we find that successive SSGs lead to progressively shorter trajectory lengths, suggesting a refinement of sensorimotor processing across successive SSGs. Together, our findings demonstrate that sensorimotor population dynamics in the SC follow common principles across distinct behavioral tasks. These results support a fundamental role for the SC in adaptive sensing and highlight its contribution to flexible sensorimotor transformations in natural behaviors.

">Dual inhibition of sEH and COX-2 Improved Cognition in Alzheimer's Disease via Enhanced Myogenic Response and Cerebral Artery Distensibility</a></h4>

              
                Genetic studies have linked EPHX2 (encoding soluble epoxide hydrolase, sEH) and PTGS2 (encoding cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2) to Alzheimers disease (AD). Elevated levels of sEH and COX-2 found in AD patients and animals suggest their involvement in neurodegeneration, glial activation, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation. This study evaluated a new dual sEH/COX-2 inhibitor, PTUPB, on cerebrovascular function and cognition in TgF344-AD rats. The rats received oral PTUPB (2mg/kg/day) for 25 days. Body weight, plasma glucose, and HbA1c levels remained stable between PTUPB- and vehicle-treated AD rats. PTUPB significantly improved recognition memory in AD rats, as detected by the Novel Object Recognition test. Pressure myography showed that PTUPB restored myogenic responses and increased the distensibility of the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) in AD rats. Acute PTUPB (0.1 and 1M) enhanced myogenic contraction in response to elevated perfusion pressure in AD MCAs, with minimal effects in wild-type vessels. Vehicle-treated AD rats displayed impaired functional hyperemia, whereas PTUPB (1M) significantly restored this response. Transcriptomic analysis of cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells from AD rats indicated that PTUPB influences genes related to contractility, extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These results provide new evidence that dual inhibition of sEH and COX-2 improves cognition in AD, likely by enhancing myogenic responses and increasing cerebral artery distensibility. Our findings highlight the potential of PTUPB as a therapeutic approach for cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.

">ComBat-Predict enhances generalizability of neuroimaging models to new sites</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging is vital in quantifying brain atrophy due to typical aging and due to neurodegenerative diseases. To collect large samples necessary to model lifespan brain development, research consortiums aggregate images acquired across multiple study sites. Previous studies have demonstrated that this multi-site study design can lead to site-related bias, necessitating harmonization of these "site effects". However, current methodologies are unable to generalize to new sites outside the original harmonized sample, limiting translation to new sites or clinical practice. Here, we propose a method called ComBat-Predict (CB-Predict) building upon the ComBat method for site effect adjustment, which extends to data from a new site with smaller sample sizes and unknown site effects. In data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), our proposed method mitigates bias and yields high accuracy in predicting cortical thickness measures when generalizing the model to new data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed harmonization method can reduce site-related variance in centile scores estimated using data from the Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium (LBCC). Altogether, our results demonstrate that CB-Predict effectively harmonizes new sites and thereby enables effective translation of neuroimaging models to additional samples.

">Efficacy of chronic 5-HT1A receptor agonism by NLX-112 in a mouse model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence in the ataxin-3 protein. This expansion triggers neuropathological events, leading to progressive motor disturbances. Currently, no approved therapy exists for this debilitating condition, but compelling evidence suggests that targeting the serotonergic system can significantly attenuate SCA3 disease progression in animal models. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of NLX-112, a highly selective serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) full agonist, in the CMVMJD135 transgenic mouse model of SCA3. Methods: NLX-112 (0.625 and 5 mg/kg/day) and tandospirone (a 5-HT1AR partial agonist used as a comparator; 20 and 80 mg/kg/day) were administered chronically in drinking water for 34 weeks, starting prior to symptom onset. To evaluate the effects of the drugs on SCA3 mice, motor-related behavioral tests and neuropathological techniques were employed. Results: Treatment with the higher dose of NLX-112 led to improvements in motor coordination and balance, and slowing of symptom deterioration as the disease progressed. These beneficial effects were not achieved with tandospirone. NLX-112 treatment also elicited neuroprotective effects, reducing dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) cell loss and astrocyte reactivity in the substantia nigra. Conclusions: NLX-112 treatment, started presymptomatically, enhanced motor function, slowed disease progression and elicited neuroprotective effects in SCA3 mice, supporting its further development as a drug candidate for treatment of ataxia and related movement disorders.

">A molecularly defined basalo-prefrontal-thalamic circuit regulates sensory and affective dimensions of pain</a></h4>

              
                Both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and thalamus have been implicated in pain regulation. However, the roles of the mPFC-thalamus connection in pain and how the mPFC modulates nociceptive processing within the brain remain unclear. Here, we show that the mPFC neurons that project to thalamus are marked by Foxp2 expression and deactivated in both acute and chronic pain. Persistent inactivation of the mPFC Foxp2+ neurons enhances nociceptive sensitivity, while their activation alleviates multiple aspects of pain. Circuit-specific manipulations revealed that the projections to parataenial nucleus, mediodorsal and ventromedial thalamus differentially modulate sensory and affective pain. Additionally, the mPFC Foxp2+ neurons receive cholinergic input from the basal forebrain, particularly the horizonal diagonal band (HDB). Notably, activation of the 4{beta}2-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in mPFC exerts antinociceptive effects in Foxp2+ neuron-dependent manner. Together, our study defines an HDB[-&gt;]mPFCFoxp2[-&gt;]thalamus circuit essential for sensory and affective pain modulation and underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting mPFC cholinergic signaling in chronic pain management.

">Genome-edited retinal organoids restore host bipolar connectivity in the primate macula</a></h4>

              
                Retinal organoids (ROs) represent a promising regenerative strategy for restoring vision in retinal degenerative diseases, but whether host cone bipolar cells (BCs) in the primate macula can rewire with transplanted photoreceptors remains unresolved. Here, we transplanted genome-edited human retinal organoids lacking ON-BCs (Islet-1-/-ROs) into a non-human primate macular degeneration model. Remarkably, host rod and cone BCs extended dendrites toward grafted photoreceptors, forming functional synapses confirmed by immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural imaging, and focal macular electroretinography. Both ON- and OFF-pathway connectivity was rebuilt, providing the first demonstration of host-graft synaptic integration in the primate macula. These results establish that primate cone circuits retain a surprising capacity for rewiring and highlight genome-edited ROs as a powerful platform for vision restoration. Our findings represent a critical translational step toward stem cel-based therapies capable of repairing central vision in patients with advanced macular degeneration.

">Psychological scales in the brain: Trait-linked questionnaire items evoke similar neural patterns in the mPFC</a></h4>

              
                Self-report questionnaires are widely used across psychology and related disciplines, yet the cognitive and neural processes underlying how individuals generate responses to such items remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether items from the same psychological scale evoke similar neural activation patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region consistently implicated in self-referential processing. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants completed a self-reference task in which they judged how well 72 personality-related questionnaire items (e.g., from the Big Five, emotion regulation, and well-being scales) described themselves. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that items from the same scale elicited more similar multivoxel activation patterns in the mPFC compared to items from different scales. This effect was specific to the self-reference task and was not observed during a semantic judgment control task using the same items. Furthermore, the mPFC encoded not only categorical scale membership but also graded psychological similarity among scales, as reflected in inter-scale behavioral correlations. Importantly, these effects remained significant even after controlling for sentence-level semantic similarity using multiple regression RSA, indicating that the observed neural structure reflects psychological rather than linguistic similarity. These findings suggest that the mPFC integrates internally constructed evidence in a construct-sensitive manner during self-report, and they open new avenues for linking psychological assessment with neural representation. We discuss the implications for understanding self-report as a cognitive process and for future work on neuroimaging-informed scale validation.

">40 Hz Audiovisual Stimulation Improves Sustained Attention and Related Brain Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) have long been theorized to play a key role in sensory processing and attention by coordinating neural firing across distributed neurons. Gamma oscillations can be generated internally by neural circuits during attention or exogenously by stimuli that turn on and off at gamma frequencies. However, it remains unknown if driving gamma activity via exogenous sensory stimulation affects attention. We tested the hypothesis that non-invasive audiovisual stimulation in the form of flashing lights and sounds (flicker) at 40 Hz improves attention in an attentional vigilance task and affects neural oscillations associated with attention. We recorded scalp EEG activity of healthy adults (n=62) during one hour of either 40 Hz audiovisual flicker, no flicker as control, or randomized flicker as sham stimulation, while subjects performed a psychomotor vigilance task. Participants exposed to 40 Hz flicker stimulation had better accuracy and faster reaction times than participants in the control groups. The 40 Hz group showed increased 40 Hz activity compared to the control groups in agreement with previous studies. Surprisingly, 40 Hz subjects had significantly lower delta power (2-4 Hz), which is associated with arousal, and higher functional connectivity in lower alpha (8-10 Hz), which is associated with attention processes. Furthermore, decreased delta power and increased lower alpha functional connectivity were correlated with better attention task performance. This study reveals how gamma audiovisual stimulation improves attention performance with potential implications for therapeutic interventions for attention disorders and cognitive enhancement.

">Post-synaptic facilitation and network dynamics underlying stimulus-specific combination sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Combination-sensitive neurons (CSNs) integrate multiple stimulus features to generate behaviorally meaningful responses. While such neurons are well studied in fast timescale systems such as bat echolocation, the mechanisms enabling extended temporal integration in species like songbirds remain poorly understood. Using a computational model, we show that syllable-specific neurons in the songbird auditory system function as coincidence detectors whose selectivity depends on both post-inhibitory facilitation and persistent network activity. This persistence serves as a "memory trace", allowing precise association of sequential syllables across hundreds of milliseconds. We propose that this dynamic interplay between intrinsic neuronal properties and convergent synaptic inputs gives rise to a higher-order "meta-combination sensitivity" enabling the auditory system to transform discrete acoustic events into temporally extended percepts. Our findings provide a mechanistic framework that bridges theories of coincidence detection with longer-timescale working memory, highlighting the importance of distributed network mechanisms for auditory temporal coding.

                <p>by Moein Khajehnejad, Julian García, Bernd Meyer</p>

Age-polyethism—the age-based allocation of tasks in social insect colonies—is a key feature of division of labour. While its hormonal underpinnings have been studied extensively, the behavioural and environmental mechanisms driving age-polyethism remain poorly understood, especially under ecological stress. We present a novel modelling framework that integrates social learning with task-related environmental feedback to explain the emergence and breakdown of age-polyethism. We develop two models: a Social Learning (SL) model, in which individuals adapt task preferences by copying similar peers, and a Stimulus-Response Threshold Social Learning (SRT-SL) model, which extends this framework by incorporating task-related dynamic stimuli and response thresholds that regulate collective task demand. Our models demonstrate that age-polyethism can emerge from simple social imitation processes, without the need for fixed hormonal schedules. We show that under increasing environmental pressure (e.g., resource scarcity), age-polyethism collapses as younger individuals are forced into tasks typically handled by older workers. Importantly, we find that age-polyethism does not necessarily optimize immediate colony efficiency; instead, it appears to reflect a trade-off between environmental constraints and behavioural coordination. These findings provide a mechanistic and ecologically grounded explanation for empirical observations linking environmental stress to dysfunctional division of labour and colony collapse.

                <p>by Kien Trung Tran, Tran Dang Nguyen, Daniel B. Weissman, Eric Zhewen Li, Sachel Mok, Jennifer L. Small-Saunders, Teun Bousema, Robert J. Zupko, Thu Nguyen-Anh Tran, Maciej F. Boni</p>

When multiple beneficial alleles at multiple loci are present in a population but not linked together in any one individual, there is no general evolutionary result that determines whether recombination will speed up or slow down the emergence and evolution of genotypes carrying multiple beneficial alleles. Translated to infectious disease control, this evolutionary uncertainty means that when multiple types of drug resistance are present we do not know whether recombination will act more strongly to (1) bring together single-resistant genotypes into multi-drug resistant (MDR) genotypes, or (2) break apart MDR genotypes into single-resistant genotypes. In this paper, we introduce a new version of an established and validated individual-based malaria transmission model where we have added 25 drug-resistance related loci, individual mosquito bites, and mosquitoes feeding on multiple hosts in a single meal (interrupted feeds) allowing for recombination events of different <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> genotypes from different hosts. Recombination among <i>P. falciparum</i> genotypes in this model occurs from two sources of variation, multi-clonal infections in single hosts and interrupted feeds on multiple hosts, and we show that 80% to 97% of MDR recombinant falciparum genotypes are projected to occur from single uninterrupted bites on hosts with multi-clonal infections (for malaria prevalence > 5%). Increases in the model’s interrupted feeding rate slowly increase the number of recombination events occurring from interrupted feeds. A comparison of drug-resistance management strategies with this new model shows that, over a 15-year timeframe, triple artemisinin-combination therapies (ACT) strategies show the largest reductions in treatment failures and the longest delays until artemisinin resistance reaches a critical 1% threshold. Multiple first-line therapies (MFT) are second best under these criteria, and ACT cycling approaches are third best. When compared to cycling strategies, MFT strategies generate a greater diversity of recombinant genotypes but fewer recombination events generating MDR and slower emergence of these recombinant MDR genotypes.

Predicting the amyloid fold and the propensity of peptide segments to adopt amyloid-like structures remain a challenge. However, recent progress has facilitated structure-based prediction of steric zipper propensity and the use of machine learning to accelerate the calculation of predictive models across many scientific areas. Leveraging these advances, we have developed a new approach for rapid proteome-wide assessment of zipper profiles that is informed by four million steric zipper predictions collected over ten years. This collection is used to build a machine learning model capable of rapidly predicting steric zipper propensity, and allowing for the assessment of zippers at both the protein and proteome level. Our predictions show enrichment for zipper forming segments in proteins involved in cell wall reorganization in yeast, highlighting a potential category of interest for experimental characterization. Overall, our predictive model allows for the exploration of amyloid formation across the tree of life and provides a tool for assessment of both novel and designed sequences for zipper density.

                <p>by Léa Loisel, Vincent Raquin, Maxime Ratinier, Pauline Ezanno, Gaël Beaunée</p>

Arboviruses represent a significant threat to the health of humans, animals, and plants worldwide. Mechanistic modeling has proven useful for elucidating the transmission, anticipating the spread, and predicting the response of arboviruses to control measures. However, most models approximate the intra-vector infection dynamic (IVD), which occurs during the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), by a single stage with an average duration. At the end of this stage, all exposed vectors are expected to become infectious. Strong assumption is hidden behind this: that the EIP is exponentially distributed in the vector population. To assess the validity of this assumption, we developed a stochastic compartmental model that represents successive IVD stages, associated with the crossing or not of the three within-mosquito barriers (infection, dissemination, and transmission). We calibrated the model using an ABC-SMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo) method, which includes model selection. We searched for literature data on experimental infections of <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes infected by dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses. We demonstrated the large discrepancy between the exponential hypothesis and observed EIP distributions for dengue and Zika viruses, and identified more relevant EIP distributions. This work provides a generic modeling framework that can be applied to other arboviruses for which similar data are available. Our model also can be linked to population-scale models to aid future arbovirus control efforts.

Background <p>While the RNA-binding protein HuR is implicated in individual cancers, its comprehensive diagnostic, prognostic, and immunological roles across diverse cancer types remain unexplored.</p> Methods <p>We performed an integrated pan-cancer analysis of HuR using public datasets. This encompassed expression profiling, survival analysis, diagnostic accuracy assessment, immune microenvironment characterization, and drug sensitivity prediction. We investigated HuR’s regulatory mechanisms through pathway correlation and differential gene expression analyses.</p> Results <p>HuR expression was consistently elevated across multiple cancers and correlated with poor patient prognosis. It demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (>85%) via TMB/PD-L1 biomarkers. High HuR expression was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and reduced efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, establishing it as a key immunoregulatory biomarker. HuR also predicted sensitivity to cell cycle inhibitors and other pathway-targeted drugs. Mechanistically, HuR drives malignancy by dysregulating core processes: cell cycle progression, immune evasion, and cellular metabolism.</p> Conclusions <p>Our pan-cancer analysis establishes HuR as a consistently upregulated oncogenic driver across malignancies, functioning as a potential universal biomarker for prognosis and diagnosis. Its critical roles in modulating the immune response and predicting therapeutic sensitivity highlight its importance for personalized cancer treatment strategies. HuR orchestrates tumorigenesis and malignant progression by integrally regulating vital cellular processes.</p>

For static stimuli or at gross (∼1-s) time scales, artificial neural networks (ANNs) that have been trained on challenging engineering tasks, like image classification and automatic speech recognition, are now the best predictors of neural responses in primate visual and auditory cortex. It is, however, unknown whether this success can be extended to spiking activity at fine time scales, which are particularly relevant to audition. Here we address this question with ANNs trained on speech audio, and acute multi-electrode recordings from the auditory cortex of squirrel monkeys. We show that layers of trained ANNs can predict the spike counts of multi-units responding to speech audio and to monkey vocalizations at bin widths of 50 ms and below. For some multi-units, the ANNs explain close to all of the explainable variance—much more than traditional spectrotemporal receptive fields, and more than untrained networks. Non-primary neurons tend to be more predictable by deeper layers of the ANNs, but there is much variation by neuron, which would be invisible to coarser recording modalities.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, decision-makers had imperfect information and faced resource constraints (i.e., vaccine availability). Public health decisions at the time may not have been optimal for minimizing disease burden. Here, we perform counterfactual evaluations of the impact of various vaccination strategies in Québec (Canada) on the COVID-19 burden from March 2020 to November 2021. In particular, we evaluate the effect of alternative age-specific prioritization sequences of vaccine dose roll-out and assess the impacts of vaccine hesitancy. To achieve this, we develop and calibrate a deterministic, compartmental dynamic transmission model, stratified according to age, susceptibility to infection, viral variant, and issue-specific immunity. The initial conditions and parameters of the model are obtained through a combination of population-based surveillance data and Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) parameter estimation methods. We find that, using our calibrated model, the vaccination prioritization policies implemented at the start of the pandemic, where age groups at highest risk were sequentially prioritized, was only outperformed by prioritizing the vaccination of younger, more socially connected groups together with higher-risk individuals aged 50+ (3% fewer hospitalizations compared to the baseline strategy). These results hold when we account for vaccine hesitancy. Specifically, we generally observe the fewest hospitalizations for the optimal strategies at the highest uptake rates (i.e. with the least vaccine refusal). However, certain sub-optimal strategies show higher hospitalization rates for higher vaccine uptake as a result of reduced vaccine dose redistribution to more interconnected age groups. Overall, our findings illustrate how the impact of vaccination strategies depends on population factors (e.g. contact patterns, vaccine uptake, and degree of immunity), age-specific risk of severe disease and transmission dynamics. Understanding these dependencies are important for guiding future decision-making related to priority vaccine administration in the face of known and emerging pathogens and potential shortage of doses.

                <p>by Ching-San Tseng, Zi-hui Zhuang, Hsiang-Wei Hsing, Chia-Ming Lee, Tsan-Ting Hsu, Yu-Kuan Pan, Yi-Ping Hsueh, Bi-Chang Chen, Shen-Ju Chou</p>

The hippocampus is a key brain region for learning and memory that can be divided into multiple compartments, including the dorsal and ventral hippocampi. Each compartment has unique functions, connectivity, and molecular properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the specification of these subregions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of COUP-TFI, a patterning transcription factor expressed in a high-caudal-to-low-rostral gradient in hippocampal progenitors, in establishing the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus in mice. The highest COUP-TFI expression in the hippocampal progenitors was observed in the caudal medial pallium that gives rise to the ventral hippocampus, and the lowest expression was found in rostral medial pallium that develops into the dorsal hippocampus. We generated mice with different levels of COUP-TFI expression in the cortex and performed a comprehensive analysis of subregion-specific gene expression across the entire hippocampus in these mice. The deletion of COUP-TFI resulted in an expansion of the dorsal hippocampus at the expense of the ventral hippocampus. Conversely, increased COUP-TFI expression led to the generation of ectopic ventral hippocampus in the dorsal compartments. We further demonstrated that COUP-TFI dose-dependently regulates Wnt signaling pathway, a crucial player in regulating hippocampus development. Together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism governing hippocampal development, in which COUP-TFI determines the fate of hippocampal subregions and balances the hippocampus into dorsal and ventral compartments.

                <p>by Siying Xie, Johannes Singer, Bati Yilmaz, Daniel Kaiser, Radoslaw M. Cichy</p>

The human brain orchestrates object vision through an interplay of feedforward processing in concert with recurrent processing. However, where, when, and how recurrent processing contributes to visual processing is incompletely understood due to the difficulties in teasing apart feedforward and recurrent processing. We combined a backward masking paradigm with multivariate analysis on EEG and fMRI data to isolate and characterize the nature of recurrent processing. We find that recurrent processing substantially shapes visual representations across the ventral visual stream, starting early on at around 100 ms in early visual cortex (EVC) and two later phases of around 175 and 300 ms in lateral occipital cortex (LOC), adding persistent rather than transient neural dynamics to visual processing. Using convolutional neural network models for comparison with the brain, we show that recurrence changes the feature format in LOC from predominantly mid-level to more high-level features. Finally, we show that recurrence is mediated by four distinct spectro-temporal neural components, which span the theta to beta frequency range. Together, our results reveal the nature and mechanisms of the effects of recurrent processing on the visual representations in the human brain.

Appendage shape is formed during development – and re-established during regeneration – according to spatial and temporal cues that orchestrate local cell behaviors. The caudal fin is the primary appendage used for propulsion in most fishes, and the organ exhibits a range of distinct morphologies adapted for different swimming strategies. Zebrafish caudal fins develop with a forked shape, with longer supportive bony rays at the periphery and shorter rays at the center of the external organ. Here, we show that inducing a transient pulse of <i>sonic hedgehog a (shha)</i> overexpression during late embryonic development leads to excess growth of the central rays, causing the adult caudal fin to grow into a triangular, truncate shape. Our results identify a period – prior to endogenous <i>shha</i> expression and before differentiation of skeletogenic cells in these tissues – during which the imprinted fin shape can be re-patterned by hyper-physiological Shh stimulation. After this critical developmental period, overexpression of <i>shha</i> does not alter the shape of the adult caudal fin. Both global and local ectopic <i>shha</i> overexpression during the critical window of embryogenesis are sufficient to alter the adult fin shape, and a normal forked shape can be rescued by subsequent treatment with an antagonist of the canonical Shh pathway. The early pulse of <i>shha</i> expands <i>hox13</i> expression domains in the fin primordium, and leads to excessive proliferation in the central regions of the fin. After developing with a truncate shape, the truncate morphology was remembered and rebuilt during regeneration, suggesting that the shape imprinted during embryogenesis informs both development and regenerative morphogenesis. Ray-finned fishes have evolved a wide spectrum of caudal morphologies, and the current work offers insights into the developmental time periods and processes that inform growth and ultimate shape of the fin.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gluten-related autoimmunity can cause neurological disease, although the best way to diagnose and monitor such patients is unclear. Serological testing for antibodies against transglutaminase 6 (TG6) has been proposed; however, this is not widely available in clinical practice. Using longitudinal data from patients attending a specialist neurological center with routine TG6 testing, this observational study explores how antibody history relates to brain atrophy, cognition, and quality of life.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Serological records of patients with gluten-related neurological disease were collected alongside clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were recruited to undertake questionnaires that assessed/included chronic symptom severity, the hospital anxiety and depression scale, the SF-12, and the Biagi scale for gluten-free diet adherence. Volunteers were offered the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome scale for cognitive testing. Primary analyses focused on patients with ≥5 years of serology (n = 462), and related TG6 history to available clinical outcomes (primary analysis range 89–104).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with a previous positive immunoglobulin A (IgA) TG6 result reported greater depression, symptom severity, and poorer physical functioning. IgA TG6 antibody exposure was correlated with regional brain atrophy (age-corrected). Greater self-reported gluten-free diet adherence significantly predicted a recent negative IgA TG6 test. Subgroup analyses replicated multiple findings in patients with and without celiac disease.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>TG6 testing can identify patients at risk of accelerated brain atrophy, poorer physical functioning, and worsened mental health. IgA TG6 should be used as a diagnostic and monitoring test for patients with relevant neurological presentations, while achieving negative serology with a strict gluten-free diet should be the goal.

<p>The ventral tectal longitudinal column (TLCv) is a midbrain nucleus thought to provide multisensory modulation of acoustic processing via descending projections to the superior olivary complex. We discovered additional projections from the TLCv to the cochlear nucleus and to the inferior colliculus.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A ventral tectal longitudinal column (TLCv) has been described in rats and is hypothesized to provide multisensory modulation of acoustic processing in the superior olivary complex. The TLCv is a column of cells in the dorsomedial tectum extending rostro-caudally through the inferior and superior colliculi. It receives ascending auditory input and projects to the superior olivary complex. Further insight into TLCv function has been hampered by limited information on its connections. Here, we provide evidence that a TLCv is recognizable in mice and that it has more extensive connections than previously believed. Deposit of retrograde tracer into the superior olivary complex labels cells bilaterally in the TLCv, comparable to results seen in rats. Viral labeling of neuronal projections demonstrates input to the TLCv from the superior olivary complex and from the inferior colliculus. Thus, the TLCv in mice has inputs and outputs similar to those described in rats. Additional experiments with retrograde tracers revealed more extensive outputs from the TLCv. Neurons in the TLCv are labeled after the deposition of retrograde tracers into the cochlear nucleus or into the inferior colliculus. The projections from the TLCv to these targets, like those to the superior olivary complex, are bilateral. These projections are much broader than those described previously. The results suggest that the TLCv could exert modulation over a wide expanse of the auditory brainstem, from the cochlear nucleus through the inferior colliculus.</p>

     alt="Distribution of Serotonergic Transporter Innervation in the Nucleus Accumbens and Ventral Pallidum Is Highly Conserved Among Primates"/>
<p>We quantified serotonin transporter (SERT) axon length density in the reward pathway of 13 primate species. Serotonergic innervation density within both the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum is highly conserved among species, in contrast to our previous findings of human-specific differences in dopaminergic and neuropeptide Y innervation.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and ventral pallidum (VP) are key nodes in the mesolimbic reward pathway that facilitate stimulus salience, including the regulation of social motivation and attachment. Primate species display variation in social behaviors, including different levels of impulsivity, bonding, and aggression. Previous research has implicated neuromodulation of the reward pathway in the differential expression of various social behaviors, suggesting that differences in neurotransmitter innervation may play a role in species-specific patterns. To explore this, we examined serotonergic innervation in the NAcc and VP among primates. We used stereology to quantify serotonin transporter-immunoreactive (SERT-ir) axon length density in the NAcc and VP of 13 primate species, including humans, great apes, and cercopithecid and platyrrhine monkeys. Our data show that serotonergic innervation density within both the NAcc and VP is highly conserved among species. This finding contrasts with our previous findings of higher levels of SERT-ir axons in the dorsal striatum of humans and great apes relative to monkeys, a human-specific increase in dopaminergic innervation within the NAcc and VP, and a human-specific increase of neuropeptide Y in the NAcc, highlighting the mosaic nature of innervation patterns among species.</p>

     alt="Interrelationship Between Intraepithelial Nerve Endings and Epithelial Cells in the Rat Epiglottis Revealed by Array Tomography With Scanning Electron Microscopy"/>
<p>Two types of intraepithelial nerve endings were observed in the epiglottis, i.e., thin nerve fibers/endings with varicosities and terminal swelling and ramified nerve ending consisted of a branched parent axon and large terminal parts. Both nerve endings were closely attached with epithelial cells.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Nerve endings in the laryngeal mucosa interact with epithelial cells to generate sensory discharges against various external stimuli. In the present study, we performed array tomography with scanning electron microscopy to examine the morphological interrelationship between intraepithelial nerve endings and epithelial cells in the rat epiglottis. In the epiglottic mucosa, thin nerve fibers/endings and ramified nerve endings were observed in the epithelial layer. Thin nerve fibers/endings had varicosities and terminal swellings, and ran in the shallow grooves of epithelial cells. The varicosities and terminal regions of the nerve fibers/endings were partially associated with epithelial cells, without any identifiable cell junctions or synaptic specializations. On the other hand, intraepithelial ramified nerve endings were detected in the stratified cuboidal epithelium at the base of the epiglottis. The ramified nerve ending consisted of a branched parent axon and large terminal parts that were approximately 3–6 µm in major axis length with irregular contours. The terminal parts of the ramified endings containing numerous mitochondria were closely attached to epithelial cells, as observed in the thin nerve fibers/endings. In conclusion, intraepithelial nerve endings in the epiglottis were in close contact with laryngeal epithelial cells and may be excited by mediators released from epithelial cells in response to various stimuli from the laryngeal lumen.</p>

                Feige et al. use single-cell RNA-seq to study host-virus transcriptional interactions of a wild-type and mutant rabies virus across stem cell-derived co-cultured human neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Viral mutations that disinhibit NF-kB and interferon signaling increase viral transcription, effects that are most dramatic in a transcriptionally unique astrocyte subpopulation.

                Szewczyk et al. show that FUS-ALS primarily impacts spinal motor neurons rather than cortical neurons. This is due to a pronounced nuclear loss of FUS associated with impaired DNA damage response and missplicing leading to upregulation of PLK1 as a protective factor against genotoxicity in spinal motor neurons.

">Electrical coupling within thalamocortical networks cumulatively reduces cortical correlation to sensory inputs</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical (TC) cells relay sensory information to the cortex, as well as driving their own feedback inhibition through collateral excitation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The GABAergic cells of the TRN are extensively coupled through electrical synapses. While electrical synapses are most often noted for their roles in synchronizing rhythmic forms of neuronal activity, they are also positioned to modulate responses to transient information flow across and throughout the brain, although this effect is seldom explored. Here we sought to understand how electrical synapses embedded within a network of TRN neurons regulate the processing of ongoing sensory inputs during relay from thalamus to cortex. We used Hodgkin-Huxley point models to construct a network of a 9 TC and 9 TRN cells, with one cortical output neuron summing the TC activity. Each pair of TC and TRN cells was reciprocally coupled by chemical synapses. TRN cells were each electrically coupled to two neighboring cells, forming a ring topology. TC cells received synaptic inputs in sequence, with intervals between inputs varying from 10 to 50 ms across simulations. This architecture and sequence of inputs allowed us to assess the functional radius of an electrical synapse by comparing the cumulative effects of each additional TRN electrical synapse on the responses of the TRN and TC cells and the cortical output. Effects of electrical synapses on TRN cell activity were strongest for smaller intervals between inputs, and cumulative with additional synapses. In contrast, effects in TC neurons were strongest for larger intervals between inputs and also increased with coupling strength. Coupling within TRN modulated cortical integration of TC inputs by unexpectedly increasing response rates, duration and reducing spike correlation to the input sequence that was presented to the TC layer. Thus, embedded TRN electrical synapses exert powerful influence on thalamocortical relay, in a cumulative manner. These results highlight the multi-synaptic influences of electrically coupled cells and reinforce that they should be included in more complex and realistic networks of the brain.

">Circuits activated by psychiatric-associated behavior: from brain-wide labeling to regional assessment using Psych-TRAP.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, affect a substantial portion of the global population, 1 in 8 individuals. Genetic risk factors have been the major contribution to neuropsychiatric disorders; however, there is limited knowledge of how risk factors lead to brain circuit impairment and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Rationale: Understanding how risk factors impact brain circuitry in the whole brain level at cellular resolution and their connection to neuropsychiatric phenotypes should help develop specific drug targets and therapeutics targeting precisely the affected cell types and circuits. Methods: We employ a clinically relevant mouse model of one of the major neuropsychiatric genetic risk factors - microdeletion in the 15q13.3 locus. Using the model, we developed a novel technique, Psych-TRAP, to label psychiatric behavior-associated circuits at whole brain level and at cellular level. We validated the genetic mouse model with clinical phenotypes and labelled transiently active cells, using TRAP2, and quantified cell densities in the whole brain using an automated pipeline, ABBA. This is the first ever approach to validate a triple transgenic mouse line with psychiatric microdeletion and understanding the cellular activation pattern and differential recruitment of cells immediately after a psychiatric-like behavior. Key findings: Further, we validated Psych-TRAP by understanding the activation of cells in already known brain areas and novel brain areas and confirmed no direct involvement of non-neuronal cells right after 3-chmabered social interaction (3-CSI). Lastly, we discovered the involvement of a dominant GABAergic component in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), mainly mediated by reelin positive (REL+) neurons and by somatostatin positive (SST+) neurons in the primary somatosensory area-trunk (SSp-tr), in mice harboring 15q13.3 microdeletion. Future implications: Thus, Psych-TRAP is a robust technique to generate mice line with disrupted copy-number variations, label transiently active cells permanently for future circuit manipulations in an unbiased manner and reveal the underlying molecular markers mediating psychiatric behaviors. This can be extended further to understand the molecular mechanisms of active cells from a particular brain area, identified from Psych-TRAP, using spatial transcriptomics and promises a potential technique for translation research targeting specific manifestations.

">Independence and Coherence in Temporal Sequence Computation across the Fronto-Parietal Network</a></h4>

              
                Time processing requires distributed and coordinated cortical dynamics. Flexible yet robust temporal representations can arise from two distinct computational modes: a coherence mode, where multiple cortical areas hold the same elapsed-time estimate, and an independence mode, where each area maintains its own local estimate. However, how the brain switches between these modes has remained unknown. Using mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging, we simultaneously recorded neuronal populations in the secondary motor cortex (M2) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of mice performing a novel alternating-interval timing task. Both areas encoded elapsed time through similar high-dimensional sequential activity. Decoding analyses revealed that the fronto-parietal network has both independent and coherent temporal codes. Communication-subspace analysis showed that temporal information was distributed across multiple low-variance subspaces, whereas the largest subspace preferentially encoded behaviour. A twin recurrent neural network (RNN) model with sparse inter-RNN connections and shared high-variance noise reproduced these experimental findings. Moreover, perturbations applied along the dominant shared subspace paradoxically enhanced independence between the two networks. Through a mathematical formalization based on the local Lyapunov exponents, we uncovered how perturbations along different subspaces selectively evoke either independent or coherent communication mode. Together, these results reveal a principle by which fronto-parietal circuits achieve robust yet flexible computation through the interplay of sparse coupling and shared global fluctuations.

">Longitudinal Associations Between Screen Time, Brain Development, and Language Outcomes in Early Childhood</a></h4>

              
                Language development during toddlerhood is supported by both neurobiological maturation and environmental experiences. It relies on reciprocal interaction, and excessive screen time exposure may have a negative impact. In the current study, we investigated how screen time at age two relates to language outcomes and brain development at ages two and three. Seventy toddlers underwent MRI scanning and neurodevelopmental testing, and brain volumes in language-related areas were extracted. Structural equation modelling showed that at age two, there was a negative relationship between screen time and pars triangularis volumes. Importantly, smaller volumes at age two predicted greater screen time usage at age three, mediated by poorer language outcomes. These results suggest that over time, children with smaller volumes and weaker language skills at age 2 became more likely to rely on screens at age 3, suggesting that early vulnerabilities amplify later screen use, highlighting the sensitivity of language networks to environmental input and the potential for screen exposure to alter developmental trajectories.

">Thalamo-insular pathway regulates tic generation via motor-limbic crosstalk</a></h4>

              
                Tic disorders accompanied by premonitory urges are the hallmark symptoms of Tourette syndrome (TS), but the neuronal mechanism remains unsolved. Here, we show that striatal disinhibition induces motor tics in mice. This model exhibits c-Fos activation in both motor and limbic structures, such as the insular cortex (IC). Viral tracing demonstrates that aberrant striatal activity is ultimately transmitted to the insular cortex via the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, a potential target of deep brain stimulation in TS patients. We further identify tic-associated activity in the IC as well as the primary motor cortex (M1). Chemogenetic inhibition of the thalamo-insular pathway suppresses M1 synchronization and alleviates tic-like behaviors. These findings reveal motor-limbic circuit dysfunction as a key mechanism underlying tic disorders.

">Pigs' brain responses to stroking after long-term positive human interactions: An fMRI exploratory study</a></h4>

              
                Positive interactions with humans can induce pleasurable experiences in animals, but their underlying neurobiology mechanisms are unknown. We investigated the brain responses (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to stroking by a human in 20 pigs under general anaesthesia. Ten pigs received positive human contacts over 9 weeks post-weaning (POS) and 10 pigs did not (CTL). Images from CTL pigs showed peaks of activation in the primary somatosensory cortex, caudate nucleus, anterior prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during stroking. Greater peaks of activation in the anterior prefrontal, ventral anterior cingulate, primary somatosensory and somatosensory association cortices were observed in POS pigs; whereas greater peaks of activation in the amygdala were observed in CTL pigs. Therefore, stroking is perceived and possibly elicited positive emotions in anesthetised pigs, and it may be perceived as more pleasant by experienced pigs than naive pigs, which may rather perceive it as a novel stimulus.

">Similar destabilization of neural dynamics under different general anesthetics</a></h4>

              
                Different classes of anesthetics can induce unconsciousness despite acting through distinct biological mechanisms. This raises the possibility that they produce a convergent effect on the dynamics or temporal evolution of neural population activity. To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.

">Modeling 3D Mesoscaled Neuronal Complexity through Learning-based Dynamic Morphometric Convolution</a></h4>

              
                Accurate reconstruction of neuronal morphology from three-dimensional (3D) light microscopy is fundamental to neuroscience. Nevertheless, neuronal arbors intrinsically exhibit slender, tortuous geometries with high orientation variability, posing significant challenges for standard 3D convolutions whose static, axis-aligned receptive fields lack adaptability to such complex morphology. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Morph-Aware Convolution (DMAC) framework, which incorporates inherent geometric priors into convolution by jointly adapting both the shape and orientation of the kernel. This enables morphology-aware feature extraction tailored to arborized and variably oriented neuronal trajectories. Specifically, we first apply dynamic tubular convolutions to bridge the structural mismatch between isotropic convolution kernels and the slender morphology of neurons. To sufficiently accommodate the 3D orientation variability of neuronal branches, we further introduce a rotation mechanism that dynamically reorients the tubular kernel via two learnable angles (elevation and azimuth), enabling precise alignment with local neuronal directions. We validate our method through extensive experiments on four mesoscaled neuronal imaging datasets, including two from the BigNeuron project (Drosophila and Mouse) and two additional benchmarks (NeuroFly and CWMBS). Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 5.4% in Entire Structure Average (ESA), 6.9% in Different Structure Average (DSA), and 7.5% in Percentage of Different Structure (PDS). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DMAC in capturing complex morphological variations and enhancing structural fidelity across diverse mesoscaled neuronal morphologies.

">M5 positive allosteric modulation alleviates parkinsonian motor deficits</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder which is characterized by cardinal motor symptoms of tremor at rest, rigidity, bradykineasia, and postural instability. Underlying these cardinal motor symptoms is thought to be death and dysfunction of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, and the gold-standard treatment of Parkinsons disease is dopamine replacement therapy with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA. While efficacious, L-DOPA does not treat all motor symptoms and can have serious treatment-related side effects called L-DOPA induced dyskinesias, indicating an immense need for new targets to modulate dopaminergic function for anti-parkinsonian efficacy. One such potential target is the M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which has a unique expression profile where it is selectively expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their terminals in the striatum, and previous studies have indicated that M5 can modulate dopamine release and patterning of firing of dopamine neurons. Given this unique expression profile and function of M5, this receptor has an untested potential to modulate parkinsonian motor phenotypes. To test the potential for M5 to modulate Parkinsonian-like motor deficits and dyskinesia, we employed the unilateral 6-OHDA lesioned mouse model to create a hemi-parkinsonian state. Using multiple behavioral assays, including the cylinder test, forepaw adjusting steps assay, and in the Erasmus ladder, in conjunction with prototypical M5 pharmacological tool compounds, we investigated the ability of M5 to modulate parkinsonian motor deficits. Additionally, we tested the ability of M5 to modulate established L-DOPA induced dyskinesia or cause dyskinesia on its own. Overall, we found that M5 PAM alleviates forepaw asymmetry, bradykinesia, and spatial aspects of gait in the Erasmus ladder. Excitingly, M5 PAM does not cause robust dyskinesia, does not affect already established L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, and does not affect L-DOPA motor efficacy. Taken together with previous findings, the current study suggests that M5 receptors are an exciting novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating parkinsonian motor deficits even in late-stage models of severe PD without lessening L-DOPAs motor benefit and without affecting existing symptoms of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.

However, whether these sequences simply reflect movement-related variables or afford more cognitive goal-directed planning remains unresolved. Using data from a navigation task on the "Honeycomb" maze that allows dissociation of head-, movement- and goal-direction correlates, we found that hippocampal theta sweeps exhibit robust goal-oriented directional biases, independent of movement- or head-direction. An existing model of theta sweeps, with an additional goal-oriented directional input, reproduces these findings and predicts goal-oriented theta phase precession, which we confirm empirically. Replay events during immobility-related sharp wave/ripples are also goal-directed, and therefore more aligned with theta sweeps than experience. Our findings indicate that hippocampal theta sweeps provide a neural substrate for online goal-directed spatial planning.

">Determining perception thresholds of young adults to small continuous moving platform perturbations</a></h4>

              
                Detecting external disturbances is vital for maintaining balance, as corrective actions are initiated to prevent falls. Quantifying people's ability to perceive such disturbances improves our understanding of how balance is maintained. This study aims to: 1) quantify healthy young adults' ability to perceive external perturbations while balancing on a stabilometer, and 2) understand the relationship between balance performance and perturbation magnitude relative to participants' perception threshold. Participants (n=22; 20-35 years) completed a multiple staircase protocol. While standing on a stabilometer mounted on a moving platform, they attempted to keep it horizontal during 10-second trials with small continuous perturbations. After each trial, participants were asked whether they perceived the platform movement. Perturbation magnitudes were adjusted for the next trial based on their response. This process continued for each staircase until the termination criteria were met, at which point participants' individual perception threshold was determined. Participants then performed ten 40-second trials on the stabilometer, two trials in each condition: without perturbation, perturbation at the 100%, 80%, and 50% of the individual's perception threshold, and the pilot study's minimum threshold. Balance performance was defined as time-in-balance ratio and RMS deviation angle from horizontal. Perception thresholds varied significantly between participants individuals, with an RMS acceleration ranging from 2.67 and 12.80 cm/s^2. The results showed that perturbation magnitude has a significant correlation with variability in deviation angle (R=0.24, p=0.0038). The results suggest that some participants can perceive very small perturbations during a challenging balance task. Subthreshold perturbations, although very small, can influence balance performance.

">A fast and child-friendly localizer for the identification of ITG-math based on its preference for mathematical processing</a></h4>

              
                The visual number form area (here referred to as ITG-math) has gained recent attention as a neural substrate of mathematical cognition. However, research on this region has been hindered by difficulties identifying it and its precise function hence remains debated. THere we aimed to: 1) Provide an efficient and child-friendly localizer for the region and 2) explore the impact of different tasks and stimuli on its responses. In the developed localizer, participants are presented with digits and UFOs, while performing a 1-back task either on stimulus numerosity or on stimulus color. We collected two sessions of the localizer from 17 healthy adults. From the localizer data, we could identify ITG-math based on higher responses in the numerosity than the color task in 92% of the participants, whereas contrasting digits with UFOs lead to selective responses in only 32% of the participants. Accordingly, in independent data, ITG-math showed a task preference, but no stimulus preference. Multivariate analyses further revealed task encoding, and a combination of task and stimulus encoding, in the left and right ITG-math, respectively. Our work facilitates further research on ITG-math and suggests that the role of ITG-math in mathematical cognition goes beyond the visual encoding of digits.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Time-dependent features are present in many sensory stimuli. In the sensory cortices, timing features of stimuli are represented by spatial and temporal code. A potential mechanism by which cortical networks may perform temporal-to-spatial conversion is “reservoir computing.” The state of a recurrently-connected network, or a reservoir, represents current and prior inputs. In this experimental study, we determined whether the state of an isolated cortical network represents temporal information in the inputs. We used patterned optogenetic stimulation of dissociated primary rat cortical cultures. We delivered input sequences of patterns where one of the patterns occurred at different times in each sequence. The state of these experimental networks contained information about input sequences for at least a second, with at least 100-ms precision. Accurate classification required many neurons, suggesting that timing information was encoded via population code. Trajectory of the network state was largely determined by spatial features of the stimulus, with temporal features having a more subtle effect. The duration of spatial information retention was &gt; 2 s, similar to duration of short-term memory in the primary visual cortex. We concluded that local reservoir computation may be a plausible mechanism for temporal-to-spatial code conversion in sensory cortices.</span>

                <p>The interface barrier between the brain surface and the adjacent meninges is important for regulating exchanges of fluid, protein, and immune cells between the CNS and periphery. However, the cell types that form this important interface are not yet fully defined. To address this limitation, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell spatial transcriptomics together with morphological lineage tracing and immunostaining to describe the cell types forming the interface barrier of the adult murine cortex. We show that the cortical interface is composed of three major cell types, leptomeningeal cells, border astrocytes, and tissue-resident macrophages. On the nonparenchymal side, the interface is composed of transcriptionally distinct PDGFR&alpha;-positive leptomeningeal cells that are intermingled with macrophages. This leptomeningeal layer is lined by a population of transcriptionally distinct border astrocytes. The interface neighborhood is rich in growth factor mRNAs, including many leptomeningeal ligands predicted to act on both the border astrocytes and macrophages. On the CNS side of the interface is the relatively cell-sparse cortical layer 1 containing interneurons, microglia, parenchymal astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and oligodendrocytes. Except for the border astrocytes, layer 1 cells are not closely associated with the interface, suggesting that secreted ligands may be the major way the brain interface communicates with the underlying cortical parenchyma. Thus, our data provide a molecular/cellular resource describing the brain interface cell types and their interactions, thereby enabling future studies investigating how this distinct cellular compartment regulates CNS:periphery interactions.</p>

                <p>Autonomic imbalance&mdash;particularly reduced activity from brainstem parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs)&mdash;is a major characteristic of many cardiorespiratory diseases. Therapeutic approaches to selectively enhance CVN activity have been limited by the lack of defined, translationally relevant targets. Previous studies have identified an important excitatory synaptic pathway from oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to brainstem CVNs, suggesting that OXT could provide a key selective excitation of CVNs. In clinical studies, intranasal OXT has been shown to increase parasympathetic cardiac activity, improve autonomic balance, and reduce obstructive event durations and oxygen desaturations in obstructive sleep apnea patients. However, the mechanisms by which activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons, or intranasal OXT, enhance brainstem parasympathetic cardiac activity remain unclear. CVNs are located in two cholinergic brainstem nuclei: nucleus ambiguus (NA) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX). In this study, we characterize the colocalization of OXT receptors (OXTRs) in both CVNs and non-CVN cholinergic neurons in the male and female mouse NA and DMNX nuclei. We found that OXT receptors are highly expressed in CVNs in the DMNX, but not in the NA. OXT increases the firing of DMNX CVN, with no effect on NA CVNs. Selective chemogenetic excitation of OXTR+ CVNs in the DMNX&mdash;achieved by a combination of Cre- and flp-dependent DREADD expression&mdash;evoked a rapid and sustained bradycardia. These findings suggest that activation of DMNX CVNs expressing OXTR with oxytocin may represent a novel translational therapeutic target for restoring autonomic balance in cardiorespiratory disorders.</p>

                <p>by Caterina Azzoni, Rene Jüttner, Anje Sporbert, Michael Gotthardt, H. Llewelyn Roderick, Martin Falcke</p>

Mathematical theory that accounts for the stochastic character of spike sequences of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling calculates the probability distributions of the features of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> time course, their moments and correlations. Including slow feedback from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to components of the pathway poses a challenge to stochastic modelling. Here, we present a stochastic model that takes this feedback into account, allows for a non-linear dependency of the open probability of the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channel (IP<sub>3</sub>R) on the feedback variable and the inclusion of more than one feedback with different relaxation time scales. We use this novel modelling approach to describe the effect of ER depletion by non-linear rate expressions for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) and the measured non-linear IP<sub>3</sub>-dependency of the open probability as part of the dynamic feedback. Our theory can calculate spike amplitude distributions, correlation coefficients (C<sub>c</sub>) of interspike intervals (ISIs) and amplitudes, simulate ISI distributions and calculate their moments. We apply it to experiments with HEK293 cells. We find very good agreement between theoretical ISI distributions and their moments with experimental results. Many measured C<sub>c</sub>s show positive values in accordance with the ideas formulated by our theory. Surprisingly, most ISI-amplitude correlations are weak despite the decay of negative feedback during the ISI, which affects spike probability. We even find negative values of C<sub>c</sub>s, which indicate feedback that decreases the open probability of IP<sub>3</sub>R with increasing ISI. The components of the pathway causing this anticorrelation have not yet been identified. Our data suggest that they involve components that are subject to cell variability.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003333">Attractive serial dependence arises during decision-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiangang Shan, Jasper E. Hajonides, Nicholas E. Myers</p>

Recall of stimuli is biased by stimulus history, variously manifested as an attractive bias toward or repulsive bias from previous stimuli (i.e., serial dependence). It is unclear when attractive versus repulsive biases arise and if they share neural mechanisms. A recent model of attractive serial dependence proposes a two-stage process in which adaptation causes a repulsive bias during encoding that is later counteracted by an attractive bias at the decision-making stage in a Bayesian-inference-like manner. Neural evidence exists for a repulsive bias at encoding, but evidence for the attractive bias during the response period has been more elusive. We recently (Hajonides et al., J Neurosci 43:2730–40, 2023) showed in a working memory task that while different stimuli in trial history exerted different (attractive or repulsive) serial biases on behavioral reports, during encoding the neural representation of the current item was always repulsively biased. Here, we assessed whether this discrepancy between neural and behavioral effects is resolved during subsequent decision-making. Multivariate decoding of human magnetoencephalography data during working memory recall showed a neural distinction between attractive and repulsive biases that is consistent with the two-stage model: an attractive neural bias was found in recall period. And stimuli that created a repulsive bias on behavior led to an early repulsive neural bias that is likely to have already been incorporated during the encoding phase. The neural attractive bias late in the trial was replicated in an independent electroencephalogram experiment. Our results suggest that attractive (but not repulsive) serial dependence arises during decision-making, and that priors that influence post-perceptual decision-making are updated by the previous trial’s target, but not by other stimuli.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors have shown promising results in treatment of plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients, but data in adults are limited. The aim of this phase 2 study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of trametinib in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty patients with a diagnosis of generalized or mosaic neurofibromatosis type 1 and a symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibroma were treated with 2mg trametinib per day. Primary outcome measures were partial response rate on tumor volume at cycle 12 and overall partial response rate. Partial response was defined as ≥20% decrease in tumor volume compared to baseline as measured with 3-dimensional volumetric analysis on magnetic resonance imaging every sixth cycle. Secondary outcome measures were pain, pain interference, quality of life, and toxicity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Partial response rate after cycle 12 was 47% (n = 14/30). Overall partial response rate was 50% (n = 15/30). Median best response was −22% decrease of tumor volume (range: −63 to +7%), and median time until best response was 12 cycles (range: 6–42 cycles). Pain score and pain interference were significantly decreased after 12 cycles of treatment. No change in quality of life was reported. Acneiform rash and fatigue were the most reported adverse events. Overall rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 40%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We observed a positive effect of trametinib on tumor volume and significant pain reduction in adults with plexiform neurofibromas. However, adverse events are common and frequently led to early termination of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Lueg et al. discovered that deregulated MYC increases cancer cell sensitivity to N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors (NMTis). Mitochondrial dysfunction upon NMTi occurs selectively in high-MYC contexts through impaired complex I via effects on the NMT substrate and complex I assembly factor NDUFAF4. An approach for targeting MYC-driven cancers is revealed.

                Lee et al. discuss how extracellular matrix biophysical cues regulate nuclear mechanotransduction, influencing chromatin organization and cell fate in various pathologies. They highlight therapeutic strategies targeting the matrix-nucleus axis by tuning matrix properties, mechano-priming cells, and targeting mechanosensitive molecules, providing a promising paradigm for disease treatment and tissue regeneration.

                Hahn et al. use male rhesus macaques as a model to characterize the immunological consequences of cross-sex estrogen therapy in primates. 17β-estradiol suppresses endogenous testosterone production, induces female physical traits, and following mRNA vaccination, leads to increased T cell activation and modulation of immune gene expression.

Environmental enrichment promotes aging-like changes in young mice, likely related to brain maturation; conversely, it reverts age-related alterations in old mice, suggesting neuronal rejuvenation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00950-7?rss=yes">Lysosomal polyamine storage upon ATP13A2 loss impairs β-glucocerebrosidase via altered lysosomal pH and electrostatic hydrolase-lipid interactions</a></h4>

              
                Ablation of lysosomal polyamine transporter ATP13A2 causes lysosome dysfunction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Samaddar et al. demonstrate that ATP13A2 loss causes lysosomal accumulation of polyamines, which, in turn, disrupts Parkinson’s disease-linked lipid hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase via lysosome deacidification and reduced enzyme-membrane electrostatic interactions in lysosomes.
